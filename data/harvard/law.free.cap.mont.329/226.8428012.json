Heath, </em>2004 MT 58, 320 Mont. 211, 89 P.3d 947 <em>(Heath </em>I). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court violated Heath\u2019s due process rights when it changed his sentence from a Department of Corrections (DOC) commitment to term at the MSP following his successful appeal in <em>Heath I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b63 Following a jury trial, the Eighth Judicial District, the Honorable Judge Thomas M. McKittrick presiding, sentenced Heath to 25 years with 5 years suspended to the DOC for sexual intercourse without consent. The District Court also imposed a consecutive 5-year with 3 years suspended sentence for a related tampering with a witness conviction. Heath appealed the sexual intercourse without consent sentence. We reversed Heath\u2019s sentence because it violated \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(c)-(d), MCA, which requires the district court to suspend \u201call but the first 5 years of the commitment to the department of corrections.\u201d Heath argued then that to remedy the statutory violation we should strike the illegal portion of the sentence, so his DOC commitment would be 25 years, with 20 years suspended. We disagreed, and instead remanded for resentencing. <em>Heath I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b64 At resentencing, Judge McKittrick imposed a 25-year sentence with 15 years suspended to the MSP for the sexual intercourse without consent conviction. The judge left the term of 5 years with 3 years suspended for the tampering with a witness sentence unchanged, but ordered it to run concurrently with the rape conviction. Heath now appeals the District Court\u2019s remanded sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">\u00b65 This Court reviews a criminal sentence for legality only. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. We review whether the District Court violated a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process at sentencing <em>de novo. State v. Redfern, </em>2004 MT 277, \u00b6 8, 323 Mont. 225, \u00b6 8, 99 P.3d 223, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">\u00b66 Heath contends that his present sentence is illegal because this Court should have stricken the illegal portion of his initial sentence in <em>Heath I. </em>He alleges further that the District Court violated his due process rights when it imposed a more severe sentence on remand because it did not comply with the requirements of <em>North Carolina v. Pearce </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 <em>overruled in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>part and on other grounds, Alabama v. Smith </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 794, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 104 L.Ed.2d 865. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b67 Heath first asserts that this Court erred when it failed to strike the illegal portion of his initial sentence, but instead chose to remand for resentencing. In <em>Heath I, </em>this Court had the opportunity to strike the illegal portion of the initial sentence but declined to do so. Relying on our prior decisions, we remanded for resentencing because the challenged sentence \u201caffect[ed] the entire sentence\u201d and we were unable to discern what the District Court would have done if it had properly applied the law. <em>Heath I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 53. Heath now espouses the identical argument and essentially asks us to revisit our decision in <em>Heath I. </em>We were unpersuaded by Heath\u2019s argument then, and res judicata prevents us from considering an issue that we have resolved previously. <em>State v. Black </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 39, 44, 798 P.2d 530, 533.</p>\n<p id=\"A_T\">\u00b68 Heath also claims that the District Court violated his due process rights when it changed his custody placement from the DOC to the MSP, because the new sentence is more severe. He contends a harsher sentence following an appeal mandates the district court comply with the requirements of <em>Pearce, </em>and asserts that the District Court failed to do so in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b69 <em>Pearce </em>requires that the reasons the court imposed \u201ca more severe sentence\u201d upon a defendant after a new trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appear in the record and be based on \u201cobjective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding.\u201d <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081, 23 L.Ed.2d at 670. The threshold question then, is whether the District Court imposed a more severe sentence following remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b610 Heath claims that the District Court\u2019s sentence on remand was more onerous than his initial sentence because the court ordered Heath to serve at the MSP instead of at the DOC as initially sentenced. On remand, Judge McKittrick ordered 25 years with 15 years suspended at the MSP instead of 25 years with 5 years suspended at the DOC. Relying on our recent decision in <em>State v. Tracy, </em>Heath contends a commitment to the MSP is stricter than a DOC commitment. <em>See State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 20, 327 Mont. 220, \u00b6 20, 113 P.3d 297, \u00b6 20 (referring to a sentence to the MSP as \u201cimpos[ing] an additional, more burdensome, condition\u201d than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>sentence for the same term to the DOC). Heath states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\">[b]eyond the obvious difference between a twenty-five year sentence with twenty years suspended and a twenty-five year sentence with fifteen years suspended, the lack of flexibility in the court\u2019s imposition of a prison term is what makes the change from the DOC commitment more punitive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b611  While we agree that a DOC commitment is more flexible than an MSP commitment, Heath\u2019s allegations of punitive sentencing omit the fact that on remand the District Court ordered Heath\u2019s sentence for sexual intercourse without consent to run concurrently with the tampering with a witness charge. In fact, Heath\u2019s entire brief does not mention this significant change to his sentence that resulted in reducing his overall sentence by 12 years. Thus, despite the more flexible nature of a DOC commitment, Heath cannot seriously argue he received a harsher sentence on remand. We conclude that the sentence the District Court imposed on remand is not more severe than Heath\u2019s initial sentence. Consequently, the <em>Pearce </em>requirements do not apply. The sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b251-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> Although the present situation does not involve a new sentence following retrial as in <em>Pearce, </em>this Court recently adopted the same analysis when examining resentencing on remand. <em>See Redfem, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-14.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
