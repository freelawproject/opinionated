Inc. (Stevens) in connection with an allegedly faulty roof it purchased from Stevens. In response to Stevens\u2019s violation of its order that required Stevens to respond to discovery requests, the District Court struck Stevens\u2019s defenses and entered judgment in favor of Roosevelt on the issue of liability. After holding a hearing to determine the amount of damages, the District Court awarded Roosevelt $143,713.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">\u00b62 Stevens now appeals the severity of the sanctions imposed by the District Court as well as its calculation of damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b59-15\">\u00b63 Roosevelt purchased a roofing system from Stevens in 1987. After the roofing system was installed on the Roosevelt County Memorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Hospital in Culbertson, Montana, a Stevens representative inspected it. Stevens then issued a ten-year warranty on the roof. Before the expiration of the warranty period, the roof began to leak, allowing water to enter into and damage the interior of the hospital. After attempts to repair the roof proved unsuccessful, Roosevelt replaced the entire roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b64 In March 1999, Roosevelt filed a complaint against Stevens in the District Court, asserting claims of negligence, product liability, breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Stevens denied having sold the roof to Roosevelt, denied liability on all claims and asserted a variety of affirmative defenses. The case stagnated until August 8,2002, when Roosevelt, having changed counsel, propounded its first discovery requests. At that time, the trial was scheduled to begin on October 8, 2002, and discovery was scheduled to close on August 30, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b65 On January 14, 2003, after twice continuing the trial date, the District Court vacated the trial date and ordered the parties to undergo mediation. The District Court ordered the parties to attend the mediation with \u201cresponsible decision-makers\u201d who were \u201cprepared to fully discuss and explore\u201d settlement. Roosevelt attended the mediation with several representatives who had full authority to settle the case. Stevens attended the mediation with a representative who apparently lacked authority to settle the case. At Roosevelt\u2019s request, the District Court later imposed sanctions on Stevens for violating its order, requiring it to reimburse Roosevelt\u2019s costs incurred in attending the mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b66 Meanwhile, on January 27, 2003, Roosevelt, having received no response to its August discovery requests, moved the District Court to compel responses. On February 3, 2003, Stevens replied to the court that the motion to compel should be denied because it had served responses to Roosevelt that very day. Stevens\u2019s \u201cresponse\u201d consisted of objections to virtually all of the twenty-eight requests for productions and interrogatories issued by Roosevelt. Stevens provided complete responses to only two of Roosevelt\u2019s requests, provided incomplete responses to three other requests, and referred Roosevelt to documents it already possessed in response to two other requests. The remaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>twenty-one requests evoked only a litany of objections.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Stevens never sought a protective order in conjunction with any of its objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\">\u00b67 On March 19, 2003, the District Court ordered Stevens to fully respond to certain of Roosevelt\u2019s discovery requests within thirty days. On May 19, 2003, after receiving no further responses from Stevens, Roosevelt moved the court to strike Stevens\u2019s defenses as a sanction for failing to comply with the court\u2019s order, pursuant to Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P. Stevens responded to this motion on June 10, 2003, indicating that despite its efforts to comply with the order, it was encountering difficulty in identifying and producing the materials Roosevelt had requested. Stevens had not formally requested additional time to respond. Stevens still had not requested a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b68 After holding a hearing on Roosevelt\u2019s motion for sanctions, the District Court issued an order on July 31, 2003, striking Stevens\u2019s defenses and entering judgment for Roosevelt on the issue of liability. The District Court found that despite the passage of nearly a year and in disregard of the court\u2019s order, Roosevelt\u2019s requests remained largely unanswered. Moreover, the court found that Stevens did not provide a \u201creasonable excuse\u201d for its failure to respond to the discovery requests or comply with the court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b69 The District Court held a hearing to determine the amount of damages, at which Stevens presented no evidence and called no witnesses to testify. Pursuant to theories of negligence and breach of contract, the District Court then awarded Roosevelt the full cost it had incurred in replacing the roof, as well as consequential damages to cover the costs of repairs and maintenance performed on the roof prior to its replacement and to compensate Roosevelt for the estimated damage to the interior of the hospital. The court concluded that, due to the extensive irreparable failure within the warranty period, the damages should not be offset by any amount, even though Roosevelt had utilized the roof for nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P., for an abuse of discretion. <em>Maloney v. Home &amp; Investment Center, Inc., </em>2000 MT 34, \u00b6 27, 298 Mont. 213, \u00b6 27, 994 P.2d 1124, \u00b6 27 (citation omitted). We consider whether \u201cthe trial court in the exercise of its discretion act[ed] arbitrarily withput the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded] the bounds of reason, in view of all the circumstances, ignoring recognized principles resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 27, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 27, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 27 (citation omitted). We review a district court\u2019s award of damages to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Kiely Construction, L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 102, 312 Mont. 52, \u00b6 102, 57 P.3d 836, \u00b6 102 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\n<em>Issue 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it struck Stevens\u2019s defenses pursuant to Rule 37(b) and entered judgment in favor of Roosevelt on the issue of liability?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b611 The Rules of Civil Procedure serve the purpose of \u201csecur[ing] the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\u201d Rule 1, M.R.Civ.P. If a party fails to obey an order to permit discovery, the district court may issue an order striking out pleadings or entering default judgment against the disobedient party. Rule 37(b)(2)(C), M.R.Civ.P. Such sanctions exist to deter dilatory parties. <em>Landauer v. Kehrwald </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 322, 324, 723 P.2d 839, 840. We remain cognizant that \u201c[t]he trial judge is in the best position to know which parties callously disregard the rights of their opponents and other litigants seeking their day in court (and) also in the best position to determine which sanction is the most appropriate.\u201d <em>Schuff, </em>\u00b6 69 (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">\u00b612 Stevens argues that the District Court imposed an excessively harsh sanction when it struck Stevens\u2019s defenses and granted judgment in favor of Roosevelt on the question of liability. Stevens contends that striking its pleadings was not well-tailored to the actual extent of its discovery violations or to the prejudice suffered by Roosevelt. Stevens insists that its initial objections to the discovery requests were valid and that its delay subsequent to the District Court\u2019s order was unavoidable. Stevens suggests that Roosevelt suffered no prejudice from its failure to obey the order because Roosevelt previously had dawdled in prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u00b613 Roosevelt contends that the District Court properly exercised its broad discretion to manage discovery when it struck Stevens\u2019s defenses. Roosevelt notes that Stevens was sanctioned only after failing to respond to discovery requests for nearly a year and effectively disregarding the District Court\u2019s order by making no effort to supplement its deficient responses, even after Roosevelt had moved for sanctions. Roosevelt also contends that Stevens\u2019s frivolous appeal further evinces its dilatory tactics. Therefore, Roosevelt asks this Court to award it attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\">\u00b614  In assessing the propriety of discovery sanctions imposed pursuant to Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P., we apply a three-part test. We consider whether the consequence inflicted via the sanction: (1) relates to the extent and nature of the actual discovery abuse; (2) relates to the extent of the prejudice to the opposing party which resulted from the discovery abuse; and (3) is consistent with the consequences expressly warned of by the District Court, if a warning was actually issued. <em>Smith v. Butte-Silver Bow County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 329, 339-40, 916 P.2d 91, 97. In addition to these three factors, we will consider a party\u2019s disregard of the court\u2019s orders and authority. <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 500, 516, 949 P.2d 1168, 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b615 We note that the phrasing of the <em>Smith </em>test in our cases over the past nine years has created the potential for confusion over the correct application of the third prong of the test. We now seek to resolve any such confusion. We previously restated the third prong of the test as \u201cwhether the court expressly warned the abusing party of the consequences.\u201d <em>See Schuff, </em>\u00b6 72; <em>Maloney, </em>\u00b6 35; <em>Xu v. McLaughlin Research Institute for Biomedical Science, Inc., </em>2005 MT 209, \u00b6 26, 328 Mont. 232, \u00b6 26, 119 P.3d 100, \u00b6 26; <em>Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 58, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 58, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 58; <em>Smart v. Molinario, </em>2004 MT 21, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 335, \u00b6 12, 83 P.3d 1284, \u00b6 12; <em>Patterson v. State Dept. of Justice, Motor Vehicle Div., </em>2002 MT 97, \u00b6 19, 309 Mont. 381, \u00b6 19, 46 P.3d 642, \u00b6 19 (utilizing this phrasing of the three-part test first announced in <em>Smith). </em>In none of these cases did we reverse sanctions because a district court failed to expressly warn the abusing party of the sanctions it ultimately imposed. Indeed, we have affirmed sanctions that were imposed without express warning by a district court. <em>See Xu, </em>\u00b6 30 (noting that the <em>defendant </em>had warned the plaintiff that it would <em>seek </em>sanctions if the plaintiff failed to comply with the court\u2019s order to attend a deposition). Therefore, we now clarify that the third prong of the <em>Smith </em>test requires only that the sanctions imposed be consistent with those of which the trial court expressly warns a party. Thus, this factor only applies if the trial court issues an express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b616 We first consider whether striking Stevens\u2019s defenses relates to the extent and nature of Stevens\u2019s discovery abuses. In <em>Smith, </em>the plaintiff had responded to a discovery request regarding its expert witnesses by providing their names and the general subject matter of their anticipated testimony, but not the \u201csubstance of the facts\u201d or bases for their opinions, as required by Rule 26(b)(4)(A)(i), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 334, 916 P.2d at 94. After the trial court ordered the plaintiff to provide additional information about the expert witnesses\u2019 opinions and the bases for them, the plaintiff failed to supplement its responses. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 335, 916 P.2d at 94. We reversed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs case as exceedingly harsh, noting that the plaintiffs failure to comply with the discovery order, although \u201ctotally insupportable[,]\u201d was \u201crelatively limited\u201d and did not amount to total concealment. <em>Smith, </em>276 Mont. at 340, 916 P.2d at 94. In contrast, we have affirmed dismissal of a plaintiffs case where the plaintiff failed to attend a court-ordered deposition and failed completely to supplement his \u201cincomplete, inappropriate, and unacceptable\u201d initial responses to written discovery requests, despite a court order to do so. <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 37; <em>see also McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 515-16, 949 P.2d at 1177-78 (affirming dismissal of plaintiffs case when plaintiff, without explanation, continuously failed to provide complete responses to discovery requests and failed to comply with the trial court\u2019s order to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b617 Like the plaintiff in <em>McKenzie, </em>Stevens has continuously failed to completely respond to Roosevelt\u2019s discovery requests. As in <em>McKenzie, </em>this unresponsiveness prevented Roosevelt from assessing the merits of Stevens\u2019s defenses and effectively challenging them. Moreover, Stevens has inhibited Roosevelt\u2019s ability to build an affirmative case by denying Roosevelt access to necessary information \u2014 information accessible only to Stevens. Unlike <em>Smith, </em>this is not a case of relatively limited obstruction of discovery. Stevens\u2019s responses to discovery requests can only be described as evasive, woefully incomplete and tantamount to complete silence. Over five months elapsed between Roosevelt\u2019s discovery requests and Stevens\u2019s initial response, during which time the scheduled close of discovery had come and gone, as had the thirty-day statutory deadline for responding or objecting to interrogatories, Rule 33(a), M.R.Civ.P., and requests for production, Rule 34(b), M.R.Civ.P. Stevens did not even request, let alone procure, a protective order, as necessary to excuse a failure to respond to discovery requests that one finds objectionable. Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P. Indeed, Stevens responded with objections only after Roosevelt had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>moved for an order to compel responses. Several of these objections Eire best described as frivolous, as a cursory review of the documents requested (and finally produced, in part, severed months after judgment had been entered against Stevens) would have obviated these objections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Stevens provided \u201csubstantive\u201d responses to seven of Roosevelt\u2019s twenty-eight requests, two of which merely referenced documents already in Roosevelt\u2019s possession, three of which were extremely general and incomplete, and two of which were minimally adequate. Stevens did not even respond to the court\u2019s order until over seven weeks after the court\u2019s mandated deadline for Stevens to provide Roosevelt with complete responses. Stevens responded only after Roosevelt had moved for sanctions, at which point it merely professed its inability to meet the already-past deadline,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but included no supplementary responses to Roosevelt\u2019s requests. Moreover, Stevens previously had suffered a less severe sanction for violating the District Court\u2019s order that it bring responsible decision-makers to the mediation. This sanction apparently did not deter Stevens from persisting in its refusal to permit discovery and its general disregard of the court\u2019s authority. Stevens\u2019s ubiquitous violations of the trial court\u2019s orders and the rules governing discovery pertained to all of Roosevelt\u2019s theories of recovery and all of Stevens\u2019s purported defenses. Such flagrant, complete \u00a3md persistent disregard of the District Court\u2019s orders and Montana\u2019s Rules of Civil Procedure warrant the consequence eventually inflicted upon Stevens by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">\u00b618 The striking of Stevens\u2019s defenses likewise relates to the extent of the prejudice suffered by Roosevelt. When a failure to comply with discovery procedures effectively halts the discovery process, it results in impermissible prejudice to the opposing party. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 516, 949 P.2d at 1177. Even though the District Court did not explicitly make a finding of the extent of prejudice to Roosevelt, we may infer from the striking of Stevens\u2019s defenses and entry of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>judgment for Roosevelt that the District Court found prejudice sufficient to warrant such sanctions. <em>See McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 516, 949 P.2d at 1177 (applying identical reasoning to affirm dismissal of plaintiffs case with prejudice). Here, the discovery process was not merely halted; due to Stevens\u2019s recalcitrance, it effectively never began. As noted above, Stevens\u2019s unresponsiveness prevented Roosevelt from assessing the merits of the proffered defenses and building its case-in-chief, forcing Roosevelt to incur mounting litigation costs while proceeding under a \u201ccloud of uncertainty.\u201d <em>See Patterson, </em>\u00b6 21. Roosevelt was forced to attend a mediation conference, prepared to settle, without the benefit of information that might have shed light on the merits of the case. In order to garner any response whatsoever from Stevens, Roosevelt first had to file various motions, increasing its burden with almost no corresponding increase in its access to the pertinent facts. Contrary to Stevens\u2019s argument, any delay that occurred previous to Roosevelt\u2019s propounding its discovery requests, whether attributable to Roosevelt or Stevens, is simply irrelevant to the question of the extent of prejudice which resulted from the discovery abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b619  Stevens further contends that Roosevelt suffered no prejudice because Stevens\u2019s violation of the court\u2019s order was not willful. Stevens argues that Roosevelt points to no evidence of its bad faith in violating the court\u2019s order. The only evidence that Stevens proffered of its good faith efforts to comply with the court\u2019s order was its attorney\u2019s affidavit, which indicated that he had been working with Stevens\u2019s representatives to locate the requested material since the court issued its order, but had encountered difficulties in identifying and producing the material. This affidavit, however, \u201chas to be accepted for what it actually is-a self-serving document drawn by appellants\u2019 attorney. The general rule is that affidavits \u2018are commonly regarded as weak evidence, to be received with caution,\u2019 and that \u2018they are not conclusive of the facts stated therein even though not contradicted by counteraffidavits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Audit Services, Inc. v. Kraus Construction, Inc. </em>(1980), 189 Mont. 94, 103, 615 P.2d 183, 188, <em>overruled on other grounds by Quantum Electric, Inc. v. Schaeffer, </em>2003 MT 29, \u00b6 30, 314 Mont. 193, \u00b6 30, 64 P.3d 1026, \u00b6 30 (citation omitted). Here, we note that the affidavit provided by Stevens came more than seven weeks after the deadline for providing the court-ordered responses and only after Roosevelt had moved for sanctions. Moreover, Stevens is simply incorrect that Roosevelt must demonstrate that it delayed the proceedings willfully by violating the court\u2019s order. \u201c[I]t is the attitude of unresponsiveness to the judicial process, regardless of the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>behind that attitude, which warrants sanctions.\u201d <em>Xu, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 508, 949 P.2d at 1172 (citations omitted)). Stevens manifested a disregard for the rules of discovery and an attitude of unresponsiveness to the court\u2019s orders throughout the discovery process. Stevens stubbornly refused to even acknowledge Roosevelt\u2019s request until Roosevelt forced it to do so by filing a motion to compel. Stevens\u2019s initial response consisted largely of objections; but these objections came several months too late and were not accompanied by a request for a protective order, which might have excused its failure to provide substantive responses. Rule 37(d), M.R.Civ.P. When this Court cannot make a ready, confident and accurate determination of a party\u2019s good faith compliance with the discovery process, we will presume the correctness of a district court\u2019s action in imposing sanctions. <em>McKenzie, </em>285 Mont. at 515, 949 P.2d at 1177 (citations omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the sanctions imposed by the District Court relate sufficiently to the extent of the prejudice suffered by Roosevelt.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\">\u00b620 The third prong of the <em>Smith </em>test-the requirement of consistency between the consequences explicitly warned of by the trial court and the sanctions actually imposed-is not an issue here. The District Court did not issue an explicit warning of the consequences that would follow if Stevens failed to obey its order. Rule 37(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., adequately informed Stevens of the consequences that could follow should it continue to disregard the court\u2019s orders and authority. That Stevens disregarded this provision, along with several other discovery rules, does not therefore burden the trial court with the responsibility to explicitly warn of the obvious. Licensed attorneys who litigate in Montana courts ought to know the rules governing such litigation. Judges ought not be made responsible for constantly rehashing them.</p>\n<p id=\"A54\">\u00b621  In light of Stevens\u2019s unwavering disregard of the court\u2019s orders and authority, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion under Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P., when it struck Stevens\u2019s defenses and granted judgment in favor of Roosevelt.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\n<em>Issue 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court err in calculating damages?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b622 Stevens argues that the District Court erroneously interpreted the law of damages for tort and breach of contract. It contends that the court should not have awarded Roosevelt the full pecuniary value of a replacement roof, but should have deducted an amount that reflects the value actually realized by Roosevelt during the nine years for which it used the roof. Roosevelt responds that this is a question of the application of law to the facts presented at the damages hearing. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>asserts that, having introduced no evidence of the diminution in value of the roof resulting from its defects or the value actually realized through use of the roof, Stevens may not challenge the damages awarded. Roosevelt also notes that Stevens failed to provide a transcript of the damages hearing, which prevents this Court from determining what evidence, if any, Stevens did offer regarding the appropriate deduction in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b623 Stevens argues that the proper damages measure in tort claims involving property damage is either the diminution in market value, or the cost of repair. The District Court concluded, however, that Roosevelt\u2019s nine years of using the roof should not be used as a deduction. Stevens must provide this Court with the record necessary for determining the merits of this appeal. Rules 9(b), 10(a), M.R.App.P.; <em>see Huffine v. Boylan </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 515, 517, 782 P.2d 77, 78 (dismissing an appeal when the appellant failed to provide the transcript that was necessary for resolution of the issue raised on appeal). Stevens did not provide this Court with a transcript of the damages hearing. Without a transcript of the damages hearing, this Court cannot determine whether Stevens presented any evidence of the value that Roosevelt realized by utilizing the roof for nine years. Without such evidence, the District Court lacked a factual basis to determine the proper amount by which to offset the full cost of replacing the roof. The record contains no indication of what evidence was before the District Court at the damages hearing. Such information is essential to the resolution of this issue. Stevens has not supplied us with a record by which to assess the District Court\u2019s conclusion, and we will not speculate as to what the evidentiary bases for its decision may have been. Stevens\u2019s argument with respect to the District Court\u2019s calculation of damages pursuant to contract law fails for the same reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b624 Roosevelt asks this Court to award attorney fees on appeal. Roosevelt asserts that Stevens\u2019s failure to provide a transcript indicates that the sole purpose behind this appeal is further delay; therefore, such a sanction is warranted. We disagree. Although a transcript of the damages hearing is required to determine the validity of the damages award, a transcript is not necessary to determine whether the District Court abused its discretion in imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 37, M.R.Civ.P. For this issue, the record suffices. Moreover, although we affirm the Rule 37 sanction imposed by the District Court, Stevens\u2019s arguments on this issue are not so frivolous as to warrant this Court imposing sanctions pursuant to Rule 32, M.R. App .P. Accordingly, Roosevelt\u2019s request for attorney fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b625  The District Court did not abuse its discretion when it struck Stevens\u2019s defenses pursuant to Rule 37(b), M.R.Civ.P., and entered judgment in favor of Roosevelt. The appellant failed to present any evidence that could establish that the District Court abused its discretion in calculating the damages it awarded to Roosevelt. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b69-3\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES MORRIS, RICE and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\"> For instance, Stevens protested that: \u201croofing system\u201d is overly vague and ambiguous; it was unable to locate sales hterature, service manuals or warranty information about the roof sold to Roosevelt because the sales were made by a distributor (of which Stevens had only one in Montana); it could not identify a single witness, lay or expert; \u201cissues and matters raised in the complaint\u201d was too vague and ambiguous to permit Stevens to identify officers of the company who were authorized to testify to those matters; and it was unaware of the existence of files of studies, tests, or experiments performed with the roofing system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b65-4\"> For instance, Stevens objected to Roosevelt\u2019s reference to tbe \u201croofing system\u201d as overly vague and ambiguous, even though Stevens\u2019s own promotional materials use these words repeatedly, both in text and banner headings, to refer to the very product sold to Roosevelt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-5\"> If Stevens were actually unable to comply with the court-ordered deadline for the discovery responses, it should have informed the court of this inability before the deadline expired, if not at the time when the order was issued. Its self-serving assertion of its inability to respond in the time allotted is suspect, at best, when issued well after the deadline and only in response to a motion seeking sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
