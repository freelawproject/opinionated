We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">\u00b62 Grixti raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the alleged victim\u2019s prior arrest for partner family member assault?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">\u00b64 2. Did the attempted impeachment of the State\u2019s key witness by Grixti\u2019s counsel fall below an objectively reasonable standard that resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">\u00b65 Following a late afternoon of drinking, Grixti and his wife, Christina Jansen (Jansen), returned to their home in Kevin, Montana. An argument ensued. Approximately twenty minutes later, Grixti called Joe Loran (Loran) in Conrad, Montana, and asked him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>retrieve Jansen. Jansen also spoke with Loran. The last thing Loran heard before the phone disconnected was Jansen yell, \u201cno!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b66 Loran\u2019s concern about Jansen\u2019s safety led him to call the Toole County Sheriffs Department. Loran drove to Shelby, Montana, and met Toole County Deputy Michael Lamey (Deputy Lamey). Deputy Lamey followed Loran to Grixti\u2019s and Jansen\u2019s home. Loran waited in the car at Deputy Lamey\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">\u00b67 Deputy Lamey knocked on the door and entered the home. Deputy Lamey believed he observed sufficient physical evidence of harm to Jansen to arrest Grixti for partner family member assault. The officer noted a disheveled house, fresh blood coming from Jansen\u2019s hand, Grixti\u2019s agitated and angry demeanor, and Jansen\u2019s terrified appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b68 Grixti slammed Deputy Lamey into the frame of the front door of the house when Deputy Lamey attempted to arrest him. Grixti then ejected Deputy Lamey from the house by closing the front door on Lamey\u2019s body. Deputy Lamey unsuccessfully attempted to reenter the house by throwing himself against the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\u00b69 Jansen soon emerged and Loran drove her to the sheriffs office. Loran testified that he observed a cut on Jansen\u2019s hand, a bump on her head, and that Jansen had \u201cfear running all through her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b610 The Toole County Sheriffs Department arrested Grixti two hours later. He entered a plea of not guilty to partner family member assault, resisting arrest, and assault on a peace officer. At trial, Grixti admitted to resisting arrest, but denied assaulting Jansen and Deputy Lamey. Grixti claimed that Deputy Lamey\u2019s version of the assault was impossible because a motorcycle stood where Deputy Lamey claimed Grixti had thrown him.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b611 Jansen had been arrested \u201csome months prior\u201d for assaulting Grixti. She and the City of Shelby entered into a deferred prosecution agreement regarding the charge. The District Court heard oral argument before trial regarding the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude evidence of Jansen\u2019s prior arrest for partner family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"AvM\">\u00b612 The State argued that Grixti had provided improper notice that he planned to use character evidence in conjunction with a justifiable use of force defense. Grixti clarified that he did not intend to introduce Jansen\u2019s prior arrest to support an affirmative defense, but instead as proof of her motive to lie under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. Grixti reasoned that because Jansen had been arrested for partner family member assault based on Grixti as the complaining witness, she may now be motivated to have Grixti arrested for the same crime. The District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Court granted the State\u2019s motion. The court determined that Grixti had failed to provide adequate notice that he intended to use character evidence, and reasoned also that the probative value of Jansen\u2019s arrest would not outweigh its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">\u00b613 Grixti now appeals his convictions based on the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and alleged ineffective assistance of his trial counsel in attempting to impeach Deputy Lamey.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 15, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 15, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 15. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>McCaslin, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b615 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 12, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">\u00b616 Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the alleged victim\u2019s prior arrest for partner family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">\u00b617 Grixti argues now thatRules 404(b) and 608(b), M.R.Evid., permit him to introduce evidence of Jansen\u2019s prior arrest for assaulting him. He asserts that he needs to present Jansen\u2019s arrest to the jury to expose her motive to lie and to attack her credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">\u00b618  Evidence of a witness\u2019s prior crimes and wrongs is inadmissible to show action in conformity therewith. Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., lists the purposes for which such evidence is admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhmY\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts ... may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">\u00b619 The Montana Rules of Evidence also disallow extrinsic evidence of a witness\u2019s specific instances of conduct for the purpose of attacking or supporting a witness\u2019s credibility. Rule 608(b), M.R.Evid., provides, however, that specific instances of the conduct of a -witness may be used to attack the witness\u2019s character \u201cif probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">\u00b620 Here, the District Court granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>part because Grixti had failed to notify the court properly that he intended to introduce character evidence during trial. The defendant must provide notice, however, only when he intends to use character evidence in support of a justifiable use of force defense. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 46-13-110(3)\u00a9, (3)(h), MCA; \u00a7 46-13-109, MCA; \u00a7 46-15-323, MCA. Grixti did not intend to raise a justifiable use of force defense, or any affirmative defense and, thus, the notice requirements do not apply. \u00b621 Judge Buyske also disallowed evidence of Jansen\u2019s arrest at trial based on Rule 403, M.R.Evid. Rule 403 allows the district court to exclude evidence offered under Rules 404(b) and 608(b) if the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value. <em>See State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 142, 814 P.2d 52, 56 (including Rule 403 considerations in a list of four elements courts should address when making Rule 404(b) determinations); <em>State v. White </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 491, 495-97, 658 P.2d 1111, 1113-14 (reversing a district court\u2019s decision to admit Rule 608(b) character evidence where Rule 403 should have barred the evidence). Further, Rule 608(b), M.R.Evid., specifically grants the court discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for the impeaching party to inquire about a witness\u2019s prior specific conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b622  We defer to the district court\u2019s broad discretion to make Rule 403 determinations. <em>McCaslin, </em>\u00b6 32. We conclude the District Court did not act arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceed the bounds of reason when it granted the State\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>on the basis that the potential prejudicial effect of Jansen\u2019s prior arrest likely outweighed any potential probative value that it may have provided regarding Jansen\u2019s character for truthfulness or untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u00b623 Whether the attempted impeachment of the State\u2019s key witness by Grixti\u2019s counsel fell below an objectively reasonable standard that resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\u00b624 Grixti also argues that his court-appointed counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to impeach sufficiently the State\u2019s key witness-Deputy Lamey. Grixti offers several methods that counsel should have employed to impeach Deputy Lamey. Instead of using a chalkboard and photographs to demonstrate the respective positions of Grixti, Deputy Lamey, and the motorcycle, Grixti suggests that his counsel should have used more illustrative means such as obtaining an accurate scale diagram and actual measurements of the house and motorcycle. Grixti also claims that his counsel should have called two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>unnamed witnesses-people who came to the house following Grixti\u2019s arrest-to testify to the motorcycle\u2019s placement in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b625  We apply the two-pronged test established in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, to determine whether a defendant\u2019s counsel rendered ineffective assistance. <em>State v. Lucero, </em>2004 MT 248, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 42, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1106, \u00b6 15. The defendant bears the burden to show first that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15. We indulge a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>State v. Turner, </em>2000 MT 270, \u00b6 54, 302 Mont. 69, \u00b6 54, 12 P.3d 934, \u00b6 54. The Court must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight. Rather, we should employ counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of trial to determine whether the conduct was reasonable. <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 64. Counsel\u2019s trial tactics and strategic decisions cannot be the basis upon which to find ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Thee, </em>2001 MT 294, \u00b6 8, 307 Mont. 450, \u00b6 8, 37 P.3d 741, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"AMb\">\u00b626 If the defendant meets the first prong, he must prove next that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15. The defendant must show that a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">\u00b627 This Court does not automatically reach the merits of ineffective assistance of counsel claims. We deem the matter more appropriate for post-conviction relief where the record is insufficient to determine whether counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objectively reasonable standard. <em>See, e.g., State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 34, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 34, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 34; <em>State v. Earl, </em>2003 MT 158, \u00b6 42, 316 Mont. 263, \u00b6 42, 71 P.3d 1201, \u00b6 42. Post-conviction proceedings permit the district court to inquire further to whether the representation was ineffective. <em>State v. Harris, </em>2001 MT 231, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 525, \u00b6 21, 36 P.3d 372, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\u00b628  Here, the record does not reveal why Grixti\u2019s counsel cross-examined Deputy Lamey in the manner he did. Even so, we deem further inquiry unnecessary to determine that Grixti\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s actions did not fall below an objectively reasonable standard. At most, Grixti\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim amounts to an assertion that Grixti\u2019s appellate counsel would have chosen to cross-examine Deputy Lamey differently than Grixti\u2019s trial counsel did. We have said \u201c \u2018the fact that some other lawyer ... would have done differently ... is not ground for branding the appointed attorney with the opprobrium <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>of ineffectiveness \u201d <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 64 (citation omitted). Merely offering alternative impeachment methods in hindsight is insufficient to overcome the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions fell within the wide range of reasonable and professional assistance. <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"ABg\">\u00b629 Grixti\u2019s counsel attempted to show the jury that a motorcycle sat in the doorway where Deputy Lamey alleged Grixti had thrown him. He questioned Deputy Lamey regarding the size of the room, the distance between Deputy Lamey and Grixti, and the position and type of the motorcycle. Grixti\u2019s trial counsel also revisited the matter during his closing argument. The jury considered the testimony and convicted Grixti nonetheless. Atrial counsel\u2019s mere lack of success in attempting to impeach a witness is insufficient to rebut the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions fell within the wide range of reasonable and professional assistance. <em>See Weaver v. State, </em>2005 MT 158, \u00b6 29, 327 Mont. 441, \u00b6 29, 114 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 29 (refusing to hold defense counsel responsible based simply on the jury\u2019s guilty verdict).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b630 Finally, Grixti\u2019s allegations can be characterized fairly as trial counsel\u2019s tactical and strategic decisions. <em>See State v. Hurblert </em>(1988), 232 Mont. 115, 120, 756 P.2d 1110, 1113 (concluding that defense counsel\u2019s decision not to cross-examine certain witnesses extensively was a tactical decision). This Court will not question Grixti\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s strategy to use a chalkboard instead of the more illustrative means Grixti now suggests-with the benefit of hindsight-on appeal. Grixti\u2019s mere conclusory allegation that his trial counsel\u2019s impeachment methods were ineffective is insufficient to overcome the strong presumption that his counsel acted within the wide range of reasonable and professional assistance. <em>Thee, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Ford v. State, </em>2005 MT 151, \u00b6 7, 327 Mont. 378, \u00b6 7, 114 P.3d 244, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b631  Grixti\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails to meet the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>standard in that he has failed to establish that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objectively reasonable standard. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693; <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15. Therefore, we reject it on the record established at trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
