We affirm. The issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in rendering the sentencing decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">\u00b62 On February 26, 2001, the State filed an Information charging Burke with the offenses of robbery and theft. The State alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Burke used a weapon in the process of taking money from an adult book store in Great Falls, putting the store clerk in fear of immediate bodily injury. Burke initially entered a plea of not guilty. Subsequently, however, Burke entered into a plea agreement with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>State, whereby he agreed to plead guilty to the charge of robbery. In exchange, the State agreed to dismiss the theft charge and recommend a sentence of seven years to the Department of Corrections, with four years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">\u00b63 The District Court accepted Burke\u2019s guilty plea and the plea agreement. The District Court then sentenced Burke to the Department of Corrections for seven years, with four years suspended, noting that he had \u201crobbed a business using a handgun\u201d and \u201cthreatened to shoot the clerk.\u201d Finally, the District Court specified various conditions applicable to the suspended portion of Burke\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">\u00b64 After serving his time in the Montana State Prison, Burke was discharged on February 14,2004. On May 18,2004, Burke\u2019s probation officer, Scott Brotnov (Brotnov), filed a Report of Violation alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that Burke had violated eight conditions of his probation by: (1) changing his place of residence without permission; (2) faffing to give notice of his address change for purposes of violent offender registration; (3) failing to personally report to Brotnov and submit monthly written reports; (4) failing to report that he was arrested for vagrancy; (5) using marijuana; (6) consuming alcohol; (7) failing to attend appointments necessary to complete a mental health assessment; and (8) faffing to report regarding his employment status and enrollment in GED classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">\u00b65 The State then filed its Petition for Revocation of Suspended Sentence, requesting that \u201cthe suspension be revoked and sentence be executed.\u201d The District Court issued a warrant for Burke\u2019s arrest. On June 10, 2004, Burke appeared before the District Court, in custody, with court appointed counsel, denying each of the alleged probation violations. Thereafter, Burke filed a motion requesting a confidential mental health evaluation, which the District Court granted. Consequently, Dr. Michael Scolatti (Scolatti), a licensed clinical psychologist, performed a psychological evaluation of Burke and produced a report outlining his findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">\u00b66 As this report discloses, Scolatti diagnosed Burke with, <em>inter alia, </em>Antisocial Personality Disorder, Borderline Intellectual Functioning, Bipolar Disorder with Psychotic Features, and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Scolatti reported that Burke\u2019s Bipolar Disorder and ADHD would significantly compromise his ability to conform to the law. Further, Scolatti identified these two conditions as \u201crelatively severe disorders that require medication,\u201d and recommended that Burke be placed at the State Hospital. As for the positive results of the evaluation, Scolatti reported that Burke gave \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>indication of organic impairment, mental retardation, or psychoses.\u201d Scolatti also reported that Burke understood his legal situation, and that he had the ability to maintain a collaborative relationship with his attorney and help plan a legal strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">\u00b67 Scolatti\u2019s report was provided to the District Court and to the State. On September 7, 2004, the District Court held an evidentiary and dispositional hearing pursuant to the State\u2019s petition. Upon direct questioning by the District Court, Burke admitted violating five conditions of his probation as specified in the first five allegations noted above. He denied violating two probation conditions as specified in the final two allegations listed above. The District Court did not question Burke regarding the remaining allegation that he had consumed alcohol while on probation. After Burke had answered to the allegations, his counsel stated that although Burke was admitting a failure to report to Brotnov, he was not admitting to every alleged failure to report. Burke\u2019s counsel also asserted that Burke believed he had in fact reported to Brotnov regarding his arrest for vagrancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">\u00b68 Thereafter, Scolatti testified regarding his psychological evaluation of Burke. In doing so, he indicated uncertainty as to Burke\u2019s ADHD diagnosis, stating \u201cI am more certain that he suffers from bipolar disorder than the attention deficit disorder.\u201d Scolatti also testified regarding the impact that Burke\u2019s mental illnesses would have on his ability to conform to the requirements of his probation. Further, Scolatti opined that the State Hospital would provide the best setting for treatment of Burke\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00b69 Brotnov testified as to his observations regarding Burke\u2019s mental condition. He stated that he became concerned, during their first meeting, that Burke might have fetal alcohol syndrome. As a result, Brotnov testified, he referred Burke for a mental health assessment. At the conclusion of this testimony, the State argued that the District Court should revoke the suspended portion of Burke\u2019s sentence and order that he serve the remaining time in prison. Burke\u2019s counsel conceded that the suspended sentence should be revoked, but argued that the District Court should commit Burke to the Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS) for treatment of his mental illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">\u00b610 The District Court revoked the suspended portion of Burke\u2019s sentence. In rendering its sentence, the District Court acknowledged Burke\u2019s mental health issues, but found that his mental condition did not render him unable to appreciate the criminality of his behavior or conform his behavior to the requirements of the law. Thus, the District Court committed Burke to the Department of Corrections for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>remaining four years of his sentence. Burke appeals, arguing that the District Court should have sentenced him to the DPHHS.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b611  When a probation violation has occurred, a district court must exercise its discretion in determining an appropriate action in response to the violation. <em>State v. Pedersen, </em>2003 MT 315, \u00b6 17, 318 Mont. 262, \u00b6 17, 80 P.3d 79, \u00b6 17. Barring an abuse of that discretion, this Court will not intervene. <em>Pedersen, </em>\u00b6 17. We also review a district court\u2019s determination of the existence of mental disease or defect under \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, to determine whether the court has abused its discretion. <em>State v. Collier </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 46, 60, 919 P.2d 376, 385. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 72, 315 Mont. 452, \u00b6 72, 69 P.3d 1162, \u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u00b612 After Burke admitted to violating five conditions of his probation, the District Court had several options in considering an appropriate disposition. Section 46-18-203(7)(a), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-8\">(7) (a) If the judge finds that the offender has violated the terms and conditions of the suspended or deferred sentence, the judge may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-9\">(i) continue the suspended or deferred sentence without a change in conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-10\">(ii) continue the suspended sentence with modified or additional terms and conditions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-11\">(iii) revoke the suspension of sentence and require the offender to serve either the sentence imposed or any sentence that could have been imposed that does not include a longer imprisonment or commitment term than the original sentence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-12\">(iv) if the sentence was deferred, impose any sentence that might, have been originally imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b25-13\">\u00b613 After revoking the suspended portion of Burke\u2019s sentence, the District Court proceeded to consider sentencing alternatives pursuant to the broad discretion granted by \u00a746-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA. In doing so, the District Court considered Burke\u2019s mental condition pursuant to \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b25-14\">Whenever a defendant is convicted on a verdict of guilty or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere and claims that at the time of the commission of the offense of which convicted the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>suffering from a mental disease or defect or developmental disability that rendered the defendant unable to appreciate the criminality of the defendant\u2019s behavior or to conform the defendant\u2019s behavior to the requirements of law, the sentencing court shall consider any relevant evidence presented at the trial and shall require additional evidence that it considers necessary for the determination of the issue, including examination of the defendant and a report of the examination as provided in 46-14-202 and 46-14-206.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">\u00b614 Section 46-14-312, MCA, specifies the proper course of action subsequent to a sentencing court\u2019s application of \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-5\">(1) If the court finds that the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense of which the defendant was convicted did not suffer from a mental disease or defect as described in 46-14-311, the court shall sentence the defendant as provided in Title 46, chapter 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">(2) If the court finds that the defendant at the time of the commission of the offense suffered from a mental disease or defect or developmental disability as described in 46-14-311, any mandatory minimum sentence prescribed by law for the offense need not apply. The court shall sentence the defendant to be committed to the custody of the director of the department of public health and human services to be placed, after consideration of the recommendations of the professionals providing treatment to the defendant and recommendations of the professionals who have evaluated the defendant, in an appropriate correctional facility, mental health facility, as defined in 53-21-102, residential facility, as defined in 53-20-102, or developmental disabilities facility, as defined in 53-20-202, for custody, care, and treatment for a definite period of time not to exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that could be imposed under subsection (1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">\u00b615 Undertaking the inquiry of \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, the District Court found that Burke\u2019s mental condition did not render him unable to appreciate the criminality of his behavior or conform his behavior to the requirements of law, stating \u201cthe evidence today does not meet the standard of 46-14-311 ....\u201d Consequently, the District Court did not sentence Burke to the DPHHS pursuant to the mandate of \u00a7 46-14-312, MCA, but rather, sentenced Burke to the Department of Corrections for four years, as is authorized by \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">\u00b616 On appeal, Burke argues that the District Court should have committed him to DPHHS for placement in a facility appropriate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the treatment of his mental illness. Challenging one finding of fact under \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, Burke argues that \u201c[t]he District Court erred by not finding the Appellant was unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of law ....\u201d In support of this argument, Burke points to Scolatti\u2019s testimony which indicated that Burke\u2019s mental illnesses would contribute to his failure to comply with probation conditions such as consistently reporting to his probation officer and completing alcohol counseling. Burke asserts \u201cScolatti made it very clear that Mr. Burke\u2019s mental illnesses made him unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of law when he testified that Mr. Burke\u2019s volitional control was greatly impaired by the illnesses.\u201d Burke also points to Scolatti\u2019s opinion that the most appropriate place for treatment of Burke\u2019s mental illnesses would be the State Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b617  We do not find these arguments persuasive. As the State notes, Scolatti testified that despite Burke\u2019s mental illnesses, \u201che still has some volitional choice of whether or not to commit a crime.\u201d Scolatti also indicated that he could not say, to a medical certainty, that Burke\u2019s mental illnesses caused him to violate the conditions of his probation. Similarly, Scolatti conceded that he could not specify what role Burke\u2019s mental illnesses had played in his probation violations. Given this testimony, we can not say that the District Court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. We recognize that the evidence indicates Burke suffers from mental illnesses that may improve with treatment. However, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Burke\u2019s mental condition did not render him unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b618 We note that the State argues \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-311 and 46-14-312, MCA, are not applicable to probation revocation proceedings. However, we decline to address this argument. As we have held, this Court generally does not address arguments raised for the first time on appeal, preferring not to hold a district court in error for rulings or procedures in which a party has acquiesced or participated. <em>State v. Clay, </em>1998 MT 244, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 147, \u00b6 24, 967 P.2d 370, \u00b6 24. Here, the State expressly agreed, upon direct questioning by the District Court, that the inquiry of \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, was appropriate in determining Burke\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b619  More importantly, however, resolution of this appeal does not require that we determine whether \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-311 and 46-14-312, MCA, apply to revocation proceedings. On its face, \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a), MCA, gives district courts the authority to revoke an offender\u2019s probation and sentence him or her without engaging in the inquiry of \u00a7 46-14-311, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>MCA. Nonetheless, the District Court interposed that inquiry as an additional, and arguably unnecessary, layer of analysis in the dispositional proceeding. In doing so, however, the District Court found no facts that triggered the sentencing requirement of \u00a7 46-14-312, MCA. Thus, we conclude that the inquiry under \u00a7 46-14-311, MCA, did not affect the proceeding in a way that requires this Court to determine whether \u00a7\u00a7 46-14-311 and 46-14-312, MCA, apply to revocation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b620 The District Court had wide latitude in sentencing Burke under \u00a7 46-18-203(7)(a)(iii), MCA. The record indicates that the sentencing decision was rendered pursuant to adequate consideration of the various relevant factors. For example, the District Court acknowledged Scolatti\u2019s testimony regarding Burke\u2019s mental illnesses, noted Burke\u2019s need for mental health care, and observed that the Montana State Prison has a mental health treatment program. The District Court also acknowledged various sentencing options other than prison. Finally, the District Court noted that successful treatment of Burke\u2019s mental illnesses is \u201cuncertain,\u201d and stated that Burke \u201cis a risk to reoffend violently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b621  We conclude Burke has not demonstrated that the District Court acted arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. Thus, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Burke to the Department of Corrections for four years.</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">\u00b622 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b28-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
