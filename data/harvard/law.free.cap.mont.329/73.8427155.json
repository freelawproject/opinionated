We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b62 The following issue is dispositive on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Farmers on the ground that the underinsured motorist coverage policy did not apply?</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">\u00b64 On December 4, 1999, a vehicle occupied by the Appellants was struck by a U-Haul truck driven by Karl Hase, who was extremely intoxicated at the time. Both Appellants were injured. Hase was indigent and had no assets, but was covered by an insurance policy in the amount of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After obtaining a default judgment in the amount of $671,150.00 for Mecca and $ 161,566.56 for Bailey, pursuant to a negligence suit against Hase, the Appellants settled with Hase and his insurance company. Under the terms of the settlement, Mecca and Bailey each received $25,000 from the insurance company, and they released Hase from further liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">\u00b65 The Appellants also brought suit against U-Haul alleging negligent entrustment, eventually settling their claims for a total of $125,000 and releasing U-Haul from any further liability. The Appellants did not inform Farmers of their settlement with U-Haul.</p>\n<p id=\"AJqV\">\u00b66 At the time of the accident, Mecca had an underinsured motorist policy with Farmers in the amount of $30,000 per person and $60,000 for each occurrence, and U-Haul had applicable bodily injury liability insurance valued at approximately $7 million. Mecca\u2019s underinsured motorist policy stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-13\">We will pay all sums which an insured person is legally entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an UNDERinsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-4\">Limits of Liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">a. Our liability under the UNDERinsured Motorist Coverage cannot exceed the limits of the UNDERinsured Motorist Coverage stated in this policy, and our maximum liability under the UNDERinsured Motorist Coverage is the lesser of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">1. The difference between the amount paid in damages to the insured person by and for any person or organization who may be legally liable for the bodily injury, and the limit of UNDERinsured Motorist Coverage; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">2. The amount of damages established but not recovered by any agreement, settlement, or judgment with or for the person or organization legally liable for the bodily injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The policy defined an underinsured motor vehicle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">c. Underinsured Motor Vehicle - means a land motor vehicle when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">1. the ownership, maintenance or use is insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">2. its limit for bodily injury liability is less than the amount of the insured person\u2019s damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">In addition, the policy included the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">Other Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-14\">1. We will pay under this coverage only after the limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">2. The amount of UNDERinsured Motorist Coverage we will pay shall be reduced by the amount of any other bodily injury coverage available to any party held to be hable for the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">\u00b67 The Appellants brought suit against Farmers seeking payment under the terms of the underinsured motorist policy. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the District Court granted the motion submitted by Farmers and denied the Appellants\u2019 motion. Mecca and Bailey appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b95-18\">\u00b68 We apply <em>de novo </em>review to a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Edie v. Gray, </em>2005 MT 224, \u00b6 11, 328 Mont. 354, \u00b6 11, 121 P.3d 516, \u00b6 11. We apply the criteria contained in Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., which provides that \u201cthe moving party must establish both the absence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>of a genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Edie, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b69 In <em>Travelers Cas. and Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 174, \u00b6 17, 108 P.3d 469, \u00b6 17 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted), we articulated our approach to the interpretation of insurance contracts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">General rules of contract law apply to insurance policies and we construe them strictly against the insurer and in favor of the insured. Courts give the terms and words used in an insurance contract their usual meaning and construe them using common sense. Any ambiguity in an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured and in favor of extending coverage. An ambiguity exists where the contract, when taken as a whole, reasonably is subject to two different interpretations. Courts should not, however, seize upon certain and definite covenants expressed in plain English with violent hands, and distort them so as to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b610 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Farmers on the ground that the underinsured motorist coverage policy did not apply?</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b611 The parties agree that U-Haul\u2019s bodily injury insurance covered U-Haul\u2019s liabilities to the Appellants in their claim against U-Haul. However, the Appellants contend that U-Haul\u2019s insurance policy has no bearing on Mecca\u2019s underinsured motorist policy with Farmers and that Mecca\u2019s policy should pay toward the damages caused by Hase\u2019s negligence that were not covered in the settlement with Hase\u2019s insurance company. Farmers responds that, by the terms of Mecca\u2019s policy, the underinsured motorist coverage in that policy does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\u00b612 The District Court determined that Farmers\u2019 subrogation rights were prejudiced by the Appellants\u2019 failure to inform the insurer of the settlement with U-Haul, distinguishing this case from our holding in <em>Sorensen v. Farmers Ins. Exch. </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 291, 927 P.2d 1002. The District Court further held that the \u201ccrucial element\u201d of Mecca\u2019s policy was \u201cthat it attaches underinsured coverage to an underinsured motor vehicle.\u201d adding, \u201c[t]he policy does not address the situation where the driver of the vehicle is underinsured.\u201d Finally, the District Court reasoned that, even if the policy did attach to the operator, the truck Hase was driving was not underinsured because it was covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>by a $7 million insurance policy, the limits of which had not been reached, concluding, \u201ceven if the Farmers\u2019 underinsured motorist policy did apply, Farmers would be entitled to a credit for the full amount of U-Haul\u2019s policy limits of $7 million, thereby barring any recovery from Farmers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b613 The Appellants argue that the District Court erred by concluding that the Farmers policy attaches to a vehicle and not the owner or operator thereof. They contend that it is incoherent that \u201cunderinsured motorist\u201d insurance would attach to a vehicle and not a \u201cmotorist.\u201d Therefore, according to the Appellants, the Farmers policy attached to Hase-the \u201cmotorist\u201d and \u201coperator\u201d-who was underinsured relative to the judgment entered against him. In support of their argument, the Appellants rely on <em>Farmers Alliance Mut. Ins. Co. v. Holeman, </em>1998 MT 155, 289 Mont. 312, 961 P.2d 114, contending that, in accordance with Holeman\u2019s admonition that an insurance policy should be read as a whole, one cannot read a \u201cmotorist\u2019s\u201d policy such that it attaches to a vehicle and not an operator of that vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b614 We find the Appellants\u2019 argument unpersuasive and agree with the District Court\u2019s reading of the policy. Essential to our holding in <em>Holeman </em>was the principle that \u201can insurer\u2019s liability for underinsured motorist benefits in any given case arises from the terms of the insurance contract ....\u201d <em>Holeman, </em>\u00b6 21. Here, the plain terms of the policy state that Farmers will pay sums that Mecca is \u201clegally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an UNDERinsured motor vehicle ....\u201d As used in the policy, the term \u201cUNDERinsured\u201d modifies \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d not \u201cowner\u201d or \u201coperator.\u201d The policy\u2019s definition of the term \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d includes those vehicles insured for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident, when that insurance is less than the amount of the insured person\u2019s damages. Moreover, nothing in the policy diminishes the requirement that the operator must operate an underinsured motor vehicle. Unlike <em>Holeman, </em>the vehicle here was not underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b615  Therefore, application of underinsured coverage, by the policy\u2019s terms, was dependent upon the available coverage on the vehicle at issue, which was the U-Haul truck and the $7 million bodily injury coverage thereon. Because that amount exceeds the Appellants\u2019 damages and Mecca\u2019s policy pays claims \u201conly after the limits of liability under any applicable bodily injury liability bonds or policies have been exhausted,\u201d the U-Haul truck was not underinsured, and the underinsured policy was not applicable. Thus, the Appellants are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>not entitled to any remuneration from Farmers thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b616 Given our determination herein, we need not address the other arguments made by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-14\"> This policy was purchased through U-Haul from Republic Western Insurance Company. It covered Hase as a renter of the vehicle, but it was separate from the bodily injury policy that covered U-Haul\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
