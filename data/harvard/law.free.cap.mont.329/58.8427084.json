(Father), the biological father of T.L. and K.L., appeals from the Order entered by the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Ravalli County, terminating his parental rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b63 The biological mother of T.L. and K.L. died in 2001, Father married D.L. in 2002, and D.L. adopted both children a few months after the marriage. In July of 2003, when the girls were nine and thirteen years old, respectively, the Montana Department of Health and Human Services (Department) petitioned the District Court for emergency protective services, adjudication of T.L. and K.L. as youths in need of care, and temporary legal custody (TLC) or, alternatively, temporary investigative authority. The District Court entered an order authorizing the Department to investigate and provide emergency protective services.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\u00b64 After a hearing, the District Court entered an order adjudicating T.L. and K.L. as youths in need of care and granting the Department TLC. In that order, the court made findings relevant to D.L. and found Father had taken nude photos of T.L. while she showered, showed or offered to show the photos to a neighbor who subsequently sexually fondled both children, provided the children with pornographic or other inappropriate materials, engaged in sexual relations in the children\u2019s presence, and supplied T.L. with excessive amounts of beer and other alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\u00b65 After a dispositional hearing, the District Court entered an order approving treatment plans for Father and D.L. The court later extended the TLC to give Father and D.L. more time to successfully complete their treatment plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\u00b66 The Department subsequently petitioned for termination of Father and D.L.\u2019s parental rights. Before the hearing on the termination petition, D.L. filed an affidavit relinquishing her parental rights and consenting to the Department\u2019s custody of the children, and the Department filed an agreement to accept temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">\u00b67 At the hearing on the termination petition, five witnesses testified in favor of the petition, five witnesses testified in opposition, and the District Court and counsel questioned T.L. and K.L. in chambers. The court ultimately terminated D.L.\u2019s parental rights based on her relinquishment and Father\u2019s parental rights based on findings that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>children were adjudicated youths in need of care, Father had not successfully completed his treatment plan and the conduct or condition rendering him unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Father appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b68 In reviewing a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights, we determine whether the statutorily required findings of fact are clearly erroneous, whether the conclusions of law are correct and whether the court abused its discretion in ordering termination. <em>In re </em>J.B.K., 2004 MT 202, \u00b6 13, 322 Mont. 286, \u00b6 13, 95 P.3d 699, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">\u00b610 Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (2003), authorizes a district court to terminate a parent-child legal relationship upon finding the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care, an appropriate court-approved treatment plan has not been complied with by the parent or has not been successful, and the parent\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him or her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Here, it is undisputed that the District Court correctly found the children were properly adjudicated as youths in need of care. Father\u2019s arguments center on the \u201csuccessful treatment plan completion\u201d and \u201cunlikely to change\u201d statutory elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b611 Father\u2019s treatment plan required him to obtain a psychological/sexual evaluation and, \u201c[i]f recommended by the evaluation, [Father] will participate in a [Department] approved sex offender program[.]\u201d In addition, the treatment plan required Father to engage in individual therapy to address decision-making and parenting issues and comply with all recommendations of his therapist; obtain a chemical dependency evaluation and comply with all of the evaluator\u2019s recommendations; and \u201cfollow all recommendations given by his daughters\u2019 counselors and the Department regarding [T.L.] and [K.L.]\u2019s treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\u00b612 In its order terminating Father\u2019s parental rights, the District Court found Father \u201cdid not fully cooperate\u201d with the psychological/sexual evaluation procedure because he marked \u201cfalse\u201d to all items on one portion of the test and re-test. It also found Father refused to comply with the chemical dependency evaluator\u2019s recommendation to abstain from alcohol and repeatedly \u201cfired\u201d his therapist when the therapist made recommendations with which he did not agree. Further, the court found social workers had testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>that Father refused to accept or follow recommendations made by the social workers and the children\u2019s therapists, as evidenced by inappropriate letters he had written to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b613 On appeal, Father asserts the District Court improperly relied on the finding that he did not cooperate with the psychological/sexual evaluation component of his treatment plan because he honestly answered \u201cfalse\u201d to the test questions and, consequently, could not obtain a recommendation for sex offender treatment. Father contends that by determining he did not cooperate with the psychological/sexual evaluation, the District Court violated the policy articulated in \u00a7 41-3-101(b), MCA (2003), to \u201cpreserve the unity and welfare of the family whenever possible,\u201d as well as his right to fundamentally fair procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b614  Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (2003), requires complete compliance with a treatment plan, as opposed to partial or even substantial compliance. <em>In re A.A., </em>2005 MT 119, \u00b6 31, 327 Mont. 127, \u00b6 31, 112 P.3d 993, \u00b6 31 (citation omitted). Father does not contest the findings that he failed to comply with the treatment plan\u2019s requirements that he follow the recommendations of the therapist, chemical dependency evaluator, and social workers. These uncontested failures to comply establish Father did not satisfy the requirement for complete compliance under \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (2003). <em>See A.A., </em>\u00b6 31. Therefore, we need not address Father\u2019s argument regarding his allegedly honest answers during the psychological/sexual evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"AhP\">\u00b615 Father also challenges two of the District Court\u2019s findings related to the \u201cunlikely to change\u201d portion of \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA (2003). First, he contends the District Court improperly found the psychological/sexual evaluator and reviewing psychologist had testified that Father was \u201cnot amenable to sex offender treatment as he refused to accept responsibility for his actions.\u201d Second, Father challenges the following language from a different finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">[Father\u2019s] compliance with his plan can be described as superficial at best and is confirmed by his testimony at the hearing where he made clear that he did not agree with the Court\u2019s previous findings that he abused or neglected his children such that he felt no need to change his behaviors or comply with the treatment plan. The Court finds that [Father\u2019s] failure to comply with his treatment plan was willful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b616 Father asserts that, in making and relying on these findings, the court ignored his admissions that he provided his children with alcohol, photographed T.L. in the shower, allowed the children access to pornography and drank alcohol \u201cthroughout the course of the custody process.\u201d He also points to his testimony that he cooperated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>with the criminal investigation into sexual abuse allegations, that photographing T.L. in the shower was poor judgment and wrong and that, if reunited with the children, he would no longer provide them with alcohol. He contends his testimony indicates he took responsibility and, therefore, the District Court erred in finding his conduct or condition rendering him unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b617 In addition to the above-referenced findings, the District Court made other relevant findings based on witness testimony. The court found the chemical dependency evaluator testified Father was \u201cnot a suitable candidate for further chemical dependency treatment because he has no interest in addressing his alcohol abuse problem and has expressed his commitment to continue to consume alcohol.\u201d The court further found that Father told social workers he had no need for therapy and refused to take responsibility for his behaviors and actions, and that social workers testified Father continued to write inappropriate letters, \u201cblaming others for his situation and denying responsibility for his conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b618  A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>A.A., </em>\u00b6 16 (citation omitted). In reviewing findings, the Court does not consider whether the evidence could support a different finding, nor do we substitute our judgment for the finder of fact regarding the weight of the evidence or witness credibility. <em>In re V.F.A., </em>2005 MT 76, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 383, \u00b6 7, 109 P.3d 749, \u00b6 7 (citations omitted). The above-cited testimony regarding Father\u2019s failure to take responsibility constitutes substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s finding that Father\u2019s conduct or condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and we discern no misapprehension or mistake in that determination. To the extent the testimony advanced by Father on appeal contradicts the testimony referenced in the court\u2019s other findings, the District Court was in the best position to resolve the contradiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b619  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b82-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
