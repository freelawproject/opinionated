We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b62 We re-state and address the following issue on appeal: Must Roubideaux\u2019s conviction be overturned because during closing argument the prosecutor improperly told the jury that the State did not have to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u00b63 Roubideaux was charged with partner assault for hitting Vivian Mondragon (Mondragon) in the face. Roubideaux and Mondragon had been in a relationship for about a year and a half at the time of the incident and had also shared an apartment in Great Falls. This arrangement ended when Mondragon accused Roubideaux of cheating on her and told Roubideaux not to return to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u00b64 On the afternoon of the assault, Mondragon saw Roubideaux walking with another woman. Mondragon then told Roubideaux that she had a new boyfriend. Afterwards, Mondragon went to a friend\u2019s house and then a bar. She had left the door to her apartment unlocked. She returned to her apartment around 1:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\u00b65 Roubideaux testified at trial. He said that after seeing Mondragon, he walked the other woman to her house and then left for Mondragon\u2019s apartment. He claimed that on the way there he was assaulted by three juveniles, that he suffered a bloody nose and got blood on his face and shirt. When Roubideaux arrived at Mondragon\u2019s apartment and found the door unlocked, he went in. From this point on, Roubideaux and Mondragon disagree on what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-12\">\u00b66 According to Roubideaux, Mondragon came home drunk with blood on her lip. She began yelling and cussing at him, accusing him of having an affair with the woman she had seen him with earlier. She said he had no right to be in the apartment. An argument ensued that was loud enough that the downstairs neighbor yelled that he was going to call the police. According to Roubideaux, the argument ended when he put his arm around Mondragon and apologized. Then, according to Roubideaux, they sat on the bed, began kissing, and had sex. He says Mondragon then got up to go to the bathroom across the hall. Police officers arrived soon after and arrested Roubideaux.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>\u00b67 According to Mondragon, she did not expect to find Roubideaux at the apartment. He punched her in the mouth as soon as she opened the door. After getting hit, Mondragon bled from the lip and cussed at Roubideaux. Mondragon denied having sex with Roubideaux. According to Mondragon, she tried to calm him down and only kissed him a couple of times until they both fell asleep. When she awoke, she left the apartment and went to her landlord, who called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b68 According to the police officers who responded to the call, Mondragon was crying and upset when they arrived. One of the officers said that Roubideaux was intoxicated. Another officer said that Roubideaux had a black left eye and a cut on his lip.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b69 The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">PROSECUTOR: Thank you, Your Honor. Let me start by saying there are two kinds of cases that are brought before the Court when I prosecute. There are those cases in which me, as the State of Montana, as the plaintiff, must convince a jury of a fact beyond a reasonable doubt. And very often times that involves the defendant sitting at counsel table and not testifying as it is his or her right to do. They simply say the State hasn\u2019t proven its case. And I say, yes, we have. Here is what should convince you of all the facts. So I have to go over that burden to convince you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">Now the other case is where the defense puts up [a]n alternate theory. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what we have here today. We have got two stories which I believe and I submit to you makes it easier for you to decide this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">So no longer do you have to decide whether the State\u2019s evidence, the two officers and Miss Mondragon\u2019s testimony is enough to convince you of what happened, but instead, since the defendant chose to get up on the stand and give you a story that\u2019s contradictory to their testimony, now all you have to do is decide who is telling the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Your Honor, I am going to object to this if Mr. Thompson is suggesting the State doesn\u2019t have to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-10\">PROSECUTOR: Well, of course I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-11\">THE COURT: Overruled. This is summation. I think he is getting into it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-12\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">PROSECUTOR: So, yes, I have to show you, and you have to decide whether I proved the elements of the case beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>\u00b610 The jury found Roubideaux guilty of Partner or Family Member Assault, and he was sentenced to five years in the Montana State Prison. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u00b611  This Court measures prosecutorial misconduct by reference to established norms of professional conduct. <em>Clausell v. State, </em>2005 MT 33, \u00b6 10, 326 Mont. 63, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 1175, \u00b6 10. This Court will not presume prejudice from charges of prosecutorial conduct; rather, the defendant must show that the alleged prosecutorial misconduct violated the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 63, 305 Mont. 123, \u00b6 63, 23 P.3d 216, \u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u00b612 Roubideaux argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement violated his due process rights under the 5th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as under Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution, because it shifted the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defense, and required him to prove that he was telling the truth, rather than requiring the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Roubideaux argues that this statement, that the jury simply had to decide who was telling the truth, could only be interpreted by a reasonable juror as meaning that the State no longer had to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Roubideaux analogizes the prosecutor\u2019s statements to other cases involving prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument. <em>See State v. Stewart, </em>2000 MT 379, 303 Mont. 507, 16 P.3d 391; <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827; <em>Gore v. State </em>(Fla. 1998), 719 So.2d 1197; <em>People v. Adams </em>(Ill. Ct. App. 1996), 666 N.E.2d 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u00b613 However, in none of the cases cited by Roubideaux did the offending prosecutor immediately re-affirm the State\u2019s obligation to prove its case. In this case the prosecutor, right after making the allegedly improper statement, explicitly stated the correct burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u00b614 Roubideaux\u2019s counsel cannot be faulted for making a objection as soon as she felt it was necessary. However, the objection itself is made only \u201cif\u2019 the prosecutor meant to suggest \u201cthe State doesn\u2019t have to prove this case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d And, in response, the prosecutor immediately affirmed that he \u201cof course\u201d had to meet the State\u2019s burden of proof. In overruling the objection, the District Judge acknowledged that the prosecutor had not had the opportunity to finish making his point prior to the objection. Then, immediately, the prosecutor stated the correct burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">\u00b6 15  This Court will consider an alleged improper statement during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>closing argument in the context of the entire closing argument. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>1998 MT 177, \u00b6 37, 290 Mont. 97, \u00b6 37, 966 P.2d 721, \u00b6 37; <em>State v. Hart </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 375, 384, 625 P.2d 21, 26. When the statement Roubideaux complains about is taken in context, and where the prosecutor clearly stated to the jury that they needed to decide if he had \u201cproved the elements of the case beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d such statement did not shift the burden of proof and deny Roubideaux a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u00b616 Since the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not improper, there is no need to discuss whether Roubideaux was prejudiced by the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"A1R\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
