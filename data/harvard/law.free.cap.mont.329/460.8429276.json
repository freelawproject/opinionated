Whether certain portions of Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b66 Respondent William Andersen and Appellants Doug and Valerie McCollum are neighbors. Appellants McCollum, LLC, Jefferson River Ranches, LLC, and Jefferson River Ranches Homeowners\u2019 Association, Inc., are all entities established by the McCollum family. This appeal arises from a dispute over who owns an 11.14 acre tract of land to the north of Andersen\u2019s property that sits between the high-water line (the bank of the Jefferson River) and the low-water line. Both Andersen and the McCollums claim ownership of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b67 Although a long line of land transfers preceded this dispute, for our purpose, the first relevant transaction took place in 1971. At this time, Taylor and May Hale granted to Remi Monforton, a present appellant, and his wife, Betty Jo, Sections 15 and 22 of the Hale Ranch in Madison County, Montana, by warranty deed, described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASHU\">That certain tract of land situated in the West 1/2 of Section 22, and the SW 1/4 of Section 15, T. 1 N., R. 4 W., M.P.M.

[See attached Map A.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b68 The Monfortons divided this tract of land sitting on the south bank of the Jefferson River in order to sell residential lots-thus, creating the Box Lazy L Ranches Subdivision. The Monfortons had the subdivision surveyed by James Spring, instructing him to survey lots all the way to the Jefferson River; they then filed the Certificate of Survey with the Madison County Clerk and Recorder. The Monfortons sold Lots 15,16,17, and 18 to the Gilberts, who in turn sold those lots to Andersen in 1980 and 1987. Lots 16, 17, and 18 sit on the south shore of a bend in the Jefferson River. The disputed property consists of 11.14 acres of land sitting between the high-water line (the river bank) and the low-water line.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u00b69 Eventually, the Monfortons sold the remainder of the original ranch, excepting out various properties, including Andersen\u2019s tracts. This remainder of land, located to the east of Andersen\u2019s property, then went through a series of owners, until Valerie McCollum acquired it in 1995. McCollum then conveyed the land to Appellant McCollum, LLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b610 In 1999, McCollum, LLC, hired a surveyor, Donald Schauber, to survey and subdivide property in order to adjust a boundary with some neighbors, the Wisners. Schauber prepared Certificate Survey No. 1349-AE, showing property belonging to McCollum, LLC, as Tract B, and the land to the east owned by the Wisners, as Tract A. <em>(See </em>attached Map B.) Andersen\u2019s land sits to the west of the McCollum property. According to Schauber\u2019s survey, Tract B encompasses (in addition to land of no concern to Andersen) the disputed 11.14 acres north of Andersen\u2019s Lots 16, 17, and 18-that is, the land between the high-water line and the low-water line on the south shore of the Jefferson River. In creating the survey, Schauber looked to the original description (from the Hales to the Monfortons), which he interpreted as granting Andersen a fixed boundary on the north side of Andersen\u2019s property along the high-water line. Andersen knew nothing of Schauber\u2019s survey at the time it was commissioned, and believed he owned the 11.14 acres that Schauber interpreted as belonging to McCollum, LLC. McCollum, LLC, on the other hand, claims it owned the 11.14 acres before commissioning Schauber\u2019s survey and therefore did not find it necessary to take action against Andersen to acquire title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b611 McCollum, LLC, hired an examiner to research and determine if title problems existed with Schauber\u2019s survey of the land depicted in Certificate Survey No. 1394-AE. The examiner discovered a title problem with a small triangle-shaped piece of property that did not include the disputed 11.14 acres. Upon the examiner\u2019s recommendation, the McCollums and the Wisners brought a quiet title action against Ted Dow Lewis and Delta H. Lewis over the small triangle-shaped land. Again, this land did not include the disputed 11.14 acres. According to the McCollums, they did not take action with regard to the disputed 11.14 acres because of their belief that they already owned the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b612 The title action for the triangle-shaped piece of land did not name Andersen, nor was he served. After performing a \u201cdiligent search and inquiry\u201d for all possible defendants, the McCollums and the Wisners served notice of the summons and complaint to all unknown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>defendants through publication in the <em>Madisonian, </em>a newspaper published in Madison County, Montana, for five consecutive weeks. Andersen claims to have been ignorant of this quiet title action-until the advent of the present litigation. The District Court entered a judgment and decree quieting title to the property described in Certificate of Survey No. 1349-AE to McCollum, LLC, and the Wisners. This property included Tract B, encompassing the disputed 11.14 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b613 The legal description of the Box Lazy L Ranches Subdivision, as quoted above, describes the high-water line as the boundary of Lots 16, 17, and 18. The legal description of the remainder of the original ranch, ever since it was sold by the Monfortons, has included an identical description of the southern boundary between the ranch and Lots 16, 17, and 18. In 2000, claiming ownership of the 11.14 acres, McCollum, LLC, conveyed Tract B to Appellant Jefferson River Ranches, LLC, which then in turn conveyed Tract B to Jefferson River Ranches Homeowners\u2019 Association, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\u00b614 Andersen brought suit against Appellants claiming ownership of the disputed land. The District Court held that a meander line defines Andersen\u2019s property, and therefore he owns the 11.14 acres in dispute. The court granted summary judgment in favor of Andersen.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b615 We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>We apply the same criteria as the district court according to Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Rolison v. Bozeman Deaconess Health Services, </em>Inc., 2005 MT 95, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 491, \u00b6 13, 111 P.3d 202, \u00b6 13. Summary judgment shall be granted if the evidence filed with the court \u201cshow[s] no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Rolison, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">DISCUSSION ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">\n<em>Whether Andersen\u2019s deed indicates that he does not own the land adjacent to his property between the high-water and low-water lines.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">\u00b616 Andersen and the McCollums (via their entities) claim ownership to the 11.14 acre stretch of land sitting between the high-water and low-water lines of the Jefferson River, just north of Andersen\u2019s property and northwest of the McCullom property. The District Court\u2019s summary judgment opinion held that a meander line defines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Andersen\u2019s property, and that he therefore owns the 11.14 acres in dispute. We agree with the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b617 Before addressing the lower court\u2019s conclusion regarding the facts of this case, we must first address the definition and purpose of \u201cmeander lines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b618 Black\u2019s Law Dictionary states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">Meander lines. Lines run in surveying particular portions of the public lands which border on navigable rivers, <em>not as boundaries of the tract, </em>but for the purpose of defining the sinuosities of the banks of the stream, and as the <em>means of ascertaining the quantity of land </em>in the fraction subject to sale, and which is to be paid for by the purchaser. In preparing the official plat from the field notes, the meander line is represented as the border line of the stream, and shows that <em>the water-course, and not the meander line as naturally run on the ground, is the boundary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 980 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">\u00b619  In other words, a surveyor utilizes a meander line when he or she wants to show that the navigable river serves as the property boundary. If a meander line does not appear in the description, the boundary is fixed-i.e., it does not alter with the river\u2019s shifting bank.</p>\n<p id=\"A5t\">\u00b620 The use of meander lines has been the cause of some debate over the years. In the 1868 case, <em>Railroad Company v. Schurmeir </em>(1868), 74 U.S. 272, 7 Wall. 272, 19 L.Ed. 74, the Supreme Court was forced to address the meaning and purpose of meander lines in response to a dispute over whether the described boundary was fixed or dependent on the river\u2019s edge. Even though the description included a meander line, counsel for the railroad company argued that the property had a fixed boundary because the description included metes and bounds. <em>Schurmeir, </em>74 U.S. at 278. The Court disagreed, holding that \u201cthe river ... not the meander-line, is the boundary of the lot...\u201d <em>Schurmeir, </em>74 U.S. at 286. The Court explained that \u201c[m]eander-lines are run in surveying fractional portions of the public lands bordering upon navigable rivers, not as boundaries of the tract, but for the purpose of defining the sinuosities of the banks of the stream.\u201d <em>Schurmeir, </em>74 U.S. at 286-87. Meander lines, according to the Court, are a \u201cmeans of ascertaining the quantity of the land in fraction subject to sale, and which is to be paid for by the purchaser.\u201d <em>Schurmeir, </em>74 U.S. at 287. In other words, while meander lines contain specific measurements, permitting an exact quantity of land to be determined for sale, they are meant to define the boundary as moving with the river\u2019s shifting bank.</p>\n<p id=\"AAM\">\u00b621 The Ninth Circuit noted several decades later in <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number><em>Boynton </em>(9th Cir. 1931), 53 F.2d 297, 298, that \u201ca meander line, as carried into field notes, shows corners, posts, monuments, and courses.\u201d The Circuit went on to hold that such a survey line does not become \u201cdefinite and fixed\u201d unless the drafter took some action or used words \u201cin the instrument of conveyance, which will show that the grantor has agreed that such line shall be considered as having more than its assigned character; it must be agreed that it indicates a definite boundary.\u201d <em>Boynton, </em>53 F.2d at 298. Citing <em>Boynton </em>as precedent, the Ninth Circuit held in <em>City of Los Angeles v. Borax Consolidated Limited </em>(9th Cir. 1935), 74 F.2d 901, 902, that even though the plat \u201cdid not distinctly state that the lines of the patent were meander lines,\u201d it was clearly inferable from the description.</p>\n<p id=\"ADX\">\u00b622  This Court long ago recognized that \u201c[t]he general rule adopted by state and federal courts is that meander lines run in surveying fractional portions of the public lands bordering upon navigable bodies of water are not run as boundaries of the tract, but for the purpose of defining the sinuosities of the banks of the lake or river .... The title of the grantee is not limited to such meander lines; <em>the waters themselves and not the meander line constitute the real boundary.\" Faucett v. Dewey Lumber Co. </em>(1928), 82 Mont. 250, 257, 266 P. 646, 648 (citations omitted; emphasis added). The same is true regarding meander lines describing non-navigable bodies of water, except that then ownership extends to the middle of the stream, not just to the low-water fine. <em>Bode v. Rollwitz </em>(1921), 60 Mont. 481, 491, 199 P. 688, 691.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b623 In addition to the above relevant law, we find a 1992 decision from the Texas Court of Appeals useful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">[T]he surveyor may run a meander line, <em>a series of course and distance calls </em>which follow the river or other natural object or monument as closely as is practically possible for purposes of calculating the amount of land conveyed. When a meander line is used, however, the natural object or monument (e.g., a river, the seashore, or an identifiable terrain feature) will control over the specific calls for course and distance. Thus, meander lines of surveys of land adjacent to or bounding upon a stream are not to be considered as boundaries, but they are to follow the general course of the stream, which in itself constitutes the real boundary. ... Where the natural object is clearly referred to in the patent or deed as a boundary of the land conveyed, specific course and distance calls will be construed to be a meander fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Texas v. Brazos River Harbor Navigation District </em>(Tex. Ct. App. 1992), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>831 S.W.2d 539, 542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">\u00b624 Appellants argue that these interpretations of meander lines only apply to government surveys, and that in private surveys meander lines raise only a presumption. However, after considering relevant precedent, we find the rule to apply to both government and private surveys. <em>The Pointe, LLC v. Lake Mgmt. Ass\u2019n, Inc. </em>(Tenn. Ct. App. 2000), 50 S.W.3d 471, 477 (quoting <em>Holbert v. Edens </em>(1880), 73 Tenn. 204, 209-10) (\u201c\u2018The general rule undoubtably is that a call for the stream or bank... and then with the stream according to its meanders, will carry the boundary <em>ad filurn aquae </em>[to the thread of the stream], whether the grant be by the State or a private individual\u201d\u2019); <em>Ford v. Butte County </em>(Cal. App. Ct. 1944), 145 P.2d 640, 643-44 (stating that rules applying to meander lines in government surveys also apply to private surveys).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b625  Before addressing the facts of this case, we note the following relevant Montana statutory law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">70-16-201. Owner of land bounded by water. Except where the grant under which the land is held indicates a different intent, the owner of the land, when it borders upon a navigable lake or stream, takes to the edge of the lake or stream at low-water mark; when it borders upon any other water, the owner takes to the middle of the lake or stream.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">In other words, Montana statute dictates that property between the low-water line and the high-water line belongs to the party owning property to the high-water line, unless a grant specifically indicates otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b626 Turning to the facts of this case, the legal description of Andersen\u2019s property references the Jefferson River bank three times to define the boundaries of the course and distance calls, and characterizes the border as \u201cmeandering.\u201d The surveyor defined the boundary as running \u201c... to a point on the right bank of the <em>Jefferson River-, </em>thence <em>meandering the right hank </em>of the <em>Jefferson River ... </em>[series of calls and distances] thence leaving the right bank of the <em>Jefferson River.\u201d </em>As noted above, Montana statute dictates that unless the grant indicates a different intent, the owner of land bordering upon a navigable stream, takes to the edge of the stream at low-water line. Section 70-16-201, MCA. As we noted from previous case law, the use of metes and bounds in the description does not indicate an intent contrary to the statutory presumption of low-water line.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\u00b627  Given that the deeds describing and conveying Lots 16, 17, and 18 refer to the plat, and given that the plat uses meander lines, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>determine that Andersen owns the disputed 11.14 acres at issue here that is adjacent to Lots 16,17, and 18 between the high-water and low-water lines of the Jefferson River. The deeds and the plat do not \u201cindicate\u201d a contrary intention of the grantor. Section 70-16-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AK7\">\u00b628 Appellants\u2019 arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, Appellants argue that when the land outside of a meander line is greatly in excess of the land covered by a grant the meander line will be treated as the boundary. This rule does not apply here, however, because the acreage of Lots 16, 17, and 18 is larger than the disputed land. In addition, Appellants contend that when boundaries are determined by location, and not monument, courses and distances control. The problem with this argument is that the references to the Jefferson River in the plat illustrate that the boundaries are, at least in part, determined by monument. <em>See Sowerwine v. Nielson </em>(Wyo. 1983), 671 P.2d 295, 299 (\u201ca \u2018monument\u2019 is a natural or artificial physical object on the ground which helps establish a line. Natural monuments are such things as trees, rivers, stone outcroppings, creeks, and land features\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b629  In addition, Appellants also cite to the depositions of various parties, including Remi Monforton, the original grantor of the subdivision, in support of their argument that the intention of the grantor was to set a \u201cdefinite boundary\u201d for the property and not use the river as the boundary. Appellants also contend that Andersen has not paid property taxes on the disputed property, while the McCollums have. However, \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA, does not allow consideration of evidence outside of the four comers of the granting document. In applying the statute, we must confine our review to the \u201cgrant under which the land is held.\u201d Since we have determined that \u201cthe grant under which the land is held\u201d does not indicate an intention contrary to granting Andersen the land below the high-water fine, the extrinsic evidence is irrelevant. <em>Tester v. Tester, </em>2000 MT 130, \u00b6 25, 300 Mont. 5, \u00b6 25, 3 P.3d 109, \u00b6 25 (citing <em>Ferriter v.

Since this argument is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not address it. <em>State v. Weaselboy, </em>1999 MT 274, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 503, \u00b6 16, 989 P.2d 836, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b631 <em>Whether Andersen is bound by the prior quiet title decree adjudicating McCollum, LLC, as the owner of the disputed property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Afe\">\u00b632 The District Court concluded that Andersen was not bound by the prior quiet title decree concerning Tract B because Andersen was never properly served, and thus the court in the prior action lacked jurisdiction over him. We agree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b633 Andersen may collaterally attack the decree if he was not properly served. <em>Joseph Russell Realty Co. v. Kenneally </em>(1980), 185 Mont. 496, 501, 605 P.2d 1107, 1110. Appellants contend that Andersen was properly served by publication. Under \u00a7 70-28-104, MCA, an \u201cunknown claimant\u201d may be joined as a defendant in a quiet title action. However, under \u00a7 70-28-107, MCA, service of such a defendant must comply with Rule 4, M.R.Civ.P. Rule 4(D)(5)(c), M.R.Civ.P., governs service by publication upon unknown claimants. It requires that an affidavit be filed that states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">[T]he affiant has made diligent search and inquiry for all persons who claim, or might claim any right, title, estate, or interest in, or lien, or encumbrance upon, such property, or any thereof, adverse to plaintiffs ownership, or any cloud upon plaintiffs title thereto, whether such claim or possible claim be present or contingent... and that the affiant has specifically named as defendants in such action all such persons whose names cam be ascertained ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">\u00b634 In the quiet title action at issue here, the affiant was the McCollums\u2019 attorney. The attorney stated that he had made a \u201cdiligent search and inquiry\u2019 for all possible claimants to Tract B. The requirement for a \u201cdiligent search and inquiry\u2019 is not a mere formality but one that requires strict compliance. <em>See Joseph Russell, </em>185 Mont. at 502, 605 P.2d at 1110 (discussing service by publication upon corporations). As stated above, Andersen\u2019s lots are directly to the west of the McCollums\u2019, and it is undisputed that Andersen\u2019s land borders on Tract B. It is also undisputed that at the time of the action, the McCollums knew Andersen and that they could see Andersen\u2019s house from their property. The McCollums did not inspect Andersen\u2019s property in preparing to quiet title, but instead asked a title company to inquire into what parties they should name in the action. Andersen did not learn of the action until after he filed the present lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u00b635  Appellants argue that the McCollums did not specifically name, and personally serve, Andersen because they had no way of knowing that Andersen had a claim to part of Tract B. The District Court held that the McCollums should have known of the claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>because the deed to Andersen\u2019s property is a matter of public record. Appellants contend that the McCollums could not have known that Andersen\u2019s deed would be interpreted to give him ownership of the disputed 11.14 acres. However, Rule 4, M.R.Civ.P., does not require \u201cknowledge\u201d of ownership but merely knowledge that a \u201cpossible claim be present or contingent.\u201d Given the language of Andersen\u2019s deed and of the subdivision\u2019s recorded plat, as well as the McCollums\u2019 knowledge of Andersen\u2019s proximity to Tract B, we affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the McCollums did not perform a \u201cdiligent search and inquiry for all persons who claim, or might claim\u201d a right to land within Tract B. Therefore, service by publication was not sufficient service with which to gain personal jurisdiction over Andersen and he is not bound by the prior decree. <em>Fonk v. Ulsher </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 379, 383, 860 P.2d 145, 147 (\u201c[ijmproper service undermines a court\u2019s jurisdiction, and a default judgment subsequently entered is thereby void\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b636 Appellants argue that <em>Brown v. Tintinger </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 373, 801 P.2d 607, <em>overruled on other grounds by Wareing v. Schreckendgust </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 196, 205-06, 930 P.2d 37, 43, compels a different result, but that case is distinguishable. There, the defendants had not been named or personally served in a previous quiet title action. The decree in the previous action extinguished an easement the defendants claimed to have held. <em>Brown, </em>245 Mont. at 376, 801 P.2d at 608. We concluded that there was no evidence that the party who had brought the quiet title action would have known of the defendants\u2019 use of the property. <em>Brown, </em>245 Mont. at 376, 801 P.2d at 609. In contrast to a claim of an easement, Andersen\u2019s claim is to ownership of the land. Further, there is ample evidence that the McCollums had reason to know of Andersen\u2019s possible claim to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b637 <em>Whether certain portions of Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief should be stricken.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u00b638 After the close of briefing, Andersen moved that certain portions of Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief be stricken because it makes references to facts not in the record and makes arguments which are misstatements and mischaracterizations of Andersen\u2019s arguments. Given that we have held for Andersen on all issues, we determine that we need not address Andersen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b639 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b494-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and WARNER and DISTRICT JUDGE SHERLOCK, sitting for JUSTICE MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"AvJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b640 The Court finds that the property survey at issue \u201cuses meander lines\u201d and from that factual predicate concludes that the disputed property is subject to the long-established rule, first stated by the United States Supreme Court in 1869 and cited by this Court in <em>Faucett, </em>to the effect that a meander line does not constitute a property\u2019s boundary, but rather, the water does. I submit that neither the Court\u2019s factual predicate nor its application of the meander rule to the property dispute here is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b641 The roots of the meander rule can be traced to Congressional enactments of the 1780s and 1790s providing the methods by which the territories ceded to the national government by the several states would be divided into townships and tracts. <em>See Railroad Company v. Schurmeir </em>(1869), 74 U.S. 272, 7 Wall. 272, 19 L.Ed. 74. The purpose of the rule was to create a convenient mechanism for determining the quantity of government land to be sold\u2014 with the land below the meander line being free of charge. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, which we noted in <em>Faucett, </em>\u201c[i]t has been the practice of the government from its origin, in disposing of the public lands, to measure the price to be paid for them by the quantity of upland granted, no charge being made for the lands under the bed of the stream or other body of water.\u201d <em>Hardin v. Jordan </em>(1891), 140 U.S. 371, 380, 11 S.Ct. 808, 35 L.Ed. 428. Thus, the rule was originally a bureaucratic convenience, explained by the part of the rule which the Court has spliced out of the quotation of it in \u00b6 20: \"... for the purpose of defining the sinuosities of the banks of the lake or river, <em>in order to ascertain the exact quantity of the upland to be charged for.\u201d Faucett, </em>82 Mont. at 257, 266 P. at 648 (emphasis added). The amount of land and the purchase price was thus determined based upon the meander line, but, as the Court correctly notes, generally-but subject to an important exception discussed herein-the actual property line extended to the water itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u00b642 Understanding the reason for this rule becomes important in this case. A distinction was made between the meander line and the actual property line out of a very practical concern: \u201cThe reason for this rule is that it is not possible for a surveyor to delineate precisely, in a series of straight lines, the meanders of a stream or body of water.\u201d <em>Board of Com\u2019rs v. Rathborne Land Co., Inc. </em>(La. App. 2004), 868 So.2d 928, 931. Thus, meander lines were not thought to be accurate indicators of property boundaries, and were not generally used as such. \u201c[F]or various reasons, meander lines are inherently inaccurate, meant only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>to approximate the course of a water body.\u201d George J. Morgenthaler, <em>Surveys of Riparian Real Property: Omitted Lands Make Rights Precarious, </em>30 Rocky Mtn. Min. L. Inst. 19-1, 19-10 &amp; nn.19-21 (1984). Thus, the purpose of the meander rule, as this Court has explained, is to \u201cascertain the exact quantity of the upland to be charged for,\u201d <em>Faucett, </em>82 Mont. at 257, 266 P. at 648, or, as the United States Supreme Court has explained, the rule is \u201cthe means of ascertaining the quantity of the land in the fraction subject to sale, and which is to be paid for by the purchaser.\u201d <em>Schurmeir, </em>74 U.S. at 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b643 In \u00b6 27 the Court concludes that the official survey in this matter \u201cuses meander lines.\u201d Unfortunately, the Court fails to acknowledge the evidence herein which demonstrates that the reason for the rule-the need to \u201cascertain the exact quantity\u201d of land purchased-does not exist, making the rule inapplicable?</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b644 Although a meander line is not meant to set the boundary of a tract, but is \u201cmeant only to approximate the course of a water body,\u201d the line in question here, and the plat as a whole, leaves no doubt that the line was designed to constitute the boundary of the tracts. The survey sets a precise, point to point, metes and bounds description of every piece of the entire circumference of the property. Each point, even those on the River\u2019s bank, is given a precise location. Each separate line is point to point. Each curve within the fines, even those along the Jefferson River, is calculated by radius and measured in length. The property fines around each individual lot are measured and set. And, <em>critically, the specific acreage of each lot is calculated and set forth on the plat itself. </em>(See attached plat.) Thus, there is no need whatsoever to \u201cascertain the exact quantity of the upland to be charged for\u201d because the exact quantity has not been left to chance. To the contrary, the survey has precisely calculated the exact quantity of land which Anderson purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b645 Thus, the survey fine in question is not a \u201cmeander fine\u201d but, rather, a boundary fine. Consequently, the survey clearly \u201cindicates a different intent,\u201d as provided in \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA, and the purchaser does not take to the river. How can a purchaser extend his property to the water by virtue of a claimed \u201cmeander fine\u201d when the purchase price he paid was based on specifically calculated acreage? <em>None </em>of the authority cited by the Court would allow a purchaser to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u00b646 To be sure, the survey does use the word \u201cmeandering\u201d on one occasion within its legal description of the property, and makes several references to the Jefferson River. That is an insufficient basis, however, to turn a precisely surveyed boundary fine into a meander <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>line, where the survey itself left no purpose for a meander line to fill. Although the survey uses the word \u201cmeandering\u201d as an additional descriptive of the location of the property\u2019s boundary line, the survey does not default to the meander line to <em>set </em>the property\u2019s boundary line. No part of this property has been left undetermined, or somehow contingent upon the vagaries of a flowing river. This becomes apparent visually when one views the plat attached hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b647 The meander rule was to be applied in the absence of a survey to \u201cdelineate precisely, in a series of straight lines, the meanders of a stream or body of water.\u201d <em>Rathborne, </em>868 So.2d at 931. That is clearly not the case here. Here, a survey was painstakingly completed which left no part of the property boundaries to chance. Though reference was made to the Jefferson River, noting at what points the property line intersected, traversed and departed from the bank of the River, the property line \u201cmeandered\u201d the River in a colloquial sense only; that is, the River\u2019s \u201cmeander line\u201d was not used to create the boundary. That was done by specific surveying calculations and each lot\u2019s acreage was carefully determined in advance of the sale. Thus, this is not a survey premised upon a meander line. As such, the meander rule is not applicable here for purposes of determining the property\u2019s boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"Aru\">\u00b648 Further, even if the meander rule did apply here, the rule, considered in its entirety, would not operate to grant the additional property to Respondent. As noted above, there are exceptions to the rule\u2019s operation, one of which is at issue here. In <em>Producers Oil Co. v. Hanzen </em>(1915), 238 U.S. 325, 35 S.Ct. 755, 59 L.Ed. 1330, the United States Supreme Court reviewed its many cases applying the meander rule since first announcing it in <em>Schurmeir </em>in 1869, and summarized the entire meander rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">[These cases] unquestionably support the familiar rule relied on by counsel for the Oil Company that in general meanders are not to be treated as boundaries and when the United States conveys a tract of land by patent referring to an official plat which shows the same bordering on a navigable river the purchaser takes title up to the water line. <em>But they no less certainly establish the principle that facts and circumstances may be examined and if they affirmatively disclose an intention to limit the grant to actual traverse lines these must be treated as definite boundaries. It does not necessarily follow from the presence of meanders that a fractional section borders a body of water and that a patent thereto confers riparian rights.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>Producers </em>Oil, 238 U.S. at 339 (emphasis added). <em>See also Schultz v. Winther </em>(Wisc. 1960), 101 N.W.2d 631, 636 (\u201cThe general rule is subject to exceptions. Circumstances may show that what appears to be a meander line rather than the shore of a body of water some distance away was intended as a boundary. The area of land between the meander line and the actual shore has been considered <em>a circumstance hearing upon the question of intent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"Ade1\">\u00b649 Regarding the question of intent in this case, although there is clear testimony that Monfortons\u2019 expressed intention was to create definite surveyed boundaries, and not default to a \u201criver boundary,\u201d I do not believe it is necessary to look to such evidence in order to determine intent, and therefore, I believe summary judgment is appropriate-in favor of Appellant. As the Court correctly notes in \u00b6 29, intent is determined by first looking to the documents themselves, but unfortunately, the Court then yields to the temptation to include references to extrinsic evidence that favors its decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ABZ\">\u00b650 From a proper review of the documents, discussed above, there can be no question that the intent was to create unmistakable property lines and lots of specific size, because that is what the survey did. And thereafter, each deed incorporated by reference the specific property dimensions and acreage. Consequently, the meander rule is not applicable-it cannot be employed in order to disregard surveyed property lines and acreage calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b651 The Court, without consideration of the long history and governmental purpose of the meander rule, applies it to private transactions as well. <em>See </em>\u00b6 24. It is a poor policy choice. We are now presmning that private persons also give away valuable riparian land without compensation, a rule of convenience for the government in yesteryear, but one of foolishness today. While this may affect future cases, it does not change the correct analysis here, as the meander rule simply should not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b652 I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"AgPU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\"> See, for example, \u00b6 8, where the Court ascribes to the Monfortons an instruction to their surveyor to \u201csurvey lots all the way to the Jefferson River.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
