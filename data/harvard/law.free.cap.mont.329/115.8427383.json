(Stockman\u2019s) for lack of personal jurisdiction. We affirm. The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in determining that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b62 On April 3, 2003, Semenza filed his Complaint in District Court, naming Don Kniss (Kniss) and Stockman\u2019s as defendants. In this Complaint, Semenza alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was a resident of Montana, that Kniss was a resident of Oklahoma, and that Stockman\u2019s was an Oklahoma corporation with its principal place of business in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Semenza also alleged that he had sold cattle to the defendants for a total purchase price of $87,400.00, to be paid in full on April 7, 2001. Further, Semenza alleged that he had received only $35,000.00 in payment, and that the defendants had breached their contract by failing to pay the remaining balance of $52,400.00. Pursuant to these allegations, Semenza demanded a jury trial and requested, <em>inter alia, </em>judgment in the amount owed on the contract, plus interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b63 On October 10, 2003, Semenza filed his Motion for Entry of Default against Stockman\u2019s, stating that Stockman\u2019s \u201cwas properly served in this action with a First Additional Summons and Complaint on July 28, 2003, and has failed to plead or otherwise defend.\u201d The District Court entered the requested default that day, stating that Stockman\u2019s \u201cis in default for failure to plead or otherwise defend as provided by Montana Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">\u00b64 On February 5, 2004, Semenza filed his Motion for Entry of Default Judgment against Stockman\u2019s, requesting judgement in the amount of $52,400.00, plus interest on this sum at 10% per annum from April 7, 2001 to January 30, 2004, amounting to $14,758.11. Semenza further requested that the judgment include his costs of $190.00, together with interest on the principal and costs at the rate of 10% per annum until paid. Semenza\u2019s counsel filed an accompanying affidavit whereby he personally testified to the accuracy of the dates and monetary figures specified in the Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">\u00b65 On February 10, 2004, the District Court entered a judgment in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>favor of Semenza without specifying a defendant against whom the judgment could be enforced. This judgment simply stated that Semenza was entitled to the balance allegedly due on the contract, together with costs and interest as specified in his Motion for Entry of Default Judgment. Then, on February 24, 2004, the District Court entered this same judgment specifically against Stockman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b66 On May 28,2004, Justin B. Lee, of Burke &amp; Lee Law Office, filed two documents in this action. One was entitled \u201cNotice of Appearance,\u201d and it stated that he would serve as counsel of record for Kniss<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Stockman\u2019s, and that all subsequent correspondence and other communications should be directed to him. The other was a Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P. This Motion, which was filed on behalf of Stockman\u2019s alone, requested that the District Court \u201cset aside its default judgment in this action and allow Defendant to answer Plaintiffs complaint.\u201d In justifying this request, the Motion asserted that Stockman\u2019s \u201cwas not properly served with this complaint and summons and in fact was not aware of the existence of this complaint and summons until recently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b67 The District Court ordered a hearing to be held on June 22,2004, regarding the Motion. Semenza moved for a continuance, which the District Court granted. At the hearing, held July 27,2004, the parties presented arguments regarding whether Stockman\u2019s was properly served. However, there was no discussion regarding the impending operation of Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P., which provides that motions made pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., are deemed denied if not ruled upon within sixty days of filing. The District Court did not make a ruling that day, but ordered the parties to submit briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b68 In its brief, Stockman\u2019s argued that it had not been properly served. Semenza argued that the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment was deemed denied pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P., and that the District Court therefore did not have jurisdiction to set aside the default judgment. In rendering its Order to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction on September 28,2004, the District Court found that Stockman\u2019s had not been properly served and, consequently, dismissed Semenza\u2019s claim. In doing so, the District Court concluded that it never had personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s and thus lacked authority to enter the default judgment. Accordingly, the District Court did not address Semenza\u2019s arguments regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>deemed denial of the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. Semenza now appeals from the Order dismissing his claim, requesting that we reverse the District Court and reinstate the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law regarding personal jurisdiction to determine whether they are correct. <em>Gulf Ins. Co. v. Clark, </em>2003 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 315 Mont. 121, \u00b6 11, 68 P.3d 673, \u00b6 11. We review related findings of fact to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Gulf Ins. Co., </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u00b610 Semenza contends that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to enter its Order dismissing his claim. In supporting this contention, Semenza challenges the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. Specifically, Semenza asserts that Stockman\u2019s was properly served at its address in Oklahoma, and that Kniss accepted service on behalf of Stockman\u2019s. Semenza also asserts that Stockman\u2019s knew of the District Court action before being served because it had received a letter from the United States Department of Agriculture which referenced the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">\u00b611 Nonetheless, Semenza argues, the issue of whether service was properly achieved is moot because Stockman\u2019s invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court by filing its \u201cunlimited\u201d Notice of Appearance along with its Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. Further, Semenza argues that the Motion was deemed denied, pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P., when the District Court did not rule on it within sixty days. This deemed denial, Semenza notes, strips a district court of jurisdiction to consider questions raised on the merits, as this Court explained in <em>Wallinder v. Lagerquist </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 212, 219, 653 P.2d 840, 843. Thus, Semenza argues that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to subsequently enter its Order dismissing the claim for lack of personal jurisdiction. Finally, Semenza argues that this Court can not review the merits of the issues raised in the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment because Stockman\u2019s did not appeal in a timely fashion after the Motion was deemed denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">\u00b612 In response, Stockman\u2019s argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court correctly determined it had not obtained personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s due to improper service. Stockman\u2019s also argues that any judgment made by a court lacking jurisdiction is void <em>ab initio. </em>Further, Stockman\u2019s argues that the District Court could not lose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P., because it never actually gained personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b613 We first address Semenza\u2019s contention that this Court can not review the merits of the issues raised in the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment because Stockman\u2019s did not appeal in a timely fashion sifter the Motion was deemed denied. Semenza would have us conclude that we can not consider the issue of personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s because that issue was raised in the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment; because the Motion was subsequently deemed denied; and because the denial was not appealed in a timely fashion. However, the deemed denial of a motion to set aside a default judgment is not conclusive as to the issue of personal jurisdiction, even when the proffered reason for bringing the motion is an alleged lack of personal jurisdiction. Rather, personal jurisdiction is established either by strict compliance with the rules governing service of process, <em>Blaskovich v. Blaskovich </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 248, 250, 815 P.2d 581, 582, or by a party\u2019s voluntary appearance in an action, Rule 4B(2), M.R.Civ.P. Thus, although Stockman\u2019s raised the issue of personal jurisdiction in its Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, and did not appeal the deemed denial of that Motion, this Court is not precluded from reviewing the District Court\u2019s determination regarding personal jurisdiction in the context of its Order dismissing Semenza\u2019s claim. Moreover, this Court is obligated to conduct such review because Semenza is now directly challenging the District Court\u2019s determination on the issue of personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b614 In rendering its Order to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, the District Court observed that the praecipe provided only the physical address of a large office building, and did not instruct the process server to serve a person authorized to accept service on behalf of Stockman\u2019s as required by the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court also observed that \u201cthe process server simply served a person at the building address (co-defendant Don Kniss), not an appropriate person within Stockman\u2019s office authorized to accept service on Stockman\u2019s behalf.\u201d Further, the District Court observed that Semenza did not contest these facts. Consequently, the District Court concluded that \u201cservice was not properly made pursuant to Rule 4D, M.R.Civ.P.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b615 Nonetheless, Semenza simply asserts that Stockman\u2019s was properly served at its address in Oklahoma, and that Kniss accepted service on behalf of Stockman\u2019s. We are not persuaded by these bald assertions because Semenza presents no argument as to how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>District Court may have erred in concluding that service was not properly achieved. As we have previously held, this Court is not obligated to develop legal analysis that may lend support to a litigant\u2019s position. <em>In re Estate of Bayers, </em>1999 MT 154, \u00b6 19, 295 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 983 P.2d 339, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b616  Semenza also asserts that Stockman\u2019s knew of the District Court action before being served because it had received a letter which referenced the action. This letter stems from a complaint which Semenza filed with the United States Department of Agriculture prior to the inception of the case <em>sub judice. </em>Semenza\u2019s assertion avails nothing, however, as actual knowledge of a lawsuit is no substitute for proper service. <em>Blaskovich, </em>249 Mont. at 251, 815 P.2d at 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b617 We now turn to Semenza\u2019s argument that the initial response filed by Stockman\u2019s invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court. Semenza seems to suggest that Stockman\u2019s should have filed a special appearance in order to preserve its opportunity to contest personal jurisdiction. Specifically, Semenza argues that the District Court acquired jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s upon the filing of its \u201cunlimited\u201d Notice of Appearance along with its Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment. However, a special appearance is no longer required to contest personal jurisdiction, as \u201cRule 12, M.R.Civ.P., abolished the distinction between special and general appearances.\u201d <em>Knoepke v. Southwestern Railway Co. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 238, 243, 620 P.2d 1185, 1187. Hence, a party may challenge a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction simply by raising the issue in its initial response to a claim. <em>Knoepke, </em>190 Mont. at 243, 620 P.2d at 1187. \u201cIf the party\u2019s initial response to the opponent\u2019s claim raises a personal jurisdiction issue, then the party is not subject to the general power of the court solely because of the response.\u201d <em>Knoepke, </em>190 Mont. at 243, 620 P.2d at 1187-88. Here, Stockman\u2019s raised the personal jurisdiction issue in its initial response by arguing that it was not properly served. Thus, the initial response filed by Stockman\u2019s did not invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b618  Finally, we address Semenza\u2019s argument that the deemed denial of the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment, pursuant to Rule 60(c), M.R.Civ.P., deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to enter its Order dismissing the case. Rule 4B(2), M.R.Civ.P., provides that a court may acquire personal jurisdiction over a party through service of process or by way of a voluntary appearance in an action. Rules for service of process are mandatory and must be strictly followed. <em>In re Marriage of Zacher, </em>2004 MT 249, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 54, \u00b6 16, 98 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>309, \u00b6 16. If service of process is flawed, the court acquires no jurisdiction over the party, and a default judgment entered thereon is void. <em>Blaskovich, </em>249 Mont. at 250, 815 P.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b619 Here, the District Court found that Stockman\u2019s was not properly served, and we have rejected Semenza\u2019s assertion to the contrary. Moreover, Stockman\u2019s did not make a voluntary appearance in the action. Rather, as noted above, Stockman\u2019s contested personal jurisdiction in its initial response to Semenza\u2019s claim. Thus, the District Court did not ever have personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s in this action, and the default judgment entered against Stockman\u2019s is void. <em>Blaskovich, </em>249 Mont. at 250, 815 P.2d at 582. As such, the deemed denial of the Motion to Set Aside Default Judgment was inconsequential, and it did not place the stamp of finality on the default judgment. Accordingly, we must reject Semenza\u2019s argument that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to enter its Order dismissing the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\u00b620  We conclude that none of the District Court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous, and none of its conclusions of law were incorrect. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in determining that it lacked personal jurisdiction over Stockman\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-8\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, RICE and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-7\"> The record before us does not disclose Kniss\u2019 present status in this litigation, but Stockman\u2019s states that Kniss is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
