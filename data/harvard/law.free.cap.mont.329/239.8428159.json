(Piper), appeals from the decision of the Second Judicial District Court, Silver Bow County, denying its motion to compel arbitration of claims asserted by Respondent Nancy Zigrang (Zigrang). We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u00b62 We address whether the District Court properly ruled that the arbitration clause contained in the SEP-IRA agreement signed by Zigrang is enforceable as to the claims against Piper and, therefore, whether Zigrang must arbitrate her dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">\u00b63 This case represents one of twenty-three lawsuits filed by individual investors against Piper, Robert English (English), and Tom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>O\u2019Neill (O\u2019Neill) involving the alleged mismanagement of accounts in Piper\u2019s corporate offices in Butte. <em>See Willems v. U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, Inc., </em>2005 MT 37, 326 Mont. 103, 107 P.3d 465. This particular action concerns an investment agreement Zigrang entered with Piper that contained an arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">\u00b64 Zigrang is a 68-year-old woman with a high school education who has worked various jobs in and around Butte for the better part of five decades. Zigrang retained O\u2019Neill in 1993 to open a simplified employee pension individual retirement account (SEP-IRA) for the purpose of investing a little money for retirement. The SEP-IRA agreement contained an arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b65 Zigrang signed the agreement after a brief discussion with O\u2019Neill regarding the general maintenance of the account. O\u2019Neill did not advise Zigrang that the agreement contained a provision to arbitrate any dispute that could arise between Piper and her. O\u2019Neill never informed Zigrang that she could \u201copt out\u201d of any of the provisions contained within the agreement, including the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"ASOK\">\u00b66 Zigrang filed a complaint on April 5, 2002, after learning that O\u2019Neill frequently had traded securities in her account without obtaining her approval. Zigrang alleged that O\u2019Neill had purchased and sold securities in rapid succession in order to generate unnecessary and excessive costs and commissions against Zigrang\u2019s account. Piper filed a motion to compel arbitration on August 14,2002, based upon the provision of the SEP-IRA agreement requiring arbitration of disputes in Zigrang\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b67 A panel of three district court judges sat era <em>banc </em>to hear evidence common to all twenty-three cases arising from O\u2019Neill\u2019s alleged misconduct on July 9, August 12, and September 3,2003. The District Court denied Piper\u2019s motion to compel arbitration and stay proceedings on April 7, 2004. The order issued by the District Court, however, includes common findings of fact that do not apply to Zigrang. The order mistakenly states that Zigrang held a PAT Plus agreement with Piper and fails to mention the SEP-IRA that Zigrang actually held. Piper\u2019s PAT Plus agreement grants O\u2019Neill some discretion to trade securities. The terms of the SEP-IRA agreement signed by Zigrang, however, specifically prohibit O\u2019Neill from having any discretion at all. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s order refusing to compel arbitration <em>de novo </em>to determine whether its conclusions of law prove correct. <em>Iwen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>v. U.S. West Direct, </em>1999 MT 63, \u00b6 17, 293 Mont. 512, \u00b6 17, 977 P.2d 989, \u00b6 17. When a district court compels arbitration, or refuses to compel arbitration, the threshold inquiry remains whether the parties agreed to arbitrate. <em>Solle v. Western State Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>2000 MT 96, \u00b6 22, 299 Mont. 237, \u00b6 22, 999 P.2d 328, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b69 The facts and issues arising in this case bear substantial similarity to those presented in <em>Willems. </em>We held in <em>Willems </em>that a clause in a PAT Plus account agreement granting Piper broad discretion over an investor\u2019s holdings creates a fiduciary duty. <em>Willems, </em>\u00b6 22. This fiduciary duty obligated Piper to advise the investor of the consequences of an arbitration clause before the formation of the contract. <em>Willems, </em>\u00b6 25. Piper\u2019s failure to so advise the investor rendered the arbitration clause unenforceable. <em>Willems, </em>\u00b6 28. The differences between the PAT Plus account agreement in <em>Willems </em>and the SEP-IRA agreement here require us, however, to evaluate further the enforceability of the arbitration agreement at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The Federal Arbitration Act</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00b610 The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) provides that arbitration provisions found in contracts affecting interstate commerce are valid and enforceable \u201csave upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The sale of securities through a public stock exchange falls within the ambit of the Act. <em>Passage v. Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc. </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 60, 65, 727 P.2d 1298, 1301. The FAA applies to disputes under state court jurisdiction. <em>See Southland Corp. v. Keating </em>(1984), 465 U.S. 1, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\u00b611 Piper contends that the District Court thwarted the FAA\u2019s intent and purpose by ruling the arbitration provision unenforceable in light of the fact that the act represents a federal and state policy favoring arbitration. <em>See Shearson/American Express, Inc. v. McMahon </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 220, 107 S.Ct. 2332, 96 L.Ed.2d 185; <em>Chor v. Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood, Inc. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 143, 862 P.2d 26. The intent of the FAA, however, does not include thwarting applicable state contract law. State law applies \u201cif that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability, and enforceability of contracts generally.\u201d <em>Perry v. Thomas </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 483, 492 n.9, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 2527 n.9, 96 L.Ed.2d 426. Thus, generally applicable contract formation defenses, such as fraud, duress, or unconscionability, may be applied to invalidate arbitration agreements without contravening the FAA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><em>Doctor\u2019s Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 681, 687, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 1656, 134 L.Ed.2d 902; <em>liven, </em>\u00b6 26. States may not craft special rules, however, that apply only for the purpose of defeating arbitration. <em>liven, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">Contracts of Adhesion</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b612 We first must analyze the nature of the agreement between Zigrang and Piper before we can evaluate the enforceability of the arbitration provision. This Court has recognized that brokerage agreements may represent contracts of adhesion. <em>Kloss v. Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., </em>2002 MT 129, \u00b6 27, 310 Mont. 123, \u00b6 27, 54 P.3d 1, \u00b6 27. The Court in <em>Willems </em>did not need to reach the issue of whether the PAT Plus account agreement constitutes a contract of adhesion in light of its holding that the discretionary nature of the account imposed a fiduciary duty on Piper. <em>Willems, </em>\u00b6 9. This fiduciary duty obligated Piper to advise the investor of the consequences of the arbitration provision. <em>Willems, </em>\u00b6 25. The SEP-IRA agreement at issue here granted Piper no similar discretionary authority on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b613 The availability ofZigrang\u2019s potential contract formation defenses hinges on our determination of whether the SEP-IRA agreement, absent discretionary authority to Piper, constitutes a contract of adhesion. Generally applicable contract law states that an adhesion contract will not be enforced against the weaker party if it is (1) not within their reasonable expectations, or (2) within their reasonable expectations, but, when considered in its context, proves unduly oppressive, unconscionable or against public policy. <em>Iwen, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b614 Contracts of adhesion arise when a party possessing superior bargaining power presents a standardized form of agreement to a party whose choice remains either to accept or reject the contract without the opportunity to negotiate its terms. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 24. We have noted that investors face the possibility of being excluded from the securities market unless they accept a contract containing an arbitration provision. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 27. In <em>Kloss </em>we concluded that a standardized investment form, drafted by the broker and presented to the investor with no opportunity to negotiate the terms, constituted a contract of adhesion that excluded the investor from the securities market unless she accepted the agreement to arbitrate. <em>Kloss, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"AEq\">\u00b615  We agree with the District Court that Piper\u2019s SEP-IRA agreement represents a contract of adhesion. O\u2019Neill provided Zigrang with a standardized form agreement, in this case the SEP-IRA, prepared by Piper, on a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d basis. Zigrang, an elderly woman with no experience with investment services, had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>bargaining power or opportunity to negotiate the terms of the contract if she chose to invest. Zigrang would have been excluded from the securities market if she did not accept the agreement to arbitrate. <em>See Kloss, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\u00b616 Piper contends that its investment agreements do not represent adhesion contracts because it maintains a policy allowing clients to \u201copt-out\u201d of any offending provision. The District Court found, however, that Piper\u2019s alleged \u201copt-out policy\u201d merely consisted of miscellaneous memoranda containing anecdotes or account summaries, many pages of which fail to mention arbitration. English, the branch manager of Piper, had not heard of the alleged policy. No one had ever brought him an account where an investor had attempted to strike a provision. In fact, to the best of his knowledge, the alleged policy cannot be found in the office\u2019s procedural manual and Piper does not train account executives to discuss the \u201copt-out\u201d policy with clients.</p>\n<p id=\"AsW\">\u00b617 The fact that the SEP-IRA agreement in this case represents a contract of adhesion, with nothing more, does not constitute a sufficient basis for invalidating the agreement. The adhesive nature of a contract only supports other contract formation defenses. <em>Iwen, </em>\u00b6 28. We turn then to potential contract formation defenses asserted by Zigrang, including reasonable expectations and unconscionability.</p>\n<p id=\"Al4\">\u00b618 This Court will not enforce the arbitration provision in a contract of adhesion if it is (1) not within Zigrang\u2019s reasonable expectations or (2) within her reasonable expectations, but, when considered in its context, proves unduly oppressive, unconscionable or against public policy. <em>Passage, </em>223 Mont. at 66, 727 P.2d at 1302. Zigrang also contends that she did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive her constitutional right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Contract Formation Defenses</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b619  We cannot complete our examination of Zigrang\u2019s contract formation defenses, however, because the District Court\u2019s order relies on a mistaken finding of fact. The order states that Zigrang held a PAT Plus agreement with Piper, rather than the SEP-IRA that Zigrang actually held. Thus, we must remand to the District Court for further findings of fact relating to the SEP-IRA investment agreement concerning potential contract formation defenses raised by Zigrang, including unconscionability, waiver, and reasonable expectations. We provide the following guidance to the District Court on remand as it attempts to analyze Zigrang\u2019s potential contract formation defenses. Her reasonable expectations likely will influence the outcome of this analysis. <em>See Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 173, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>180-81, 656 P.2d 820, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b620  The inquiry into an investor\u2019s reasonable expectations in an adhesion contract consists only of an analysis of the investor\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations regarding the investment agreement. This Court considers objectively reasonable expectations from the investor\u2019s perspective. <em>See Iwen, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 180-81, 656 P.2d at 824. Thus, the terms of the investment agreement will be construed as laymen would understand it and not according to the interpretation of sophisticated stockbrokers. An investor\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations should be honored even if a painstaking study of the agreement would negate those expectations. <em>See Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 180-81, 656 P.2d at 824. Zigrang\u2019s objectively reasonable expectations, therefore, may negate the arbitration provision of an investment agreement in the same manner that any contract may be negated by this state law defense. <em>Casarotto, </em>517 U.S. at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b621 Regardless of the type of investment agreement, Piper contends that the conspicuous presence of the arbitration provision in the investment agreement, with nothing more, proves sufficient to demonstrate objectively reasonable expectations. This Court in <em>Transamerica </em>held invalid a provision included in an insurance policy, however, because it failed to honor the policy holder\u2019s reasonable expectations. <em>Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 180, 656 P.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b622 The issue in <em>Transamerica </em>concerned an insurance company\u2019s obligation to defend or provide coverage for parents who were sued by their daughter who was injured in an accident in which the mother was the driver. <em>Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 174, 656 P.2d at 821. The insurance policy contained a \u201chousehold exclusion clause\u201d that excluded coverage for injuries to any person related to the insured who resided in the same household. <em>Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 174, 656 P.2d at 821. The fact that the policy represented an adhesion contract justified the Court\u2019s decision to consider reasonableness from the perspective of the policy holder. <em>Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 180-81, 656 P.2d at 824. This Court held that the \u201chousehold exclusion clause\u201d failed to meet the reasonable expectations of the purchaser of the policy. <em>Transamerica, </em>202 Mont. at 180, 656 P.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b623 The fact that Zigrang\u2019s investment agreement constitutes a contract of adhesion likewise supports consideration of reasonableness from her perspective. Thus, the mere presence of an arbitration provision in an investment agreement, though conspicuous, does not bring the provision within the reasonable expectations of an investor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>in every instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\u00b624 In fact, our review of the SEP-IRA agreement reveals the presence of other similarly conspicuous provisions not addressed by the District Court and apparently not raised by the parties. For example, a clause directly above the arbitration provision in the SEP-IRA agreement states: \u201cI understand that I have the full responsibility for directing the investment of my account and that no transactions will occur in my account unless I (or another authorized person) so direct.\u201d The SEP-IRA agreement also contains a letter from the Internal Revenue Service that authorizes Piper to act as the custodian or passive trustee only in accordance with federal income tax regulations. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.408-2(e) (2005). Federal regulations permit Piper only to acquire and hold particular investments specified by Zigrang. Piper cannot act as the trustee of Zigrang\u2019s SEP-IRA account if the investment agreement grants them any discretion to direct investment within the account. <em>See </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.408-2(e)(6)(i)(A)-(B) (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b625 The District Court must assess Zigrang\u2019s reasonable expectations in light of the entire SEP-IRA agreement. We remand to the District Court for findings of fact concerning the SEP-IRA account Zigrang actually held with Piper. The District Court must evaluate Zigrang\u2019s contract formation defenses, including reasonable expectations, unconscionability, and waiver of jury trial, as they relate to the terms of the SEP-IRA agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\u00b626 Remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-7\">JUSTICES RICE, COTTER, WARNER, LEAPHART and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
