Green avers that (1) the district court erred in declining to depart downward; (2) the district court\u2019s statements at sentencing showed that it treated the Guidelines as mandatory, rather than advisory, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); (3) the district court erroneously applied the \u201cpresumptively reasonable\u201d appellate standard of review in arriving at his sentence; and (4) his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-23\">This court does not have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Green\u2019s motion for a downward departure. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). However, we do have jurisdiction to review \u201cwhether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\">Contrary to Green\u2019s assertion, the record reflects that the district court was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>aware that the Guidelines were advisory in nature. Accordingly, there was no Fanfan violation. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005) (explaining that Fanfan error \u201cis found where the district court applied the mandatory Guidelines to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence absent any Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The record further reflects that the district court properly calculated the applicable guideline sentencing range and considered the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-20 (5th Cir. 2005). Therefore, Green has not shown that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
