There is no evidence of what, how or if it was dislodged from its \u201cat rest\u201d position and fell. Plaintiff and a friend were the only persons present when it became dislodged and neither offered any further explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">The district judge issued a carefully considered ten-page order granting defendant\u2019s motion.
