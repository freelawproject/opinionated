On appeal, counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritorious claims on appeal but raising the following issues, whether: (1) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance; (2) McLeod\u2019s \u00a7 922 conviction is invalid because, at the time, he could legally possess a weapon under state law; ' (3) McLeod\u2019s traffic stop for suspicion of driving-while-impaired violated his Fourth Amendment rights; (4) the state\u2019s dismissal of the driving-while-impaired and related charges precludes McLeod\u2019s \u00a7 922(g) conviction; (5) McLeod\u2019s statements to officers in December 2004 should have been suppressed; and (6) the district court erred by denying McLeod\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">First, we find no ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999) (stating standard). To allow for adequate development of the record, generally claims of ineffective assistance should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">We have rejected McLeod\u2019s second issue. <em>See id. </em>at 292-93 (holding that North Carolina state statute permitting convicted felon to possess firearm in his home did not amount to restoration of defendant\u2019s civil rights for purposes of pre-' eluding \u00a7 922(g) violation). Moreover, by pleading guilty, McLeod has waived this issue. <em>United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201c[A] guilty plea constitutes a waiver of all nonjurisdietional defects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-12\">McLeod\u2019s third issue also fails as it has been waived by virtue of his guilty plea. <em>See id. </em>That the state dropped its charges against McLeod, as alleged in the fourth claim, is irrelevant because a federal prosecution is not barred by a state prosecution for the same offense. <em>Abbate v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 187, 194, 79 S.Ct. 666, 3 L.Ed.2d 729 (1959); <em>United States v. Christmas, </em>222 F.3d 141, 145 (4th Cir.2000). McLeod\u2019s fifth claim is without merit as his statements made to police in December 2004 related only to the dismissed count of his indictment. Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of McLeod\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir. 2000) (stating review standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>including the issues raised in McLeod\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We also deny McLeod\u2019s motions to relieve his counsel and strike counsel\u2019s brief and counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
