We deny the petition.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">In his petition for review, Lin maintains that he met his burden of proof for his request for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Lin fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">Additionally, we uphold the denial of Lin\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum-even though the facts that must be proved are the same-an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Lin fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">Accordingly, though we grant Lin leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>tentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-16\"> As Lin fails to set forth any argument concerning the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture, we find that this claim has been abandoned on appeal. <em>See Yousefi v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 318, 326 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
