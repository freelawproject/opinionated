Thereafter, Robinson filed a motion to suppress evidence gained from a related search of his residence. The district court denied the motion to suppress, and Robinson entered a conditional guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(b), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C). The district court then sentenced Robinson to 188 months in prison and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-25\">Robinson timely appealed, challenging the denial of his motion to suppress. Robinson argued that because a tipster was unreliable, the police improperly stopped and searched Robinson\u2019s vehicle. Additionally, Robinson argued that as the stop and search supported the warrant issued to search his residence, the evidence discovered at his residence was inadmissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>at trial. After conducting a thorough review of the record, we conclude the district court properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Accordingly, we affirm Robinson\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
