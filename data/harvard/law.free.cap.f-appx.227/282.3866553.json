Morris\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), contending there exist no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred by considering incidents not noted by the probation officer as violations of supervised release. Morris was notified of the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief but chose not to do so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-24\">We will affirm a sentence imposed after revocation of supervised release if it is within the prescribed statutory range and not plainly unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Crudup, </em>461 F.3d 433, 437 (4th Cir.2006). In making this determination, we first consider whether the sentence is proeedurally or substantively unreason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>able, and if so, whether it is \u201cplainly\u201d so. <em>Id. </em>While the district court must consider the Chapter 7 policy statements and statutory requirements and factors applicable to revocation sentences under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a), 3583 (2000), the district court ultimately has broad discretion to revoke the previous sentence and impose a term of imprisonment up to the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to discuss incidents at sentencing that did not put Morris in a favorable light. The court stated it would not sentence Morris based on information not known to counsel prior to sentencing. In any event, the sentence was reasonable. Morris had nine violations to his supervised release. Some of the violations included committing crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Morris\u2019 sentence. This court requires counsel to inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
