Burnett first claims that the Commissioner denied her an adequate collection due process (CDP) hearing under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 by refusing to provide her an in-person hearing following notice of intent to levy. We disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-15\">Treasury regulations require taxpayers to state their reasons for disagreement with the proposed levy in requesting a CDP hearing. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-1(c)(2) Q&amp;A-C1(ii)(E). The lengthy missive attached to Burnett\u2019s form CDP hearing request set forth various frivolous and groundless defenses to the proposed collection action. ' Following Burnett\u2019s request, in addition to exchanging correspondence, the IRS Appeals Officer scheduled a telephonic hearing with Burnett. Burnett refused to speak with the Officer when called and did not, as she stated she would, call the Officer back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-16\">As we have recognized and as Treasury regulations make clear, CDP hearings are valid and satisfy the demands of due process if conducted by telephone or correspondence instead of face-to-face particularly where, as here, the taxpayer\u2019s proffered arguments are frivolous. <em>See Ralidis v. United States, </em>169 Fed.Appx. 390, 391 (5th Cir.2006); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-1(d)(2) Q&amp;A-D6 (\u201cCDP hearings ... are informal in nature and do not require the Appeals officer or employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>ee and the taxpayer, or the taxpayer\u2019s representative to hold a face-to-face meeting. A CDP hearing may, but is not required to, consist of a face-to-face meeting ....\u201d) and Q&amp;A-D8 (\u201cA face-to-face CDP conference concerning a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability will not be granted if the request for a hearing or other taxpayer communication indicates that the taxpayer wishes only to raise irrelevant or frivolous issues concerning that liability.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the issues Burnett indicated she would have raised in a face-to-face meeting were frivolous and because Burnett was offered a telephonic hearing as permitted by Treasury regulations, the Tax Court properly found that the IRS afforded Burnett an opportunity for an adequate CDP hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\"><em>2. </em>Burnett further asserts that the Tax Court granted summary judgment on insufficient evidence. We find Burnett\u2019s objections to the scope of the administrative record without merit. No formal administrative record is required in informal adjudicative proceedings such as CDP hearings. <em>See Kindred v. Comm\u2019r, </em>454 F.3d 688, 696 &amp; n. 21 (7th Cir.2006); <em>Living Care Alternatives of Utica, Inc. v. United States, </em>411 F.3d 621, 624 (6th Cir.2005). Further, while the pre-levy hearing statute and regulations do require verification that the requirements of any applicable law or administrative procedure have been met,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the law does not mandate that the Appeals Officer rely on any particular documents in satisfying the verification requirement. The notice of determination and attached explanation fully explained the rationale for the determination. We are satisfied that this thorough explanation for the final action taken provided an adequate basis for the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the Appeals Officer made a reasoned decision under the Internal Revenue Code and Treasury regulations. <em>Living Care, </em>411 F.3d at 630. 3. Finally, we reject Burnett\u2019s assertion that the Tax Court levied improper sanctions against her. Code Section 6673(a)(1) authorizes the Tax Court to impose sanctions against a taxpayer who maintains a proceeding primarily for delay or who maintains a frivolous position. A claim is \u201cfrivolous\u201d under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a)(1)(B) if \u201cit is contrary to established law and unsupported by a reasoned, colorable argument for change in the law.\u201d <em>Rhodes v. Comm\u2019r, </em>152 Fed. Appx. 340, 342 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Coleman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>791 F.2d 68, 71 (7th Cir.1986)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">In her request for a CDP hearing and during summary judgment argument, Burnett asserted <em>inter alia </em>(1) that the underlying liabilities are invalid because nothing in the Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Revenue Code requires her to file tax returns and pay taxes; and (2) that the IRS failed to send her proper notice and demand because nothing in the Code makes her liable to pay any tax. These arguments are patently frivolous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of Burnett\u2019s failure to raise any substantial issues regarding the levy and her refusal to discuss the matter with the Appeals Officer when both parties were on the telephone, it is apparent that her repeated requests for a face-to-face conference and her allegations that the Appeals Officer abused his discretion in sustaining the levy were made merely in hope of further delaying the collection of her delinquent tax liabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">Burnett\u2019s case is based upon frivolous claims that are contrary to relevant statutes and case law, and Burnett has continued to advance frivolous challenges to the tax laws in spite of warnings to refrain from doing so. Burnett was provided an opportunity for a CDP hearing to discuss non-frivolous issues pertaining to the levy. She failed to take advantage of that opportunity and has engaged in dilatory conduct to postpone collection. We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that Burnett has become a serial offender in making frivolous arguments for the sake of delay and accordingly affirm the imposition of a penalty under section 6673.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

United States, </em>461 F.3d 610, 612 (5th Cir.2006) (noting that in a CDP case in which the underlying liability is not at issue, the Tax Court and the court of appeals review the Commissioner\u2019s determination for abuse of discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b372-5\">. We note that Q&amp;A-D8, which describes specific circumstances in which Appeals will not hold a face-to-face conference with the taxpayer because a conference will serve no useful purpose, was added to Treasury regulations effective November 16, 2006, after this case was on appeal. Q&amp;A-D8 of the regulation provides that a face-to-face conference need not be offered if the taxpayer raises only frivolous arguments concerning the Federal tax system. This clarification was added because Q&amp;A-D7, which sets forth where face-to-face hearings are to be held if offered, had been misinterpreted by some taxpayers as requiring the IRS to hold a face-to-face conference at the taxpayer's option. <em>See </em>Misc. Changes to Collection Due Process Procedures Relating to Notice and Opportunity for Hearing Upon Filing of Notice of Federal Tax Lien, 70 Fed.Reg. 54681, 54683 (proposed Sept. 15, 2005) (to be codified at 26 C.F.R. pt. 301). That is the same misinterpretation that Burnett relies upon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(1); 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330 \u2014 1 (e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-6\">. We have recognized that \u201c[t]he claim that wages and investment income are somehow exempt from federal taxation is a tired one, and has been repeatedly rejected.\" <em>Rhodes, </em>152 Fed.Appx. at 341 (citing <em>Lonsdale v.

Eggers, </em>782 F.2d 1341, 1343 (5th Cir.1986) (finding such a claim to be \"manifestly and patently frivolous.\u201d)). Burnett\u2019s contention that an assessment must precede deficiency has also been rejected by this court. <em>Rhodes, </em>152 Fed.Appx. at 341; <em>State Farm Life Ins. Co. v.

Because we affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s determination of Burnett\u2019s deficiencies for the taxable years which lead to the levy, Burnett was precluded from placing the underlying liabilities for those taxable years at issue in this case. <em>Burnett v.
