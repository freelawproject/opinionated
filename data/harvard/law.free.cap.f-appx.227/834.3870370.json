Dykes argues that section 2251(a) is unconstitutional both on its face and as applied to his case on the ground that section 2251(a) is beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-23\">We review the constitutionality of a challenged statute <em>de novo. United States v. Ballinger, </em>395 F.3d 1218, 1225 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-25\">Dykes recorded a videotape of himself fondling the genitals of an eight-year old girl who was spending the night with his daughter. The recording occurred wholly in the State of Alabama and remained there. The camera and videotape used to produce the child pornography were manufactured outside the State of Alabama. Dykes pleaded guilty to one count of sexual exploitation of a child and reserved the right to argue on appeal that section 2251(a) is unconstitutional as applied to his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-26\">Dykes\u2019s argument that section 2251(a) is unconstitutional is foreclosed by our precedents. Section 2251(a) prohibits the production of child pornography \u201cusing materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in interstate or foreign commerce by any means.\u201d In <em>United States v. Maxwell, </em>446 F.3d 1210, 1218 (11th Cir.2006) , we held that \u201cit is within Congress\u2019s authority to regulate <em>all </em>intrastate possession of child pornography, not just that which has traveled in interstate commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>or has been produced using materials that have traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d In <em>United States v. Smith, 459 </em>F.3d 1276, 1285 (11th Cir.2006), we held that \u201cCongress could have rationally concluded that the inability to regulate intrastate possession and production of child pornography would, in the aggregate, undermine Congress\u2019s regulation of the interstate child pornography market,\u201d and upheld the application of section 2251(a) to an individual who produced pornographic photographs using Kodak paper and processing equipment that had traveled interstate. In the light of <em>Maxwell </em>and <em>Smith, </em>Dykes\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Dykes\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
