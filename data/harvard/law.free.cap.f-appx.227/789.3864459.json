After review, we dismiss the petition for review for lack of jurisdiction to the extent it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s July 26, 2006 final order. We deny the petition to the extent it seeks review of the BIA\u2019s September 14, 2006 order denying Carrera\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b818-14\">Carrera, a native and citizen of Venezuela, was admitted to the United States on August 3, 2003 on a nonimmigrant B-2 tourist visa and was authorized to stay until January 29, 2004. In September 2003, Carrera filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief claiming that he had been persecuted in Venezuela based on his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. On February 3, 2004, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) sent Carrera a Notice to Appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-15\">After an asylum hearing, the IJ denied Carrera all relief and ordered his removal. The IJ determined that Carrera had failed to meet his burden of proof to show eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal or CAT relief. Carrera appealed the IJ\u2019s order of removal to the BIA. On July 26, 2006, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. Carrera filed a motion for reconsideration, which the BIA denied on September 14, 2006. Carrera filed his petition for review with this Court on October 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-16\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-9\">A. July 26, 2006 Final Order</p>\n<p id=\"b818-17\">A petitioner must file a petition for review with this Court within thirty days after the date of the final order of removal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). \u201cSince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). The finality of a removal order is not affected by the filing of a motion to reconsider. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Here, Carrera\u2019s removal order became. final on July 26, 2006, when the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). Carrera filed his petition for review on October 13, 2006, more than thirty days after the BIA\u2019s July 26, 2006 final order. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the July 26, 2006 final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">B. September 14, 2006 Order Denying Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Because Carrera\u2019s petition for review was filed within thirty days of the BIA\u2019s September 14, 2006 order denying his motion for reconsideration, we have jurisdiction to review that order. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cJudicial review ... is limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, when an argument is not raised in the initial brief before this Court, the argument is deemed abandoned on appeal. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">Carrera does not challenge the denial of his motion for reconsideration in his counseled appeal brief. Specifically, Carr-era\u2019s brief contains no law relevant to a motion for reconsideration, and does not argue that, in denying his motion for reconsideration, the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. Indeed, Carrera\u2019s brief references his motion for reconsideration only once, at the end of the statement of facts. Therefore, Carrera has abandoned his claim with regard to the BIA\u2019s September 14, 2006 order denying his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">For the above stated reasons, we dismiss the petition as it relates to the July 26, 2006 order affirming the IJ\u2019s order of removal and deny the petition as it relates to the September 14, 2006 order denying Carrera\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-8\">. A motion for reconsideration filed with the BIA \"shall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b). Notably, Carrera\u2019s motion for reconsideration failed to specify any legal or factual error and instead merely reiterated arguments Carrera had already made unsuccessfully in his direct appeal of IJ\u2019s removal order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
