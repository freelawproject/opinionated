Benavides appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. He argues that his detention was impermissibly extended and that he did not voluntarily consent to the search of his tractor-trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-24\">Our review of the record shows that the district court did not err in determining that the initial stop of Benavides\u2019s vehicle was permissibly extended based on reasonable suspicion of other criminal activity. <em>See United States v. Brigham, </em>382 F.3d 500, 506-07 (5th Cir.2004). The district court also did not err in determining that Benavides voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 435-37 (5th Cir.2002). Benavides has not shown that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
