He also seeks review of the denial of his motion to remand. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-25\">The Immigration and Naturalization Act (INA) authorizes the Attorney General to confer asylum on any refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (2000). The INA defines a refugee as a person unwilling or unable to return to his native country \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). An applicant can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>establish refugee status based on past persecution in his native country on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1) (2006). Without regard to past persecution, an alien can establish a well-founded fear of persecution on a protected ground. <em>Ngarurih v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">An applicant has the burden of demonstrating his eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2006); <em>Gandziami-Mickhou v. Gonzales, 445 </em>F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir.2006). A determination regarding eligibility for asylum is affirmed if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). This court will reverse the Board \u201conly if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports both the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility finding and its ultimate findings that Nken is ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. Accordingly, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s final order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We also conclude the Board did not abuse its discretion denying Nken\u2019s motion to file a brief out of time. With respect to the motion to remand,\u2019 because Nken did not show that a visa was immediately available to him and the Government opposed the motion, we find the Board did not abuse its discretion denying the motion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a) (2000); <em>Onyeme v. INS, </em>146 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.1998); <em>Matter of Velarde-Pacheco, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 253 (B.I.A.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
