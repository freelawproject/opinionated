Pacheco Dominguez contends that his right to due process was violated when he was placed in removal proceedings after he had been denied status under the special agricultural worker (\u201cSAW\u201d) program set out at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160. Pacheco Dominguez argues that information from his application for SAW status was used in violation of the confidentiality provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1160(b)(6)(A)(i). Even if it is assumed that Pacheco Dominguez exhausted administrative remedies as to that contention, \u00a7 1160(b)(6)(A)(i) only prohibits use of information gathered during the SAW legalization process; it does not prohibit immigration authorities from checking on whether SAW status was granted or denied. <em>See Arreola-Arellano v. INS, </em>223 F.3d 653, 656 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-23\">Pacheco Dominguez presents several arguments challenging the determination that his 1989 conviction of alien smuggling rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal. Because, however, he admitted removability on the basis that he was not admitted or paroled into the United States, he was ineligible for cancellation of removal regardless of the status of his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>tion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1229b(a)(1) &amp; (2). Moreover, counsel\u2019s concession that Pacheco Dominguez had been convicted of alien smuggling was binding on Pacheco Dominguez, <em>see Matter of Velasquez, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 377, 382 (BIA 1986); alien smuggling is currently defined as an aggravated felony, regardless of the sentence imposed, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N); the current definition applies retroactively, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43); and its retroactivity does not violate the Due Process or Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See Madriz-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 321, 334 (5th Cir.2004) (Due Process Clause); <em>Marcello v. Ahrens, </em>212 F.2d 830, 838-39 (5th Cir.1954), <em>aff'd, </em>349 U.S. 302, 75 S.Ct. 757, 99 L.Ed. 1107 (1955) (Ex Post Facto Clause). Finally, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h), which Pacheco Dominguez argues entitles him to a waiver, is facially inapplicable to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
