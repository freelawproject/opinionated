The district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim because there was no liberty interest involved and thus no constitutional violation. Stallworth timely appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Stallworth contends that the district court used an incorrect legal standard in determining that he had failed to state a claim. He does not, however, explain what standard should have been used. The district court correctly found that Stallworth failed to state a claim of a due process violation with regard to the RVR. <em>See Sandin v. </em>Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Stallworth argues that he stated a claim of retaliation against the prison\u2019s law library clerk. Stallworth\u2019s allegation in the district court was that the library clerk was discriminating against him. We do not consider this new claim raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999). Stallworth did allege retaliation by the prison commissioner, but he did not state a claim of a constitutional violation as he did not allege any facts showing a retaliatory motive on the part of the commissioner. <em>See Moody v. Baker, </em>857 F.2d 256, 258 (5th Cir.1988); <em>Brinkmann v. Johnston, </em>793 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1986). Nor did Stallworth carry his burden of persuasion when he sought global injunctive relief from retaliation by prison officials. <em>See PCI Transp., Inc. v. Fort Worth &amp; Western R.R. Co., </em>418 F.3d 535, 545 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Lakedreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">Stallworth asserts that the prison commissioner\u2019s response to Stallworth\u2019s grievances amounted to an Eighth Amendment violation. Stallworth\u2019s allegations did not state such a violation by the commissioner, however, as he did not allege conditions that would satisfy the objective component of an Eighth Amendment violation. <em>See Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 352 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Novak v. Beto, </em>453 F.2d 661, 665 (5th Cir.1971). We decline to consider any Eighth Amendment claims that Stall-worth raises for the first time on appeal against any other defendants. <em>See Leverette, </em>183 F.3d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-14\">Stallworth argues that the actions taken by the defendants against him violate his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Stallworth has not established an ADA violation, however, because he has failed to show that the fact that he is housed in a special needs facility renders him disabled within the meaning of the ADA. <em>See Lightbourn v. County of El Paso, Texas, </em>118 F.3d 421, 428 (5th Cir. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">Finally, Stallworth maintains that the district court erred in failing to conduct a <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir. 1985), hearing prior to dismissal. Stall-worth does not state what additional facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>would have been brought out during a <em>Spears </em>hearing. <em>See Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 10 (5th Cir.1994). Thus, he has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We have reviewed the record and Stall-worth\u2019s brief on appeal, and we conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Stallworth\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii); <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Stall-worth\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Stall-worth has had one other civil action dismissed for failure to state a claim. <em>See Stallworth v. Johnson, </em>No. 4:00-CV-299 (N.D.Miss. July 19, 2001). Stallworth is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. See \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
