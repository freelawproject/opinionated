The district court sentenced Nichols to 210 months\u2019 imprisonment. We find no error and affirm Nichols\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">On appeal, counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there were no meritorious grounds for appeal. Nichols filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he contends the district court erred in its determination that he satisfied the criteria for enhancement as a career offender. Additionally, Nichols contends his counsel provided ineffective assistance. The Government elected not to file a responsive brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Initially, Nichols contends the district court erred in its application of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 4B1.1 (2004). Nichols argues that he does not have the requisite number of qualifying offenses as his prior convictions were consolidated for sentencing purposes. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because Nichols\u2019s offenses occurred on different dates, involved different crimes, were separated by an intervening arrest, and charged separately, we conclude the district court appropriately characterized them as separate offenses for career offender purposes. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>187 F.3d 429, 431 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Nichols also contends that his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the court\u2019s application of USSG \u00a7 4B1.1. An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is generally not cognizable on direct appeal, but should instead be asserted in a post-conviction motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). However, we have recognized an exception to the general rule when \u201cit \u2018conclusively appears\u2019 from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir.1994)). Because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to an enhancement that was properly applied, Nichols\u2019s claim is not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Nichols\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
