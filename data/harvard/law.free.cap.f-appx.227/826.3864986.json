She contends that her sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary to achieve the [sentencing] purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d Her sentence was greater than necessary, she says, because (1) it is inconsistent with our precedent affirming as reasonable sentences at the low end of the guideline range; (2) her mitigating evidence was more compelling than the mitigating evidence in similar cases; (3) in imposing a sentence at the top of the guideline range, the district court showed that it did not weigh the relevant sentencing factors; (4) the court\u2019s finding that a sentence of 24 months was necessary so she could take part in a federal drug treatment program was misguided because she does not need further treatment. Moreover, the court could not guarantee that the Bureau of Prisons will comply with its recommendation, and even if the Bureau does, she would not be eligible for the program because of her progress in state drug-treatment programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-22\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors, which Bacon contends the district court misapplied, in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>elude: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; (2) whether the sentence is \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with ... the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Bacon suggests that the court failed to do its duty under \u00a7 3553(a) because it only considered drug treatment in fashioning her sentence. While it is true that treatment for drug addiction played a prominent part in the court\u2019s decision, the court also stated that it had considered the Guideline sentence range and all of the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors \u2014 in particular, the seriousness of her offense and the need to protect the community. After doing this, the court concluded that a sentence at the top of the Guideline sentence range, which was three years less than the statutory maximum, was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">We find no basis in the record of this case for concluding that Bacon\u2019s sentence is unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes. Bacon\u2019s sentence is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
