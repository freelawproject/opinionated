Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, Green\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel is DENIED as moot, . and his convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b861-30\">.
