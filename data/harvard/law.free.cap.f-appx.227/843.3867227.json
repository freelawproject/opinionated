James Nicholson, in his official capacity, on her claims of race, age, and sex discrimination, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623. Summary judgment was entered because Sachs filed her complaint beyond the 45-day limitation period set forth in 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(1) for exhausting an administrative grievance. Although Sachs concedes that her administrative complaint was eleven days late, she argues that she was entitled to waiver or equitable tolling due to the severity and duration of a series of hurricanes that took place during the limitation period. She also states, without any corroboration, that she attempted to contact an EEO counselor but was unable to do so. After <em>de novo </em>review, we agree with the district court that Sachs \u201cwas not prevented [for] reasons outside her control from filing a complaint during the limitations period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
