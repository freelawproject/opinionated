On March 24, 2006, the BIA upheld the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) discretionary denial of cancellation of removal, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D), and dismissed her appeal. Charles filed no petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal order in this Court. On April 21, 2006, Charles filed a motion to reconsider the removal order, arguing that the IJ had failed to consider the excessive hardship on her children that her removal would cause. On September 6, 2006, the BIA denied the motion to reconsider. Charles then filed this petition for review from the denial of her motion to reconsider. We deny the petition in part and dismiss the petition, for lack of jurisdiction, in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation omitted). We have jurisdiction over a \u201cfinal order of removal,\u201d so long as the petition for review is filed within 30 days. INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (providing that \u201cdeportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashion after issuance, irrespective of the later filing of a motion to reopen or reconsider\u201d). An order of removal becomes final upon, <em>inter alia, </em>the dismissal of an appeal by the BIA. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1(a). A petitioner\u2019s filing of a motion to reconsider does <em>not </em>toll the statutory time to petition for review. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 394, 115 S.Ct. 1537. \u201c[T]he statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 [and, therefore,] it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">Because Charles did not file her petition for review within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s March 24, 2006 decision, and because the filing of a motion to reconsider does not toll this statutory time-period, we lack jurisdiction to review the March 24, 2006 decision and therefore dismiss the petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>as it relates to that decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s September 6, 2006 order denying reconsideration, Charles has abandoned any claim of error as to that order by failing to raise any argument about it in her brief. Therefore, as to that order, the petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-17\">. As for Charles\u2019s argument concerning the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal, we likewise lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s purely discretionary decisions, both that a petitioner did not meet \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D)\u2019s hardship standard, and that a petition was not entitled to cancellation of removal under \u00a7 1229b. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1222-23 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
