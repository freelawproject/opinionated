The district court sentenced Cruz-Ochoa to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Cruz-Ochoa argues the district court erred in failing to impose a variance sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2006). For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-22\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines. However, in imposing a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[A] sentence within the proper advisory Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-25\">Cruz-Ochoa submits that he offered substantial evidence of rehabilitation following his convictions that enhanced his criminal history category, and that his sentence is. longer than necessary to comply with the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a). However, Cruz-Ochoa\u2019s sentence was within the guideline range of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>fifty-seven to seventy-one months and well within the twenty-year statutory maximum set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Because the district court appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory, and properly calculated and considered the guideline range and the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, in light of Cruz-Oehoa\u2019s mitigation arguments, we find the sentence reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.) (holding that a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
