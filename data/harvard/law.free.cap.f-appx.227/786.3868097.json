After two unsuccessful attempts to reopen her removal proceedings and the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reconsider the second motion to reopen, Kennedy appealed the IJ\u2019s order denying reconsideration to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Kennedy\u2019s motion to reopen and rescind the <em>in absentia </em>order, refusing to consider Kennedy\u2019s exceptional circumstances claim because none of Kennedy\u2019s motions were filed within the 180-day statutory period. Kennedy petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s order, urging us to adopt a doctrine of equitable tolling of the 180-day period in which to file a motion to reopen <em>in absentia </em>removal proceedings based on exceptional circumstances, and arguing that equitable tolling was warranted in her case because she did not receive notice of her hearing or file a timely motion to reopen due to ineffective assistance of counsel. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-21\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Anin v. Reno, </em>188 F.3d 1273, 1276 (11th Cir.1999).

U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>430 F.3d 1148, 1149-50 (11th Cir.2005). We determined that this provision was \u201cjurisdictional and mandatory.\u201d <em>Anin, </em>188 F.3d at 1278. We applied this reasoning in <em>Anin </em>to a motion to reopen under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7), INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the ground of ineffective assistance, which was filed after the expiration of the 90-day deadline for filing such a motion. <em>Abdi, </em>430 F.3d at 1149-50. Although we recognized that the 90-day period may be subject to equitable tolling in very limited circumstances, <em>id. </em>at 1149, we held that ineffectiveness of counsel did not qualify. We said in <em>Anin </em>that this 90-day filing period \u201cis mandatory and jurisdictional, and, therefore, it is not subject to equitable tolling. We say this because our reasoning in <em>Anin </em>is not specific to <em>in absentia </em>orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1150. Accordingly, we held that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Under <em>Anin </em>and <em>Abdi </em>we do not recognize equitable tolling based upon alleged ineffectiveness of counsel and we hold that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in declining to consider Kennedy\u2019s exceptional circumstances claim because she did not file a motion to reopen within the 180-day filing period. In light of the foregoing, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b815-15\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-15\">. Procedurally, Kennedy's appeal to the BIA was from the IJ\"s denial of her motion to reconsider her motion to reopen the <em>in absentia </em>removal order.
