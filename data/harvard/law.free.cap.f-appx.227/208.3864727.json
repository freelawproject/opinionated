Although the district court adopted the parties\u2019 position that Lawson\u2019s total adjusted offense level was eighteen, and Lawson waived her right to appeal from any sentence within or below the advisory guideline range resulting from that offense level, she contends her waiver is unenforceable because the Government breached the plea agreement. Lawson raises the issue of the Government\u2019s alleged breach for the first time on appeal. She furthermore argues the district court erred in sua sponte departing upward in her criminal history category pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number><em>Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a). We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Whether a defendant has effectively waived the right <em>to </em>appeal is an issue we review de novo. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). \u201cA party\u2019s waiver of the right to seek appellate review is not enforceable where the opposing party breaches a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Bowe, </em>257 F.3d 336, 342 (4th Cir.2001). \u201cOnce released from the bar of the appeal waiver, [the defendant] may raise any claim relating to the sentence, except a contention that first should have been presented to the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>16 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.1993). \u201cIt is settled that a defendant alleging the Government\u2019s breach of a plea agreement bears the burden of establishing that breach by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Snow, </em>234 F.3d 187, 189 (4th Cir.2000). Where a party raises the alleged breach for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>108 F.3d 64, 65-66 (4th Cir. 1997). Accordingly, Lawson must not only establish that the plea agreement was breached, but also that \u201cthe breach was \u2018so obvious and substantial that failure to notice and correct it affeet[ed] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>See id. </em>at 66 <em>&amp; </em>n. 4 (quoting <em>United States v. Fant, </em>974 F.2d 559, 565 (4th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u201c[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971). \u201cIt is well-established that the interpretation of plea agreements is rooted in contract law, and that \u2018each party should receive the benefit of its bargain.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Peglera, </em>33 F.3d 412, 413 (4th Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Ringling, </em>988 F.2d 504, 506 (4th Cir.1993)). \u201cA central tenet of contract law is that no party is obligated to provide more than is specified in the agreement itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201cthe government\u2019s duty in carrying out its obligations under a plea agreement is no greater than that of \u2018fidelity to the agreement.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Fentress, </em>792 F.2d 461, 464 (4th Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">In the plea agreement, the parties stipulated that Lawson\u2019s adjusted offense level was eighteen and that no other offense characteristics, sentencing guidelines factors, potential departures, or adjustments would be raised or were in dispute. However, Lawson acknowledged there was no agreement as to her criminal history category, and the court was not bound by the stipulation but would consider it along with the presentence report and any other relevant information. Finally, the Government \u201cexpressly agree[d] to seek a sentence within the advisory guideline range determined to be applicable by the Court.\u201d Prior to the district court\u2019s departure, Lawson\u2019s advisory guideline range was thirty-three to forty-one months. After the departure, the range was forty-one to fifty-one months.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">We have reviewed the record and conclude the Government did not breach the plea agreement. The Government expressly sought a sentence of forty-one months, the high end of Lawson\u2019s advisory guideline range prior to the district court\u2019s departure. Moreover, the Government did not raise any potential departures and expressly agreed with Lawson that it was prohibited from requesting one. Nevertheless, Lawson contends the Government\u2019s response to the district court\u2019s direction to address the upward departure issue raised by the court amounted to an implicit argument for the departure and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>violation of its obligations under the agreement. We disagree. The Government fulfilled its promises under the plea agreement, and its statements were consistent with its recommended sentence at the high end of Lawson\u2019s initial guideline range. Finally, although Lawson expressly informed the district court that the parties were bound by their agreement not to argue for any departures, she never objected that the Government\u2019s argument was in breach of the agreement. Even if Lawson could establish an implicit breach, she cannot show it was so obvious and substantial that a failure to notice and correct it affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Accordingly, we dismiss Lawson\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
