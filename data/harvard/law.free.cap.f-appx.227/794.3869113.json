In his petition, Harden argues that the sentencing court erred when it imposed a sentence greater than 20 years of imprisonment because the indictment faded to specify a drug quantity. The district court dismissed Harden\u2019s section 2241 petition with prejudice because Harden faded to qualify for the savings clause provision of section 2255. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>We review the denial of habeas relief <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cTypically, a petitioner collaterally attacks the validity of his federal sentence by filing a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Under the savings clause of [section] 2255, a prisoner may file a [section] 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under [section] 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he only sentencing claims that may conceivably be covered by the savings clause are those based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturning circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The district court correctly dismissed Harden\u2019s section 2241 petition because Harden\u2019s claim is not based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision. Harden argues that his sentence is fundamentally defective in the light of the decision in <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002), and that <em>Cotton </em>is retroactively applicable, but this argument fails. <em>Cotton </em>did not establish an avenue of relief but explained the standard of review to be applied on appeal to an objection under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that was not preserved in the district court. Harden\u2019s sentencing argument is actually based on <em>Apprendi, </em>which is not a retroactively applicable decision. <em>See McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1258 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The dismissal of Harden\u2019s petition under section 2241 is</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
