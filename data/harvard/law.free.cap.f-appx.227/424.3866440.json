Cartwright, </em>6 F.3d 294 (5th Cir.1993), and <em>United States v. Gamez-Gonzalez, </em>319 F.3d 695, 699-700 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">As a general rule, we decline to review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal, although we may do so in exceptional cases. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir. 1987). Although King asserts that this court may review his ineffective-assistance claim because trial counsel\u2019s strategy and knowledge of the applicable law are ascertainable from the record, review of King\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim at this juncture would require this court \u201cto speculate as to the reasons for [counsel\u2019s] alleged acts and omissions.\u201d <em>United States v. Kizzee, </em>150 F.3d 497, 502-03 (5th Cir.1998) (quotation at 503). Accordingly, we decline to review King\u2019s ineffective assistance claim in this direct appeal. The judgment of the district court is affirmed without prejudice to King\u2019s right to raise an ineffective-assistance claim in a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We express no view on the merits of such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
