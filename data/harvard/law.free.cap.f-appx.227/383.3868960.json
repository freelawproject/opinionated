He argues that his 151-month and consecutive 60-month sentence was unreasonable and unjust for an offense of this type, character, and seriousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Because Powell\u2019s sentence was within a properly calculated guideline range of 151 to 188 months, we infer that the district court considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). \u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Powell has failed to demonstrate that his properly calculated guidelines sentence was unreasonable. <em>See id.; Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
