He argues that the evidence was insufficient to show: (1) that he was the individual who pawned the two firearms that are the subject of this charge; and (2) that the two rifles in question were \u201cfirearms\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-24\">This court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence <em>de novo, </em>to determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any reasonable juror could have concluded that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>doubt. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>187 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.1999). To hold that the testimony of a government witness is incredible as a matter of law, we must find that the testimony is \u201cunbelievable on its face,\u201d meaning that the facts to which the witness testified \u201cphysically could not have possibly [been] observed\u201d or were \u201cevents that could not have occurred under the laws of nature.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>775 F.2d 1559, 1561 (11th Cir.1985) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In order to convict Burrell of being a felon in possession of a firearm, the jury must have found three elements: \u201c(1) that [he] was a convicted felon, (2) that [he] was in knowing possession of a firearm, and (3) that the firearm was in or affecting interstate commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Deleveaux, </em>205 F.3d 1292, 1297 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cFor purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1), a firearm is defined to include any weapon which will or is designed to or may be readily converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>137 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.1998). The government need not show that the firearm is operable to sustain a conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Because the evidence included, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) testimony from a pawn shop employee, who identified Burrell as the individual who pawned two firearms; (2) surveillance video of Burrell pawning the firearms; (3) pawn documents containing Burrell\u2019s signature; and (4) expert testimony stating that the items that Burrell pawned were firearms, the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to convict Burrell. Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
