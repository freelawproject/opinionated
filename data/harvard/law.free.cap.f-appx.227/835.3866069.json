He argues that he pled guilty only to a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), for which the maximum penalty is two years imprisonment, but the district court sentenced him as if he had been convicted under U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), for which the maximum penalty is ten years. He concedes that the Supreme Court held in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that the government need not allege a defendant\u2019s prior felony conviction in the indictment in order for the district court to impose an \u201cenhanced\u201d sentence under \u00a7 1326(b) because the pri- or felony is not an element of the offense. However, he argues that, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which struck down a similar sentencing enhancement provision in a New Jersey statute, we should hold that the enhancement provision in \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional and reverse his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">Because Calix-Matute objected in the district court to the government\u2019s failure to allege his prior conviction in the indictment as a violation of <em>Apprendi, </em>we review his claim <em>de novo. United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2001). Section 1326(a) establishes a two-year maximum sentence for aliens who illegally attempt to re-enter the United States after being deported. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(1), however, if an alien\u2019s initial deportation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>subsequent to a conviction for a felony, the statutory maximum increases to ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The Supreme Court established in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the context of the \u00a7 1326(b) increased-penalty provision is merely a sentencing factor that does not have to be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 523 U.S. at 243-45, 118 S.Ct. at 1225, 1231-32. The Court later held in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The Supreme Court also stated that \u201cwe need not revisit <em>[Almendarez-Torres] </em>for purposes of our decision today to treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rule.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">After <em>Apprendi </em>was issued, we considered its effect on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and whether the government now needs to allege a defendant\u2019s prior conviction in the indictment in order for the court to sentence him under the increased maximum penalty provision of \u00a7 1362(b)(2). <em>United States v. Guadamuz-Solis, </em>232 F.3d 1363, 1363 (11th Cir.2000). In <em>Guadamuz-Solis, </em>we held that <em>\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Because the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent, we affirm Calix-Matute\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
