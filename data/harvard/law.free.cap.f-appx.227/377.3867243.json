He argues that the district court\u2019s determination of the amount of crack cocaine attributed to him was clearly erroneous because it was not based on information having a sufficient indicia of reliability as required under the Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that the prior statements made by his supplier, Roderick Porter, to the probation office and Porter\u2019s testimony at the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>hearing were \u201cso inconsistent, contradictory and potentially self-serving, that they should have been totally discounted by the district court\u201d in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The district court\u2019s calculation of the quantity of drugs involved in an offense is a factual determination that is entitled to considerable deference and will be reversed only if clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 246 (5th Cir.2005). A factual finding is not clearly erroneous if it is plausible in light of the record as a whole. <em>Id. </em>In making the finding of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, the district court may consider any information that has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy. <em>Id. </em>at 247; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Brooks himself acknowledges that Porter\u2019s statements regarding the 125-gram amounts he sold to him were consistent throughout. Moreover, his arguments in support of his assertion that the statements were nevertheless unreliable are without merit. Porter\u2019s testimony regarding other amounts of crack cocaine that he sold to Brooks was not proven to be untrue, and any inconsistencies were not material to the district court\u2019s ultimate determination of the amount of crack cocaine that Brooks purchased from Porter. The district court was within its province in making a determination that Porter was credible with respect to the amounts supporting a base offense level of 38. <em>See United States v. Ocana, </em>204 F.3d 585, 593 (5th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Sotelo, </em>97 F.3d 782, 799 (5th Cir.1996). The district court did not clearly err in determining the amount of crack cocaine attributable to Brooks. <em>See Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Further, Brooks has not shown reversible error in the district court\u2019s failure to resolve the alleged inconsistencies in that portion of Porter\u2019s testimony which had no effect on the determination that Brooks\u2019s base offense level was 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b405-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
