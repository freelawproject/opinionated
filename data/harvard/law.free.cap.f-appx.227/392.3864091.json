Academy filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Nassar faded to respond. Relying on the allegations in Nassar\u2019s complaint, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Academy on the sex discrimination claim because Nassar failed to make out her prima facie case, and on the retaliation claim because Nassar failed to offer any evidence to indicate that Academy\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory reason for terminating her was pretextual. Additionally, the district court dismissed Nassar\u2019s \u00a7 1981 complaint for failure to allege racial discrimination. After careful review of the record, we affirm the district court for essentially the reasons set forth in its thorough and well-reasoned opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b420-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
