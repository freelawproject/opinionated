Arredondo-Rodr\u00edguez argues that his sentence \u201cis contrary to <em>[United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] and unreasonable as a matter of law.\u201d He contends that this court\u2019s <em>post-Booker </em>decisions have effectively reinstated the mandatory guideline scheme condemned by <em>Booker </em>and further argues that, post <em>-Booker, </em>a district court in imposing sentence should be allowed to disagree with policy decisions of the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-24\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>appellate courts are to review sentences for reasonableness. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261-63, 125 S.Ct. 738; <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cIf the sentencing judge exercises her discretion to impose a sentence within a properly calculated Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>line range, in our reasonableness review we will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519. \u201cGiven the deference due the sentencing judge\u2019s discretion under <em>[Booker </em>], it will be rare for a reviewing court to say such a sentence is \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Arredondo-Rodr\u00edguez identifies no error in the guidelines calculations, and he was sentenced at the low end of the applicable guidelines range. We conclude that Arredondo-Rodriguez\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Arredondo-Rodriguez\u2019s constitutional challenge to \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Arredondo-Rodr\u00edguez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Arredondo-Rodr\u00edguez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
