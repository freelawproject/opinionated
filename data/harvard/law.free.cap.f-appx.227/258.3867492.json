The district court sentenced DiazRueda to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment and two years of supervised release.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Diaz-Rueda\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the district court erred in penalizing Diaz-Rueda three times for the same conviction. Specifically, he notes that DiazRueda was convicted of the cocaine trafficking offense which formed the basis for his deportation, then he was assessed a sixteen-level increase to his base offense level based on the same conviction, and also received three criminal history points for the same conviction, resulting in an increase to his criminal history category from III to IV. Diaz-Rueda was given an opportunity to file a <em>pro se </em>brief, but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">In reviewing Diaz-Rueda\u2019s issue on appeal, we find no error. As we have held before, a district court properly may use a prior conviction to enhance the offense level and the criminal history category. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>18 F.3d 1173, 1180-81 (4th Cir.1994). Moreover, the district court properly \u201cconsult[ed the] Guidelines and [took] them into account when sentencing,\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 767, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), it. made all the factual findings appropriate for that determination, considered the sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006), and imposed a sentence that was \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456-57 (4th Cir.2006) (finding a sentence within a properly calculated advisory range to be presumptively reasonable). Given these facts, we find to be reasonable the district court\u2019s sentence at the low end of a properly calculated advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Diaz-Rueda\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ther review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-11\"> The probation officer calculated an advisory sentencing guideline range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment founded on an offense level of twenty-one and a criminal history category of IV, after a sixteen-level increase to Diaz-Rueda\u2019s base offense level of eight, pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>(\"USSG\") \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(2)(A)(I) (2004), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USSG \u00a7\u00a7 3E1.1(a), (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
