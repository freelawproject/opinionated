For the following reasons, we affirm with regard to both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AGf\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">In connection with its greeting cards business, appellant Renaissance Greeting Cards, Inc. (\u201cRGC\u201d), owns three registered trademarks containing the. words \u201cRenaissance\u201d and \u201cRenaissance Greeting Cards.\u201d Although the marks were registered in 1992, 1996, and 2003, respectively, at least one of these marks has been in continuous use by RGC or its predecessors since 1977. The parties do not dispute that RGC\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark is incontestible pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1065 and 1115(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">Although RGC operates one retail outlet store in Maine, the vast majority of RGC\u2019s sales are made on a wholesale basis to assorted retailers and to florists affiliated with RGC\u2019s parent company, Florists\u2019 Transworld Delivery, Inc. (\u201cFTD\u201d). Not surprisingly, RGC\u2019s advertising expenditures, which have averaged $358,000.00 in recent years, are targeted mostly at these wholesale customers. With recent annual sales averaging twelve million dollars, RGC claims approximately 0.2% of the greeting cards market. Although RGC\u2019s products at one time included a line of gift bags, gift wrap, bows, and ribbon, RGC abandoned this line in 1990, and has since confined itself to the sale of greeting cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">Appellee Dollar Tree Stores, Inc. (\u201cDTS\u201d), owns and operates approximately 2,800 discount retail stores nationwide, with recent annual sales totaling in excess of $3 billion. Since 1993, DTS has sold a line of gift bags bearing a \u201cRenaissance\u201d or \u201cRenaissance Gift. Bags\u201d mark. In 2002, it expanded this line to incl\u00fcde gift wrap, boxes, bows, ribbon, and tissue paper. DTS estimates that it has sold somewhere between 250 million and 500 million units of these products since 1995. DTS also sells a line of greeting cards, but these cards, which are produced by American Greetings Corporation, are sold under the trademark \u201cTender Thoughts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">At the time it selected its \u201cRenaissance\u201d marks, DTS was unaware of RGC\u2019s trademarks. Indeed, DTS did not conduct a trademark search or consult counsel with regard to its use of the mark until 2003, when it discovered that the \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark was widely used by many companies. As a result of this discovery, DTS eventu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>ally began marketing its line of gift products under the mark \u201cVoila.\u201d The older \u201cRenaissance\u201d gift bags, .however, remained available for purchase in some of DTS\u2019s stores as late as July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">When RGC discovered DTS\u2019s use of the mark in 2003, it sent a letter to Betta Products, Inc., the company it believed to have produced the bags. Betta Products directed RGC to DTS, and in December 2003, counsel for RGC sent a letter to DTS seeking to discuss the issue. When this and two subsequent letters produced no response, RGC filed suit on March 29, 2005, alleging (I) infringement of a federally registered trademark under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1); (ii) trademark infringement and a false designation of origin under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a); and (iii) common law infringement and unfair competition under Virginia state law. On December 19, 2005, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of DTS, the parties having previously agreed to a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">RGC filed a timely notice of appeal with regard to two issues: (1) the. district court\u2019s determination that no likelihood of confusion existed between RGC\u2019s and DTS\u2019s marks; and (2) the district court\u2019s decision to strike portions of the complaint and to preclude certain discovery pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 408. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legal determinations made by a district court in granting summary judgment. <em>See Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon v. Alpha of Va., Inc., </em>43 F.3d 922, 928 (4th Cir.1995). A district court\u2019s likelihood of confusion inquiry, however, necessarily involves factual determinations. <em>Int\u2019l Bancorp, LLC v. Societe des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers a Monaco, </em>329 F.3d 359, 362 (4th Cir.2003). Where, as here, the court is to be the ultimate finder of fact, the entire record is before the court at the summary judgment stage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and only the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts \u2014 as opposed to the facts, themselves \u2014 are in dispute, a court may properly proceed to final judgment. <em>See Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b269-12\">It makes little sense to forbid the judge from drawing inferences from the evidence submitted on summary judgment when that same judge will act as the trier of fact, unless those inferences involve issues of witness credibility or disputed material facts. If a trial on the merits will not enhance the court\u2019s ability to draw inferences and conclusions, then a district judge properly should draw his inferences without resort to the expense of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b269-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 362 (quoting <em>Matter of Placid Oil Co., </em>932 F.2d 394, 398 (5th Cir.1991)(internal quotations and citations omitted)). In such circumstances, we review the district court\u2019s findings for clear error. <em>Int\u2019l Bancorp, </em>329 F.3d at 362; <em>see also Petro Stopping Centers, L.P. v. James River Petroleum, Inc., </em>130 F.3d 88, 91-92 (4th Cir. 1997)(\u201cThis circuit reviews district court determinations regarding likelihood of confusion under a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d). Under this standard, the district court\u2019s findings may not be disturbed unless there is no evidence in the record to support them, or when, having reviewed the record ourselves, \u201cwe are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Petro Stopping, </em>130 F.3d at 92. In no case, however, will this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>standard permit a district court\u2019s decision to stand where the court incorrectly applied the law. <em>Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, </em>747 F.2d 1522, 1526 (4th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Actions for trademark infringement require proof of two elements: (1) that the plaintiff has a valid mark, and (2) that the similarity of the defendant\u2019s mark to the plaintiffs creates a \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d in the marketplace. <em>See Perini Corp. v. Perini Constr., Inc., </em>915 F.2d 121, 124 (4th Cir.1990); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114(1). Because the parties do not dispute that RGC\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark is incontestible pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1065 and 1115(b), the district court properly limited its inquiry to the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d element.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Courts consider seven factors in evaluating whether a competing mark creates a likelihood of confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-7\">1) The strength or distinctiveness of the mark;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-8\">2) The similarity of the two marks;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-9\">3) The similarity of the goods or services the marks identify;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-10\">4) The similarity of the facilities the two parties use in their businesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">5) The similarity of the advertising used by the two parties;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-12\">6) The defendant\u2019s intent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\">7) Actual confusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-14\"><em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1527. These factors will not be of equal relevance in every case. <em>Lone Star, </em>43 F.3d at 933. Indeed, \u201c[c]ertain factors may not be germane to every situation,\u201d and certain factors other than those listed above may be relevant to the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis in certain cases. <em>Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., </em>81 F.3d 455, 463 (4th Cir.1996). RGC contends that the district court misapplied these factors in certain respects to such an extent that it committed legal error. We will consider each element in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-20\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-21\">RGC contends that the district court improperly weighed the strength of the \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark, and that it placed too much emphasis on the \u201cstrength of the mark\u201d element in analyzing the likelihood of confusion. The district court began its evaluation of the mark\u2019s strength by noting our statement in <em>Pizzeria Uno </em>that the \u201cfirst and paramount factor under this set of factors is the distinctiveness or strength of the two marks.\u201d <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1527. It then proceeded to apply the two-factor test set forth in <em>CareFirst of Md., Inc. v. First Care, P.C., </em>434 F.3d 263 (4th Cir.2006). Under that test, the court considers (1) the conceptual strength of the mark, and (2) the commercial strength of the mark. <em>Id. </em>at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-22\">A mark\u2019s conceptual strength is determined in part by its placement into one of four categories of distinctiveness: (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, and (4) arbitrary or fanciful. <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1527. Suggestive and arbitrary marks are deemed strong and presumptively valid, whereas generic and descriptive marks are deemed weak, and require proof of secondary meaning within the market in order to receive trademark protection. <em>Id. </em>After considerable analysis, the district court concluded that RGC\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark is suggestive, because it \u201cdoes not describe any particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>lar characteristic of RGC\u2019s greeting cards, but \u2018requires some imagination to connect it with the goods.\u2019 \u201d (J.A. at 353) (quoting <em>Retail Servs., Inc. v. Freebies Publ\u2019g, </em>364 F.3d 535, 539 (4th Cir.2004).)</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">This categorization does not end a court\u2019s evaluation of a mark\u2019s conceptual strength, however. A court must also consider other registrations of the mark, because \u201cthe strength of a commonly-used mark decreases as the number of third-party registrations increases.\u201d <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1531. The district court therefore considered evidence of 465 federal and 203 state trademark registrations or pending applications, all for marks using the word \u201cRenaissance.\u201d (J.A. at 358.) It then specifically considered evidence that twenty-three of these registrations, including RGC\u2019s, are for marks that fall in the same class of paper products as RGC\u2019s, PTO International Class 16.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 358, 344.) As a result, the court concluded that this widespread usage of the word \u201cRenaissance\u201d in other trademarks significantly diminished any distinctiveness inherent in RGC\u2019s marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Citing <em>CareFirst, </em>RGC asserts that the district court erred in considering evidence that \u201cRenaissance\u201d is used in products outside RGC\u2019s class of paper goods. <em>Care-First </em>does not support such an argument. In that case, we explained that \u201cthe frequency of prior use of [a mark\u2019s text] in other marks, particularly in the same field of merchandise or service,\u2019 illustrates the mark\u2019s lack of conceptual strength.\u201d <em>CareFirst, </em>434 F.3d at 270 (quoting <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1530-31). Because in that case there was ample use <em>of </em>\u201cCare-First\u201d and similar marks in the health care industry alone, it was unnecessary to consider use of the mark in unrelated industries. As the above passage makes clear, however, evidence of third-party use of a mark in unrelated markets \u2014 although not as persuasive as use within the same product class \u2014 indicates a mark\u2019s lack of conceptual strength.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">The second step in the \u201cstrength of the mark\u201d analysis is to consider the mark\u2019s commercial-strength, a concept similar to the \u201csecondary meaning\u201d inquiry considered in evaluating a mark\u2019s validity. <em>Care-First, 434 F.3d </em>at 269 n. 3. While third-party use of the mark is relevant at this stage, as well, the court also considers a number of other factors, such as advertising expenditures, consumer awareness of the source of the. mark, market share, and unsolicited media coverage. <em>See Perini, </em>915 F.2d at 125. The district court faithfully considered these and other factors, noting RGC\u2019s market share of less than one percent of the greeting cards market, its average annual advertising expenditures of less than $360,000.00, and the lack of both independent media coverage of the business and survey evidence indicating an association between RGC\u2019s mark and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>product. (J.A. at 361.) Because of the ample evidence supporting the district court\u2019s decision on this point, we find no error in the court\u2019s conclusion that RGC possesses a weak mark \u201csuch that its ability to identify the source of products does not extend beyond the greeting card market.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 361-62.) <em>See Arrow Fastener Co., Inc. v. Stanley Works, 59 </em>F.3d 384, 394 (2d Cir.1995).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The second factor to be considered in the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis is the similarity of the marks in question. In order for this factor to weigh in favor of the plaintiff, the marks need not be identical; rather, they must only be \u201csufficiently similar in appearance, with greater weight given to the dominant or salient portions of the marks.\u201d <em>Lone Star, </em>43 F.3d at 936. For purposes of summary judgment, the district court assumed the marks to be similar in appearance. This factor thus weighs in favor of a finding of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Next, the court considers the similarity of the goods or services identified by the marks. With regard to this element, the products in question need not be identical or in direct competition with each other. Because confusion may arise even where products are merely \u201crelated,\u201d the court is to consider \u201cwhether the public is likely to attribute the products and services to a single source.\u201d <em>CAE, Inc. v. Clean Air Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>267 F.3d 660, 679 (7th Cir.2001). An important function of this \u201crelated goods\u201d concept is to protect trademark owners\u2019 ability to expand into associated markets in the future. <em>Id. </em>at 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">After considering the manner in which greeting cards and gift products are marketed in the industry, and the fact that RGC at one time marketed its own line of gift products, the district court concluded that the parties\u2019 products constituted related goods. The court then properly observed that, although the fact that goods are related weighs in favor of a finding of infringement, the similarity of the goods, alone, is not dispositive as to the likelihood of confusion. (J.A. at 364-65) (citing <em>Arrow Distilleries, Inc. v. Globe Brewing Co., </em>117 F.2d 347, 351 (4th Cir.1941); <em>Petro Stopping, </em>130 F.3d at 95; 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, <em>McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 24:62 (4th ed. 2006).)</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">The fourth factor to be considered in the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis is the similarity of the facilities used by the parties in their businesses. As McCarthy explains, the court is to consider the class of consumers purchasing the products, and the context in which they make their purchases. McCarthy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 24:51. Although noting that DTS\u2019s products were most likely to be purchased by \u201cvalue-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>conscious consumers,\u201d the district court concluded that the placement of the products within the stores and their general retail availability were sufficient to tilt this factor \u201cvery modestly\u201d in favor of a finding of infringement. (J.A. at 365-66.) We see no error in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We next consider the similarity of the advertising employed by the parties. It is undisputed that DTS does not advertise its greeting cards line in any way. Moreover, although RGC does engage in some limited advertising, its efforts are targeted almost entirely at its wholesale customer base. RGC contends that the district court erred in interpreting this factor as militating against infringement, rather than assigning it neutral effect. (Brief of Appellant at 54) (citing <em>Carnival Brand Seafood Co. v. Carnival Brands, Inc., </em>187 F.3d 1307, 1314 (11th Cir.1999).) The district court\u2019s holding on this point was supported by sound authority; however, and we find no error. <em>See IDV N. Am., Inc. v. S &amp; M Brands, Inc., 26 </em>F.Supp.2d 815, 828-29 (E.D.Va.1998)(citing <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1527; <em>Petro Stopping, </em>130 F.3d at 95).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">6.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">The sixth factor to be considered is the defendant\u2019s intent in adopting its mark.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>\u201c[i]f there is intent to confuse the buying public, this is strong evidence establishing likelihood of confusion, since one intending to profit from another\u2019s reputation generally attempts to make his signs, advertisements, etc., to resemble the other\u2019s so as deliberately to induce confusion.\u201d <em>Pizzeria Uno, </em>747 F.2d at 1535.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">RGC contends that DTS exhibited bad faith by failing to conduct a trademark search or to obtain advice of counsel before adopting the \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark for use on its gift products, and by continuing to use the mark after being contacted by RGC. RGC\u2019s first argument necessarily fails, because, as the district court reasoned, \u201c[a]t most, the failure to conduct a search is probative of Dollar Tre\u00e9\u2019s carelessness, which even if true, has little bearing on the likelihood that its allegedly infringing mark will confuse the public.\u201d (J.A. at 367 (citing McCarthy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23:109).) Moreover, DTS was justified in continuing its use of the \u201cRenaissance\u201d mark if, as the district court concluded, DTS believed RGC\u2019s mark to be too weak to prevent DTS\u2019s use of the mark on its gift products. <em>See </em>McCarthy, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 23:120. Accordingly, the district court committed no error in concluding that the intent factor militated against a finding of infringement.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">7.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-14\">Finally, the \u201clikelihood of confusion\u201d analysis requires consideration of instances of actual confusion among consumers. RGC produced evidence of four instances of confusion, one involving a shop owner, two involving shop managers, and one involving an independent sales representative. The district court found that this small number of cases, none of which demonstrated confusion among the actual consumer public, weighed against RGC\u2019s position, rather than in favor. In so holding, the district court took into account the large volume of sales from which RGC\u2019s instances of confusion were taken, as well as RGC\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to uncover additional examples of actual confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The court also appropriately considered our statement in <em>Petro Stopping </em>that, \u201c[a]t worst, [a] company\u2019s failure to uncover more than a few instances of actual confusion creates a \u2018presumption against likelihood of confusion in the future.\u2019\u201d <em>Petro Stopping, </em>130 F.3d at 95 (quoting <em>Amsta/r Corp. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 252, 263 (5th Cir.1980)). In <em>Petro Stopping, </em>we determined that the appellant\u2019s evidence of actual confusion, consisting of only a few instances out of more than $2 billion in sales, was \u201cat best <em>de minimis. \u201d Petro Stopping, </em>130 F.3d at 95. We see no error in the district court reaching the same conclusion in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Having determined that the district court committed no clear error in assessing each of the <em>Pizzeria Uno </em>factors, we turn to RGC\u2019s contention that the court erred in weighing these factors against each other. Specifically, appellant argues that the court placed excessive significance on the strength of the mark. This argument is similarly unavailing. As previously noted, these factors will be of varying relevance in every case. <em>Lone Star, </em>43 F.3d at 933. Nonetheless, where only three of the seven <em>Pizzeria Uno </em>factors weighed in favor of a finding of likelihood of confusion, we are unable to conclude that the district court committed clear error in finding no infringement. Ample evidence supported the court\u2019s decision, and we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The second issue RGC raises on appeal is the district court\u2019s exclusion, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 408, of evidence relating the parties\u2019 settlement negotiations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the district court ordered such content stricken from two paragraphs of RGC\u2019s original complaint, and subsequently upheld a protective- order entered by the magistrate judge precluding witness testimony on the issue. We review both decisions for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Seay v. TVA, </em>339 F.3d 454, 480 (6th Cir.2003)(\u2018We review the decision to grant or deny a motion to strike for an abuse of discretion, and decisions that are reasonable, that is, not arbitrary, will not be overturned.\u201d); <em>Neighbors of Cuddy Mountain v. Alexander, </em>303 F.3d 1059, 1070 (9th Cir.2002)(reviewing ruling on motion to strike under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(f) for abuse of discretion); <em>Stanbury Law Firm, P.A. v. IRS, </em>221 F.3d 1059, 1063 (8th Cir.2000)(same); <em>M &amp; M Med. Supplies &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Pleasant Valley Hosp., Inc., </em>981 F.2d 160, 163 (4th Cir.1992)(protective order entered under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) reviewable for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">Paragraphs 16 and 17 of RGC\u2019s original complaint detailed certain communications between the parties\u2019 attorneys made during settlement negotiations. (J.A. at 14.) In its answer to the complaint, DTS moved to strike these paragraphs pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 408, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">Evidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount. Evidence of conduct or state-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>merits made in compromise negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is presented in the course of compromise negotiations. This rule also does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness, negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Fed.R.Evid. 408. RGC contended that the passages, which included statements by counsel for DTS as to how many units of the \u201cRenaissance\u201d gift products remained in stock, were admissible as an exception to Rule 408 to show bad faith or willfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The court took up the issue at a motions hearing on June 3, 2005, discussing the matter at length. The transcript of that hearing makes evident that the court was aware of the law governing motions to strike under Rule 12(f), and that such motions are to be granted infrequently. (J.A. at 92.) <em>See Stanbury, </em>221 F.3d at 1063. It is equally clear that the court felt RGC\u2019s proffered exceptions to Rule 408 were impermissible under the rule, and that it did not consider the disputed information to be probative. As a result, the district court granted the motion to strike in part and directed RGC to file an amended complaint. In doing so, however, the court narrowly tailored the portions of Paragraphs 16 and 17 to be excluded, and assured counsel for RGC that it would reconsider the matter if an exception to Rule 408 were later revealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">RGC made its argument on the basis of rather weak authority. It was able to cite no cases from this circuit in support of its position. Furthermore, one of its chief cases, <em>Itron, Inc. v. Benghiat, </em>No. 99-501, 2003 WL 22037710, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 15039 (D.Minn. Aug. 29, 2003), is an unpublished district court opinion from the District of Minnesota, and is therefore of questionable precedential value. Another case on which it relies actually militates against admission of the disputed paragraphs. Ste<em>rn\u2019s Miracle-Gro Prods., Inc. v. Shark Prods., Inc., </em>823 F.Supp. 1077 (S.D.N.Y.1993). In <em>Stem\u2019s, </em>the corut considered statements made during settlement negotiations for purposes of showing the defendant\u2019s intent. The <em>Stem\u2019s </em>court only considered statements made by the plaintiff, however, and only to the extent they proved notice of the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the defendant\u2019s mark. <em>Id. </em>at 1088 n. 6 (adding that statements made during settlement negotiations are clearly inadmissible under Rule 408 where they may be considered admissions as to the merits of the action). Similarly, the district court here informed RGC that it would consider statements made by RGC to DTS. (J.A. at 94-96.) Because the district court\u2019s ruling on this point was reasonable and not overreaching, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The protective order arose from a notice of deposition issued by RGC that included a demand for the production of a witness to testify to \u201call factual representations made to plaintiff\u2019s counsel during negotiations with defendant\u2019s counsel in 2004 involving the mark RENAISSANCE....\u201d (J.A. at 189.) Upon motion by DTS, the magistrate judge to whom the motion was referred concluded that, although evidence of settlement negotiations may be discoverable under some circumstances, RGC had not shown why the settlement negotiations were relevant to its \u201cclaims or defenses.\u201d (J.A. at 184.) Moreover, the magistrate judge observed that RGC did not say what fact it wished to discover through inquiry about the negotiations. <em>(Id.) </em>When RGC objected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the magistrate judge\u2019s order, the district court considered the issue at a subsequent motions hearing. Concluding, as it had at the prior hearing on DTS\u2019s motion to strike, that the disputed information was not probative and did not meet an exception to Rule 408, the district court overruled RGC\u2019s objections to the order. The district court\u2019s decision in this regard was supported by sound policy considerations. <em>See Fiberglass Insulators, Inc. v. Dupuy, </em>856 F.2d 652, 654 (4th Cir.1988)(\u201cThe public policy of favoring and encouraging settlement makes necessary the inadmissibility of settlement negotiations in order to foster frank discussions.\u201d). Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s rulings with regard to Federal Rule of Evidence 408, and its grant of summary judgment to Dollar Tree Stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">. \"The Court: \u2018All right.

Because the \"likelihood of confusion\u201d test governs not only suits under the Lanham Act, but also Virginia common law actions for infringement and unfair competition, we analyze appellant\u2019s causes of action simultaneously. <em>Lamparello v.

RGC further argues that the district court ought not to have discounted its attempts to police the use of its mark by third-parties. The district court's opinion makes evident that it gave due consideration to RGC\u2019s efforts in this regard, but was unimpressed with the \"mixed results\u201d RGC achieved. (J.A. at 359 n. 15.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b272-8\">. On November 30, 2006, the day this matter was argued, this court issued its opinion in another trademark dispute, <em>Synergistic Int'l, LLC v. Korman, </em>470 F.3d 162 (4th Cir.2006). Although RGC argues that <em>Synergistic </em>supports its position with regard to consideration of third-party registrations of a mark in unrelated industries, we must conclude otherwise. In <em>Synergistic, </em>we concluded that the appellant\u2019s mark was conceptually strong based in part on the fact that the mark\u2019s dominant word, although commonly used in other industries, was not commonly used in the appellant\u2019s industry or related industries. <em>Id. </em>at 174. By contrast, \"Renaissance\u201d is used not only by hundreds of businesses in industries unrelated to RGC's, but also by numerous businesses within RGC\u2019s PTO class of products. Furthermore, the appellant's mark in <em>Synergistic </em>was found to be commercially strong. As described above, that is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b273-10\">. To the extent appellant argues that the district court\u2019s decision to strike portions of the complaint and to preclude certain discovery are relevant to this factor, the court notes that the district court\u2019s ruling on those points is affirmed in Section III helow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b274-8\">. After a review of the record, we believe RGC made clear to the district court that it wished to introduce the disputed evidence to show DTS's intent for purposes of the \"likelihood of confusion\u201d analysis. We are thus unpersuaded by DTS's argument that RGC waived this issue below. (See Brief of Appellee at 32-34.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
