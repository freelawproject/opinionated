Lazo contends her sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765-66, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>Post-Booker, </em>we have established a two-part process for district courts to use in fashioning sentences. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). First, the court must consult and correctly determine the sentence range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Here, the district court correctly calculated Lazo\u2019s Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Second, the court must fashion a reasonable sentence by considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>Included among the factors are (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (4) the need for deterrence; (5) the need to protect the public; (6) the Sentencing Guidelines range; and (7) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Lazo\u2019s 41-month sentence is at the bottom of the Guidelines range. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 787-88 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting the notion that a sentence within the Guidelines is <em>per se </em>reasonable, but acknowledging \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, [we] ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d). In fashioning this sentence, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and specifically referenced several of them. Although the district court acknowledged Lazo returned to the United States to see her children and that reentering the United States is not as serious an offense as others, the court also acknowledged the seriousness of Lazo\u2019s criminal history of drug trafficking and her disrespect for the law by failing to appear for deportation. While Lazo argues her sentence is unreasonable in light of her relationship with her daughters, the Sentencing Guidelines policy statement provides that a defendant\u2019s \u201cfamily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure may be warranted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.6. A policy statement issued by the Sentencing Commission is one of the 3553(a) factors the district court must consider. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-14\">Additionally, Lazo\u2019s argument that the maximum allowable sentence is set by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and may be below the Guidelines range fails. The \u201cparsimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>provision\u201d provides a sentence shall be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [3553(a)(2) ].\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). However, the maximum allowable sentence is the sentence established by the corresponding criminal statute. <em>See United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1303 (11th Cir.2005). Lazo\u2019s sentence is well under the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). It cannot be said that the district court fashioned a sentence that is greater than necessary to comply with the purpose of \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">The district court correctly calculated Lazo\u2019s Guidelines range, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and arrived at a sentence at the low-end of the advisory Guidelines range. We conclude that Lazo\u2019s sentence is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
