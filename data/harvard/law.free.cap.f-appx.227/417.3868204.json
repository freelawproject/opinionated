He objects to the 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement based on his prior conviction for aggravated battery with a firearm under Florida Statute Annotated \u00a7 784.045(1)(a). After Hernandez filed his appeal, we held that the relevant offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>qualifies as crime of violence under the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cbecause it has as an element at least a threatened use of force.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez, </em>479 F.3d 345, 347-49 (5th Cir.2007); <em>see </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), comment, (n. 1(B)(iii)). The enhancement of Hernandez\u2019s sentence was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Hernandez further asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) cause the statute to be unconstitutional. This argument is foreclosed under <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We repeatedly have rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Hernandez properly concedes that this argument is foreclosed and that he raises it only to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
