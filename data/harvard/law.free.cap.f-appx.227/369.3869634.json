Sudeen contends that the district court reversibly erred by imposing a guidelines sentence without independently determining that the sentencing range was reasonable and without considering all of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The record reflects that the district court implicitly considered the statutory sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). Sudeen has not shown that the sentence was unreasonable or that we should not defer to the district court\u2019s determinations at sentencing. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
