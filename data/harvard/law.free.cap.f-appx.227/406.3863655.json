Martinez was sentenced to a 40-month term of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">Martinez argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) for a drug trafficking offense based on his prior California cocaine conviction. The Government concedes the error and asserts that this court should vacate Martinez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-22\">The documents pertaining to Martinez\u2019s California cocaine conviction are ambiguous as to the statute of conviction. The charging document, which merely tracks the statutory language, indicates that Martinez was convicted under Cal. Health <em>&amp; </em>Safety Code \u00a7 11352(a). Section 11352(a) encompasses acts that are not included in the definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d in the context of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). <em>See United States v. Gutierrez-Ramirez, </em>405 F.3d 352, 359 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 217, 163 L.Ed.2d 198 (2005). Accordingly, Martinez\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-25\">Martinez also challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Martinez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Tor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number><em>res </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
