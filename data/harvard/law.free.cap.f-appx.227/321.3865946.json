Cantrell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>claims: in finding he was not disabled, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) improperly defined \u201cmoderate\u201d in relation to mental limitations; and the Appeals Council failed to consider evidence he submitted that was allegedly new and material and would provide a basis for changing the decision of the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">As an applicant for disability benefits, Cantrell bore the initial burden of proving he was disabled by establishing a physical or mental impairment prevented him from engaging in substantial gainful activity for at least 12 months. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423. Once he satisfied this burden, the Secretary bore the burden of establishing he did <em>not </em>have any impairments significantly limiting his physical or mental ability to do work activities, and therefore was not disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(c) and 416.920(c); <em>Johnson v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 340, 344 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">The ALJ found Cantrell had the residual functional capacity (RFC) for a full range of medium work, with, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cmoderate\u201d limitations in his ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods, to interact with the general public, and to accept instructions and respond appropriately to supervisors. This determination was based in part on the reports from a state consultant\u2019s assessment of Cantrell\u2019s ability to work. A vocational expert testified that an individual with Cantrell\u2019s RFC could <em>not </em>perform his past work as a sales agent but could perform his past work as a gambling dealer. The ALJ defined \u201cmoderate\u201d, both in his decision and in the interrogatories directed to the vocational expert, as meaning \u201cthere are some moderate limitations, but the person can still perform the task satisfactorily\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">After the ALJ issued his decision finding him <em>not </em>disabled, Cantrell submitted additional evidence to the Appeals Council regarding treatment he received for two medical conditions. (The evidence had apparently been inadvertently left out of the administrative transcript. Accordingly, the Agency filed a supplemental transcript.) The Appeals Council reviews a case if, <em>inter alia, </em>it receives new and material evidence and the decision is contrary to the weight of all the evidence in the record. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b). The Appeals Council denied Cantrell\u2019s request for review in a written order.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), our court reviews whether substantial record evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s final decision and whether, in reaching it, the Commissioner applied proper legal standards. <em>Perez v. Barnhart, </em>415 F.3d 457, 461 (5th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla, less than a preponderance, and \u201c\u2018such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 236 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Cantrell claims that, because \u201cmoderate\u201d falls between \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cmarked\u201d, which are defined in the regulations, it should indicate a greater degree of limitation than that in the ALJ\u2019s definition. Although the term \u201cmoderate\u201d is not defined in the regulations or the Program Operations Manual System, Cantrell does <em>not </em>show the definition used by the ALJ conflicts with either. \u201cMarked\u201d is defined as \u201cmore than moderate but less than extreme\u201d. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 12.00(c). Accordingly, \u201cmoderate\u201d is less severe and was <em>not </em>used in a manner inconsistent with the regulations. Moreover, there is substantial evidence the vocational expert understood the degree of limitation at issue in assessing what level of work a person with Cantrell\u2019s RFC could perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The record also contains substantial evidence the Appeals Council considered all of the evidence, including the post-decision supplemental records submitted by Cantrell, in denying his request for review. In its order, the Appeals Council specifically stated it had considered the additional evidence and found it did not warrant changing the ALJ\u2019s disability decision. Furthermore, the final no-disability decision is supported by substantial evidence: Cantrell has <em>not </em>shown no credible choices or medical evidence support the decision. <em>See Hames v. Heckler, </em>707 F.2d 162, 164 (5th Cir.1983) (\u201c \u2018[N]o substantial evidence\u2019 will be found only where there is a \u2018conspicuous absence of credible choices\u2019 or \u2018no contrary medical evidence\u2019 \u201d.
