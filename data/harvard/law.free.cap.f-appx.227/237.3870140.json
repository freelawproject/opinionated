Eichelberger pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of a quantity of cocaine (Count 2), two counts of possession with intent to distribute and distribution of a quantity of cocaine (Counts 4 and 8), two counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (Counts 5 and 9), two counts of possession of a firearm by a felon (Counts 6 and 7), and one count of possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base (Count 14), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1); 924(a)(2), (c)(1)(A), (e)(1); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C); 846 (2000). The district court sentenced Eichelberger to a total term of imprisonment of 437 months. On appeal, Eichelberger contends his counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the court\u2019s imposition of a twenty-five year mandatory minimum sentence on the second \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) offense charged in Count 9. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim is generally not cognizable on direct appeal, but should instead be asserted in a post-conviction motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). However, we have recognized an exception to the general rule when \u201cit \u2018conclusively appears\u2019 from the record that defense counsel did not provide effective representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir.1994)). Because the record does not conclusively establish that counsel was ineffective, Eichelberger\u2019s claim is not cognizable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
