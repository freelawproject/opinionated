He argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to provide reasons for imposing it. Because Delancey did not object to the imposition of the non-guideline sentence in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-26\">The record reflects that the district court considered the applicable advisory guideline range and decided to depart upwardly from that range based on its consideration of individualized and proper 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense and Delancey\u2019s history and characteristics; the need to provide just punishment and deter criminal conduct; and the need to protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>the public from farther crimes by Delancey. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707-09 (5th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s stated reasons for the upward departure are not based on improper or irrelevant factors, nor do they represent a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors. <em>See id. </em>at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The court\u2019s stated reasons also allowed this court to determine that the non-guideline sentence is supported by the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 707. Delancey has failed to show plain error, and the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
