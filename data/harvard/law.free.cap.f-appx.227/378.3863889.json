Welles pleaded guilty to on one count of transporting child pornography and two counts of possession of child pornography. Welles argues that the district court erred in using his 2000 New York conviction for attempted possession of a sexual performance by a child to enhance his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1) and (2). Both sections provide for increased penalties if the defendant has a prior conviction \u201crelating to\u201d a list of offenses consisting of \u201caggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography, or sex trafficking of children.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1) and (2). Welles argues that the statute does not allow for an increased penalty based on a prior attempt offense. The Government argues that the plain reading of the statute provides for the enhanced penalty because the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d includes attempt offenses for the listed crimes. This is a question of statutory construction which is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>303 F.3d 548, 550 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Whether the phrase \u201crelating to\u201d gives a clear indication that Congress intended for the penalties for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A to be increased for a prior attempt crime has been decided by this court in <em>United States v. Hubbard, </em>480 F.3d 341, 343-51 (5th Cir.2007). The panel in <em>Hubbard </em>cited <em>Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>504 U.S. 374, 383, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), to hold that the phrase \u201crelated to\u201d is to be interpreted broadly. <em>Hubbard, </em>480 F.3d at 347-48. The panel rejected the application of the rule of lenity to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(1) because the statute is not ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 345. <em>Hubbard </em>addressed the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(1), but the language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2) in question in this case is essentially identical with respect to whether the statute may be interpreted to provide an enhanced penalty for a prior offense of attempt that is \u201crelated to\u201d one of the generic offenses listed. The reasoning of <em>Hubbard </em>is compelling. The use of Welles\u2019s 2000 New York conviction for attempted possession of sexual performance by a child to enhance his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(1) and (2) was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Welles argues that his prior conviction from New York could not be used to enhance his current sentence because the prior conviction was the result of an unknowing and involuntary plea. The district court overruled this collateral attack at sentencing based on <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), that such a collateral attack was not available under the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252. Welles has not shown that the district court erred on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
