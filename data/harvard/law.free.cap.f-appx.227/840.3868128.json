Robinson asserts the evidence did not support the revocation of his supervised release due to its contradictory nature. He also contends his sentence is unreasonable. We address each issue in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Robinson\u2019s supervised release. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994) (stating that a district court\u2019s decision regarding revocation of supervised release is reviewed for abuse of discretion). A mandatory condition of Robinson\u2019s supervised release was that he \u201cnot commit another federal, state or local crime.\u201d The evidence presented at the probable cause hearing established that (1) three witnesses testified to seeing Robinson holding a gun; (2) two witnesses testified that Robinson dragged Ventras Davis with his car; and (3) the responding police officer testified that Davis was distraught and told him that her ex-boyfriend, Robinson, had tried to grab her with his car and pointed a firearm at her. Even though the witnesses presented different versions of exactly where Robinson stood as he held the gun and the gun\u2019s color, this Court gives deference to the district court\u2019s factual findings unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993). The district court specifically found that Robinson pulled a gun. Moreover, the district court had to weigh the testimony of Davis, Antonio McWilliams, India Pressley, and Timothy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>Walsh against that of Robinson, and this Court generally will not review the factfinder\u2019s credibility determination. <em>See United States v. Copeland, </em>20 F.3d 412, 413 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Thus, despite the contradictory nature regarding the circumstances of the incident, it was not clearly erroneous to find that Robinson pulled a gun, and thereby violated the terms of his supervised release. As evidence establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required to revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release, the district court did not abuse its discretion in choosing to do so. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1107 (11th Cir.2006). In sentencing a defendant, the factors that a district court should consider include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence to protect the public, to afford adequate deterrence, and provide the defendant with needed medical care or correctional treatment; and (4) the pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The district court\u2019s sentence reflected consideration of several of the relevant factors under \u00a7 3553(a). The court stated it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the court explicitly mentioned Robinson\u2019s history of violence with his girlfriends and his temper. Thus, the court explicitly considered the history and characteristics of the defendant and the nature of the offense. Additionally, the Guidelines range was 24-30 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court took account of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Robinson at the high end of the relevant Guidelines range. We conclude Robinson\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1106-07 (holding sentences imposed for violation of supervised release are reviewed for reasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
