Stepter was sentenced by the district court to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-24\">On appeal, Stepter initially contends that the presumption of reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>this court affords <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentences imposed within a properly calculated Guidelines range is unconstitutional. This court\u2019s precedent, however, forecloses this argument. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. July 21, 2006) (No. 06-5439); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341-42 (4th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006); <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 457 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because one panel of this court cannot overrule another, we decline Stepter\u2019s invitation to ignore established circuit authority. <em>United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346-47 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Stepter also contends that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000). Because the district court properly calculated and considered the advisory guideline range and weighed the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we conclude Stepter\u2019s sentence, which was below the statutory maximum and within the advisory guideline range, is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-30\"> <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
