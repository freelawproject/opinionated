She was working at the exact place to which she had been assigned, and was doing her work in a proper manner. It is apparent that the accident could not have occurred had the defendant used the methods designed by the maker of the machine for keeping the roller in place. The construction of the \u201c U \u201d shaped clutch indicated that the screw pin was ail important part of the completed machine, and a neglect of proper supervision which permitted the pin to work out of its place exposed the employee to a danger of which she could not have notice and made her working place an unsafe one.
