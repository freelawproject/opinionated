The other defendant, the United States Fidelity <em>&amp; </em>Guaranty Company of Baltimore, was the surety of the collector for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The first item in the auditors\u2019 report charged against the collector is: <em>\u201c </em>To balance at Aud. settlement 1899, $778.90.\u201d Inasmuch as this item shows upon its face that it was carried forward from a previous set dement and was not a charge against the collector for the year 1898, for which the surety company was defendant, the court properly refused to admit that item in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The first item of credit in the said auditor\u2019s report was : \u201c By Amt. paid Treas. \u201998, $784.45.\u201d Upon its face this credit would indicate that the payment had been made either in the year 1898 or out of taxes collected for that year. We said in Com. v. Carson, 26 Pa. Superior Ct. 437: \u201c That, as a general rule, the auditor\u2019s settlement of a tax collector\u2019s account is admissible in evidence, both as against him and against his sureties, for the year in question, is clear,\u201d citing authorities. Upon what ground the court, therefore, refused to strike out the item of \u201cAmt. paid Treas. \u201998, $784.45,\u201d after having stricken out \u201cBalance at Aud. settlement 1899, $778.90,\u201d we are at a loss to understand. If the item needed explanation, the offers made by the plaintiff \u2014 First, \u201c That at the time Mr. Carson, the collector, came before the auditors, he handed in this amount of $784.45 and stated to the auditors that that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>was of taxes which, he had collected of the previous year, and accordingly it was so marked by the auditors on the auditors\u2019 report,\u201d and that the collector \u201c was charged with a balance on the preceding year and he paid this money in to square off that balance, and it is so marked, \u2018Paid Treas. 1898,\u2019\u201d and that the said amount was collected from the taxes of 1898 and specifically applied by the collector for the payment of a balance appearing against him for that year \u2014 were abundantly sufficient to explain the credit and to establish the fact, if believed by the jury, that the said item was not a credit upon the taxes collected for 1899. The item of itself, if it showed anything, would be presumed to mean just what it says. If it needed explanation, as it probably did, the offers should have been admitted for that purpose. In any view of the case, we think the court erred in excluding the offers of the plaintiff, after having excluded from the consideration of the jury the item on the debit side of the account, charging the defendant collector with the balance at the former settlement. The second and third assignments of error are, therefore, sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">Judgment reversed and a new venire awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
