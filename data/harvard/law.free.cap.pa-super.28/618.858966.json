Before a decision was rendered, it was shown to us, by suggestion of the district attorney in writing, duly filed, that the appellant died on or about March 13,1905. It is clear, both upon reason and authority, that under such circumstances, the appeal abates and that nothing remains for the appellate court to do but to make the formal order to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Now October 9, 1905, the appeal is abated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
