MARRA, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1343-14\">THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss Amended Complaints. (DEs 92, 295). The motions are fully briefed and ripe for review. The Court has carefully considered the briefing, supplemental briefing, and oral arguments, and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1343-15\">Plaintiffs, citizens and residents of Colombia, are the family members of trade unionists, banana-plantation workers, political organizers, social activists, and others tortured and killed by the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (\u201cAUC\u201d), a paramilitary organization operating in Colombia. The decedents were allegedly killed by the AUC during the 1990s through 2004 in the Colombian banana-growing regions, primarily in the Uraba and Magdalena areas. Plaintiffs bring this action against Defendants Chiquita Brands International, Inc. and Chiquita Fresh North America LLC (collectively \u201cChiquita\u201d), alleging claims under various federal statutes, state common laws, international customary law, and foreign law. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 \u2014 commonly known as the Alien Tort Statute (\u201cATS\u201d) or Alien Tort Claims Act (\u201cATCA\u201d) \u2014 for terrorism; material support to terrorist organizations; torture; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>extrajudicial killing; war crimes; crimes against humanity; cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; violation of the rights to life, liberty and security of person and peaceful assembly and association; and consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. Plaintiffs also allege claims under the Torture Victim Protection Act (\u201cTVPA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 note, for torture and extrajudicial killing. Last, Plaintiffs allege claims under the laws of Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, the District of Columbia, and the foreign law of Colombia for assault and battery, wrongful death, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, negligent hiring, negligent per se, and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_4\">\n<em>The AUC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-5\">Since the 1940s, Colombia has been engaged in a longstanding civil conflict between the government and left-wing guerrilla insurgents, such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) and the National Liberation Army (\u201cELN\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> FAC \u00b6\u00b6 407, 497-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-6\">In the early 1980s, Colombian drug barons, large-land owners, industrialists, and bankers, with the cooperation of the Colombian government, began to create private paramilitary units to combat the left-wing guerrilla forces. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 407-08. By the mid-1990s, the largest and most well-organized paramilitary group in Colombia was the Rural Self-Defense Group of Cordoba and Uraba (the \u201cACCU\u201d). FAC \u00b6 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-10\">The commander-in-chief of the ACCU was Carlos Casta\u00f1o. FAC \u00b6 409. In 1994, Casta\u00f1o and the ACCU sponsored a summit of the paramilitary groups from across Colombia. FAC \u00b6 409. This summit led to the formation of the AUC, a national federation uniting Colombia\u2019s regional paramilitaries under Castano\u2019s leadership. FAC \u00b6 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-11\">The AUC grew rapidly in size during the late 1990s and into the twenty-first century. FAC \u00b6 410. In 1997, it was comprised of roughly 4,000 combatants. FAC \u00b6 410. By 2001, Casta\u00f1o claimed to have 11,000 members, and by 2002, AUC forces were present in nearly all regions of Colombia. FAC \u00b6 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b1344-12\">As part of its war strategy, the AUC sought to eliminate any guerrilla sympathizer who opposed the paramilitaries\u2019 control of the territories in which the AUC operated. FAC \u00b6 411. The AUC\u2019s primary method was to terrorize individuals and communities suspected of guerrilla sympathies. FAC \u00b6 411. To this end, the AUC routinely engaged in death threats, summary executions, torture, rape, kidnaping, forced disappearances, looting, and large-scale attacks on civilian populations. FAC \u00b6 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>While the AUC periodically engaged in direct combat with armed guerrilla forces, the majority of its victims were civilians whom the AUC viewed as supporters of the guerrillas or whom inhabited areas in which the guerrillas operated. FAC \u00b6 412. The AUC also targeted people thought to share the guerrillas\u2019 leftist ideology, such as teachers, community leaders, trade unionists, human rights activists, religious workers, and leftist politicians. FAC \u00b6 413. The AUC was also known to eliminate groups it considered socially undesirable, such as indigenous persons, people with psychological problems, drug addicts, prostitutes, and petty criminals. FAC \u00b6 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-5\">The escalation of violence between the paramilitaries and the guerrillas caused the Colombian president to issue Decree 1194 of 1989, adopted as permanent legislation in 1991, which criminalized membership in a paramilitary group or providing any support to such groups. FAC \u00b6 408. In 1994, however, the Colombian government created a new legal mechanism for funding and supporting paramilitaries, known as Chapter 5 of Decree 356. FAC \u00b6 421. Paramilitaries could reorganize and continue operating under Chapter 5, which allowed private groups to provide for \u201cSpecial Vigilance and Private Security Services.\u201d FAC \u00b6 421. These private security groups, known commonly by their Spanish-language acronym \u201cconvivir,\u201d were comprised of civilians who received permission from the government for a license to provide their own security in high-risk areas. FAC \u00b6 421. Convivir were permitted to use arms that were otherwise restricted to the military\u2019s use. FAC \u00b6 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-6\">Plaintiffs allege that the convivir units were fronts for the paramilitaries from their inception. FAC \u00b6 422. In the Uraba region \u2014 where Chiquita\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, C.I. Bananos de Exportaci\u00f3n, S.A. (\u201cBanadex\u201d), operated its banana plantations \u2014 the convivir units were comprised of and led by known AUC paramilitaries. FAC \u00b6 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-8\">The convivir units worked closely with the Colombian military, facilitating communication and collaboration between the military and the AUC. FAC \u00b6 426. Plaintiffs allege that the cooperation between the AUC and convivirs on one hand, and the Colombian military and government officials on the other, was extensive. Both groups sought to defeat the left-wing guerrilla insurgency and both worked together towards that end. FAC \u00b6429. This alleged collaboration included joint membership between the AUC and the Colombian military and security forces, the government\u2019s acquiescence to the AUC\u2019s permanent military bases and security checkpoints, the government\u2019s refusal to intervene to stop AUC attacks, intelligence sharing, arms and equipment sharing, and planning and executing joint attacks on civilian populations. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 426, 429, 433-37. Plaintiffs allege that this model of collaboration between the paramilitaries and the government was \u201cdeveloped and perfected\u201d in the Uraba region, the area of Chiquita\u2019s banana operations. FAC \u00b6 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-9\">On September 10, 2001, the U.S. government designated the AUC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (\u201cFTO\u201d). FAC \u00b6 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-10\">\n<em>The Torture and Killing of Plaintiffs\u2019 Relatives</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1345-11\">There are several thousand named plaintiffs in the seven complaints, and some complaints are filed as class actions seeking to represent larger classes. Each named plaintiff alleges that he or she is a family member of a victim who was killed or tortured by the AUC. Each plaintiff alleges that the AUC attacked his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>relative in the banana-growing regions of Colombia, during the period when Chiquita supported the AUC. While the circumstances of each attack are unique, to summarize each plaintiffs allegations would be impractical given the number of plaintiffs. Accordingly, this opinion will provide only allegations of several representative plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1346-4\">\u2022 Juana Perez 50B is the wife and is also a legal heir of Pablo Perez 50, with whom she had a family. Pablo Perez 50, an employee of Finca Marte, a banana plantation owned or controlled by Chiquita, or which supplied Chiquita, was an active member of the trade union SINTRAIN-AGRO, which represented banana workers in Magdalena, including Chiquita workers .... On the night of October 31, 1997 or in the early morning hours of November 1, 1997, a group of heavily armed paramilitaries dressed in camouflaged uniforms stormed Pablo Perez 50\u2019s home in the village of Guacamayal, in the banana zone of Magdalena, while he was sleeping. The paramilitaries broke down the door to the home, found Pablo Perez 50 and seized him, tied him up and forced him to accompany them at gunpoint, beating him as they kidnaped him. Pablo Perez 50\u2019s corpse was found the following morning with signs of torture and two gunshots, one to the head and one to the body. In a certificate issued on November 22, 1999, Elvis Emilio Redondo Lopez, the Ci\u00e9naga Municipal Representative, confirmed that Pablo Perez 50 was murdered in a massacre carried out in the context of the internal armed conflict. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 296-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b1346-7\">\u2022 Juan Perez 60 is the father and legal heir of Pablo Perez 60, an employee of Finca San Antonio, a banana plantation owned or controlled by Chiquita, or which supplied Chiquita, located in Turbo, in the Uraba region of Antioquia.... At approximately 1:00 AM on June 17, 1999, Pablo Perez 60 was resting at his home in Apartado, Antioquia when a group of paramilitaries who had arrived in several vehicles stormed his home, kicked in his door, seized Pablo Perez 60, and beat him. The paramilitaries demanded to know where Pablo Perez 60 had weapons hidden. Finding no weapons, the paramilitaries kidnaped Pablo Perez 60 and took him to the village of Nueva Colonia .... There, the paramilitaries tortured Pablo Perez 60 before executing him with several gunshots to the head and body. At the time when Pablo Perez 60 was kidnaped, tortured and murdered, the AUC was receiving substantial support from Chiquita, and the murder of Pablo Perez 60 was in furtherance of the understanding that the AUC had with Chiquita that in return for Chiquita\u2019s support, the AUC would drive the FARC and ELN guerrillas out of the banana area of Uraba, Antioquia and maintain a sufficient presence to keep the guerrillas from regaining a foothold. Further, the AUC provided Chiquita with security, labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>quiescence and social stability, and ensured that trade unions were not infiltrated by leftists sympathetic to the FARC and ELN guerrillas. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 316-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-5\">\u2022 Juana Perez 13 is the sister and legal heir of Paula Perez 13. Paula Perez 13, an employee of the banana plantation Nabusimake, a Chiquita supplier, was raped, tortured and murdered on October 18, 2005 by AUC paramilitaries from the William Rivas Front, who were in control of the banana zone and surrounding areas of Magdalena, in furtherance of the internal armed conflict. On the evening of October 19, 2005, Paula Perez 13 was on the Nabusimake plantation, located in the town of Sevilla, Zona Bananera, in the company of a security guard when, at approximately 8:00 PM, a group of five armed paramilitaries entered the plantation. The security guard fled as the paramilitaries approached, leaving Paula Perez 13 alone. The paramilitaries raped Paula Perez 13, tortured her with multiple stab wounds and by burning her chest, and then killed her by slitting her throat. On March 13, 2007, the Zona Bananera Municipal Representative issued a letter confirming that Paula Perez 13 was murdered on October 18, 2005, for ideological and political reasons in the context of the internal armed conflict. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 220-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-6\">\n<em>Chiquita\u2019s Assistance to the AUC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-7\">Chiquita, an American multinational corporation, is one of the world\u2019s largest producers and suppliers of bananas. FAC \u00b6 394. As the successor to the United Fruit Company and the United Brands Company, Chiquita has been operating in the Colombian banana-growing regions, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Banadex, since the early 1960s. FAC \u00b6 456. In 2003, Banadex was Chiquita\u2019s most profitable banana-producing operation in the world.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> FAC \u00b6 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">During labor struggles in the 1980s, left-wing, anti-government guerrilla groups, including the FARC, became active in the banana areas of Uraba and Magdalena. FAC \u00b6 458. The FARC became particularly involved in union activity. FAC \u00b6 458. In the 1990s, the rise of FARCinfluenced unions was accompanied by increased paramilitary violence, as groups like the AUC moved into these areas to combat the FARC\u2019s influence. FAC \u00b6 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">In or around 1995, Chiquita formed an agreement with the AUC, paying them to pacify the banana plantations and to suppress union activity. FAC \u00b6472. In return for Chiquita\u2019s support, the AUC agreed it would drive the guerrillas out of Chiquita\u2019s banana-growing areas and maintain a sufficient presence to prevent the guerrillas from returning. FAC \u00b6 197. Furthermore, the AUC would provide Chiquita .with security, labor quiescence, and ensure that the unions were not infiltrated by leftists sympathetic to the FARC or ELN guerrillas. FAC \u00b6 197. This arrangement benefitted Chiquita, as labor unrest and strikes were minimized while profits increased. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 548-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">Under this agreement, Chiquita paid the paramilitaries a commission based on the number of boxes Chiquita shipped each month. FAC \u00b6472. During the period 1997-2004, Chiquita paid the AUC nearly every month, making over one hundred payments totaling over $1.7 million. FAC \u00b6 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>Chiquita made payments directly to the AUC <em>or to </em>the AUC\u2019s convivir front organizations. FAC \u00b6 470. Chiquita concealed the nature of these payments by recording them in corporate books as payments for \u201csecurity services.\u201d FAC \u00b6 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">Chiquita also made payments indirectly to the AUC by depositing payments into the accounts of Banadex executives who would then withdraw cash and hand it directly to AUC representatives. FAC \u00b6 471. Chiquita concealed these payments by recording them in corporate books as income contributions. FAC \u00b6 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">These payments were reviewed and approved by Chiquita\u2019s senior company executives who knew that the AUC was a violent, illegal paramilitary group. FAC \u00b6 469. In 2003, Chiquita consulted with outside counsel, a U.S.-based law firm, regarding its ongoing payments to the AUC, which was by then a designated FTO. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 473-74. Outside counsel advised Chiquita that its payments to an FTO were illegal under U.S. law and that Chiquita should immediately stop the payments. FAC \u00b6 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">On April 3, 2003, Chiquita\u2019s Board of Directors agreed to disclose its AUC payments to the U.S. Department of Justice. FAC \u00b6 475. On April 8, 2003, Chiquita instructed Banadex to continue making payments to the AUC. FAC \u00b6 475. On April 24, 2003, Chiquita met with Justice Department officials, who told Chiquita that the AUC payments were illegal. FAC \u00b6 475. Nonetheless, Chiquita continued paying the AUC until February 2004. FAC \u00b6 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-7\">Plaintiffs also allege that Chiquita assisted the AUC by facilitating arms shipments. For example, Plaintiffs allege that in 2001, a ship left Nicaragua carrying 3,000 AK-47 assault rifles and 5 million rounds of ammunition. FAC \u00b6478. Instead of docking in Panama, its official destination, the ship went instead to Turbo, Colombia, where Chiquita, through Banadex, operated a private port facility for transporting bananas and other cargo. FAC \u00b6 479. After the ship docked in Turbo, Banadex employees unloaded the rifles and ammunition, which remained at Chiquita\u2019s facilities for two days before being loaded onto AUC vehicles. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 480-81. Some of these arms were later confiscated from AUC units operating in Uraba. FAC \u00b6 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">\n<em>Chiquita\u2019s Guilty Plea and Plaintiffs\u2019 Lawsuits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">On March 19, 2007, Chiquita pled guilty in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to one count of violating federal anti-terrorism laws by engaging in transactions with a designated FTO. FAC \u00b6 476. Chiquita\u2019s sentence included a $25 million criminal fine, the requirement to implement and maintain an effective compliance and ethics program, and five years\u2019 probation. FAC \u00b6 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">In March 2007, shortly after Chiquita\u2019s public guilty plea, Plaintiffs first learned of Chiquita\u2019s assistance to the AUC. FAC \u00b6 10. On June 7, 2007, the first civil complaint was filed against Chiquita arising from its alleged support to the AUC. <em>Perezes (1-95) v. Chiquita Brands Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>No. 08-cv-80465 (D.D.C., filed June 7, 2007). Additional complaints followed in various judicial districts. On February 20, 2008, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred these actions to the Southern District of Florida for consolidated pretrial proceedings with the related actions already pending before this Court. (DE 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-12\">Chiquita now moves to dismiss the complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1311\">*1311</page-number>state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201crequires only \u2018a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief in order to give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs claim is ... and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)). The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[w]hile a complaint attacked by a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss does not need detailed factual allegations, a plaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do. Factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955). \u201cA claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Sinaltrainal v. Coca-Cola Co., </em>578 F.3d 1252, 1261 (11th Cir.2009). Thus, \u201conly a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1950. When considering a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the court must \u201caccept[ ] the allegations in the complaint as true and construir\u00e9] them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., </em>605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-9\">A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1) may \u201cassert either a factual attack or a facial attack to jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1260. In a facial, attack \u2014 that is, an attack on the sufficiency of the jurisdictional allegations in the complaint \u2014 the court reviews the allegations as \u201cit does when considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion,\u201d construing \u201cthe complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accepting] all well-pled facts alleged in the complaint as true.\u201d <em>Id.; see also McElmurray v. Consol. Gov\u2019t of Augusta-Richmond Cnty., </em>501 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir.2007) (explaining that in a Rule 12(b)(1) facial challenge the plaintiff has \u201csafeguards similar to those retained when a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is raised\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-11\">Chiquita asserts numerous grounds for dismissing the complaints, primarily for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The Court will first address Chiquita\u2019s arguments for dismissing the claims that arise under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350, also know as the Alien Tort Statute (\u201cATS\u201d) or the Alien Tort Claims Act (\u201cATCA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-12\">I. The Alien Tort Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-13\">The First Congress enacted the ATS as part of the Judiciary Act of 1789. The modern-day version of the ATS provides: \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed in violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350. Federal subject-matter jurisdiction exists for an ATS claim \u201cwhen the following three elements are satisfied: (1) an alien (2) sues for a tort (3) committed in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>law of nations.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, 578 </em>F.3d at 1261. The parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs satisfy the first two elements, so this Court\u2019s analysis focuses on the third requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">Under the ATS, the \u201claw of nations\u201d refers to the norms of customary international law. <em>Id; Flores v. S. Peru Copper Corp., </em>343 F.3d 140, 154 (2d Cir.2003). Conduct violates the law of nations if it contravenes \u201cwell-established, universally recognized norms of international law.\u201d <em>Kadic v. Karadzic, </em>70 F.3d 232, 238 (2d Cir.1995); <em>Sinaltrainal, 578 </em>F.3d at 1262 n. 11. In 1789, when Congress passed the ATS, the only recognized violations of the law of nations were \u201cviolation of safe conducts, infringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.\u201d <em>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>542 U.S. 692, 715, 124 S.Ct. 2739, 159 L.Ed.2d 718 (2004). Since then, a modest number of additional causes of action have been recognized under the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\"> In <em>Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, </em>the Supreme Court set forth the standard for recognizing new causes of action. The Court explained that claims under the ATS are not static; new ones may be recognized if they \u201crest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms we have recognized.\u201d 542 U.S. at 725, 124 S.Ct. 2739; <em>see also Sinaltrainal, 578 </em>F.3d at 1263 (\u201c[FJederal courts have not been precluded from recognizing new claims under the law of nations as an element of the common law, even though the law of nations was originally limited to violation of safe conducts, offenses against ambassadors, and piracy.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 1262 n. 11 (holding that jurisdiction under the ATS exists \u201conly when a defendant\u2019s alleged conduct violates \u2018well-established, universally recognized norms of international law.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, </em>630 F.2d 876, 888 (2d Cir.1980)). Thus, under <em>Sosa, </em>\u201cthe ATS is not only a jurisdictional statute; the ATS also empowers federal courts to entertain \u2018a very limited category\u2019 of claims.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1262 (quoting <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 712, 124 S.Ct. 2739).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-7\">The <em>Sosa </em>Court, however, admonished the lower federal courts to exercise \u201cgreat caution\u201d in considering new causes of action, stating that the door to recognizing new claims under the law of nations is \u201cstill ajar subject to vigilant doorkeeping, and thus open to a narrow class of international norms today.\u201d 542 U.S. at 728, 729, 124 S.Ct. 2739. <em>Sosa </em>also directed that lower courts consider the practical consequences of making new claims available to private litigants in federal courts. <em>Id. </em>at 732-33, 124 S.Ct. 2739. For instance, courts must consider whether recognizing new causes of action under international law would \u201cimping[e] on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727, 124 S.Ct. 2739. <em>Sosa </em>also noted that Congress may \u201cshut the door to the law of nations\u201d by \u201ctreaties or statutes that occupy the field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731, 124 S.Ct. 2739.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-8\">Thus, under <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>framework, courts may recognize new ATS claims where the conduct violates an international-law norm that is sufficiently well-defined and universally accepted, i.e., comparable to the three 18th-century paradigms. <em>See, e.g., Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 760, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]o qualify for recognition under the ATS, a norm of international law must have a content as definite as, and an acceptance as widespread as, those that characterized 18th-century international norms prohibiting piracy.\u201d). <em>Sosa </em>instructs that courts consider international law as it exists today, not as it was in 1789, in determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>to recognize a new claim under the ATS. 542 U.S. at 733, 124 S.Ct. 2739; <em>see also Filartiga, </em>630 F.2d at 881 (\u201c[C]ourts must interpret international law not as it was in 1789, but as it has evolved and exists among the nations of the world today.\u201d). The present state of customary international law is discerned from \u201c \u2018the works of jurists, writing professedly on public law; or by the general usage and practice of nations; or by judicial decisions recognizing and enforcing that law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Saperstein v. Palestinian Auth., </em>No. 04-20225, 2006 WL 3804718, at *4 (S.D.Fla. Dec. 22, 2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Smith, </em>18 U.S. 153, 160-61, 5 Wheat. 153, 5 L.Ed. 57 (1820)); <em>see also Almog v. Arab Bank, PLC, </em>471 F.Supp.2d 257, 271-72 (E.D.N.Y.2007) (explaining that the sources of law from which a court discerns the current state of international law include treaties, executive or legislative acts, judicial decisions, customs and usages of civilized nations, and scholarly works and treatises).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">It is against this backdrop that the Court addresses Chiquita\u2019s arguments for dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Terrorism-Based Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-7\">Plaintiffs allege two causes of action against Chiquita based upon the AUC\u2019s alleged acts of terrorism: (1) a claim for terrorism under various indirect-liability theories, and (2) a claim for material support to a terrorist organization under a direct-liability theory.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, Plaintiffs contend that the AUC committed acts of violence against Colombian civilians to coerce and intimidate those civilians into abandoning their support for the FARC. Plaintiffs allege that Chiquita is indirectly liable for terrorism because it aided and abetted, conspired with, ratified or were the principals of the AUC in committing these attacks. Plaintiffs further allege that Chiquita is directly liable for providing material support to the AUC, a terrorist organization. Jurisdiction for both terrorism claims is premised upon the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">Chiquita argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-related claims because (1) the Anti-Terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333 (\u201cATA\u201d), limits private rights of action for terrorism to U.S. nationals and therefore forecloses recognition of a parallel and broader cause of action for foreign nationals under the ATS; (2) there is no clearly defined and universally accepted customary international law norm against terrorism, and therefore terrorism is not a cognizable claim under the ATS; and (3) that to the extent terrorism is a recognized violation of international law, Plaintiffs have failed to adequately plead the elements of such a claim. Chiquita also contends that practical considerations and foreign-affairs concerns militate against recognizing a new international-law norm against terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the Anti-Terrorism Ad Foredoses Plaintiffs\u2019 TerrorismrBased ATS Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-12\">Chiquita first argues that the Anti-Terrorism Act precludes Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS-based terrorism claims. The ATA provides a civil cause of action for U.S. nationals harmed by international terrorism. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a) (\u201cAny national of the United States injured in his or her person, property, or business by reason of an act of international terrorism ... may sue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>therefor in any appropriate district court of the United States and shall recover threefold the damages he or she sustains .... \u201d). Chiquita contends that under <em>Sosa, </em>Congress\u2019s action in passing the ATA, and declining to extend a civil action to foreign victims of terrorism, \u201coccupies the field\u201d of private causes of action for terrorism claims and thus precludes recognizing broader civil liability under the auspices of the ATS. <em>See Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 731, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (holding that Congress can \u201cshut the door\u201d to recognizing new ATS claims through \u201cstatutes that occupy the field\u201d). Chiquita points to several congressionally imposed limitations on ATA actions, such as the limitation to U.S. nationals, that are purportedly inconsistent with, and would be impinged upon by, Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed ATS claims. Chiquita thus concludes that the ATA precludes Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to bring a terrorism claim under international law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">The Court finds this argument unpersuasive. The limitations on ATA liability that Chiquita highlights as inconsistent with the ATS, e.g., its limitation to U.S. nationals, actually support the finding that the ATA does not \u201coccupy the field\u201d of civil terrorism claims by <em>non-U.S. </em>nationals under the ATS. In passing the ATA, Congress simply provided a statutory cause of action for U.S. nationals; there is no indication in the statute or its legislative history that Congress intended to foreclose claims by <em>non-U.S. </em>nationals arising under a different statute. Thus, the Court finds that the ATA does not expressly foreclose terrorism claims for non-U.S. nationals under the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">Nor does it appear that Congress intended to repeal the ATS, as it may apply to terrorism claims, by implication. \u201c[Rjepeals by implication are not favored.\u201d <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 549, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn the absence of some affirmative showing of an intention to repeal, the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 94 S.Ct. 2474. When the \u201c \u2018two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective.\u2019 \u201d <em>J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>534 U.S. 124, 143-44, 122 S.Ct. 593, 151 L.Ed.2d 508 (2001) (quoting <em>Morton, </em>417 U.S. at 551, 94 S.Ct. 2474). Here, there is no conflict between the ATA\u2019s provision of civil remedies for U.S. nationals injured by acts of terrorism and the ATS\u2019s provision of civil remedies for aliens injured by violations of international-law norms. These two statutes, providing rights to two different groups of plaintiffs, are capable of coexistence. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims under the ATS are not precluded by the ATA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">\n<em>2. Whether Terrorism and Providing Material Support to a Terrorist Or: ganization Are Actionable Claims Under the ATS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-8\">Chiquita next argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims are not cognizable under the ATS because they do not meet <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>stringent requirements for recognizing new violations of the law of nations. Specifically, Chiquita contends that there is no clearly defined and universally accepted rule of international law prohibiting terrorism or material support for terrorism and, therefore, <em>Sosa </em>prohibits this Court from recognizing such a norm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">Plaintiffs contend that while there may be disagreement regarding the definitional fringes of terrorism, this lack of universal agreement does not undermine the core prohibition against acts intended to cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>death or serious injury to civilians for the purpose of intimidating a population. Plaintiffs argue that this \u201ccore norm\u201d against terrorism is clearly established and widely accepted under customary international law. For more than forty years, Plaintiffs argue, international treaties and domestic laws have recognized this core norm and prohibited acts of terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-4\">Neither the Supreme Court nor the Eleventh Circuit has addressed whether terrorism constitutes a cognizable claim under the ATS. A fractured panel of the D.C. Circuit has addressed this issue, albeit before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sosa. </em>In <em>Tel-Oren v. Libyan Arab Republic, </em>726 F.2d 774 (D.C.Cir.1984), survivors and representatives of victims murdered in an armed attack on civilian busses in Israel sued several governmental and private entities under the ATS for violations of the law of nations. <em>Id. </em>at 775. The \u201cPLO terrorists\u201d seized two civilian buses, a taxi, a passing car and took 121 men, women, and children hostage. <em>Id. </em>at 776 (Edwards, J., concurring). The terrorists tortured, shot, wounded, and murdered many of the civilian hostages. <em>Id. </em>Before the Israeli police stopped the massacre, twenty-two adults and twelve children were killed, and seventy-three adults and fourteen children were seriously injured. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1353-5\">A three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit unanimously dismissed the lawsuit, with three concurring opinions. Judge Edwards\u2019s opinion \u201cconsidered] whether terrorism is itself a law of nations violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795. He found that \u201cthe nations of the world are so divisively split on the legitimacy of such aggression as to make it impossible to pinpoint an area of harmony or consensus.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Judge Edwards concluded that, \u201c[g]iven such disharmony, I cannot conclude that the law of nations ... outlaws politically motivated terrorism, no matter how repugnant it might be to our own legal system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-9\">Judge Bork\u2019s opinion agreed, noting that \u201cappellants\u2019 principal claim, that appellees violated customary principles of international law against terrorism, concerns an area of international law in which there is little or no consensus .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806 (Bork, J., concurring). Judge Bork continued, \u201cSome aspects of terrorism have been the subject of several international conventions, .... But no consensus has developed on how properly to define \u2018terrorism\u2019 generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 806-07. \u201cAs a consequence,\u201d Judge Bork concluded, \u201cinternational law and the rules of warfare as they now exist are inadequate to cope with this new mode of conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1353-10\">More recently, two district courts within this judicial district addressed this issue, both holding that terrorism is not a recognized violation of the law of nations. In <em>Saperstein v. Palestinian Authority, </em>No. 04-20225, 2006 WL 3804718 (S.D.Fla. Dec. 22, 2006), survivors of an Israeli citizen murdered by a terrorist attack in Israel sued the Palestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d) and the Palestine Liberation Organization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>(\u201cPLO\u201d) under the ATS. <em>Id. </em>at *3. On February 18, 2002, a Palestinian terrorist \u2014 recruited, trained, funded, and armed by the PA and PLO \u2014 murdered the plaintiffs\u2019 relative, a civilian, by spraying her car with bullets from an AK-47. <em>Id. </em>The Plaintiffs sued the PA and PLO under the ATS for violations of the law of nations, alleging that the defendants sponsored terrorist acts against Jewish civilians and provided support to terrorist entities. <em>Id. </em>at *2-3. After a thorough analysis of the <em>Sosa </em>framework for recognizing ATS claims under international law, and a discussion of the leading ATS cases at that time, the court concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism claims were not violations of the law of nations. The court first found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of terrorism did not \u201cfit the categories of conduct that prior courts have found constitute a violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *7. Then, finding that the conduct in <em>Tel-Oren </em>was \u201csubstantially similar to the conduct in the present case,\u201d the court adopted Judge Edwards\u2019s conclusion that it is \u201cabundantly clear that politically motivated terrorism has not reached the status of a violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[I]f the conduct of the Defendants is construed as terrorism, then Plaintiffs have not alleged a violation of the law of nations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1354-4\">In <em>Barboza v. Drummond Co., </em>No. 06-61527, Slip op., DE 39 (S.D.Fla. July 17, 2007), the court reached the same conclusion, based on allegations similar to those here. There, family members of a Colombian trade unionist murdered by the AUC sued an American corporation and its Colombian subsidiary under the ATS. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants hired the AUC to protect its Colombian facilities. <em>Id. </em>at 2. Later, the AUC surrounded the plaintiffs\u2019 relative\u2019s house, demanded he exit, and then killed him in front of his family. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The plaintiffs then sued the American companies in federal court under the ATS, asserting a claim for providing financial support to a terrorist organization. <em>Id. </em>at 18 (\u201cPlaintiffs contend that Defendants violated a norm of customary international law by providing material support to a known terrorist organization.\u201d). The court followed the reasoning of <em>Tel-Oren </em>and <em>Saperstein </em>and rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims, holding that \u201cclaims of terrorism in general\u201d have \u201c \u2018not reached the status of [a] violation of the law of nations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22 (quoting <em>Saperstein, </em>2006 WL 3804718, at *7); <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cPlaintiffs have not identified any particular international convention or other recognized source of determining international law to establish a violation of the law of nations here.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1354-7\">The Court finds <em>Tel-Oren, Saperstein, </em>and <em>Barboza </em>persuasive and reaches the same conclusion regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims here. Like the plaintiffs in those cases, Plaintiffs essen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>tially assert a \u201cgeneral\u201d terrorism theory of ATS liability. That is, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are not limited to any specific, narrow category of conduct, such as hijacking civilian aircraft or suicide bombing civilian targets. Rather, Plaintiffs allege a broad range of alleged terrorist acts,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> linked only by the facts that the victims are civilians and the intent is to intimidate. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 First Resp. at 23-24 (DE 111) (\u201cThere is a clearly defined and widely accepted prohibition in international law against acts intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population.\u201d). Plaintiffs thus attempt to group this broad, ill-defined class of conduct under the umbrella of \u201cterrorism,\u201d or material support thereof, and create a cause of action against it under the ATS. Given that Plaintiffs\u2019 generalized terrorism claims are similar to those rejected in <em>Tel-Oren, Saperstein, </em>and <em>Barboza, </em>this Court will follow those decisions and reject Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to categorize these broad claims as violations of the law of nations. <em>See Amergi v. Palestinian Auth., </em>611 F.3d 1350, 1364 (11th Cir.2010) (\u201c[T]he ATS does not broadly provide for causes of action. The federal courts are empowered to open the door only to a narrow class of claims, and the tort asserted [here] \u2014 a single murder purportedly in the course of an armed conflict \u2014 is anything but narrow.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">The Court first notes that disagreement among the international community regarding the definition of terrorism, which <em>Tel-Oren </em>recognized in 1984, continues today. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Yousef, </em>327 F.3d 56, 106-08 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cWe regrettably are no closer now than eighteen years ago to an international consensus on the definition of terrorism or even its proscription; the mere existence of the phrase \u2018state-sponsored terrorism\u2019 proves the absence of agreement on basic terms among a large number of States that terrorism violates public international law.... We thus conclude that the statements of Judges Edwards, Bork, and Robb remain true today .... \u201d); <em>Mwani v. Bin Ladin, </em>No. 99-125, 2006 WL 3422208, at *3 n. 2 (D.D.C. Sept. 28, 2006) (\u201cThe law is seemingly unsettled with respect to defining terrorism as a violation of the law of nations.\u201d). Such continued disharmony underscores the difference between Plaintiffs\u2019 unsettled, controversial terrorism claims and the clearly defined, universally recognized 18th-century paradigmatic international-law claims discussed in <em>Sosa.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">Next, the Court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that international-law sources establish a modern, well-defined, universally accepted norm against terrorism. Plaintiffs cite dozens of international treaties, United Nations resolutions and declarations, and regional conventions for this point. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 First Resp. at 24-25 nn. 15-19 (DE 111). Plaintiffs\u2019 argument seems to culminate with the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, U.N. Doc. A/54/109 (Dee. 9, 1999) (\u201cFinancing Convention\u201d), which Plaintiffs contend codified an existing international norm against terrorism created by decades of treaties and conventions. Article 2 of the Financing Convention provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-9\">(1) Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person by any means, directly or indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>rectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-4\">(a) An act which constitutes an of-fence within the scope of and as defined in one of the treaties listed in the annex;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-5\">(b) Any other act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">The Court finds that the Financing Convention neither codifies nor creates an international-law norm against terrorism or financing terrorism. First, the Financing Convention does not establish a <em>universally accepted </em>rule of customary international law. An international treaty \u201cwill only constitute <em>sufficient proof </em>of a norm of customary international law if an <em>overwhelming majority </em>of States have ratified the treaty.\u201d <em>Flores v. S. Peru Copper Corp., </em>414 F.3d 233, 256 (2d Cir. 2003) (second emphasis added). The \u201cevidentiary weight to be afforded to a given treaty varies greatly depending on [ ] how many, and which,- States have ratified the treaty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The more States that ratify a treaty, and the greater influence of those States in international affairs, the greater the treaty\u2019s evidentiary value towards establishing an international-law norm. <em>Id. </em>at 257. Importantly, the inquiry into whether a treaty establishes a rule of international law is limited to the period of the events giving rise to the alleged injuries. <em>See Vietnam Ass\u2019n for Victims of Agent Orange v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>517 F.3d 104, 123 (2d Cir.2008) (stating that ATS claims must rest on a rule of international law \u201cthat was universally accepted at the time of the events giving rise to the injuries alleged\u201d); <em>Khulumani v. Barclay Nat\u2019l Bank Ltd., </em>504 F.3d 254, 325 (2d Cir.2007) (Korman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that under international law \u201cconduct may be punished only on the basis of a norm that came into force prior to when the conduct occurred\u201d) (internal quotation marks omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>ted). In April 2002, when the Financing Convention came into force, only 26 of the 192 nations of the world, or roughly 14%, had ratified it.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In February 2004, when Chiquita\u2019s alleged payments to the AUC terminated, 111 States, or roughly 58% of the nations of the world, had ratified the Financing Convention.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These figures do not constitute the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d necessary to establish a widely accepted norm of international law prohibiting financial support for terrorism at the time of Chiquita\u2019s purported wrongful acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-5\">Second, the norms in the Financing Convention are not <em>well-established. </em>Rather, the signatories to the Financing Convention dispute many of the rules therein, as illustrated by the many declarations and reservations, i.e., non-consents and varying interpretations,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> appended to the convention. For instance, Egypt declared that it \u201cdoes not consider acts of national resistance <em>in all its forms, </em>including armed resistence against foreign occupation and aggression with a view to liberation and self-determination, as terrorist acts.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Egypt\u2019s declaration prompted an objection by the Czech Republic, which declared that it \u201cconsiders the declaration to be incompatible with the object and purpose of the Convention.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, a substantial number of states declared that they are not bound to entire subject areas of the Convention. For example, Bahrain, Thailand, and Venezuela each declared that six of the nine treaties upon which the Finance Convention is based do not apply to it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Similarly, Brazil, China, Guatemala, Syria, and Vietnam declared the same with regard to three of the treaties.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Such disagreements, non-consents, and divergent interpretations of the Finance Convention demonstrate that the prohibitions of the convention are disputed and not well-established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 briefing also provides several footnotes that string cite dozens of other international treaties, United Nations resolutions and declarations, and regional conventions that Plaintiffs contend prohibit specific acts of terrorism. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 First Resp. at 24-25 nn. 15-19 (DE 111). Plaintiffs do not discuss any of these sources, but contend that they created the international norm against terrorism that the Financing Convention ultimately \u201ccodified.\u201d Because the Court finds that the Financing Convention did not codify an international norm against terrorism, and because Plaintiffs provide no discussion regarding how these string-cited sources establish an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>international norm, the Court does not individually address these many treaties, resolutions, and conventions. The Court notes generally, however, that many of these sources address norms not applicable to the allegations here.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court further notes that many of these sources address the subject of terrorism, if at all, only at a high level of abstraction and do not provide any definition of terrorism.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, like the Financing Convention, these additional sources also fail to provide a well-defined, universally accepted norm of international law against terrorism or material support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">Plaintiffs next argue that \u201cnearly every state has incorporated the international prohibition against terrorism in its domestic laws.\u201d Pis.\u2019 First Resp. at 25 (DE 111). The United States, Plaintiffs highlight, enacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) in 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2338B), and the USA Patriot Act in 2001, Pub.L. No. 107-56, 115 Stat. 272, as prohibitions against terrorism. Under <em>Sosa, </em>however, a norm of international law sufficient to create a claim under the ATS must be drawn from international, not domestic, laws <em>See Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 732 &amp; n. 20, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (observing that \u201cwhether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause of action\u201d under the ATS involves a \u201crelated consideration [of] whether international law extends the scope of liability for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being sued\u201d); <em>see also Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>582 F.3d 244, 259 (2d Cir.2009) <em>(\u201cSosa </em>and our precedents send us to international law to find the standard for accessorial liability.\u201d); <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 269 (Katzmann, J., concurring) (\u201cWe have repeatedly emphasized that the scope of the ATCA\u2019s jurisdictional grant should be determined by reference to international law.\u201d); <em>Abecassis v. Wyatt, </em>704 F.Supp.2d 623, 654 (S.D.Tex.2010) <em>(\u201cSosa </em>establishes international law as the touchstone of the ATS analysis.\u201d); <em>Doe v. Drummond Co., </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 20 n. 21 (N.D.Aa. Apr. 30, 2010) <em>(\u201cDrummond II \u201d) (\u201cSosa </em>supports the broader principle that the scope of liability for ATS violations should be derived from international law\u201d). Reliance on domestic laws, even those of the United States, cannot support recognition of an international norm under the ATS. <em>See Flores, </em>414 F.3d at 249 (\u201cEven if certain conduct is universally proscribed by States in their domestic law, that fact is not necessarily significant or relevant for purposes of customary international law.... [F]or example, murder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>one private party by another, universally proscribed by the domestic law of all countries (subject to varying definitions), is not actionable under the ATCA as a violation of customary international law .... \u201d); <em>Filartiga, </em>630 F.2d at 888 (\u201c[T]he mere fact that every nation\u2019s municipal law may prohibit theft does not incorporate the Eighth Commandment, \u2018Thou Shalt not steal\u2019 [into] the law of nations. It is only where the nations of the world have demonstrated that the wrong is of mutual, and not merely several, concern, by means of express international accords, that a wrong generally recognized becomes an international law violation within the meaning of the [ATS].\u201d) (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Barboza, </em>No. 06-61527, DE 39, Slip op. at 18 (rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on the ATA, AEDPA, and USA Patriot Act as evidence of an international-law norm against financing terrorism).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs urge this Court to follow the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Almog v. Arab Bank, PLC, </em>471 F.Supp.2d 257 (E.D.N.Y.2007), which Plaintiffs contend supports their claim that terrorism is actionable under the ATS. There, survivors of Israeli citizens killed by Palestinian suicide bombers sued a Jordanian bank alleged to have provided financial services that facilitated Palestinian groups\u2019 terrorist attacks. The district court held that \u201corganized, systematic suicide bombings and other murderous attacks against innocent civilians for the purpose of intimidating a civilian population are a violation of the law of nations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">To the extent that <em>Almog </em>can be read as holding that terrorism, or material support thereof, constitutes a violation of the law of nations, the Court respectfully disagrees with that conclusion for the reasons discussed above. In recognizing an international norm against suicide bombing and other attacks on civilians, the <em>Almog </em>court relied largely on the Financing Convention and the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings. <em>See Almog, </em>471 F.Supp.2d at 276-78. As discussed above, this Court finds that the Financing Convention fails to establish a universally recognized, well-settled norm of customary international law. Moreover, and as noted above, the Bombing Convention addresses terrorism at a highly abstract level and does not provide any definition of the subject. The Court thus disagrees with Almog\u2019s conclusion that these conventions support an international norm, under <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>stringent requirements, prohibiting terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-8\"><em>Almog </em>is also distinguishable in that the court there did not recognize an ATS claim for terrorism in general, as Plaintiffs here urge upon this Court. Rather, <em>Almog </em>rested its holding on the specific allegations before it, which the court described as suicide bombings and assassinations of civilians. <em>See id. </em>at 264 (listing representative allegations from Almog\u2019s amended complaint). Indeed, the court explained that its holding was limited to the specific factual allegations before it, and not based upon a cause of action for \u201cterrorism\u201d generally. <em>See id. </em>at 280 (\u201c[T]here is no need to resolve any definitional disputes as to the scope of the word \u2018terrorism,\u2019 for the Conventions expressing the international norm provide their own specific descriptions of the conduct condemned. Although the Conventions refer to such acts as \u2018terrorism,\u2019 the pertinent issue here is only whether the acts as alleged by plaintiffs violate a norm of international law, however labeled.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims are not actionable under the ATS. Like <em>Tel-Oren, Saperstein, </em>and <em>Barboza, </em>and mindful of <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>mandate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>courts exercise great caution in recognizing new ATS claims, this Court finds that a claim for terrorism in general, or material support thereof, is not based on a sufficiently accepted, established, or defined norm of customary international law to constitute a violation of the law of nations. Accordingly, the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction under the ATS over Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims and those claims are dismissed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">\n<em>3. Practical Consequences</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">Chiquita also contends that <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>directive that courts consider the \u201cpractical consequences,\u201d such as foreign-policy implications, of recognizing new ATS claims precludes this Court from recognizing Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims. While the Court need not address this issue given the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-based claims, the Court will briefly address it here because Chiquita weaves this theme throughout its briefing, arguing that the Court should decline to exercise jurisdiction over <em>all </em>of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims because this action will touch on foreign-policy and political issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">The Court finds nothing extraordinary about Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, such that the potential- for adverse foreign-policy consequences balances against adjudication on the merits. Many courts have adjudicated ATS claims based on allegations involving significant foreign-relations issues, some involving allegations nearly identical to those here. <em>See, e.g., Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, Slip op. (addressing ATS claims arising out of AUC\u2019s alleged violence in the course of the Colombian civil war); <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N.A., </em>416 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the plaintiffs sufficiently pleaded ATS claims against a U.S. company that allegedly hired private Guatemalan security forces to torture labor unionists); <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d 232 (addressing ATS claims arising out of the Bosnian genocide); <em>Almog, </em>471 F.Supp.2d 257 (addressing ATS claims arising out of suicide bombings by Palestinian terrorist organizations in Israel). There is no indication that those cases \u201cimping[ed] on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs.\u201d <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 727, 124 S.Ct. 2739. Adjudicating Plaintiffs\u2019 claims is similarly unlikely to risk unwarranted judicial interference with the political branches\u2019 foreign policy vis-avis Colombia. Indeed, unlike other ATS cases addressing significant foreign-policy issues, neither the U.S. nor Colombian governments have voiced any concern regarding this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See, e.g., In re South African Apartheid Litig., </em>617 F.Supp.2d 228, 276-77 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (adjudicating ATS claims arising from U.S. companies\u2019 business practices with the Apartheid-era government of South Africa despite a statement of interest from the U.S. State Department stating that \u201ccontinued adjudication of the above-referenced matters risks potentially serious adverse consequences for significant interests of the United States\u201d and that continued litigation \u201cwill compromise a valuable foreign policy tool\u201d); <em>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>No. 01-9882, 2005 WL 2082846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2005) (upholding ATS claims despite the \u201cUnited States Government [having] submitted a Statement of Interest ... expressing concerns regarding the impact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>of this litigation on this Nation\u2019s foreign affairs\u201d). This Court will not decline to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims solely because the allegations touch on issues concerning Colombian officials and the Colombian civil war. <em>See Amergi </em>611 F.3d at 1365 (\u201cThere can be little doubt that the ATS permits federal courts to assert jurisdiction over hot-button matters of international law.\u201d); <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 263 (\u201c[N]ot every case touching foreign relations is nonjusticiable and judges should not reflexively invoke these doctrines to avoid difficult and somewhat sensitive decisions in the context of human rights.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 249 (\u201cAlthough these cases present issues that arise in a politically charged context, that does not transform them into cases involving nonjusticiable political questions. The doctrine is one of \u2018political questions,\u2019 not one of \u2018political cases.\u2019 \u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">The Court also rejects as a basis for dismissal Chiquita\u2019s argument that hearing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims would give rise to thousands of new ATS claims stemming from its alleged support to the AUC, resulting in unmanageable litigation. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide adequate procedures for managing large, complicated lawsuits, including class actions involving thousands of plaintiffs. Moreover, Chiquita\u2019s position risks rewarding offenders who commit large-scale, as opposed to individual, international torts. Under Chiquita\u2019s argument, an offender who commits a small number of international-law violations would be subject to ATS claims in federal court, while an offender who commits thousands of offenses, thereby making any lawsuit more complex, could escape liability. The Court refuses to adopt such a rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Additional ATS Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">As a threshold matter, the Court rejects Chiquita\u2019s suggestion that the Court\u2019s ruling on Plaintiffs\u2019 terrorism-related claims disposes of Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining ATS claims. Chiquita argues that all of Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS causes of action are really just material-support-for-terrorism claims that Plaintiffs attempt to \u201cshoehorn\u201d into other theories of ATS violations, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, torture, and extrajudicial killing. The Court disagrees with this assessment of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. The complaints allege multiple, distinct non-terrorism causes of action\u2014 claims that federal courts have recognized as independent, valid ATS claims \u2014 and the Court will analyze Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as such. The Court now turns to Chiquita\u2019s specific arguments directed at Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">Chiquita first argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims for (1) cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, (2) violation of the rights to life, liberty and security of person and peaceful assembly and association, and (3) consistent pattern of human-rights violations are not recognized violations of the law of nations. The Court agrees. First, while asserting these causes of action in their complaints, Plaintiffs\u2019 briefing ignores entirely Chiquita\u2019s arguments for dismissing these claims and provides no authority recognizing these causes of action under the ATS. Without any authority recognizing these claims, the Court cannot conclude that they are sufficiently established or universally recognized under international law to satisfy <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>requirements for recognizing new ATS claims. Additionally, other courts have expressly rejected these types of claims under the ATS. <em>See, e.g., Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1247 (\u201cWe see no basis in law to recognize Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d); <em>Ville</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number><em>da Aldana v. Fresh Del Monte Produce, Inc., </em>305 F.Supp.2d 1285, 1299 (S.D.Fla.2003) (\u201c[T]his Court cannot let this claim proceed as Plaintiffs have not established the existence of [a] customary international law \u2018right to associate and organize.\u2019 \u201d), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>416 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>456 F.Supp.2d 457, 467 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for violations of the \u201crights to life, liberty, security and association\u201d because there \u201cis no particular or universal understanding of the civil and political rights covered by Plaintiffs\u2019 claim, and thus, pursuant to <em>Sosa, </em>these \u2018rights\u2019 are not actionable under the ATS.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>621 F.3d 111 (2d Cir.2010); <em>Sarei v. Rio Tinto PLC, </em>221 F.Supp.2d 1116, 1162 n. 190 (C.D.Cal.2002) (\u201c[P]lain-tiffs have not demonstrated that prohibitions against cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment (other than torture) and gross violations of human rights constitute established norms of customary international law.\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>456 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir.2006), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part, and vacated in part en banc, </em>487 F.3d 1193 (9th Cir.2007). Having provided no authority recognizing these claims under international law, the Court follows the many cases holding that these causes of action are not cognizable under the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">The Court now turns to Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining ATS claims: torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Chiquita\u2019s first argument concerns whether Plaintiffs sufficiently allege that the AUC committed these four offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">\n<em>1. Primary Violations of International Law By the AUC</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">Chiquita argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining ATS claims fail because the complaints do not allege primary violations of international law by the AUC and, therefore, there are no offenses for which it can be found secondarily liable. Specifically, Chiquita argues that (1) Plaintiffs do not plead the requisite state action with respect to the AUC\u2019s alleged offenses, and therefore fail to plead a necessary element for the torture and extrajudicial killing claims; (2) Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege that the alleged torture and killing were war crimes; and (3) Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege that the alleged torture and killing were crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">\n<em>a. State-Action Requirement for Torture and Extrajudicial-Killing Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">Torture and extrajudicial killings are recognized violations of the law of nations under the ATS. <em>See, e.g., Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1265 n. 15; <em>Romero v. Drummond Co., </em>552 F.3d 1303, 1316 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 234. For ATS purposes, the Eleventh Circuit has adopted the definition of torture set forth by the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, G.A. Res. 39/46, U.N. GAOR, U.N. Doc. A/39/51 (1984). This convention defines torture as the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, on a person for the purposes of obtaining information or a confession, punishment, intimidation or coercion, or discrimination. <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1252. The Eleventh Circuit has not specifically addressed the elements of an extrajudicial-killing claim under the ATS. Under the analogous TVPA, however, the Eleventh Circuit explains that extrajudicial-killing is defined as a deliberate killing not previously authorized by a regularly constituted court affording recognized judicial guarantees. <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d 1252 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 note \u00a7 3(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>As with most ATS claims, torture and extrajudicial killing are cognizable only when committed by state actors or under color of law. <em>See, e.g., Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1265; <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1247; <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 234. To plead state action for ATS purposes, the Eleventh Circuit \u201cdemand[s] allegations of a symbiotic relationship\u201d between the private actor and the government. <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1266; <em>see also Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1317 (adopting same symbiotic-relationship standard in the context of torture and extrajudicial-killings claims under the TVPA). Under this symbiotic-relationship standard, Plaintiffs must assert \u201cmore than allegations of a general, joint-relationship between the government and the alleged state actor.\u201d <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 8. Allegations of \u201cColombia\u2019s mere \u2018registration and toleration of private security forces does not transform those forces\u2019 acts into state acts.\u2019\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1266 (quoting <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1248). Rather, Plaintiffs must allege a close relationship between the government and the AUC that \u201c \u2018involves the torture or killing alleged in the complaint to satisfy the requirement of state action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1317); <em>see also Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1317 (\u201c[P]roof of a general relationship is not enough. The relationship must involve the subject of the complaint.\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">Chiquita contends that Plaintiffs have not adequately pleaded the state-action requirement for these claims. The complaints, Chiquita argues, rely upon generalized allegations of collusion between Colombian authorities and the paramilitaries that are similar to those found insufficient in <em>Sinaltrainal. </em>Chiquita concedes that the complaints allege that the \u201cColombian government helped create, promote and finance paramilitaries, was complicit in paramilitary operations, participated in certain paramilitary massacres, and delegated certain government functions to the paramilitaries.\u201d' Second Mot. at 24 (DE 295). Chiquita concludes, however, that these allegations fail because they do not assert any \u201cgovernment involvement in any of the more than one thousand violent acts at issue here,\u201d and therefore fail to plead the requisite government involvement in the \u201c \u2018murder and torture alleged in the complaints.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1266).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">As an initial matter, the Court disagrees with Chiquita\u2019s argument that to plead state action Plaintiffs must allege government involvement in the specific torture and killings of Plaintiffs\u2019 specific relatives. While the symbiotic relationship must involve \u201cthe torture or killing alleged in the complaint,\u201d <em>Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1317, the \u201cEleventh Circuit has approved a district court exercising this standard by inquiring whether \u2018the symbiotic relationship between the paramilitaries and the Colombian military had anything to do with the conduct at issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 11 (quoting <em>Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1317). Here, the conduct at issue is the AUC\u2019s torture and killing of thousands of civilians in Colombia\u2019s banana-growing regions, torture and killing which allegedly harmed or killed Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives. This Court finds that to plead state action at the motion-to-dismiss stage, Plaintiffs must allege a symbiotic relationship between the Colombian <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1326\">*1326</page-number>government and the AUC with respect to the AUC\u2019s campaign of torture and killing of civilians in the banana-growing regions, not specific government involvement with each individual act of torture and killing of Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives. Such allegations suffice to show a \u201crelationship [that] involved] the subject of the complaint.\u201d <em>Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1317; <em>see also Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 12-13 (finding that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged a symbiotic relationship with respect to the killings alleged in the complaint based on allegations that the defendant paid the AUC with the intent to assist the AUC\u2019s war crimes and with the knowledge that the AUC would direct its war efforts in the areas in which the plaintiffs\u2019 decedents lived.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">Turning to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, the Court finds that the complaints allege facts regarding a direct, symbiotic relationship between the Colombian government and the AUC that involves the AUC\u2019s torture and killing of civilians in the banana-growing regions of Uraba and Magdalena. For example, the complaints allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-5\">\u2022 [D]espite the official criminalization of the paramilitaries, they became a central component of the government\u2019s strategy to win the civil war. At all times relevant to this complaint, the AUC and other paramilitary groups in fact collaborated closely with the Colombian government and were used by the government to oppose anti-government guerrilla groups like the FARC.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-6\">\u2022 As part of the Colombian government\u2019s strategy for defeating the left-wing insurgency, senior officials in the Colombian civilian government and the Colombian security forces collaborated with the AUC and assisted the paramilitaries in orchestrating attacks on civilian populations, extra-judicial killings, murders, disappearances, forced displacements, threats and intimidation against persons including Plaintiffs.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-8\">\u2022 As a result of this interdependence, longstanding and pervasive ties have existed between the paramilitaries and official Colombian security forces from the beginning. In the 1980s, paramilitaries were partially organized and armed by the Colombian military and participated in the campaigns of the official armed forces against guerrilla insurgents. Paramilitary forces included active-duty and retired army and police personnel among their members.... Cooperation with paramilitaries has been demonstrated in half of Colombia\u2019s eighteen brigade-level Army units, spread across all of the Army\u2019s regional divisions. Such cooperation is so pervasive that the paramilitaries are referred to by many in Colombia as the \u201cSixth Division\u201d \u2014 a reference to their close integration with the five official divisions of the Colombian Army.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-9\">\u2022 Senior officers in the Colombian military, including but not limited to former Military Forces Commanders Major General Manuel Bonett, General Harold Bedoya, Vice Admiral Rodrigo Quinones, Gen.

Paramilitary leaders noted that Colombian security forces in Uraba allowed members of the AUC to serve as proxies in their pursuit of guerrilla forces, largely due to the military\u2019s operative incapacity to defeat the guerrillas on its own.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-6\">\u2022 Colombian security forces in Uraba \u2014 \u25a0 with the knowledge and collaboration of high-level officials in the national government \u2014 have willfully failed to prevent or interrupt the crimes of the AUC, actively conspired with them, and coordinated activities with them.

An alliance was formed between politicians, active military units, multinational companies, businessmen, and paramilitaries in order to impose a regime of terror and consolidate the dominance of the AUC, which would wrest control of the countryside back from the leftist guerrillas. The first paramilitary groups to operate in Uraba in a systematic and continuous manner received special training from the Colombian military.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1365-19\">\u2022 When the government or the military was not able to legally arrest or attack civilians, they would delegate the task to the AUC or to <em>convivir </em>associated with the paramilitaries to act on their behalf.

For example, the Elmer Cardenas Bloc of the AUC regularly received logistical support and transportation from the 17th Brigade and other units of the Colombian army and conducted joint operations with the 17th Brigade. General Rito Alejo del Rio Rojas, the commander of the 17th Brigade from 1995 to 1997 who was responsible for military operations in Uraba, was notorious for his collaboration and collusion with paramilitaries in the region.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1366-5\">\u2022 General del Rio was finally arrested in 2008 ....

These allegations provide detailed facts of the government\u2019s role in creating, financing, promoting, and collaborating with the AUC in the common objective of fighting the leftist guerrillas. This cooperation involves joint membership, intelligence sharing, and the government\u2019s role in training and arming the AUC. The complaints then link this close relationship to the campaign of torture and killing in the banana-growing regions \u2014 i.e., the subject of the complaints \u2014 including allegations that the government and the AUC jointly planned and carried out specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>attacks against civilian villages in Uraba. This is more than a \u201cformulaic recitation\u201d of a symbiotic relationship between the AUC and the Colombian government. <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.Bd at 1266. Plaintiffs have alleged ample facts supporting the requisite state-action elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\">These detailed facts distinguish the allegations here from those found insufficient in <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>upon which Chiquita principally relies in its second motion to dismiss. There, the plaintiffs\u2019 conclusorily alleged that the paramilitaries were \u201cpermitted to exist,\u201d were \u201cassisted by the Colombian government,\u201d that the government \u201ctolerate[d] the paramilitaries, allowed] them to operate, and often cooperate[d], protected] and/or work[ed] in concert with them.\u201d 578 F.3d at 1266. The plaintiffs also made \u201cthe naked allegation the paramilitaries were in a symbiotic relationship with the Colombian government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Eleventh Circuit found that (1) the \u201cconclusory allegation that the paramilitary security forces acted under color of law is not entitled to be assumed true and is insufficient to allege state-sponsored action,\u201d and (2) that the allegations that the Colombian government \u201ctolerated and permitted the paramilitary forces to exist are insufficient to plead the paramilitary forces were state actors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs allege many facts supporting their allegations of a symbiotic relationship, and those allegations are therefore not conclusory. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe plaintiffs\u2019 \u2018formulaic recitation\u2019 that the paramilitary forces were in a symbiotic relationship and were assisted by the Colombian government, <em>absent any factual allegations to support this legal conclusion, </em>is insufficient to state an allegation of state action that is plausible on its face.\u201d) (emphasis added). Moreover, Plaintiffs\u2019 do not merely allege that the government \u201ctolerated and permitted\u201d the AUC\u2019s activity; the complaints allege the government\u2019s active participation in the AUC\u2019s activity. Thus, unlike <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>where there was \u201cno suggestion the Colombian government was involved in, much less aware of, the murder and torture alleged in the complaints,\u201d <em>id., </em>Plaintiffs here provide detailed allegations of the government\u2019s close cooperation with the AUC regarding the torture and killing alleged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-7\">Chiquita also argues, in its first motion to dismiss, that the complaints allege that Colombian law currently prohibits assisting paramilitaries and that the Colombian government is currently investigating and prosecuting officials for ties to the AUC. Chiquita contends that these facts are inconsistent with the notion that the AUC was acting under color of law. This argument is unavailing. First, the government\u2019s <em>current </em>investigations and prosecutions are not relevant to its alleged <em>past </em>relationship with the AUC. Second, that government officials are currently being investigated and prosecuted for ties to the AUC is not inconsistent with, and indeed may support, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that a symbiotic relationship existed between the government and the AUC during the time of the alleged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-8\">The Court thus concludes that the complaints sufficiently allege that the AUC acted under color of law when it committed the offenses alleged in the complaints. Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 torture and extrajudicial-killings claims will not be dismissed for failure to plead state action.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1331\">*1331</page-number>\n<em>b. War Crimes.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">War crimes are recognized violations of the law of nations under the ATS. <em>See, e.g., Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1266-67; <em>Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 256; <em>Radio, </em>70 F.3d at 242-43. Such a claim is cognizable under the ATS if Plaintiffs can establish (1) there was an armed conflict, (2) the AUC was a party to the conflict, (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives were not active participants in the conflict, and (4) Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives were tortured or killed in the course of hostilities. <em>See Radio, </em>70 F.3d at 243 (applying the war crimes definition from Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention); <em>see also Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 257 (adopting <em>Radio\u2019s </em>war crimes standard); <em>In re Sinaltrainal Litig., </em>474 F.Supp.2d 1273, 1287 (S.D.Fla.2006) (same); <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 14 (same). Unlike claims for torture and extrajudicial killing, a claim for war crimes does not require state action. <em>See Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1267 (holding that the \u201cwar crimes exception dispenses with the state action requirement.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cSome acts, such as torture and murder committed in the course of war crimes, violate the law of nations regardless of whether the perpetrator acted under color of law of a foreign nation or only as a private individual.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">Chiquita argues that it cannot be secondarily liable because Plaintiffs fail to plead that the AUC committed a primary violation of international law. The parties agree that the civil war in Colombia between the Colombian government and the guerrilla organizations was an armed conflict and that the AUC was a party to that conflict. Thus, the controlling issue here is the third element of a war crimes claim: whether the AUC committed its alleged violence \u201cin the course of hostilities.\u201d Case law does not provide any clear definition of this requirement. In <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>the Eleventh Circuit clarified that this \u201cin the course of\u2019 element requires that the crimes be committed \u201cbecause of the ongoing civil war.\u201d 578 F.3d at 1267. This requires more than merely alleging that the offenses occurred \u201cduring\u201d an armed conflict. <em>Id.; see also In re XE Servs. Alien Tort Litig., </em>665 F.Supp.2d 569, 585 (E.D.Va.2009) (\u201c[A] more substantial relationship must exist between the armed conflict and the alleged conduct than the mere fact that the conduct occurred while an armed conflict was ongoing.\u201d). Plaintiffs must allege a nexus between the AUC\u2019s alleged violence and the Colombian civil war. <em>See, e.g., In re XE Servs., </em>665 F.Supp.2d at 585 (\u201c[PJlaintiffs must allege a nexus to the armed conflict in order to state a valid claim for war crimes under the ATS....

For instance, the complaints allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1369-11\">\u2022 All of the Plaintiffs\u2019 decedents were merely innocent civilians executed in the course of the conflict between the AUC and the FARC....

While the AUC periodically engaged in direct combat with armed guerrilla forces, the vast majority of its victims were civilians. The AUC claimed that it was justified in targeting civilians with no known ties to guerrillas because guerrilla groups required the logistical support of local towns in order to operate in the region. Carlos Casta\u00f1o, the AUC leader, described this strategy as \u201cquitarle agua al pez\u201d (draining the water to catch the fish), as the AUC sought to intimidate and coerce civilians to prevent them from providing support to guerrillas.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-5\">\u2022 The AUC and other paramilitaries were parties to this armed conflict that engaged in combat with guerrilla armies on behalf of the government; they committed the abuses against Plaintiffs and decedents as part of their prosecution of this conflict.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1370-6\">\u2022 Decedents were not killed simply against the background of war; rather, the use of criminal violence and intimidation against civilians was part of the war strategy against the FARC agreed on by the AUC and the Colombian Government____The AUC used extremely violent means to take back areas held by the FARC and employed tactics of violence and terror to target civilians regardless of whether they were participants in the civil war, with the intention of discouraging civilians from supporting the leftist guerrillas....

The paramilitaries broke down the door to the home, found Pablo Perez 50 and seized him, tied him up and forced him to accompany them at gunpoint, beating him as they kidnaped him. Pablo Perez 50\u2019s corpse was found the following morning with signs of torture and two gunshots, one to the head and one to the body.

The paramilitaries demanded to know where Pablo Perez 60 had weapons hidden. Finding no weapons, the paramilitaries kidnaped Pablo Perez 60 and took him to the village of Nueva Colonia....

Furthermore, these allegations provide factual support linking the AUC\u2019s killing and torture, carried out in furtherance of its war against the FARC, to the Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives. These factual contentions sufficiently allege that the unrest in Colombia did not merely \u201cprovide[] the background for the unfortunate events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>that unfolded,\u201d but that the \u201ccivil war ... precipitate[d] the violence that befell plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1267.</p>\n<p id=\"AXe\">c. <em>Crimes Against Humanity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1372-4\">Chiquita first argues that a claim for crimes against humanity is not cognizable under the ATS. Chiquita contends that \u201cunder <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>cautious approach,\u201d crimes against humanity is too ambiguous a norm to satisfy Sosa\u2019s definiteness requirement for recognizing violations of the law of nations. First Mot. at 65 n. 60 (DE 93); Second Mot. at 27 n. 28 (DE 295). Chiquita does not cite any case law for this argument. Based on Eleventh Circuit, and other circuit, case law recognizing crimes against humanity as an actionable claim under the ATS, the Court rejects Chiquita\u2019s argument. <em>See Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1161; <em>see also Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 762, 124 S.Ct. 2739 (Breyer, J., concurring) (\u201cToday international law will sometimes similarly reflect not only substantive agreement as to certain universally condemned behavior but also procedural agreement that universal jurisdiction exists to prosecute a subset of that behavior. That subset includes torture, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.\u201d) (internal citation omitted); <em>Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 256 (\u201cPlaintiffs assert that Talisman aided and abetted (and conspired with) the Government in the commission of three violations of international law: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. All three torts may be asserted under the ATS.\u201d); <em>Sarei, </em>487 F.3d at 1202 (\u201cPlaintiffs here have alleged several claims asserting jus cogens violations that form the least controversial core of modern day ATCA jurisdiction, including allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and racial discrimination.\u201d); <em>Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 236 (\u201c[W]e hold that subject-matter jurisdiction exists, [and] that Karadzic may be found liable for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity .... \u201d); <em>Flores, </em>414 F.3d at 244 n. 18 (\u201cCustomary international law rules proscribing crimes against humanity ... have been enforceable against individuals since World War II.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-7\">Next, Chiquita argues that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that the AUC committed crimes against humanity. Crimes against humanity include murder, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer, torture, rape or other inhumane acts committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population. <em>See, e.g., Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1161; <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1247; <em>Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 257; <em>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>453 F.Supp.2d 633, 670 (S.D.N.Y.2006). A \u201cwidespread attack is one conducted on a large scale against many people, while a systematic attack is an organized effort to engage in violence.\u201d <em>Talisman, </em>453 F.Supp.2d at 670. Crimes against humanity require \u201cproof of numerous attacks.\u201d <em>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>226 F.R.D. 456, 479 n. 24 (S.D.N.Y.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-8\">Chiquita contends that crimes against humanity is not an exception to the state-action requirement, and that Plaintiffs\u2019 failed to adequately plead state ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>tion. The Court rejects the former part of this argument and therefore need not address the latter. While it is true that the Eleventh Circuit has never directly held that crimes against humanity are an exception to the ATS\u2019s state-action requirement, it has never been presented with that issue. Courts that have addressed this issue hold that crimes-against-humanity claims under the ATS do not require state action. <em>See, e.g., Kadic, </em>70 F.3d at 236 (\u201cThe pending appeals pose additional significant issues as to the scope of the Alien Tort Act: whether some violations of the law of nations may be remedied when committed by those not acting under the authority of a state; if so, whether genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity are among the violations that do not require state action.... [W]e hold that subject-matter jurisdiction exists [and] that Karadzic may be found liable for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity in his private capacity .... \u201d); <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 17 (ruling that a claim for crimes against humanity does not require state-action allegations). Even if state action were required to state a claim for crimes against humanity, as discussed above Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the AUC acted under color of law in attacking the civilian populations of the Uraba and Magdalena regions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Chiquita next argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of crimes against humanity are conclusory and failed plead facts tying the alleged killings and injuries to a \u201cwidespread or systematic attack.\u201d Thus, Chiquita contends, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail to meet Iqbal\u2019s pleading requirements. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1951 (explaining that conclusory allegations, devoid of factual support, are not entitled to the presumption of truth on a motion to dismiss). The Court disagrees and finds that the complaints sufficiently allege facts of both widespread and systematic attacks by the AUC against civilians.</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-9\">Although the Eleventh Circuit has not defined \u201cwidespread or systematic\u201d attacks, several district courts have provided persuasive analyses on this requirement. The concept of \u201cwidespread\u201d action has been defined as \u201c \u2018massive, frequent, large-scale action, carried out collectively with considerable seriousness and directed against a multiplicity of victims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bowoto v.

The paramilitaries attempted to rape Juana Perez 1, the petitioner, but were ordered to stop by an unidentified paramilitary leader.

Upon leaving the village, the paramilitaries forcibly disappeared over thirty more people and compelled most of the residents to flee.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXb\">The allegations include the killing, torture, or disappearances of thousands of specific individuals, which establishes that the action was \u201cwidespread.\u201d The allegations also discuss the planning and organization that occurred before and during the attacks, which establishes that the action was \u201csystematic.\u201d Additionally, the complaints provide detailed facts regarding the AUC\u2019s attacks, including the manner of attack, specific perpetrators, specific victims, locations, motivations underlying the attacks, and in many cases specific dates. Such detailed allegations, tying the victims\u2019 injuries to the AUC\u2019s attacks, are not conelusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-6\">These allegations are distinguishable from <em>Aldana, </em>upon which Chiquita relies, where the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 crimes-against-humanity claims. There, the Eleventh Circuit first reasoned that \u201csuch crimes were not expressly plead in the complaint.\u201d 416 F.3d at 1247. Second, the court found that the requirement of a \u201cwidespread or systematic attack against civilian populations\u201d was not alleged \u201cin the complaint, but instead in Plaintiffs\u2019 appellate brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). And third, the court found that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201creliance\u2014 found exclusively in the appellate brief \u2014 on alleged systematic and widespread efforts against organized labor in Guatemala is too tenuous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints provide detailed allegations of crimes against humanity that are sufficient to plead this cause of action. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not merely plead widespread and systematic \u201cefforts\u201d against a general class, such as \u201corganized labor,\u201d but instead specifically allege widespread and systematic killing, torture, and disappearances against Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives. The three factors upon which <em>Aldana </em>relied are thus not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-11\">Last, the Court notes that there is nothing inconsistent with Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that, on the one hand, the AUC tortured and killed as part of their military campaign against the FARC and, on the other hand, intentionally attacked non-combatant civilians. The complaints allege that the AUC attacked civilians as a means of depriving the FARC of a civilian support base.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The civilians were targeted <em>as civilians, </em>not as participants in the civil war.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>The Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged detailed facts supporting the requisite elements of their crimes-against-humanity claims.

Chiquita\u2019s Secondary Liability for the AUC\u2019s Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-5\">While the complaints sufficiently allege international-law violations against the AUC, Chiquita\u2019s liability must rest on a well-pled theory of indirect liability.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The Court thus turns to whether the complaints adequately plead Chiquita\u2019s secondary liability. The Court must (1) determine whether Plaintiffs\u2019 various secondary-liability theories are recognized in the ATS context, and, if so, (2) determine the appropriate standards for these theories, and (3) assess whether the complaints allege sufficient facts to support these indirect-liability theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-6\">\n<em>a. Secondary Liability Under the Law of Nations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-7\">Chiquita first argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 indirect-liability theories are not recognized under international law. Plaintiffs\u2019 first theory for Chiquita\u2019s liability is that Chiquita\u2019s support to the AUC renders it liable for aiding and abetting the AUC\u2019s unlawful acts. While acknowledging that the Eleventh Circuit recognized aiding and abetting liability under the ATS in <em>Cabello v. Femandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148 (11th Cir.2005) and <em>Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh Produce, N.A., </em>416 F.3d 1242 (11th Cir.2005), Chiquita argues that these precedents do not support the broad aiding and abetting theory advanced by Plaintiffs here. The Eleventh Circuit, Chiquita argues, recognizes aiding and abetting liability under the ATS only for <em>specific </em>assistance in the commission of a <em>specific </em>tort. Chiquita contends that here, by contrast, Plaintiffs take the position that Chiquita\u2019s payments to the AUC for \u201cany reason\u201d render it liable for \u201cany violent act committed by any member of the AUC ... for any reason.\u201d First Mot. at 40 (DE 93). The Court disagrees with Chiquita\u2019s readings of both Eleventh Circuit precedent and Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1376-10\">First, the Court does not interpret the Eleventh Circuit case law on this issue as imposing Chiquita\u2019s proposed limitation on aiding and abetting liability. In <em>Cabello, </em>the plaintiffs alleged that the defendant, a Chilean military officer in a unit responsible for killing political opponents, assisted in killing the plaintiffs\u2019 relative, Mr. Cabello. 402 F.3d at 1152. The complaint alleged that the defendant and five other officers arrived at a military garrison and instructed local officers to provide them with prisoners\u2019 files from which the squad selected thirteen prisoners, including Mr. Cabello, for execution. <em>Id. </em>The complaint alleged that the squad then drove the prisoners ten minutes outside the garrison, ordered them out of the truck, and executed them. <em>Id. </em>Based on the defendant\u2019s involvement in locating and selecting the prisoners and his presence at the executions, the plaintiffs brought claims against him under the ATS and TVPA. With respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 indirect theories of liability, the court held that \u201cby their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>terms, the ATCA and TVPA are not limited to claims of direct liability. The courts that have addressed the issue have held that the ATCA reaches conspiracies and accomplice liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">In <em>Aldana, </em>the plaintiffs, Guatemalan labor unionists, alleged that the defendant, an American banana company operating in Guatemala, hired a private security force to quell union activity. 416 F.3d at 1245. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant\u2019s agents met with the security force to plan \u201cviolent action against the Plaintiffs and other [union] leaders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The security force arrived at the union\u2019s headquarters, held the plaintiffs hostage, and threatened to kill them. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs were then taken to a radio station to announce that their labor dispute was over and that they were resigning. <em>Id. </em>The plaintiffs were released after eight hours and told that they would be killed if they did not leave Guatemala. <em>Id. </em>Based on these allegations, the plaintiffs sued the American company for violations of the ATS and TVPA under aiding and abetting and conspiracy theories of liability. In holding that the complaint adequately alleged torture claims based on secondary liability, the court reaffirmed the holding in <em>Cabello </em>that the \u201cAlien Tort Act \u2018reaches conspiracies and accomplice liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248 (quoting <em>Cabello </em>402 F.3d at 1157).</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\"><em>Cabello </em>and <em>Aldana </em>thus establish that aiding and abetting, or accomplice liability, is a recognized theory of indirect liability under the ATS. While these cases involve assistance by the defendants that is arguably more direct than that alleged here \u2014 for instance, the defendant in <em>Cabello </em>was personally present during the alleged unlawful acts \u2014 the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding in each case was not based on this direct assistance. Rather, <em>Aldana </em>and <em>Cabello </em>broadly held that conspiracy and accomplice liability are recognized theories for secondary liability under the ATS. Neither the specific holdings nor the underlying reasoning of these decisions discussed Chiquita\u2019s proposed specific-versus-general assistance distinction. Chiquita\u2019s argument seems to go more towards whether Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled facts supporting indirect liability, a subject addressed below, and not whether such a theory is recognized under the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-8\">In any event, as discussed in detail below, Plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations are not as far-reaching as Chiquita\u2019s original characterization. That is, Plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations are based on payments made for <em>specific </em>purposes that render it liable only for <em>specific </em>violent acts committed for <em>specific </em>reasons. Thus, even accepting Chiquita\u2019s position that <em>Cabello </em>and <em>Aldana </em>recognize only indirect liability for specific assistance in the commission of a specific tort, Plaintiffs\u2019 amended allegations meet that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-9\">Chiquita also suggests that the continuing viability of aiding and abetting claims under the ATS is questionable after <em>Sosa. See </em>First Mot. at 40 n. 34 (DE 93) (citing, for example, <em>Doe I v. Exxon Mobil Corp., </em>393 F.Supp.2d 20, 24 (D.D.C.2005), which rejected aiding and abetting claims based on <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>admonitions that \u201cCongress should be deferred to with respect to innovative interpretations of the Alien Tort Statute\u201d and that courts should be \u201cmindful of the collateral consequences and possible foreign relations repercussions that would result from allowing courts in this country to hear civil suits for the aiding and abetting of violations of international norms across the globe\u201d (internal quotations marks omitted)). Although <em>Cabello </em>and <em>Aldana </em>were decided after <em>Sosa, </em>Chiquita argues that these decisions failed to consider <em>Sosa </em>in their discussion of aiding and abetting liability, relying instead on pre-Rosa case law. Accordingly, Chiquita <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>contends that the precedential value of these decisions is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-4\">The Court finds this argument unavailing. While <em>Cabello </em>and <em>Aldana </em>did not cite <em>Sosa </em>in their indirect-liability discussions, the Eleventh Circuit was presumably aware of the Supreme Court\u2019s leading ATS decision and presumably reached these holdings in accordance with <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>mandates. Indeed, the court cited <em>Sosa </em>throughout the <em>Aldana </em>opinion. Furthermore, more recent decisions from the Eleventh Circuit continue to hold that aiding and abetting is a recognized theory of indirect liability under the ATS. <em>See Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1258 n. 5 (\u201cThe ATS permits conspiracy and accomplice liability\u201d); <em>Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1315 (\u201c[T]he law of this Circuit permits a plaintiff to plead a theory of aiding and abetting liability under the Alien Tort Statute\u201d); <em>see also Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 259 (recognizing aiding and abetting liability for ATS claims); <em>Talisman, </em>453 F.Supp.2d at 668 (\u201cAiding and abetting liability is a specifically defined norm of international character that is properly applied as the law of nations for purposes of the ATS.\u201d). This Court cannot second guess the analyses underlying the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s binding precedent on this point. Under the law of this Circuit, aiding and abetting liability survives the limitations that <em>Sosa </em>placed upon ATS claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next theory of indirect liability is conspiracy. Chiquita argues that there is no universally accepted norm of conspiracy liability under international law and, consequently, Plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy-liability claims are not cognizable under the ATS. As <em>Sinaltrainal, Aldana, </em>and <em>Cabello </em>make clear, however, in the Eleventh Circuit conspiracy is a recognized theory of indirect liability for ATS claims. <em>See Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1258 n. 5 (\u201cThe ATS permits conspiracy and accomplice liability\u201d); <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1248 (\u201cThe Alien Tort Act reaches conspiracies\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1157 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-7\">Chiquita contends, however, that after <em>Cabello </em>and <em>Aldana, </em>the Supreme Court, in <em>Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, </em>548 U.S. 557, 126 S.Ct. 2749, 165 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), explained that under international law, conspiracy liability is limited to conspiracies to commit genocide or wage aggressive war, categories that are not applicable here. <em>See Hamdan, </em>548 U.S. at 610, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (\u201c[I]nternational sources confirm that the crime charged here [conspiracy] is not a recognized violation of the law of war.... And the only \u2018conspiracy\u2019 crimes that have been recognized by international war crimes tribunals ... are conspiracy to commit genocide and common plan to wage aggressive war.... \u201d). This Court finds that the Supreme Court\u2019s statement in <em>Hamdan </em>is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-8\">First, the plurality in <em>Hamdan </em>addressed conspiracy as an inchoate offense, not as a theory of accessorial liability for the commission of <em>other </em>recognized offenses. <em>See id. </em>at 566-67, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (explaining that Hamdan was charged with one count for \u201cthe crime of conspiracy\u201d). Accordingly, Hamdan\u2019s statement limiting conspiracy (as an inchoate crime) to genocide and waging aggressive war is inapplicable here where Plaintiffs\u2019 assert conspiracy as a theory of indirect liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-9\">Second, the <em>Hamdan </em>plurality\u2019s statement limiting conspiracy to two categories was based on the \u201claw of war,\u201d not the law of nations. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[I]nternational sources confirm that the crime charged here [conspiracy] is not a recognized violation of the law of war.\u201d). The law of nations is a broader body of law. <em>See, e.g., Application of Yamashita, </em>327 U.S. 1, 7, 66 S.Ct. 340, 90 L.Ed. 499 (1946) (referring to \u201cthe Law of Nations, of which the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>war is a part\u201d); <em>al-Marri v. Pucciarelli, </em>534 F.3d 213, 315 (4th Cir.2008) (Wilkinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cThe law of war represents a distinct canon of the Law of Nations.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Khulumani </em>504 F.3d at 270 n. 6 (Katzmann, J., concurring) (\u201cThe law of war has long been recognized as a subset of international law.\u201d). Thus, in limiting criminal conspiracy liability under the law of a war, <em>Hamdan </em>did not speak to conspiracy liability under the broader law of nations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">Last, the Eleventh Circuit has recognized, in decisions both before and after <em>Hamdan, </em>that conspiracy as a theory of accessorial liability under the ATS applies to claims beyond genocide and a common plan to wage aggressive war. <em>See Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1258 <em>&amp; </em>n. 5 (holding that a conspiracy theory of indirect liability is applicable to torture claims); <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1247-48 (same); <em>Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1151, 1157 (holding that a conspiracy theory of indirect liability is applicable to claims for extrajudicial killing, torture, and crimes against humanity). This Court thus holds that under the law of this Circuit, conspiracy is a recognized theory of secondary liability under the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">Plaintiffs also assert an agency theory for Chiquita\u2019s secondary liability, relying on domestic agency-law principles. Chiquita argues that agency liability is not recognized under international law. Neither side provides any authority directly recognizing or rejecting agency liability under international law. This alone suggests that there is no well-established international consensus for imposing secondary liability on entities whose agents violate international law, a fact that balances against recognizing agency liability under the ATS. <em>See, e.g., Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 259. However, because, as discussed below, the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to allege facts supporting their proposed agency theory, the Court does not determine whether customary international law recognizes agency as a form of secondary liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">\n<em>b. Secondary-Liability Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-9\">The Court turns now to consider the appropriate standards for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability. The parties primarily dispute the <em>mens rea </em>requirement for indirect liability and from which body of law to derive that requirement. Plaintiffs argue that federal common-law standards apply for aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under the ATS. Plaintiffs point to <em>Cabello, </em>in which the Eleventh Circuit recognized conspiracy liability under the ATS. Cabello\u2019s conspiracy ruling, in turn, relied on <em>Halberstam v. Welch, </em>705 F.2d 472, 481 (D.C.Cir.1983), a decision setting forth the conspiracy standard in the domestic, federal common-law context. <em>See Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1159 (\u201cFor the jury to find Fernandez indirectly liable by means of conspiracy, the Cabello survivors need to prove ... (1) two or more persons agreed to commit a wrongful act, (2) Fernandez joined the conspiracy knowing of at least one of the goals of the conspiracy and intending to help accomplish it, and (3) one or more of the violations was committed by someone who was a member of the conspiracy and acted in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d) (citing <em>Halberstam, </em>705 F.2d at 487); <em>see also Halberstam, </em>705 F.2d at 487 (explaining, in a domestic civil action, the federal common-law standard for conspiracy). Plaintiffs contend that \u201c[i]n adopting the federal common law of conspiracy, the Eleventh Circuit necessarily found that federal common law governs complicity liability,\u201d and there \u201cis no basis to conclude the court would not also adopt the federal common law of aiding and abetting.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Second Resp. at 8 (DE 321). Plaintiffs conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>that the applicable standard from <em>Cabello </em>requires only knowing substantial assistance to the primary tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">Chiquita argues that the standards for indirect liability under the ATS must be drawn from international, not federal, law. Chiquita relies on the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Presbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talisman Energy, Inc., </em>582 F.3d 244 (2d Cir.2009), which held that <em>Sosa </em>directs courts to international law to determine standards for secondary liability. <em>Id. </em>at 259 <em>{\u201cSosa </em>and our precedents send us to international law to find the standard for accessorial liability.\u201d). <em>Talisman </em>rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument \u201cthat aiding and abetting liability is a matter ordinarily left to the forum country,\u201d explaining that \u201csuch an expansion would violate <em>Sosa\u2019s </em>command that we limit liability to \u2018violations of ... international law ... with ... definite content and acceptance among civilized nations [equivalent to] the historical paradigms familiar when \u00a7 1350 was enacted.\u2019 Recognition of secondary liability is no less significant a decision than whether to recognize a whole new tort in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 732, 124 S.Ct. 2739) (alterations in original). The court then held that under customary international law, \u201cthe <em>mens rea </em>standard for aiding and abetting liability in ATS actions is purpose rather than knowledge alone.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>(\u201cEven if there is a sufficient international consensus for imposing liability on individuals who <em>purposefully </em>aid and abet a violation of international law, no such consensus exists for imposing liability on individuals who <em>knowingly </em>(but not purposefully) aid and abet a violation of international law.\u201d) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). <em>Talisman </em>thus approved the two-part test set forth in a concurring opinion in <em>Khulumani v. Barclay Nat\u2019l Bank Ltd., </em>504 F.3d 254 (2d Cir.2007): a defendant may be liable for aiding and abetting an international-law violation of another when \u201cthe defendant (1) provides practical assistance to the principal which has a substantial effect on the perpetration of the crime, and (2) does so with the purpose of facilitating the commission of that crime.\u201d <em>Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 258 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court similarly held that a conspiracy theory of secondary liability \u201crequire[s] the same proof of <em>mens rea </em>as ... claims for aiding and abetting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260. Thus, under <em>Talisman, </em>aiding and abetting and conspiracy theories of indirect liability for ATS claims are governed by international law\u2019s purpose standard. It is this purpose standard that Chiquita argues applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">First, this Court agrees with <em>Talisman, </em>as well as many other courts, that under <em>Sosa </em>the appropriate standard for secondary liability under the ATS should be derived from international law. <em>See Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 259; <em>see also Sosa, </em>542 U.S. at 732 &amp; n. 20,124 S.Ct. 2739 (observing that \u201cwhether a norm is sufficiently definite to support a cause of action\u201d under the ATS involves a \u201crelated consideration [of] whether international law extends the scope of liability for a violation of a given norm to the perpetrator being sued\u201d); <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 268-69 (Natzmann, J., concurring) (\u201cThe district court\u2019s conclusion that its jurisdiction under the ATCA should depend on whether international law specifically recognizes liability for aiding and abetting violations of the law of nations is consistent with our prior case law. We have repeatedly emphasized that the scope of the ATCA\u2019s jurisdictional grant should be determined by reference to international law.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 330-31 (Norman, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing with Judge Natzmann\u2019s conclusion that the standard for aiding and abetting liability under the ATS must derive from international law); <em>Abecassis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>704 F.Supp.2d at 654 <em>(\u201cSosa </em>establishes international law as the touchstone of the ATS analysis.... There is no reason to believe that international law determines whether private \u2014 as well as state \u2014 actors can be sued but not whether secondary\u2014 as well as primary \u2014 actors can be sued.\u201d); <em>Aziz v. Republic of Iraq, </em>No. 09-cv-00869, DE 51, Slip op. at 11 (D. Md. June 9, 2010) (adopting <em>Talisman\u2019s </em>international-law standard for aiding and abetting liability); <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, Slip op. at 20-21 <em>&amp; </em>n. 21 (applying the international-law standard for aiding and abetting liability, reasoning that <em>\u201cSosa </em>supports the broader principle that the scope of liability for ATS violations should be derived from international law\u201d); <em>Doe v. Drummond Co., </em>No. 09-1041, Slip op. at 16, DE 37 (N.D.Ala. Nov. 9, 2009) <em>(\u201cDrummond I </em>\u201d) (\u201c[T]he international law standard applies to aiding and abetting claims brought under the ATS.\u201d)<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">In any event, there is no inconsistency between the standard set forth in <em>Cabello, </em>urged by Plaintiffs, and <em>Talisman\u2019s </em>standard, urged by Chiquita. That is, <em>Cabello </em>and <em>Talisman </em>both use a <em>purpose </em>standard for secondary liability. While <em>Cabello </em>does not use the term \u201cpurpose,\u201d its standard requires that the defendant \u201cjoin[] the conspiracy knowing of at least one of the goals of the conspiracy and <em>intending to help accomplish it.\u201d </em>402 F.3d at 1159 (emphasis added). The Court finds that this intent requirement is essentially the same as <em>Talisman\u2019s </em>purpose requirement. Contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 position, <em>Cabello </em>requires more than mere knowledge of the principal\u2019s unlawful goals. <em>Cabello, </em>like <em>Talisman, </em>requires that the defendant act with the <em>intention </em>of accomplishing the offense. Indeed, the court in <em>Talisman </em>specifically noted that its purpose standard was effectively the same as Cabello\u2019s intent standard. <em>See Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 260 n. 11 (\u201c[Plaintiffs would fare no better if we adopted their preferred definition of conspiracy, because that definition (derived from domestic law) also requires proof \u2018that ... [the defendant] joined the conspiracy <em>knowing of at least one of the goals of the conspiracy and intending to help accomplish it.\u2019 </em>\u201d) (quoting <em>Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1159) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">In sum, the Court holds that in order for Plaintiffs to allege that Chiquita is secondarily liable for the AUC\u2019s violations of international law, they must allege that Chiquita assisted or conspired with the AUC with the purpose or intent to facilitate the commission of the specific offenses alleged. Thus, to plead aiding and abetting liability, Plaintiffs must allege that (1) the AUC committed an international-law violation, (2) Chiquita acted with the purpose or intent to assist in that violation, and (3) Chiquita\u2019s assistance sub-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>stantially contributed to the AUC\u2019s commission of the violation.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> <em>See Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 258; <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 277 (Katzmann, J., concurring); <em>Doe v.

To plead conspiracy liability, Plaintiffs must allege that (1) Chiquita and the AUC agreed to commit a recognized international-law violation, (2) Chiquita joined the agreement with the purpose or intent to facilitate the commission of the violation, and (3) the AUC committed the violation. <em>Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1159; <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">Having determined the proper standards to apply to Plaintiffs\u2019 secondary-liability claims, the Court now considers whether Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support the elements of their remaining ATS claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">c. <em>Aiding and Abetting Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"AGr\">With respect to the first element of aiding and abetting liability, as discussed above Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that the AUC committed primary international-law violations for torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">With respect to the second element, the <em>mens rea, </em>Chiquita attacks the sufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of its intent to assist the AUC. Chiquita contends that Plaintiffs\u2019 do not allege that it acted with the specific purpose to facilitate the AUC\u2019s commission of torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. To allege the <em>mens rea </em>element for aiding and abetting liability, Plaintiffs need not allege that Chiquita specifically intended that the AUC torture or kill the specific individuals alleged in the complaint, i.e., Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives specifically. <em>See Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 22 n. 24 (\u201cThe court can find no authority for Defendants\u2019 contention that Drummond must have known of specific <em>identities </em>of those murdered, and have ordered the deaths of those specific individuals in order to potentially be held liable for aiding and abetting extrajudicial killings.... Without such authority, this court must conclude that, at this time, Plaintiffs have done enough to sufficiently allege aiding and abetting based upon their factual contention that Drummond purposefully participated in murders along its rail lines.\u201d) (emphasis in original). But Plaintiffs must allege more than the mere fact that Chiquita had knowledge that the AUC would commit such offenses. Plaintiffs must allege that Chiquita paid the AUC with the specific purpose that the AUC commit the international-law offenses alleged in the complaints. This requires that the complaints allege that Chiquita intended for the AUC to torture and kill civilians in Colombia\u2019s banana-growing re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>gions, which is the conduct that allegedly harmed or killed Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">The Court finds that, with one exception,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Plaintiffs\u2019 detailed and voluminous factual allegations meet this demanding pleading standard. For instance, the complaints allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-6\">\u2022 Chiquita supported terrorist groups in Colombia by paying them and assisting them to obtain arms and smuggle drugs. Chiquita knew that these groups used illegal violence against civilians and intended that they employ this strategy to quell social and labor unrest in the Northeast Colombian region of Uraba and safeguard the stability and profitability of Chiquita\u2019s enterprises in Colombia.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-7\">\u2022 From on or about September 10, 2001, through on or about February 4, 2004, Chiquita made 50 payments to the AUC totaling over $825,000.... Chiquita\u2019s acts of assistance to the AUC were made with the intent that the AUC continue carrying out acts of killing, torture, and other illegal violence against the civilian population of Uraba in accordance with the AUC\u2019s strategy for suppressing the FARC and deterring its sympathizers. In exchange for its financial support to the AUC, Chiquita was able to operate in an environment in which labor and community opposition was suppressed. Chiquita\u2019s assistance was not given out of duress; rather it was part and parcel of the company\u2019s proactive strategy to increase profitability and suppress labor unrest by exterminating the FARC in the Uraba region.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-11\">\u2022 The arrangement between Chiquita and the AUC was not one of duress; in fact, it was the banana companies that approached the AUC to initiate their relationship. Mario Iguaran, the former Attorney-General of Colombia, has charged that there was a criminal relationship between Chiquita and the AUC in which Chiquita supplied money and arms to the AUC in return for the \u201cbloody pacification of Uraba.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1383-12\">\u2022 As part of its deal with Chiquita, the AUC provided protection services to banana plantations, dealing out reprisals against real or suspected thieves, as well as against social undesirables, suspected guerrilla sympathizers or supporters, and anyone who was suspected of opposing the AUC\u2019s activities or social program. By arming and financing the AUC, Chiquita intended to benefit from the AUC\u2019s systematic killings of civilians. After its agreement with Chiquita, the AUC understood that one goal of its campaign of terror was to prevent work stoppages in the banana plantations.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>For example, one individual who worked in Chiquita\u2019s offices at a plantation in Uraba was present when paramilitaries arrived at the plantation and summarily executed a banana worker who had been seen as a troublemaker because his slow work held up the production line.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-4\">\u2022 Chiquita joined the conspiracy knowing that the AUC intended to fight the FARC by means of illegal violence against particular classes of civilians, and intending to help accomplish that goal.... Chiquita sought a meeting with the paramilitaries in late 1996 or early 1997 and concluded an agreement with the AUC whereby Chiquita paid the paramilitaries for their services supporting the banana plantations. These services consisted of threatening or killing civilians, including workers who attempted to strike, union leaders, alleged criminals, and small banana farmers who refused to sell or abandon their land.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-5\">\u2022 Chiquita intended that the AUC continue carrying out acts of killing, torture, and other illegal violence against the civilian population of Uraba in accordance with the AUC\u2019s strategy for suppressing the FARC and deterring its sympathizers. In providing the AUC with money and assistance with their arms and drug trafficking, Defendants intended that the AUC obtain arms and continue their practice of killing civilians, especially those civilians who were perceived as threats to the profitability of the banana industry. The leadership of the AUC did, in fact, carry out killings of union members, social organizers and other undesirable groups, as well as civilians with no known or suspected ties to the guerrillas, knowing that Chiquita expected and intended that they do so using the arms and money provided by Chiquita.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-8\">\u2022 Chiquita authorized the AUC\u2019s strategy of killing, torture, and other illegal violence against civilians in Uraba. The AUC\u2019s agreement with Chiquita involved forcing people to work using threats and illegal violence, as well as the quelling of labor and social unrest through the systematic terrorization of the population of Uraba.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1384-9\">\u2022 In late 1996 or early 1997, the Banadex general manager, and another Chiquita employee from Colombia, participated in a meeting of banana growers to discuss security issues arising from leftist guerilla activity in the Santa Marta and Uraba regions. The meeting was also attended by Carlos Casta\u00f1o, the leader of the AUC.... Casta\u00f1o asked Chiquita to support the AUC in its War effort against the leftist guerillas in two ways. First, Casta\u00f1o asked Chiquita to stop making payments to the leftist guerillas. Second, Casta\u00f1o asked Chiquita to begin paying the AUC. Casta\u00f1o informed Chiquita\u2019s executives that the AUC would use money it received from Chiquita to finance Paramilitary Terrorism Tactics that would be used to drive the leftist guerillas out of the Santa Marta and Uraba banana-growing regions; protect the company, its executives, employees, and infrastructure from future attacks by leftist guerillas; and create a business and work environment that would enable Chiquita\u2019s Colombian banana-growing operations to thrive.... Following the Casta\u00f1o Meeting, Chiquita knowingly and intentionally provided practical assistance and material support to enable the AUC to use Paramilitary Terrorism <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>Tactics for the purpose of [1] driving leftist guerillas out of the Santa Marta and Uraba banana regions; [2] maintaining control over the banana-growing regions; and [3] creating an environment where the company\u2019s banana-growing operations could prosper. According to information developed by the Attorney General for the Republic of Colombia, the agreement between Chiquita and the AUC constituted a \u201ccriminal relationship\u201d to bring about the \u201cbloody pacification\u201d of the banana-growing regions.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-5\">\u2022 According to Mangones [an AUC leader in the banana-growing region], during the period of time Chiquita made payments to the AUC, the AUC killed many civilians in the Santa Marta region as part of what the AUC \u201chad to do in order to win\u201d the War against the leftist guerillas. Among those killed by the AUC were some individuals targeted for assassination by Chiquita executives in Colombia.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-6\">\u2022 Chiquita made the payments to the AUC for the purpose of facilitating the AUC\u2019s ability to combat the leftist guerillas and employ the Paramilitary Terrorism Tactics for which it had become notorious, including massacres, extra-judicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, and forced displacements of civilians accused of being leftist guerillas and their sympathizers or supporters.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1385-7\">\u2022 Chiquita also used the AUC to resolve complaints and problems with banana workers and labor unions. Among other things, when individual banana workers became \u201csecurity problems,\u201d Chiquita notified the AUC, which responded to the company\u2019s instructions by executing the individual. According to AUC leaders, a large number of people were executed on Chiquita\u2019s instructions in the Santa Marta region.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1385-11\">These detailed factual allegations are neither \u201cvague\u201d nor \u201cconclusory.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1268.

The Court agrees, but finds that the complaints sufficiently allege the required facts regarding Chiquita\u2019s purpose. Because a primary claim for war crimes under the ATS requires that the alleged offenses be carried out in furtherance of a conflict, an aiding and abetting theory of war crimes must allege that Chiquita shared the principal\u2019s same purpose, i.e., to torture and kill as a means to defeat militarily its enemy. Based on similar allegations, the court in <em>Drummond II </em>characterized this pleading element as requiring allegations that the defendant assisted the AUC for the purpose of advancing the AUC\u2019s interests over the FARC\u2019s in the conflict. <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 24. That is, Plaintiffs must allege that the defendant \u201ctook a side\u201d in the conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 28. The complaints adequately allege that Chiquita assisted the AUC not only with the intent that the AUC commit torture and killings, but for the specific purpose that the AUC commit such acts in the course of its efforts to defeat the FARC:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-6\">\u2022 Chiquita\u2019s acts of assistance to the AUC were made with the intent that the AUC continue carrying out acts of killing, torture, and other illegal violence against the civilian population of Uraba in accordance with the AUC\u2019s strategy for suppressing the FARC and deterring its sympathizers____ Chiquita\u2019s assistance was not given out of duress; rather it was part and parcel of the company\u2019s proactive strategy to increase profitability and suppress labor unrest by exterminating the FARC in the Uraba region.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-9\">\u2022 Chiquita intended that the AUC continue carrying out acts of killing, torture, and other illegal violence against the civilian population of Uraba in accordance with the AUC\u2019s strategy for suppressing the FARC and deterring its sympathizers.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-10\">\u2022 Chiquita joined the conspiracy knowing that the AUC intended to fight the FARC by means of illegal violence against particular classes of civilians, and intending to help accomplish that goal.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-11\">\u2022 The manager of Chiquita\u2019s Colombia operations, Charles Kaiser, worked with the AUC to set up the <em>convivir </em>system to get funds to the AUC to defeat the FARC.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1386-12\">\u2022 At the Casta\u00f1o Meeting, and at all relevant times thereafter, Chiquita took sides with the AUC in the War against the leftist guerillas and helped to finance and assist the AUC\u2019s efforts in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>War.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-5\">\u2022 Chiquita made the payments to the AUC for the purpose of facilitating the AUC\u2019s ability to combat the leftist guerillas and employ the Paramilitary Terrorism Tactics for which it had become notorious, including massacres, extra-judicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, and forced displacements of civilians accused of being leftist guerillas and their sympathizers or supporters.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">The fact that Chiquita may not have had a military objective of its own, or that it was motivated by financial gain, is not dispositive. A \u201clack of motive does not negate intent to assist the underlying acts that may be war crimes.\u201d <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 25; <em>see also In re XE Servs., </em>665 F.Supp.2d at 587 (\u201cDefendants would require that the conduct allegedly constituting a war crime be committed in direct furtherance of a \u2018military objective.\u2019 Under this standard, an ATS action would not lie where defendants were motivated by ideology or the prospect of financial gain, as plaintiffs allege here. Indeed under defendants\u2019 proposed rule, it is arguable that nobody who receives a paycheck would ever be liable for war crimes.\u201d). The complaints\u2019 allegations that Chiquita assisted the AUC with the intent that the AUC\u2019s interests were furthered over the FARCs in the Colombian civil war sufficiently allege the <em>mens rea </em>for aiding and abetting the AUC\u2019s war crimes, irrespective of the fact that the company may have chosen the AUC\u2019s side for financial, as opposed to military, reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-9\">With respect to Chiquita\u2019s secondary liability for the AUC\u2019s crimes against humanity, Plaintiffs must allege that Chiquita not only intended for the AUC to torture and kill, but that Chiquita intended for the AUC to torture and kill <em>civilians. </em>The complaints contain such allegations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-10\">\u2022 Chiquita knew that these groups used illegal violence against civilians and intended that they employ this strategy to quell social and labor unrest in the Northeast Colombian region of Uraba and safeguard the stability and profitability of Chiquita\u2019s enterprises in Colombia.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-11\">\u2022 Chiquita intended that the AUC continue carrying out acts of killing, torture, and other illegal violence against the civilian population of Uraba in accordance with the AUC\u2019s strategy for suppressing the FARC and deterring its sympathizers. In providing the AUC with money ... Defendants intended that the AUC obtain arms and continue their practice of killing civilians, especially those civilians who were perceived as threats to the profitability of the banana industry.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1387-12\">In sum, the Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of Chiquita\u2019s intent to further the AUC\u2019s torture and killing of civilians in the banana-growing regions of Colombia adequately plead the <em>mens rea </em>for aiding and abetting liability, particularly in light of the fact that questions of intent are factual inquiries not appropriate for resolution on a motion to dismiss. <em>See, e.g., Chanel, Inc. v. Italian Activewear of Fla. Inc., </em>931 F.2d 1472, 1476 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cAs a general rule, a party\u2019s state of mind (such as knowledge or intent) is a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>of fact for the factfinder, to be determined after trial.\u201d).<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">Turning to the third and final element of aiding and abetting liability, Chiquita argues that the allegations do not establish that it provided \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the AUC. This argument is unavailing. \u201c[MJerely \u2018supplying a violator of the law of nations with funds\u2019 as part of a commercial transaction, without more, cannot constitute aiding and abetting a violation of international law.\u201d <em>Nestle, </em>748 F.Supp.2d at 1099 (quoting <em>In re South African Apartheid Litig., </em>617 F.Supp.2d at 269). However, if the defendant \u201cengages in additional assistance beyond financing, or engages in financing that is gratuitous or unrelated to any commercial purpose, the <em>actus reus </em>element has been satisfied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Plaintiffs allege that Chiquita facilitated arms shipments for the AUC, including AK-47 rifles and ammunition used by AUC units carrying out attacks in Uraba.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Moreover, Plaintiffs allege that Chiquita paid the AUC nearly every month for approximately seven years.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that these payments totaled over $1.7 million.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> According to the allegations, these payments were not for ordinary commercial purposes, but were specifically intended to assist the AUC\u2019s military campaign against the FARC.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>The Court finds that, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, these allegations of arms shipments and large and numerous payments to the AUC for use in its war against the FARC adequately allege that Chiquita substantially assisted the AUC\u2019s international-law violations committed in the course of its conflict with the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 have thus sufficiently alleged aiding and abetting liability for their torture, extrajudicial-killing, war-crimes, and crimes-against-humanity ATS claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AHb\">\n<em>d. Conspiracy Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">To plead conspiracy liability against Chiquita, Plaintiffs must allege that (1) Chiquita and the AUC agreed to commit a recognized international-law violation, (2) Chiquita joined the agreement with the purpose or intent to facilitate the commission of the violation, and (3) the AUC committed the violation. <em>Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1159; <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 29. As discussed above, the third element is satisfied here because the AUC committed primary violations of international law. With respect to the first element, Chiquita argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 factual allegations of an agreement are insufficient under <em>Iqbal </em>and <em>Sinaltrainal\u2019s </em>pleading standards. Specifically, Chiquita cites the district court opinion in <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>474 F.Supp.2d at 1293-96, for its position that allegations of names, dates, locations and terms of a conspiracy are required to be pled with particularity to survive a motion to dismiss. Chiquita then contends that the complaints fail to plead facts supporting these conspiracy elements. While the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Sinaltrainal </em>affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiffs\u2019 conspiracy allegations were insufficient, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decision was not premised on the lack of specificity in the allegations regarding these items. Rather, the court\u2019s holding was based upon the failure of the \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 attenuated chain of conspiracy ... to nudge their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1268. The court there found the conspiracy allegations insufficient because they rested on \u201cunwarranted deductions of fact,\u201d failed to \u201cprovide any factual content,\u201d were \u201cvague and conclusory,\u201d and failed to define \u201cthe scope of the conspiracy and its participants.\u201d <em>Id.; see also In re Chiquita Brands Int\u2019l, </em>690 F.Supp.2d 1296, 1311 (S.D.Fla.2010). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion does not analyze the elements of a civil conspiracy claim, and there is no indication that it was retreating from or adding to Cabello\u2019s articulation of the elements required to plead conspiracy under the ATS. In any event, as discussed in detail above, the allegations here are not \u201cvague and conclusory,\u201d but instead provide facts regarding dates, attendees, and discussions of meetings between Chiquita and the AUC, as well as facts regarding the terms of the agreements reached.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs sufficiently allege an agreement between Chiquita and the AUC to commit the ATS claims alleged in the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">Next, with respect to the intent element, Chiquita argues that the complaints fail to allege that Chiquita joined the agreement with the purpose or intent to facilitate the AUC\u2019s offenses. A conspiracy claim under the ATS requires the same <em>mens rea </em>allegations as aiding and abetting claims, i.e., a showing of purpose or intent, not merely knowledge. <em>Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 260; <em>Cabello, </em>402 F.3d at 1159. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>same standards govern both conspiracy and aiding and abetting theories of liability, and because the allegations here sufficiently allege that Chiquita acted with the purpose and intent to aid and abet the AUC\u2019s international-law violations, the Court concludes that the complaints also sufficiently allege that Chiquita conspired with the AUC with the requisite purpose and intent. <em>See Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 30 (\u201c[BJecause the same standards control on the issue of intent in the conspiracy context as apply in the area of aiding and abetting, and because Defendants have argued only that they did not have the requisite intent to meet those particular standards, the court concludes that the [ATS claims] may proceed on theories of conspiracy.\u201d). Plaintiffs have therefore adequately alleged conspiracy liability for their torture, extrajudicial-killing, war-crimes, and erimesagainst-humanity ATS claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">\n<em>e. Agency Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASFT\">Plaintiffs also assert an agency theory for Chiquita\u2019s secondary liability. The Court rejects this ground for indirect liability under the ATS. First, Plaintiffs point to no authority recognizing agency liability under international law.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> This alone suggests that there is no well-established international consensus for imposing secondary liability on entities whose agents violate international law. Without any authority recognizing this theory under international law, the Court cannot conclude \u2019that agency liability is sufficiently established or recognized to satisfy Sosa\u2019s requirements for recognizing ATS liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-8\">Second, even assuming agency liability is recognized under international law, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not satisfy the requisite elements of an agency relationship between Chiquita and the AUC concerning the AUC\u2019s alleged offenses. The parties agree that such a theory requires allegations that Chiquita exercised control over the AUC. <em>See </em>Pis.\u2019 Second Resp. at 13 (DE 321) (\u201cAgency requires \u2018(1) consent to the agency by both principal and agency; and (2) the control of the agent by the principal.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>CFTC v. Gibraltar Monetary Corp., 575 </em>F.3d 1180, 1189 (11th Cir.2009)). The complaints, however, fail to allege that the AUC acted under Chiquita\u2019s control when carrying out its campaign of torture and killing. The Court finds unavailing Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that \u201cby trading payment for performance\u201d Chiquita \u201cexercised control over the AUC like any employer.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Second Resp. at 13 (DE 321). The mere fact that Chiquita paid the AUC, and allegedly shared the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>same goals as the AUC, falls short of alleging that Chiquita, an American corporation, controlled the military campaign of the AUC, a violent Colombian paramilitary group. There are no allegations that Chiquita directed the AUC\u2019s military strategy or tactics, directed any of the AUC\u2019s actions in the banana-growing region, or exercised any other direction over the AUC\u2019s decisions or conduct. Plaintiffs merely allege that Chiquita provided substantial support to the paramilitary group, support that the AUC seems to have used as it deemed fit in its war with the FARC. The complaints thus fail to plead facts supporting the conclusion that Chiquita, as principal, \u201ccontrolled\u201d the AUC\u2019s violence, and Plaintiffs cannot survive a motion to dismiss based on vague and conclusory legal assertions that the AUC acted as Chiquita\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d or that the AUC acted under Chiquita\u2019s \u201ccontrol.\u201d <em>See Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">Last, the Court rejects Plaintiffs\u2019 alternative theory that Chiquita may be liable under agency principles for its after-the-fact ratification of the AUC\u2019s violence. Plaintiffs contend that Chiquita may be secondarily liable under this ratification theory if it \u201c(1) knows of the unauthorized act carried out on [its] behalf and (2) affirms the act, including by failure to repudiate it.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Second Resp. at 13-14 (DE 321) (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency (1958) \u00a7\u00a7 91 &amp; 94). Regardless of whether Plaintiffs may plead this theory of secondary liability under domestic agency principles, the Court finds that such a theory is not cognizable under international law. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed ratification standard requires a <em>mens rea </em>of mere knowledge and potentially no <em>actus reus, </em>as failure to act suffices. To hold that aiding and abetting and conspiracy liability under the ATS require allegations of purpose or intent and affirmative acts, but that agency liability may be established by a less-demanding knowledge-based ratification theory and no <em>actus reus </em>is inconsistent. More importantly, to permit Plaintiffs to plead an ATS claim so easily is at odds with Sosa\u2019 s directive that court\u2019s exercise \u201cgreat caution\u201d before adding to the \u201cnarrow class\u201d of recognized international-law norms. 542 U.S. at 728, 729, 124 S.Ct. 2739; <em>see also Amergi, </em>611 F.3d at 1364 (\u201c[T]he ATS does not broadly provide for causes of action. The federal courts are empowered to open the door only \u2018to a narrow class\u2019 of claims.\u201d) (quoting <em>Aldana, </em>416 F.3d at 1246-47); <em>id. </em>(\u201c[T]he ATS cases have consistently emphasized the need for federal courts to guard carefully against the overexpansion of federal subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d). Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs cannot plead an agency theory of indirect liability under the ATS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">II. Torture Victim Protection Act</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">The Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 (\u201cTVPA\u201d) provides a cause of action for official torture and extrajudicial killing. In relevant part, the TVPA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-9\">An individual who, under actual or apparent authority, or color of law, of any foreign nation\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-10\">(1) subjects an individual to torture shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to that individual; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-11\">(2) subjects an individual to extrajudicial killing shall, in a civil action, be liable for damages to the individual\u2019s legal representative, or to any person who may be a claimant in an action for wrongful death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 \u00a7 2(a), Pub.L. No. 102-256, 106 Stat. 73 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350 note). The TVPA defines torture as any act (1) \u201cdirected against an individual in the offender\u2019s custody or physical control,\u201d (2) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>inflicts \u201csevere pain or suffering!],] ... whether physical or mental,\u201d (3) for the purpose of obtaining information or a confession, inflicting punishment, intimidation or coercion, or any reason based on discrimination of any kind. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(b). Extrajudicial killing is defined as \u201ca deliberated killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3(a)</p>\n<p id=\"AGL\">Plaintiffs assert two causes of action under the TVPA, torture and extrajudicial killing. Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of TVPA violations are based on the same operative facts underlying their ATS claims. <em>See Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1269 (\u201cIt is not uncommon for plaintiffs to assert ATS and TVPA claims together,\u201d based on \u201cthe same operative facts\u201d). Whereas a complaint that fails to sufficiently plead the elements of an ATS claim is analyzed under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, a motion to dismiss a TVPA claim requires an inquiry under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1269. To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a TVPA claim, \u201cPlaintiffs must sufficiently allege (1) the paramilitaries were state actors or were sufficiently connected to the Colombian government so they were acting under col- or of law and (2) the Defendants, or their agents, conspired with [or aided and abetted] the state actors, or those acting under color of law, in carrying out the state-sponsored torture [or extrajudicial killing].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1270.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">Chiquita first argues that the \u201c \u2018plain reading of the TVPA strongly suggests that it only covers human beings, and not corporations.\u2019 \u201d First Mot. at 68 (DE 93) (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>393 F.Supp.2d at 28). This limitation to individuals, Chiquita contends, bars Plaintiffs\u2019 TVPA claims against it, a corporation. Recent Eleventh Circuit precedents, however, hold that \u201c \u2018an individual\u2019 to whom liability may attach under the TVPA also includes a corporate defendant.\u201d <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1264 n. 13; <em>see also Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1315 (\u201cUnder the law of this Circuit, the Torture Act allows suits against corporate defendants.\u201d). Thus, under the precedent of this Circuit, the Court rejects Chiquita\u2019s first basis for dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">Chiquita\u2019s asserts two additional arguments: first, that Plaintiffs do not sufficiently allege that the AUC acted under color of law in committing torture and extrajudicial killing, and second, that Plaintiffs fail to plead aiding and abetting liability (i.e., <em>mens rea </em>and substantial assistance). In support of these arguments, which are identical to those advanced against Plaintiffs\u2019 torture and extrajudicial-killing claims under the ATS, Chiquita incorporates by reference its ATS arguments on these two points. For the same reasons that the Court rejected these same arguments in the ATS context, discussed in detail above, these arguments fail against Plaintiffs\u2019 TVPA claims.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>Court thus finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 TVPA claims survive Chiquita\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">III. State-Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">Plaintiffs assert various common-law claims under the laws of Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, the District of Columbia, and in some cases the law of \u201cany other applicable jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> These claims include assault and battery, wrongful death, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, negligent hiring, negligence per se, and loss of consortium. The Court will dismiss these claims because the civil tort laws .of Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, and the District of Columbia do not apply to the extraterritorial conduct alleged here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">Under recognized principles of international law, a nation state \u201chas jurisdiction to prescribe law with respect to ... conduct outside its territory that has or is intended to have substantial effect within its territory.\u201d Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7 402 (1987) (\u201cRestatement of Foreign Relations Law\u201d). Additionally, a nation state has jurisdiction to define and prescribe punishment for offenses \u201crecognized by the community of nations as of universal concern ..., even where none of the bases of jurisdiction indicated in \u00a7 402 is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404; <em>see also Basulto v. Cuba, </em>No. 02-21500, DE 39, Slip op. at 14 (S.D.Fla. Jan. 20, 2005). Similarly, the right of the several States of the United States to prescribe laws relative to such extraterritorial conduct is recognized under the same principles of international law, so long as the exercise of such jurisdiction does not violate constitutional limitations. Restatement of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 402, Reporters\u2019 Note 5; cmt. k; <em>Basulto, </em>No. 02-21500, Slip op. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims are premised on acts by Colombian paramilitaries against Colombian civilians that occurred inside Colombia as part of Colombia\u2019s civil war. There are no allegations that this conduct had or was intended to have a substantial effect within the states of Florida, New Jersey, Ohio, or the District of Columbia. Nor are the state-law claims alleged here \u2014 e.g., ordinary tort claims for assault and battery, negligence, wrongful death, etc. \u2014 matters of universal concern recognized by the community of nations. Accordingly, the Court holds that the civil tort laws of Florida, Ohio, New Jersey and the District of Columbia do not apply to the AUC\u2019s alleged torts against Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives. <em>See, e.g., Roe I v. Bridgestone Corp., </em>492 F.Supp.2d 988, 1024 (S.D.Ind.2007) (dismissing state-law claims because \u201c[p]laintiffs have not yet articulated a viable basis for applying California law or Indiana law to the management of a Plantation in Liberia.\u201d); <em>Romero v. Drummond Co., </em>No. 03-0575, DE 329, Slip op. at 2 (N.DAla. Mar. 5, 2007) (\u201c[I]n view of Alabama\u2019s traditional refusal to apply its common law to torts where the injury occurred outside of the state, [the Court will] not apply Alabama common law to the tort claims alleged here, which occurred extraterritorially in Colombia.\u201d); <em>Basulto, </em>No. 02-21500, Slip op. at 15 (permitting a Florida citizen to assert a claim under Florida tort law where the alleged conduct had a \u201cdetrimental effect on its citizens after their return to the State\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-12\">The Montes Plaintiffs (Case No. 10-60573), who assert common-law claims under Ohio law, argue that the Ohio Revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>Code expressly authorizes suits in Ohio courts by nonresident aliens. The Montes Plaintiffs point to Ohio\u2019s wrongful-death statute, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMGG\">When death is caused by a wrongful act, neglect, or default in another state or foreign country, for which a right to maintain an action and recover damages is given by a statute of such other state or foreign country, such right of action may be enforced in this state. Every such action shall be commenced within the time prescribed for the commencement of such actions by the statute of such other state or foreign country.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">Ohio Rev.Code. Ann. \u00a7 2125.01 (West 2011). The Montes Plaintiffs contend that under Section 2125.01 they can maintain their wrongful-death claim because \u201cColombia provides a right to maintain an action and recover damages for torts, including wrongful death\u201d and \u201cthe relevant statutes of limitations have not yet expired under Colombian law.\u201d Montes Pis.\u2019 Second Resp. at 5 (DE 322). Recognizing the Montes Plaintiffs\u2019 wrongful-death claims, via Ohio\u2019s wrongful-death statute, would involve interpreting and ruling on complex and novel issues of Colombian common law \u2014 such as the elements of a Colombian wrongful-death claim and the applicable statutes of limitation \u2014 which, for the reasons discussed in the next section, this Court declines to do. That is, because the Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 Colombian-law claims, the Court will not hear those same claims under the guise of Ohio\u2019s wrongful-death statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">Plaintiffs also contend that even if they cannot directly assert these state-law claims, this Court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over them based on the Court\u2019s jurisdiction under the ATS and TVPA. First, the previously stated basis for refusing to hear Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims is not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, but because those state laws do not cover Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Thus, supplemental jurisdiction cannot save Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-8\">In any event, the Court would decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction. The \u201capplication of supplemental jurisdiction is statutorily controlled by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367.\u201d <em>Amergi, </em>611 F.3d at 1366. The statute permits the district courts to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if, for example, \u201cthe claim raises a novel or complex issue of State law\u201d or \u201cin exceptional circumstances, there are other compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c). This section \u201cdescribes the occasions on which a federal court may exercise its <em>discretion </em>not to hear a supplemental claim or admit a supplemental party, despite the <em>power </em>of the court to hear such a claim.\u201d <em>Amergi, </em>611 F.3d at 1366 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court is unaware of any of these states\u2019 civil tort laws ever being applied to foreign conduct against foreign citizens in the course of a foreign war. Given the novelty and complexity of adjudicating claims under the laws of four U.S. states, and potentially <em>every </em>state,<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> based on wholly foreign conduct by foreign tortfeasors against foreign victims, even if the Court could hear these claims it would exercise its discretion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 to decline to supplemental jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-9\">IV. Colombia-Law Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-10\">Some Plaintiffs also assert claims under the laws of Colombia. These are the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>common-law claims that these Plaintiffs assert under state laws, e.g., wrongful death, but the complaints assert that these claims also are actionable under Colombian law. Even if the Court were competent to interpret and rule upon a foreign nation\u2019s common law, the novel and complex issues inherent in such in endeavor balance against exercising supplemental jurisdiction. Accordingly, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a) the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs\u2019 Colombian-law claims. <em>See Amergi, </em>611 F.3d at 1366 (affirming district court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over foreign-law claim based on \u201cextraordinary inconvenience and expenditure of judicial resources involved in hearing the Israeli law wrongful death claim\u201d); <em>Romero, </em>552 F.3d at 1318 (\u201cThe conclusion of the district court that the claim [for wrongful death under Colombian law] raised complex issues is supported by the record, and the court was well within its discretion to decline jurisdiction over that claim.\u201d); <em>Drummond I, </em>No. 09-1041, Slip op. at 35 (declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Colombian-law claim, reasoning that the \u201cwrongful death claim raises a novel and complex issue under the law of Colombia. Those issues are sufficiently complex that it would be impossible for this court to navigate the Colombian law requisites for a wrongful death claim.\u201d) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-5\">Y. FARC Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">The Perez Plaintiffs (Case No. 08-80465) assert claims based on Chiquita\u2019s alleged payments to <em>both </em>the AUC and the FARC.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Of Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims\u2014 torture and extrajudicial killing under the TVPA and torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity under the ATS \u2014 the Perez Plaintiffs concede that they cannot state a claim for torture or extrajudicial killings under either the TVPA or ATS because they do not allege that the FARC, a guerrilla group that opposes the Colombian government, acted under color of law. Perez Pis.\u2019 First Resp. at 32 (DE 119, Ex. 1). The Perez Plaintiffs further concede that they cannot state a claim under a conspiracy theory of secondary liability because they do not allege any meetings or agreements between the FARC and Chiquita. Perez Pis.\u2019 First Resp. at 32 (DE 119, Ex. 1). The Court therefore addresses only whether the Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint sufficiently alleges ATS claims against Chiquita for war crimes and crimes against humanity under an aiding and abetting theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-10\">To plead aiding and abetting liability under the applicable international standard, Plaintiffs must allege that (1) the FARC committed an international-law violation, (2) Chiquita acted with the purpose or intent to assist in that violation, and (3) Chiquita\u2019s assistance substantially contributed to the FARC\u2019s commission of the violation. <em>See Talisman, </em>582 F.3d at 258; <em>Khulumani, </em>504 F.3d at 277 (Katzmann, J., concurring); <em>Drummond II, </em>No. 09-1041, DE 43, Slip op. at 20-21. The Court concludes that this complaint fails to allege sufficient facts supporting the second and third elements for aiding and abetting liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-11\">First, the Perez Plaintiffs fail to allege that Chiquita paid the FARC with the purpose or intent to further the FARC\u2019s violence. Plaintiffs conclusorily allege that Chiquita supported the FARC, but fail to allege Chiquita\u2019s intent, if any, in doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>so.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The complaint thus lacks facts supporting the conclusion that Chiquita acted with the purpose, as opposed to mere knowledge, to further the FARC\u2019s violence in the banana-growing regions. Indeed, the complaint itself argues that the FARC allegations meet the lesser knowledge standard, and argues only that the AUC allegations meet the purpose standard.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Second, the Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding Chiquita\u2019s assistance to the FARC are conclusory and devoid of any factual support. Plaintiffs assert that Chiquita made payments to the FARC, but they fail to allege any facts supporting this allegation, such as when these payments were made, the size, frequency, or form of the payments, how the FARC used the funds or whether the payments were related in any way to the offenses alleged in the complaint.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Without any facts regarding the amount of payments or how the FARC used that support, this Court cannot conclude that Chiquita\u2019s alleged assistance substantially contributed to the FARC\u2019s international-law violations. The Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusory allegations therefore fail to state a claim against Chiquita for aiding and abetting the FARC. <em>See Iqbal, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1951 (explaining that conclusory allegations, devoid of factual support, are not entitled to the presumption of truth on a motion to dismiss); <em>Sinaltrainal, </em>578 F.3d at 1268 (holding that the plaintiff \u201cmust plead factual content,\u201d not \u201cvague and conclusory\u201d assertions, to state a claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-8\">The Court rejects the Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 suggestion that this Court\u2019s February 4, 2010 order in a related case \u2014 finding that the plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Chiquita aided and abetted the FARC (DE 278) \u2014 is controlling here.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s February 4, 2010 order applied the <em>domestic </em>aiding and abetting standard (i.e., knowledge) to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims that arose under a different statute, the Anti-terrorism Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cATA\u201d). That this Court found that a different complaint sufficiently alleged, under a less-demanding standard, that Chiquita knew of the FARC\u2019s violent aims when allegedly assisting it is not relevant to whether the Perez Plaintiffs sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>allege, under the international purpose standard, that Chiquita assisted the FARC with the purpose to further the FARC\u2019s violence. Similarly, the Court\u2019s finding that the ATA plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Chiquita substantially assisted the FARC is not dispositive here. The complaints at issue there alleged detailed facts regarding the specific amounts, frequency, and duration of Chiquita\u2019s payments, the terms of Chiquita and the FARC\u2019s agreements surrounding the payments, and included the additional allegations that Chiquita supplied the FARC with weapons, ammunition, and other non-monetary supplies. The Perez Plaintiffs do not allege such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\">Thus, because the Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint fails to allege that Chiquita\u2019s payments to the FARC substantially contributed to the FARC\u2019s violence or were intended to further that violence, the Perez Plaintiffs fad to sufficiently allege, under the applicable international-law standard, that Chiquita is secondarily liable for the FARC\u2019s alleged offenses. The Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on Chiquita\u2019s alleged payments to the FARC are dismissed.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Chiquita\u2019s Motions to Dismiss Amended Complaints (DEs 92, 295) are GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. Specifically, Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims for terrorism and material support to terrorist organizations. Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims for cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment; violation of the rights to life, liberty and security of person and peaceful assembly and association; and consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 state-law claims. Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 Colombia-law claims. Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are GRANTED with respect to the Perez Plaintiffs\u2019 FARC-based claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-10\">Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are DENIED with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims for torture, extrajudicial killing, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Chiquita\u2019s motions to dismiss are DENIED with respect to Plaintiffs\u2019 TVPA claims for torture and extrajudicial killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-11\">The Carrizosa and Perez Plaintiffs are hereby granted leave to amend their complaints, consistent with the directives of this order. They may file their amended complaints, if they choose, within thirty (30) days from the date of entry of this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1343-10\">. Chiquita filed its first motion to dismiss on July 11, 2008. (DE 92). After that motion was fully briefed, and after a hearing was held thereon, Plaintiffs amended their complaints. Accordingly, the Court permitted Chiquita to file a second motion to dismiss, filed on April 9, 2010 (DE 295), which was limited to the amended allegations and developments in the relevant case law. This order addresses the arguments raised by the parties in both rounds of motion-to-dismiss briefing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1344-7\">. There are seven complaints before the Court, transferred here by the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407, for consolidated pretrial proceedings. Case Nos. 07-cv-60821, 08-cv-80421, 08-cv-80465, 08-cv-80480, 08-cv-80508, 10-cv-60573, and 10-cv-80652. The factual allegations in these complaints are essentially the same. For simplicity, the factual discussion that follows relies on and cites the allegations from the First Amended Complaint (\u201cFAC\u201d) in <em>Does 1-144 and. Perezes 1-95 v. Chiquita Brands International, Inc., </em>No. 08-cv-80465, DE 58 (filed Mar. 1, 2010), which the Court finds representative of the other complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1344-14\">. The factual background is drawn from the allegations in the First Amended Complaint, which the Court credits as true for purposes of these motions to dismiss. <em>See Instituto De Prevision Militar v. Merrill Lynch, </em>546 F.3d 1340, 1342 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1346-5\">. While some allegations of the violence against Plaintiffs\u2019 relatives are highly detailed, the complaints also contain lists of brief, undetailed allegations. <em>See, e.g., </em>FAC \u00b6 32 (\"On 2/10/1997, Peter Doe 1 was killed by the AUC, which received support from Chiquita and/or Banadex. Plaintiff John Doe 1, who was the son of Peter Doe 1, is the legal heir to Peter Doe 1 and resides in the municipio of Apartado in Antioquia, Colombia.\u201d); <em>see also </em>FAC \u00b6\u00b6 33-195 (similar allegations). Because it would be impractical for the complaints to detail each one of the thousands of alleged killings, especially the class-action complaints, at this stage in the litigation the Court will assume that the detailed allegations, quoted in the text below, are representative of all Plaintiffs' claims. Of course, as this litigation proceeds, Plaintiffs must ultimately prove sufficient facts surrounding the deaths of each victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1347-8\">. Chiquita sold Banadex in June 2004 and no longer owns a Colombian subsidiary. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 8, 396.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">. <em>See, e.g., Does 1-11 v.

The Court finds that the causes of action alleged in the <em>Does 1-11 </em>First Amended Complaint provides a representative example of these two terrorism causes of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1353-6\">. In support of his finding, Judge Edwards referenced United Nations resolutions, which he explained demonstrate that some states view politically motivated terrorism as legitimate acts of aggression and therefore immune from condemnation.

Chiquita\u2019s second motion argues briefly that Chiquita's intent cannot be inferred from any actions taken by Banadex, its wholly owned Colombian subsidiary. Second Mot. at 29 (DE 295). Chiquita relies on <em>Talisman </em>\u2014 a decision based on summary judgment, not the bare pleadings \u2014 which noted, without ruling on the issue, that the \"attenuation between the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations and the named defendant ... raises knotty issues concerning control, imputation, and veil piercing. ...\" 582 F.3d at 261. <em>Talisman </em>is inapposite. There, the defendant corporation owned an \"indirect subsidiary\u201d which in turn owned a 25% share in a third entity, which allegedly assisted the Sudanese government in ATS violations. <em>Id. </em>The remaining 75% of the third entity was further divided among three more corporate entities from China, Malaysia, and Sudan. <em>Id. </em>It was upon this chain of indirect and shared ownership that the Second Circuit noted concerns regarding attenuation between the allegations and the named defendant. Such attenuation is not a concern here, where Plaintiffs allege that Banadex is Chiquita\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"89\">\n<p id=\"b1388-6\">. <em>E.g., Does 1-144 v. Chiquita Brands Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>No. 08-80465, DE 58, First Am.

Without addressing whether it is appropriate to consider these foreign documents in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the Court finds that the reports are not inconsistent with Plaintiffs' allegations that Chiquita was involved in facilitating arms shipments. <em>See, e.g., </em>Permanent Council, Organization of American States, <em>Report of the General Secretariat of the Organization of American States on the Diversion of Nicaraguan Arms to the United Defense Forces of Colombia, </em>at 17 (Jan. 29, 2003) (DE 93, Ex. B) (\u201cWhat actually occurred at Turbo remains a mystery.... [A]U that is known is that the guns somehow found their way to the AUC. This would have meant that someone in Colombia ... was ultimately responsible for the illegal importation of the arms onto Colombian soil.\"). Moreover, the fact that investigations by a nongovernmental organization and a foreign prosecutor may have attributed responsibility to others does not preclude Plaintiffs from proving in these U.S. court proceedings that Chiquita or Banadex also played a role. Plaintiffs' allegations of gun-running are quite serious and they will need to prove these facts as this case proceeds, but at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the Court must accept these allegations as true.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"90\">\n<p id=\"b1388-10\">. <em>E.g., Montes v.

Plaintiffs' reliance on <em>Aldana </em>and <em>Cabello </em>is misplaced. Neither decision held that plaintiffs may plead an ATS case under an agency-liability theory. While the plaintiffs in <em>Aldana </em>alleged an agency relationship, the Eleventh Circuit did not address that issue and instead held only that accomplice and conspiracy were recognized theories of secondary liability. 416 F.3d at 1247-48. The <em>Cabello </em>opinion is also limited to accomplice and conspiracy liability, and in fact does not mention agency liability at all. 402 F.3d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Plaintiffs' selective quotation from <em>Flores, </em>414 F.3d at 251, is similarly misplaced. <em>Flores </em>quotes Article 38 of the International Court of Justice (\"ICJ\u201d) Statute, which provides that the ICJ shall decide issues \"in accordance with international law\u201d and \"shall apply ... the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations\u201d and \"judicial decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251. Plaintiffs seem to argue that this statement establishes that agency liability \u2014 a \"general principle of law recognized by civilized nations,\u201d e.g., U.S. domestic law \u2014 is a recognized principle under international law. The Court disagrees. The ICJ Statute\u2019s general statement regarding the law to which that court looks cannot satisfy <em>Sosa\u2019 s </em>requirement that ATS standards be well-defined and universally accepted. Additionally, the issue of agency liability is entirely absent from the ICJ Statute, as well as from the <em>Flores </em>opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">. The Court recognizes that the \"TVPA differs from the ATS in certain crucial ways,\u201d <em>Baloco v. Drummond Co., </em>640 F.3d 1338, 1345 (11th Cir.2011), and that ruling on ATS claims does not necessarily dispose of similar claims under the TVPA. Here, however, Chiquita\u2019s state-action and indirect-liability arguments are the same arguments, based on the same factual allegations and under the same legal standards, asserted against Plaintiffs\u2019 ATS claims. The Court rejected those arguments in the ATS context, finding that, with respect to state action, Plaintiffs alleged a \"symbiotic relationship\u201d between the AUC and Colombian government and that, with respect to aiding and abetting liability, Plaintiffs alleged that Chiquita possessed a purpose <em>mens rea </em>and provided substantial assistance to the AUC.
