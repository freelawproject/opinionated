The complaint sets forth a breach of contract of employ-, ment. The answer, among other things, sets up a counterclaim of $350 for money advanced. The plaintiff replies that in pursuance of the agreement set forth in the complaint he rendered services to the defendants of the value of $225, and asks that such sum may be set off against any sum that may be found due the defendants on their counterclaim. The defendants moved to strike out this set-off, and from the order denying the said motion this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-16\">The allegation in the reply is a new cause of action by the plaintiff against the defendants for work, labor,, and services performed amounting to the sum of $225. Practically, this is a counterclaim to a counterclaim, and is unauthorized under section 514 of the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of Civil Procedure. The remedy for the plaintiff on receipt of the answer setting up the counterclaim was to move for leave to amend the complaint. A case much in point is Fitzgerald v. Rightmeyer, 12 Mise. Rep. 186, 33 N. Y. Supp. 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
