At the expiration of the first quarter the defendant notified the plaintiffs not to continue the advertisement. This notice was complied with, and plaintiffs now sue to recover damages for defendant\u2019s breach of the contract. On the trial proof was excluded as to the expense, if any, which the plaintiffs would incur in the continued publication of the advertisement for the remainder of the period, and the plaintiffs were allowed only the balance due for the period during which the advertisement actually appeared. This was error requiring the reversal of the judgment. The defendant committed a breach of her contract when she ordered, without cause, the termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of the advertisement. The plaintiffs were then warranted in treating the defendant\u2019s act as putting an end to the contract for all purposes of performance, and suing for the part performed, and for loss of profits on the part which the plaintiffs were not permitted to perform in consequence of the defendant\u2019s repudiation of her obligation. 7 Am. &amp; Eng.

The defendant made a written contract with the plaintiffs whereby plaintiffs were to publish the adverr tisement of the defendant in their paper once each week for the term of one year, for which the defendant agreed to pay $35. The defendant paid on account $4. At the end of three months defendant notified plaintiffs in writing to discontinue the publication of the advertisement, and they accordingly discontinued it. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for a breach of the contract, and the trial court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover only the proportionate share of the $35\u2014that is, $8.75 for the three months\u2014less the amount paid on account, and gave judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $4.75 and costs. On the trial the plaintiffs attempted to prove as elements of damage that they had paid commissions to an advertising solicitor for procuring the advertisement, and what their profits would have been had they been allowed to continue the advertisement; but the trial court excluded such evidence, and plaintiffs duly excepted, and they now appeal to this court. We think the trial court properly excluded the evidence, and awarded the correct measure of damages. Had the plaintiffs gone on and completed the contract, or even properly protested against the act of the defendant in discontinuing the publication of the advertisement, they might have recovered the full contract price. They acquiesced, and their acquiescence was fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
