The plaintiffs intrusted to the defendant, to be dyed, certain ribbons, which were so improperly done as to be of no value to the former. The trial justice gave judgment for the value of the goods, with a condition and direction that they be delivered to the defendant, which has been done. On behalf of the latter it is argued that it was the duty of the plaintiffs to reduce their damages as much as possible (Parsons v. Sutton, 66 N. Y. 92; Wright v. Bank of Metropolis, 110 N. Y. 245, 18 N. E. 79, 1 L. R. A. 289, 6 Am. St. Rep. 356; Dillon v. Anderson, 43 N. Y. 237; Roberts v. White, 73 N. Y. 380; Sedgwick on Damages [8th Ed.] vol. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 201, 202) by procuring the goods to be redyed, and that the measure of damages is limited to the cost of such redying. On the other hand, it is sought to support the judgment on the ground that, as the goods were rendered worthless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to the plaintiffs, they might abandon them to the use of the defendant, and recover the full value in an action in trover for conversion. May v. Georger, 21 Misc. Rep. 622, 47 N. Y. Supp. 1057; Barrett Dyeing Establishment v. Wharton, 16 N. Y. Wkly. Dig. 500. The complaint in this case, however, does not show an action brought on the theory of conversion, but for damages for breach of contract. As there was no evidence that the goods were absolutely valueless, but only valueless to the plaintiffs, the damages awarded for the full amount of the original value were excessive. The judgment therefore must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
