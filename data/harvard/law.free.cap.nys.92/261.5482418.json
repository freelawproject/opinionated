An entry of withdrawal was made in the passbook. The depositor thereafter had possession of the book, and on six different occasions he personally made deposits, which were entered therein without an inquiry as to the meaning of the withdrawal entry. <em>'Held, </em>that the bank, as a matter of law, was not liable; there being no evidence of want of reasonable care on its part.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b285-12\">[Ed.

When the payment was made by the bank\u2019s officer, the party to whom it was made presented a draft together with plaintiff\u2019s bankbook. He was catechised by the cashier upon the basis of what are termed \u201ctest questions,\u201d and the proof shows that in every instance he responded correctly, answering each question as the plaintiff himself had replied to them when he opened his account. It is true that the cashier, on his examina- ' tion during the trial, answered that when he asked the person presenting the draft, while testing him, what his occupation was, he replied, \u201cStone mason,\u201d while the reply given originally by the depositor to same question was \u201cStonecutter,\u201d but it is equally true that on page <em>22 </em>of the record he swore that the reply the individual presenting the draft made to his inquiry was, \u201cStonecutter,\u201d showing clearly that, if there was a variance at all, it was simply due to a slip that is of no serious moment whatever. The essential element is that he did put these questions; that he did test the individual\u2019s right to get its money; that he \u201ccompared the answers the person made with the test questions in the signature book, and, on the answers he made, and my comparison of them with the signature book,\u201d he \u201cpaid the draft.\u201d On the other hand, we find this passbook after this withdrawal in the possession of the plaintiff, with this entry of withdrawal\u2019 made therein, and on six different occasions thereafter we find him personally making deposits, each of which are entered in the passbook, and the same is returned to him; but not the slightest inquiry upon his part is made as to what that $300 entry meant, although it was there on the opposite page of the book, among other withdrawals which presumably had been made by this plaintiff. The judgment was a proper one, and there was nothing in the testimony that, either through variance or any other feature, would warrant the submission of the question whether ordinary care and diligence had been exercised by the bank authorities. That they had performed every duty the law exacted of them was too patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">SCOTT, J., concurs.
