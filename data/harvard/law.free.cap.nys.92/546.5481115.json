That the Knickerbocker Trust Company of the City of New York, whom the said Graham Youngs appoints in his will executor and trustee, refused to qualify as such, and duly renounced, and thereupon his widow, Ada C. Youngs, was duly appointed as administratrix with the will annexed of his estate, and also guardian of his two infant children, Graham Youngs and Josephine Graham Youngs, and these two last are the only children and heirs at law of the said Graham Youngs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-5\">Sixth. That the said Graham Youngs never accepted the above devises made in his favor, but neglected and refused to receive the same, or to act under them, or to become vested with the estate so devised to him, or to assume or become subject to, or chargeable with, any of the liabilities, which would follow on his receiving the said legacies, devises, or the benefits thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-6\">Seventh. That the legacy and other amounts set forth in the complaint, and to recover which this action is instituted, are as follows: A legacy of a debt of Edwin A. Youngs to the testator amounting to $7,500, which is given to the testator\u2019s widow, the plaintiff, Henrietta Graham Youngs. An advance of $30,000, made by the testator to the said Graham Youngs before the testator\u2019s death. The sum of $9,262.23, the indebtedness of said Graham Youngs to the firm of Youngs &amp; Co., which the said testator assumed with Graham\u2019s knowledge and assent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-7\">Eighth. That as to the interest on the said sums the testator directs that Interest be paid on the $7,500, given to his widow, from his death; also, that interest be paid on the $30,000 from his death, and that as to the indebtedness of $9,262.23 interest shall run on that according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-8\">Ninth. The last two amounts are directed to be collected by the plaintiffs the executrices and trustees, and when so collected are to be distributed by them under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-9\">Tenth. The lands which are the subject-matter of this action consist of about 365 acres. As the whole estate is subject to the widow\u2019s life estate, and after her death that part which composed the testator\u2019s dwelling house and farm adjoining it are subject to another life estate during the life of his son Alfred, I have caused separate descriptions to be proved, showing, first, the part which is subject to the life estate for the benefit of his son Alfred Youngs after the widow\u2019s death, and another description, showing the remaining part of said lands which after the widow\u2019s death is subject to no life or other estate or lien. Such descriptions are as follows: * * *.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-10\">Eleventh. That the said land, if sold at public sale, free from or unincumbered by any liens or life estates, would probably bring the amount herein-before stated. Said lands would bring only a nominal price if sold at public sale, and incumbered as they now are by the two life estates above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-11\">Twelfth. The lands which form the subject of this action may, with the concurrence of the widow of testator, be sold free and clear of all charges and of any life estate under the power of sale contained in the will of Thomas F. Youngs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-12\">I further report, as a matter of law:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-13\">First. That all the said lands are subject to the life estate of the said Henrietta Graham Youngs for her life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-14\">Second. That on her death a part of the said lands remain devised in fee to the plaintiffs, in trust for the benefit of Alfred Youngs for his life. These lands are one-third of the salt meadow tract and the mansion house and lands appurtenant to it, in the preceding description described as forming the southerly part of the residence of the late Thomas F. Youngs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-15\">Third. That all of the lands which form the subject of this action, subject to the two life estates of the testator\u2019s widow and in favor of his son Alfred, are chargeable with the three legacies mentioned in the will; that the first legacy is $7,500, and is payable to the complainant, the widow, Henrietta Graham Youngs, with interest from the testator\u2019s death to the date of my report, and amounts to $11,001.90; that the remaining two amounts chargeable on the lands amount to $39,262.23; that this amount is payable to the plaintiffs, as executrices and trustees of and under the last will and testament of Thomas F. Youngs, deceased, to be by them disposed of as directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>by said last will and testament, and, with interest at the date of my report, amounts to $57,595.75.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-5\">Fourth. That subject to the two life estates in favor of the widow and the son Alfred, and subject to and charged with these three amounts, the said lands have descended to and are now vested in fee simple in the heirs at law of the said testator as tenants in common as follows: Fannie Henrietta Youngs, one-sixth; Lavine G. Meyer, one-sixth; Alice B. Nash, one-sixth; Gertrude W. Cheever, one-sixth; Alfred Youngs, one-sixth; Graham Youngs, one-twelfth; and Josephine Graham Youngs, one-twelfth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-6\">Fifth. That a judgment or decree in the form settled by me and herewith reported be entered, directing that the said lands, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the payment of the said legacies, interests, and the. costs and expenses of this action, taxes, and other legal charges thereon, be sold under the direction of this court, subject to the aforesaid life estates of Henrietta Graham Youngs and Alfred Youngs, and, after the payment of the aforesaid amounts, such amount as may then remain of such proceeds be brought into and deposited with the court, according to law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">Sixth. That the said lands being unsalable, and incumbered as they are by the two life estates, it should be directed that said lands be sold free and clear of all charges and life estates, and in accordance with such equitable provisions as may be set forth in the decree hereinafter to be entered; but such directions cannot be given except upon the consent of the executors and the concurrence therein of the widow of Thomas F. Youngs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\">Seventh. That the plaintiffs have their costs and expenses, and the attorneys for the other parties to this action their costs to be taxed, with an allowance to each of the guardians ad litem.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">All of which is respectfully submitted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b578-10\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.

We think he was clearly right in finding as a matter of fact that Graham Youngs, Sr., did not accept the devise of the lands in controversy under his father\u2019s will. These lands having passed to the heirs at law of the testator, we also agree with the referee that all the shares are subject to the charges made in the devise to Graham Youngs, Sr., and that these charges should not be restricted only to the shares which go to his children. It seems to have been the intention of the testator that the lands devised to his son Graham, to whomsoever they might go if he failed to accept the devise, should bear the burden of paying Graham\u2019s indebtedness to the testator\u2019s estate. It is not hostile to the intent of the testator to hold that all the lands are subject to the charges, instead of only the shares which the children of Graham take .as heirs at law. The testator intended that Graham should have all these lands after paying his debt, if he did pay it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u2014in other words, he intended that Graham\u2019s debt should be paid out of the lands devised to him; and there is no injustice in carrying out this intention, no matter who acquires the lands in consequence of Graham\u2019s failure to accept the devise. If he had accepted the devise, none of the heirs would have received any portion of these lands whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
