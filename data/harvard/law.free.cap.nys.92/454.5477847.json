Upon information and belief that on or about said April 21, 1903, the defendant National Broadway Bank went into liquidation, pursuant to the provisions of sections 5220 and 5221 of the Revised Statutes of the United States [U. S. Comp. St. 1901, p. 3503], and diily sold, assigned, transferred, and delivered to the defendant Mercantile National Bank all of its assets, of every nature and description whatsoever, for and in consideration of the sum of. $3,000,000 in cash, paid or to be paid by the said defendant Mercantile- National Bank to the defendant National Broadway Bank, and the assumption and payment by the defendant Mercantile National Bank of the liabilities of the defendant National Broadway Bank.

That it was further provided that the president of the defendant National Broadway Bank should act as the agent and attorney for each and every shareholder of the defendant National Broadway Bank who should subscribe for such increased capital stock of the defendant Mercantile National Bank, to receive the said subscriptions, and the distributive share of the proceeds of the sale of the assets and business of the defendant National Broadway Bank, on behalf of such subscribing shareholders, and to apply the same to the payment of the aforesaid subscriptions for stock to the defendant Mercantile National Bank. That these plaintiffs, as trustees of the estate of Robert Barkley, deceased, did thereupon, and pursuant to said offer and privilege, subscribe for 50' shares of the capital stock of the said defendant Mercantile National Bank, and did authorize and empower said officer of the said defendant National Broadway Bank to apply the pro rata share due to estate of Robert Barkley,, deceased, on the sale of the assets and business of the defendant National Broadway Bank, to wit, the sum of $15,000 to the purchase of said 50 shares of stock of the defendant Mercantile National Bank, and did thereupon, indorse as such trustees, and deliver and surrender up, to the defendant Mercantile National Bank, the certificates for 200 shares of the defendant National Broadway Bank belonging to and standing in the name of the estate of Robert Barkley, deceased, as aforesaid, and thereupon received from the defendant Mercantile National Bank a certificate for 50 shares of the capital stock of the said defendant Mercantile National Bank in the name of the estate of Robert Barkley, deceased, and the plaintiffs now hold the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">\u201cEleventh. Upon information and belief that the capital stock of the defendant National Broadway Bank of New York was, at the time of such transfer as aforesaid, of the value in open market of $15,000 or thereabouts,, and that for some time previous thereto, and up to the time of such transfer, dividends upon said stock had been declared and paid at the rate of 12 per cent, per annum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">\u201cTwelfth.

That there is no adequate remedy at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-8\">\u201cFifteenth. That these plaintiffs, in making the \"transfer and sale of stock as aforesaid, acted in good faith, believing that the said transfer or sale was-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>for the best -interest of the estate of Robert Barkley, deceased, and were free from any wrongful intent or design in such transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-4\">\u201cWherefore these plaintiffs pray the decree of this court directing the delivery to them, as trustees of the estate of Robert Barkley, deceased, by the defendants herein, or the one in whose possession the stock now is, of the said 200 shares of the capital stock of the defendant Broadway National Bank, heretofore delivered by the -plaintiffs to the Mercantile National Bank, upon the surrender up by these plaintiffs of the aforesaid 50 shares of the stock of the defendant Mercantile National Bank, together with the sum of $406, dividends and interest thereon, upon said stock, heretofore paid and received by the plaintiffs, and for such other and further relief in the premises as may be just and equitable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b482-5\">Bach of the defendants demurred to this complaint, upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The demurrers were sustained at the Special Term, and upon the decision there rendered final judgment was entered dismissing the complaint Brom this judgment the plaintiffs have appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b482-6\">Argued before BARTLETT, JENKS, HOOKER, RICH, and MILLER, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-7\">Henry G. K. Heath, for appellants,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-8\">E. H. Sykes (William V. Rowe, on the brief), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b482-9\">WILLARD BARTLETT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtO\">The plaintiffs in this action, as substituted trustees under the will of Robert Barkley, deceased, seek to recover 200-shares of the capital stock of the National Broadway Bank, transferred by them to the Mercantile National Bank in violation of the terms of the will, and of the orders of the Supreme Court under which they were appointed to succeed the original trustees. These orders provided that the substituted trustees should have no power or authority to bargain, sell, alienate, or in any manner dispose of any part of the principal of the real or personal property of the estate without having first obtained leave of the court, nor until they should have given such security for the due and proper proportion of the proceeds of any sale as the court might thereafter direct and require. The transfer of the National Broadway Bank stock to the Mercantile National Bank was made by the indorsement of the certificates by the plaintiffs as such trustees, and in return therefor- the plaintiffs received from the Mercantile National Bank a certificate for 50 shares of the capital stock of that corporation in the name of the estate of Robert Barkley, deceased. The circumstances of the transfer, as set out in the complaint, were such as to charge the defendants with knowledge of the limitations imposed by the will and the orders of the Supreme Court upon the powers and authority of the plaintiffs as trustees. \u201cKnowledge of the trustee\u2019s violation of the trust conditions will be chargeable to the person dealing with him,\u2019 if the facts were such as in reason to put him upon inquiry, and to require him to make some investigation, as the result of which the true title and authority of the trustee might have been disclosed. He will then be regarded as having constructive notice of the terms of the trust whence the trustee derives his power to act.\u201d First National Bank v. National Broadway Bank, 156 N. Y. 459, 468, 51 N. E. 398,42 L. R. A. 139. A person who takes trust property with such constructive notice takes it subject to the right of the trustee to reclaim possession thereof. The obligation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>a party who deals with a trustee, in the purchase from him of trust securities, to look into the trust agreement to ascertain the power of the trustee, was distinctly asserted in the clearest language by the Appellate Division in the First Department in the case of Suarez v. De Montigny, 1 App. Div. 494, 37 N. Y. Supp. 503, and the judgment therein rendered was affirmed upon the opinion below by the Court of Appeals, 153 N. Y. 678, 48 N. E. 1107. It seems to me that under these authorities the complaint clearly states a cause of action against the Mercantile National Bank, and that the National Broadway Bank is a proper party because its interests will be directly affected if the plaintiffs succeed in enforcing their equitable demand against the Mercantile National Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">I think the judgment should be reversed, and that the plaintiffs should have an interlocutory judgment overruling the demurrers, but providing that the defendants have leave to answer over.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Final judgment reversed, with costs, and interlocutory judgment directed overruling the demurrer, with costs, with leave to the defendants to answer over upon payment of costs. All concur; HOOKER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
