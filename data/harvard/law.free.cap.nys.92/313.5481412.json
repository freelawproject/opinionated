We think this instruction is erroneous. No such obligation is imposed upon common carriers, viz., to safely land a passenger at his destination. This was virtually an instruction that the defendant railway company was an insurer of its passengers, during transit, irrespective of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-17\">It is urged, however, that, since the proof showed that the car in question descended an incline \u201cat an unusual rate of speed,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>defendant was bound to exercise toward its passengers \"the utmost care and diligence which human prudence and foresight can suggest.\u201d Such instruction was approved in Keegan v. Third Avenue R. R. Co., 34 App. Div. 297, 54 N. Y. Supp. 391, affirmed without opinion, 165 N. Y. 622, 59 N. E. 1124. The facts in that case, however, disclosed a situation from which grave injury was to be apprehended, and the court, in the course of its opinion, said, at page 300 of 34 App. Div., page 394 of 54 N. Y. Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-5\">\u201cA rule which called upon every driver or motorman, at all times and under all circumstances, to keep himself keyed up to the highest pitch of vigilance, would be senseless. He should never, it is true, be heedless or forgetful of his duty. He should, in fact, at all times be watchful and prepared for emergencies. When, however, the law imposes upon him a still higher degree of care, namely, the exercise of all the vigilance that human foresight can suggest, it naturally refers to conditions calling for that extreme degree of vigilance. It is not so unreasonable, for example, as to demand constantly strained eyes from the lookout over a perfectly clear horizon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The court also quoted from that part of the opinion in Stierle v. Union Railway Company, 156 N. Y. 684, 50 N. E. 834, which lays down the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cThe strict rule would be, in a proper case, where the accident resulted from a situation from which grave injury might be expected, and which therefore imposed upon the carrier\u2019s servants the duty to exercise the utmost skill and foresight to avoid it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Whether or not these principles so laid down in these cases are applicable to the present case depends, of course, upon the circumstances. If, as claimed by the plaintiff, the situation was dangerous, the jury might, in the event of their so finding, have been instructed in conformity with the rule last above quoted. The jury, however, were .not so instructed, but the trial justice went much further, and virtually told them that the railway company would be liable if it failed to safely land a passenger at his destination. This was clearly an overstatement of the carrier\u2019s obligation to its passengers, and hence, for the error as committed, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
