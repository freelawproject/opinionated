The answer given falls under the ban of a long line of decisions, and it was error that calls for a reversal of this judgment not to have granted that motion. More particularly is this so when we consider that the condition about which the doctor was then testifying was one of the most important features in the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b271-6\">SCOTT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtI\">(concurring). I concur not only for the reason stated in the opinion of Mr. Justice McCALL, but also because there is absolutely no evidence that the accident was the result of any negligence on the part of the defendant. The only proof is that two cars collided, and that one of them was operated by the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b271-7\">GIEGERICH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Av8\">(concurring). I concur for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice McCALL, but dissent from the view that there was no evidence of negligence. The accident itself is such evidence. Where a collision occurs between a car operated by the carrier of passengers and a car operated by an independent company, there is, as between the passenger and the carrier, a presumption of negligence against the latter, which calls for an explanation.
