There are cases, however, in which it is permitted to allege something short of full performance, with a sufficient excuse for nonperformance. Such a case is presented where the plaintiff\u2019s contract is for the rendition of personal services, and the excuse for nonperformance is sickness\". Wolfe v. Howes, 20 N. Y. 197, 75 Am. Dec. 388. Undoubtedly an employer is not bound to wait an unreasonable time for his employ\u00e9 to recover. McCarrigle v. McCosker, 83 App. Div. 184, 82 N. Y. Supp. 494. But the question as to what an unreasonable time is, in general, a question of fact, and not of law. It certainly cannot be said, as matter of law, that the illness of plaintiff, as set forth in the complaint, was unreasonably prolonged; and, even if plaintiff\u2019s incapacity to work for two weeks, owing to his illness, would have constituted a sufficient cause for the cancellation of the contract, it did not so operate as to cancel it ipso facto. The most that could be claimed is that it offered to defendants an option to cancel it. But they had also the option to waive the breach, if breach it was. No particular act or form of words was necessary to indicate such a waiver. The complaint alleges that when plaintiff had recovered his health, and_ returned and offered to go on with his work, the defendants \u201ctold him to call on the following Friday to resume his employment.\u201d Accepting this statement as true, as we must do on this appeal, we are of opinion that it sufficiently pleads a waiver by defendants of any supposed breach arising from plaintiff\u2019s enforced absence from work. The breach, having been waived, could no longer be availed of as a reason for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">The judgment must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
