The doctor induced the plaintiff to execute a release to the defendant of 'all claims for his injury, and.in consideration thereof promised the plaintiff that he would receive his wages while unable to work. This action was brought to recover wages under this agreement. The doctor testified that he had no recollection of making such a promise, and the defendant denied his authority to do so. Upon the trial one of the defendant\u2019s officers was called by the plaintiff, and asked to produce the general release. He had been duly served with a subpoena duces tecum to produce it, but testified that he was unable to find it. The defendant\u2019s attorney, then in court, was called to the stand by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and after numerous evasive answers finally admitted that the release called for by the subpoena was in court, and in his possession. The trial justice was then asked to order the attorney to produce the paper, and the court replied, \u201cI have no power,\u201d to which ruling an exception was taken. This was error. The court had the power, and the production of the paper should have been, ordered, and, in default of its production, the person having the paper under his control should have been committed for contempt. Boynton v. Boynton, 25 How. Prac. 490, affirmed 41 N. Y, 619; Stone v. Mansfield, 27 Misc. Rep. 560, 58 N. Y. Supp. 339. The release was material; It was the consideration for defendant\u2019s promise. Its recitals, it is claimed, tended to prove the contract sued on, and to establish the doctor\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
