This was error. Such a disposition \u25a0of the case is to be taken as a nonsuit. The parties are entitled to a judgment upon the merits, and this court cannot be called upon to determine the issues presented, or the weight of evidence bearing thereon, until the same has been passed upon by the court below. Schlesinger v. Jud, 61 App. Div. 453, 70 N. Y. Supp. 616; Johnson v. Duncan, 98 App. Div. 322, 90 N. Y.
