The uncontradicted evidence, however, was to the effect that defendants sublet a portion of the loft from a man named Buckley, who remained in possession of the remainder of the same loft, and that, while the faucet was physically within the boundaries of that portion of the loft occupied by defendants, yet that both defendants\u2019 employ\u00e9s and those of Buckley had access to the closet in which the faucet was, and that, in point of fact, both sets of employ\u00e9s used the closet and faucet. Under these circumstances, there was no presumption that the loss was occasioned by the negligence of defendants\u2019 servants, for it might equally have been occasioned by the negligence of one of Buckley\u2019s servants. The case, on the facts, is not to be distinguished from Moore v. Goedel, 34 N. Y. 527, which has frequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>been followed in similar cases. Harris v. Perry, 89 N. Y. 308; Wiley v. Bondy, 23 Misc. Rep. 658, 52 N. Y. Supp. <em>68; </em>Spencer v. McManus, 82 Hun, 318, 31 N. Y. Supp. 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The remark of defendants\u2019 manager (if she ever made it) that one of the girls must have left the faucet open, cannot be treated as an admission of a fact, for it clearly appears to have been merely the expression of an opinion, resting upon no actual knowledge of any fact to sustain it. The plaintiff failed to sustain the burden of proof, and the complaint should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Judgment reversed and new trial .ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
