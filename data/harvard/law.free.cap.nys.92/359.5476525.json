The portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>necessary to be quoted are as follows (the words printed in italics being those stricken out from the printed form as above stated):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201cPlease take notice, that the Peck Brothers and Company, a corporation * * * for the principal and interest of the value and agreed price of the labor and materials hereinafter mentioned which were <em>(performed </em>and\u2014 stricken out) furnished by the said lienor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-5\">\u201cThe <em>(labor performed and </em>the\u2014stricken out) materials furnished and the agreed price and value thereof are as follows: Plumbing supplies, pipe, metal goods, &amp;c.,' under contract for the sum of four thousand eight hundred and thirty seven and \u00aeVioo dollars ($4,837.04).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">\u201cThe amount unpaid to the said lienor for such labor and materials is eighteen hundred fifty-seven \u00aeVioo dollars, with interest thereon from the 1st day of October, 1903.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">\u201cThe time when the first item of work was performed was the-day of -, 1-; the time when the first materials were furnished was the eighth day of July, 1903; the time when the last item of work was performed was the-day of-, 190-; and the time when the last materials were furnished was the 21st day of Nov. 1903.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">The court below held that this notice was insufficient, and from that decision The Peck Bros'. &amp; Co. has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">In support of the notice, it is argued that the striking out of the words above indicated, together with the omission to state the time when the first or the last item of work was performed, show with sufficient clearness that the purpose of the notice was to create a lien for materials furnished only, and not for labor. On the other hand, it is argued that, since the notice in so many words claims a lien for both labor and materials, and states the amount unpaid for such labor and materials, without specifying how much of that unpaid amount is for labor and how much for materials, there is a clear failure to comply with the statutory requirement that there should be stated \"the amount unpaid to the lienor for such labor or materials.\u201d If it were held that the lien in question was claimed for labor performed as well as for materials furnished, then, unquestionably, the notice would be bad; but our opinion is that, fairly construed, the notice should be held to relate only to materials, and that the word \u201clabor,\u201d where it was allowed to remain, was plainly the result of inadvertence, and should be disregarded. The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
