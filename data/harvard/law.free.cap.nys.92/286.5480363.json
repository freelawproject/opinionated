Board of Education, 165 N. Y. 431, 59 N. E. 300), and herein the case at bar differs from McAdam v. The Mayor, 36 Hun, 340, and Fitch v. The Mayor, 40 Hun, 512. McAdam was clerk of a bureau in the finance department, and therefore directly within the language of section 59 of the Consolidation Act, Laws 1882, p. 14, c. 410, and in the Fitch Case the learned justice writing the opinion is at much pains to-demonstrate that the plaintiff was an officer and not merely an employ\u00e9. If the plaintiff did not hold an office as teacher of gymnastics, he did not fall within the prohibition of section 1549 of the-charter, Laws 1901, p. 639, c. 466, which provides that \u201cNo person shall hold two city or county offices, except as expressly provided, in this act.\u201d For a like reason he is not one'of those persons who,, by section 1533 (page 632) of the charter, are forbidden to become.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>interested in the performance of a contract, the expense, price, or consideration of which is payable from the city treasury, and, if he were, such a contract is not by the terms of the charter made absolutely void, but only voidable at the option of the comptroller (Matter of Clamp, 33 Misc. Rep. 250, 68 N. Y. Supp. 345), who in the present case is not shown, to have exercised such option. It is expressly stipulated that the. duties and hours of the employment in the two positions do not conflict. No question arises as to the assignability of the claim, because it is expressly stipulated that the defendant\u2019s sole reason for withholding payment is the belief that the employment is prohibited by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The judgment must be reversed, with costs, and, as all the facts are stipulated to, there should be judgment absolute in favor of plaintiff, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
