The papers do not show what the proposed witnesses are expected to testify to, or even about. Even the nature of the action is not shown. ' The only ground anywhere assigned for the court\u2019s action is in the opinion, which states that the plaintiff appeared and requested leave to orally cross-examine. It is altogether probable that the learned justice had good reasons for his de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>cisi\u00f3n, and those reasons were apparently stated by the plaintiff on the hearing; but they should have been made in the form of an affidavit, and incorporated in the record. Special circumstances should be shown where the privilege of oral examination or cross-examination is sought. Laidley v. Rogers (Sup.) <em>22 </em>N. Y. Supp. 458; Frounfelker v. D. L. &amp; W. Ry., 81 App. Div. 67, 80 N. Y. Supp. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The order should be modified by striking out all provisions for oral examination or cross-examination, and substituting therefor provisions for written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
