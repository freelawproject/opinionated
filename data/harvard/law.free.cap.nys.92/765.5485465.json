At the solicitation of Kelly, the defendant indorsed the check, passed it through his bank, and it was paid by the plaintiffs\u2019 bank in due course. There was judgment for the plaintiffs, and the sole question presented is whether the trial justice erred in excluding evidence tendered by the defendant as to Kelly\u2019s conversation with him at the time of the presentation of the check, and as to the defendant\u2019s subsequent delivery of the $1,200 to Kelly. The case, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>. the proof, is simply a case of money had and received. The defendant received plaintiffs\u2019 money without consideration, and in consequence of the fraud of a third person. The plaintiffs had a right to its immediate return. It is no defense that the defendant cannot be restored to his original position. Kingston Bank v. Eltinge, 40 N. Y. 399, 100 Am. Dec. 516. Evidence of defendant\u2019s good faith would be admissible only if suit were brought without previous demand. Sharkey v. Mansfield, 90 N. Y. 227, 43 Am. Rep. 161. As a demand was made, that question did not arise, and defendant\u2019s exception to the exclusion of this evidence is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
