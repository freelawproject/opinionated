Th\u00e9y were tried as one case, the evidence in the Harris case to be considered as having also been taken in the Linter case. The material facts are undisputed. Harris, the plaintiff, in company with Linter and a Mr. and Mrs. Weinstein, boarded a car of the defendant at Chatham Square and the Bowery, intending to go to the Juvenile Orphan Asylum, at 176th street and Amsterdam avenue. This car was marked, \u201cAmsterdam Ave. &amp; 195th St.\u201d Weinstein paid the fares for the entire party. Upon reaching the intersection of 125th street and 3d avenue, the conductor of the car informed the party that he \"had received orders to take the car direct to 129th street, and he thereupon gave them transfers, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>he stated would be good upon a car going west upon 125th street. These transfers were taken by the plaintiff and his friends, who alighted from the car, and immediately boarded another car, which was about to proceed westerly upon said 125th street. This car, the plaintiff testifies, was also marked, \u201cAmsterdam Ave. &amp; 195th St.\u201d Upon tendering the transfers to the conductor of that car, they were refused, the conductor saying \u201cit was against the rules,\u201d and the plaintiff was told that he must \u201cpay your fare or get off.\u201d The plaintiff thereupon paid five cents fare, as did the other members of the party.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">There is no testimony in the case showing that the plaintiff failed to take the proper car, nor was there any reason advanced for the refusal of this conductor to honor the transfers given by the first conductor. Under such circumstances, it might well be held that a refusal to accept a transfer is equivalent to a refusal to give one, and thereby renders the defendant liable to the penalty sued for. Tull\u00eds v. Brooklyn Heights R. Co., 71 App. Div. 494, 75 N. Y. Supp. 863. It was shown, however, by the defendant, that there are at least two lines of cars running westerly over and along 125th street, from its intersection with 3d avenue, which cars run over the same tracks. A lease of these lines alleged to have been given by the Metropolitan Street Railway Company to the defendant was offered and received in evidence, and marked \u201cExhibit 2,\u201d as appears by the stenographer\u2019s minutes, but no such lease is attached to or submitted with the return. The transfers given to the plaintiff, and admitted in evidence, may be taken as showing that the defendant controls and operates one of the lines above referred to; but, in the absence of the lease, this court cannot determine whether or not the car boarded by the plaintiff ran over a line controlled or operated by the defendant, and that such was the fact we cannot assume.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The records in these cases must therefore be returned to the files of the court, to enable them to be amended or completed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
