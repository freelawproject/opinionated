Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">This action was brought to recover the sum of $43,800 upon a contract of employment, and for services rendered for and at the request of the defendant by Joseph L. Prager, plaintiff\u2019s assignor, in procuring a reduction in the rate of fire insurance prevailing on defendant\u2019s building, and in securing for the defendant certain policies of insurance.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b260-15\">Argued before SCOTT, GIEGERICH, and McCALL, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-16\">Jacob Harris, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b260-17\">Joseph L.

The reduction in rates contracted for was procured, and the defendant received the full benefit provided for in the agreement. The principle that an agent cannot delegate his power has no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-20\">As to the $100 which the jury disallowed, there was evidence that a subsequent agreement was made that the defendant should receive this amount of benefit, additional to the reduction in rate already secured. If the jury saw fit to disallow that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the defendant has no just ground of grievance. The argument for reversal proceeds on the theory that, as the defendant had testified that this sum was to be used as a bribe, its disallowance by the jury demonstrates that they believed such testimony. They were distinctly charged, however, that, if they so believed, the plaintiff could not recover at all. Their verdict shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that they regarded the $100 in question as an additional benefit due the defendant, rather than as a provision for a bribe which would invalidate the plaintiff's entire claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
