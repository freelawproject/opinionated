The assignor, the plaintiff\u2019s only witness, was cross-examined by the defendant\u2019s counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-17\">\u201cQ. You have assigned this claim, as I understand? A. Yes, sir. Q. You are still interested in the result of this suit, are you not? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: I object to that. (Objection sustained.) Defendant\u2019s Counsel: I wish to show /his interest as a witness; that is all. The Court: I sustain the objection. (Exception.) Q. Have you assigned this under an arrangement by which the result of the suit will affect whether it amounts to the payment or not on a transaction? Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel: Objected to on. the ground that it Is incompetent, irrelevant, and immaterial. (Objection sustained: Exception.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-18\">This cross-examination was proper, as tending to show that the plaintiff was an interested witness. It related to the weight and credibility of his testimony, and was therefore proper matter for submission to the jury. The exceptions by the defendant\u2019s counsel to the exclusion of this cross-examination were well taken, and discloses a material error, which calls for the reversal of the judgment. Vaughn v. Westover, 2 Hun, 43; Cady v. Bradshaw, 116 N. Y. 188, 22 N. E. 371, 5 L. R. A. 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-19\">The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
