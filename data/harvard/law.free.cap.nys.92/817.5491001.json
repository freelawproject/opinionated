Same\u2014Alias Summons\u2014Service.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b841-12\">Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1498, c. 580) \u00a7 26, provides that an , action must be commenced by the service of summons. Section 30 (page 1499) provides that, if defendant cannot be found, the clerk, at the request of pl\u00e1intiff, shall issue another summons, to be known and stamped \u201calias.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that service of an alias is not fatally defective, although the original summons is not also served therewith.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b841-13\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Eleventh District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b841-14\">Action by Gustavus L. Lawrence against Benjamin Bernstein. From a judgment for plaintiff, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b841-15\">Argued before SCOTT, O\u2019GORMAN, and BLANCHARD, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b841-16\">Elias Rosenthal, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b841-17\">William A. Walling, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b841-18\">O\u2019GORMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4s\">The objections urged by the appellant.herein are not sufficient to invalidate the judgment. The failure to state in the affidavit upon which an order for substituted service of the summons was granted that no previous application for such an order had been made was an irregularity merely, and refusal of the trial justice to dismiss the complaint upon that ground does not constitute reversible error. Skinner v. Steele, 88 Hun, 307, 34 N. Y. Supp. 748; Matter of Natl. Gramophone Co., 82 App. Div. 593, 81 N. Y. Supp. 853; Pratt v. Bray, 10 Misc. Rep. 445, 31 N. Y. Supp. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-19\">Neither is the fact that an alias summons only was served upon the defendant a fatal defect. Section 26 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1498, c. 580) provides that \u201can action must be commenced by the service of a summons.\u201d Section 30 (page 1499) provides that if the marshal, or other person having the summons to serve, cannot find the defendant, the clerk shall, at the request of the plaintiff, continue to \u201cissue another summons,\u201d to be known and stamped \u201calias,\u201d until the defendant is served. There is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>provision in said act which requires that, with the service of this \"alias\u201d summons, the original summons shall also be served.^ The \u201calias\u201d summons is as much a writ issued to obtain jurisdiction-of the defendant as the first summons issued. The provision for the issuance of an \u201calias\u201d summons is for the purpose of keeping the cause' of action alive, as the same section provides that \u201can action shall be deemed commenced at' the time the summons is actually-delivered for service,\u201d and an \u201calias\u201d writ is \u201ca second writ issued when the first has failed its purpose.\u201d Century Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The appellant\u2019s criticism as to the form of the summons, even if tenable, is not borne out by the return. The form of the summons filed with the return seems to conform to that prescribed in the Municipal Court act. The defendant also failed to show a surrender and acceptance by the landlord of the demised premises, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
