One of the defendants admitted on the trial that at that time the property in question was stored in his name, and it may be inferred that he controlled its possession. At the close of the trial the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted to so much of the learned court\u2019s charge \u201cas holds that, even if the defendants had no possession of the property, if they were in any way concerned in the wrongful sale of it they are liable in an action for replevin.\u201d We think the law as stated by the court is sustained by the case of Nichols v. Michael, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number><em>23 </em>N. Y. 264, 80 Am. Dec. 259, and by the more recent case of Sinnott v. Feiock, 165 N. Y. 444, 59 N.
