The plaintiff paid to the defendant $300 on account of the purchase price specified .in the contract, but when the time arrived for passing the title the plaintiff refused to accept the deed tendered by the defendant on the ground that the title was unmarketable because of certain encroachments of adjoining buildings thereon, and because the buildings on the property to be conveyed themselves encroached upon the street. Upon these facts, and the further allegation that he had incurred an expense of $75 for examining the title to the .premises and obtaining a survey thereof, the plaintiff brought this action, in which he demanded judgment that, if it were decreed by the court that the defendant had a good and marketable title, she should be compelled to specifically perform the terms of her contract, but that, if it were decreed that she had not such title, the plaintiff have judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ment against her for $375, and that said judgment be impressed as a lien upon the defendant\u2019s land as described in the contract. The learned judge at Special Term found that the defendant could not convey a good and marketable title on account of the encroachments and intrusions which existed on the premises, and on the street in front thereof, and thereupon rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff in-accordance with the prayer o-f the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The evidence upon the trial showed encroachments upon the street of 16 and 17 inches by the show windows of the two buildings erected on the premises. Counsel for the respondent, however, concedes that these encroachments cannot be deemed substantial, under the decisions in Volz v. Steiner, 67 App. Div. 504, 73 N. Y. Supp. 1006, and Webster v. Kings County Trust Co., 145 N. Y. 275, 39 N. E. 964. It was also made to appear by the survey which was put in evidence that the buildings themselves, irrespective of the show windows, encroached upon the street from <em>iy2 </em>to 5 inches, and it is contended that such latent encroachment rendered the title to the property unmarketable, under the decision of the General Term of the New York Superior Court inSmithers v. Steiner, 13 Misc. Rep. 517, 34 N. Y. Supp. 678. However this may be, the further uncontradicted proof, showing that the adjoining buildings encroached from 1 to <em>Zy2 </em>inches upon the property contracted to be sold, justified the vendee in rejecting the title. See opinion of Ingraham, J., in Volz v. Steiner, 67 App. Div., on page 508, 73 N. Y. Supp. 1006. The trial court was therefore right in adjudging-that the plaintiff was entitled to the return of the $300 deposit, and to-recover the $75 claimed as a reasonable expense incurred in making the search and obtaining the survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The judgment rendered, however, was erroneous in so far as it impressed this sum, together with the interest and costs, as a lien upon the premises which were the subject of the contract. The cases-relied upon by the respondent as sustaining this procedure were cases-in which the vendees, under an agreement to sell, had taken actual possession of the land, and were held to be entitled to an equitable lien-on the premises for the moneys expended in improvements thereon. King\u2019s Heirs v. Thompson, 9 Pet. 204, 9 L. Ed. 102; Gibert v. Peteler, 38 N. Y. 165, 97 Am. Dec. 785. No lien exists, however, in behalf of a purchaser, under the circumstances disclosed by the evidence in-this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">The judgment should be modified -by striking out all that portion thereof which relates to the alleged lien and its foreclosure, and, as thus modified, should be affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. All concur, except HOOKER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
