As the record stood before the amendment, the defendant was bound to be defeated and to be mulcted in costs, for the ground on which the reversal of the former judgment went left no other alternative. 43 Misc. Rep. 393, 87 N. Y. Supp. 474. She should not by an amendment at this late day not only defeat the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, but also escape the payment of the costs already accrued. We cannot, however, entertain this appeal, because the order sought to be reviewed is not appealable, under the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1486, c. 580). Leavitt v. Katzoff, 43 Misc.
