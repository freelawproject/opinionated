The plaintiffs procured such loan, and paid defendant\u2019s mortgage. The new mortgagee testified without objection that the expenses of obtaining such loan was $80. As the defendant only obligated himself to pay the expense of procuring the loan, the judgment should have been for the sum of $80 only.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Judgment modified by reducing the amount of recovery to the sum of $80 and costs, based upon that recovery in the court below, but without costs to either party of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
