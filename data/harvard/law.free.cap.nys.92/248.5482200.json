He testified that he had examined the plaintiff on September 8,1904, a little more than two weeks after the accident. He testified that he found \"an old scar\u201d just outside of the outer angle of the right eye, and a painful point on the back part of the he'ad. It seems to be evident that any scar which justified the description \u00f3f \u201cold\u201d on September 8th could not have been the result of an accident on August 22d. The next question was a hypothetical one, commencing as follows: \u201cAssuming that Mr. Fitzpatrick was thrown from a car August 22, 1904, sustaining a bruise over the right eye that inflicted a scar that you found there on September 8, 1904.\u201d Here it was assumed what could not have been the fact\u2014 that the scar which the doctor described as \u201cold\u201d was the result of an injury received in the accident of which complaint was made. The question was properly objected to, and an exception taken to its admission. The doctor evidently saw the false assumption, for he replied guardedly that the facts stated indicated that the plaintiff had had concussion of the brain \u201csome time,\u201d which is evidently very different from saying that he had had it as the result of an accident on August 22d. The next question pushed the error even further, for it asked the doctor to assume \u201cthat he did have concussion of the brain at that time,\u201d of which there was not the slightest evidence. As to this question the proper objection and exception were taken. By this method of examination it was made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>to appear to the jury that an \u201cold scar,\u201d which, in the very nature of things, if \u201cold,\u201d could not have resulted from the accident, indicated that the plaintiff had suffered on August 22d an injury which was liable to have permanent effects. The verdict was a substantial one, and we are not able to say that the errors pointed out did not prejudice the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
