See Mitchell v. Rochester Railway Co., 151 N. Y. 107, 45 N. E. 354, 34 L. R. A. 781, 56 Am. St. Rep. 604. In the case cited there was no immediate personal injury\u2014no physical impact or exercise of force upon the body of the plaintiff. In the case at bar the collision threw the plaintiff from her seat forward against the glass at the side of the car, and then to the floor between the seats, from which she was picked up, crying and screaming, by a fellow passenger. The medical evidence, and the testimony in reference to the child\u2019s exclamations indicative of bodily pain, fully justify the inference that ar abnormal nervous condition, partly manifested by \u201cnight terrors,\u201d was produced in thfe plaintiff by the physical shock which she suffered in consequence of the collision, and the right to recover for such injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>inflicted by the negligence of the defendant cannot seriously be questioned. Fright may properly be considered as an element of damage \u2022 when it is associated with actual bodily injury. Jones v. Brooklyn Heights Railroad Co., 23 App. Div. 141, 48 N. Y. Supp. 914. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-3\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur, except HOOKER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
