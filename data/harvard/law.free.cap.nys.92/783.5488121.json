Root v. Great Western R. R., 45 N. Y. 524. A carrier may, indeed, make a special contract for-through transportation, but the burden of such a contract rests upon the plaintiff who seeks to enforce it. In the present case not only is there no proof of such a contract, but the shipping receipt contains a special clause exempting the first carrier from liability beyond its own lines. It appears by stipulation that the defendant railroad \u25a0 company safely delivered the goods to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>next connecting carrier on the route to final destination. On the proof as it stood, the defendant should have succeeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
