The sole question on this appeal is whether service of a.no tice was a condition precedent to the bringing of this action. The First Department of this court has decided that that was a condition precedent. Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 80 App. Div. 541, 80 N. Y. Supp. 705; Id., 83 App. Div. 339, 82 N. Y. Supp. 366; Johnson v. Roach, 83 App. Div. 351, 82 N. Y. Supp. 203. And the same rule has been announced in Veginan v. Morse, 160 Mass. 143, 35 N. E. 451. I think that those decisions are correct, and that we should follow them.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">It is insisted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the Court of Appeals in Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 178 N. Y. 147, 70 N. E. 411, reversing Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 87 App. Div. 631, 84 N. Y. Supp. 1127, has rejected the doctrine of Johnson v. Roach, supra. My opinion is to the contrary. Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 87 App. Div. 631, 84 N. Y. Supp. 1127, the judgment reversed ut supra, is not reported save that it is stated that \u201con the authority of Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 83 App. Div. 339, 82 N. Y. Supp. 366,\u201d the judgment is reversed, with costs. In Gmaehle v. Rosenberg, 83 App. Div. 339, 82 N. Y. Supp. 366, the court held that chapter 600, p. 1748, of the Laws of 1902, is a general act, which applies to every action brought after its passage by servant against master, whether under the common law or any statute, and that the rule as to notice laid down in same case (80 App. Div. 541, 80 N. Y. Supp. 705) must apply, though the complaint was framed under section 18 of the Labor Law (Laws 1897, p. 467, c. 415). The question certified to the Court of Appeals on the appeal from the said judgment in 87 App. Div. 631, 84 N. Y. Supp. 1127, was: \u201cIs the service of a notice of the time, place, and cause.of the injury by the servant upon the master within 120 days after the occurrence of the accident, as provided for by chapter 600, p. 1748, of the Laws of 1902, entitled 'An act to extend and regulate the liability of employers to make compensation' for personal injuries suffered by employ\u00e9s/ a condition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>precedent to the maintenance of an action against the employer to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the employ\u00e9 after the passage of said act?\u201d The question certified was answered in the negative. But a reading of the opinion of the court, per Cullen, J., - shows that it held that the statute limited the requirement of notice to actions under the act (chapter 60,0, p. 1748, Laws of 1902), and that the statute did not cover the whole liability of employer to employ\u00e9. This rule had been enunciated by this department of the court in Rosin v. Lidgerwood Manufacturing Co., 89 App. Div. 245, 86 N. Y. Supp. 49, and Cullen, J., in his opinion approves the doctrine of that decision, save that he does not pass upon the semble by two of the members of this court as to the unconstitutionality of the act if given the broad construction contended for but rejected. It is clear, then, that the Court of Appeals has neither rejected nor disapproved the rule that, where the action is brought solely under chapter 600, p. 1748, of the Laws of 1902, the service of the notice required by section 2 of the act is a condition precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">The learned counsel for the appellant says that, \u201cif the act in question had used the word \u2018commenced,\u2019 instead of the word \u2018maintained,\u2019 there might not be any question as to the interpretation which should be placed upon said act.\u201d I think that the word \u201cmaintained\u201d in this statute is synonymous or equipollent with the word \u201cbegun\u201d or \u201ccommenced\u201d to the effect that the requirement is a condition precedent. Burbank v. Inhabitants of Auburn, 31 Me. 590; Boutiller v. Steamboat Milwaukee, 8 Minn. 97, 105 (Gil. 72); Smith v. Lyon, 44 Conn. 178; Byers v. Bourret, 64 Cal. 73, 28 Pac. 61. The expression of Platt, B., in Moon v. Durden, 2 Ex. 21: \u201cThe verb \u2018to maintain\u2019 in pleading has a distinct technical signification. It signifies to support what has already been brought into existence\u201d\u2014is often quoted. But examination of the report shows that the phrase under consideration was \u201cno suit shall be brought or maintained,\" and the question was as to the retrospective force of the statute. The other judges did not agree with the opinion. They were of opinion that the expression \u201cor maintained\u201d was redundant or surplusage. And Alderson, B., in his opinion says: \u201cIf it had been stated that \u2018no action shall be brought\u2019 or only that no action shall be maintained, it seems to me clear that we should have considered the words \u2018brought\u2019 and \u2018maintained\u2019 as synonymous, and as prohibiting the success of future suits alone.\u201d Chapter 572, p. 801, of the Laws of 1886, entitled \u201cAn act in relation to certain actions against municipal corporations,\u201d provides: \u201cNo action against the mayor, aldermen or commonalty of any city * * * shall be maintained, unless the same shall be commenced within one year, * * * nor unless notice * * * shall have been filed,\u201d etc. Here, then, is a statutory provision that no action shall be maintained unless notice shall have been filed. It was held that this notice was a condition precedent. Mertz v. City of Brooklyn (Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 778, affirmed 128 N. Y. 617,28 N. E. 253..</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. .All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
