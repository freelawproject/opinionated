The referee to whom the proceeding was referred to take proof found that the petitioner, Henry C. Rogers, was not, at the times mentioned in his petition, the owner of any stock of the Union Bank. The evidence leaves no doubt of the correctness of this conclusion, for it shows that the 136 shares of stock which he claimed to own were in fact the property of one William H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Ziegler. \u25a0 We agree with the referee that section 36 of the banking law refers to the actual ownership of stock, and not to shares standing in the name of one, but really the property of'another. The petitioner, Henry C. Rogers, was shown to have no interest entitling him to maintain this proceeding, and it was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The order and judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Order and judgment thereon dismissing application affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. HOOKER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
