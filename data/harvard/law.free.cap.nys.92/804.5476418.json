The note was dated April 15, 1894, but both parties conceded on the trial that the date should be 1904, and, as originally drawn, \u201cdue .no time.\u201d The following September the defendant struck out the words \u201cno time,\u201d and wrote instead \u201cMay 1st, 1905.\u201d He claims the time was extended by agreement. This the plaintiff denies. In any event, there was no consideration for the extension. The plaintiff sued the defendant in this action to recover for money loaned, disregarding the note. The defendant pleaded the outstanding note in the hands of the plaintiff, and that it was not due, and that the action was prematurely brought. Such was the issue. The trial court gave judgment for the plaintiff, and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">It is the well-settled law of the state that the taking by a creditor of the debtor\u2019s note for the existing indebtedness does not merge or extinguish the indebtedness. The note is simply evidence of the debt, and when default is made in the payment the creditor may sue upon the original demand, and bring the note into court, to be delivered up on the trial. This is what was done in this case, and the note in question is a part of the record. Even admitting that the plaintiff promised to extend the time of payment of the note to May 1, 1905, as claimed by the defendant, such promise was not binding upon the plaintiff, for the reason that the promise was not supported by sufficient consideration. In the case of Parmelee v. Thompson, 45 N. Y. 58, 6 Am. Rep. 33, the court says, \u201cA prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>ise to extend the time of payment of a debt is void, unless founded upon a good consideration.\u201d To the same effect is Blake v. Clausen, 10 App. Div. 223, 41 N. Y. Supp. 772, affirmed in 158 N. Y. 727, 53 N. E. 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">It follows that the judgment , must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
