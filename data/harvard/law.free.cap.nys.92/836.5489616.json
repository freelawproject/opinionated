Service of the summons, when first issued, not having been made upon the defendants, alias summons were issued, served, and returned with an affidavit of such service indorsed thereon. The appellants\u2019 main contention herein is that the copy alias summons served upon the defendants, not bearing thereon the indorsement \u201caction for a penalty pursuant to the provisions of chapter 667, pp. 1480-1482, of the Laws of 1900, sections 198, 201,\u201d as required by-section 38 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1502, c. 580), the court below acquired no jurisdiction of the defendants, and therefore erred in not granting the defendants\u2019 motion made to set aside the service and vacate the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">. The orders appealed from recite that the plaintiff was allowed to file \u201can amended affidavit of service showing the indorsements on the copy summons served,\u201d and the defendants\u2019 counsel admits in his brief that \u201ca copy of alias summons, together with a copy summons, was served upon the defendant.\u201d The only object of the indorsement referring to the cause of action is to give the person sued notice of the nature of the action (Townsend v. Hopkins, 9 Civ. Proc. R. 257), and, as the original summons and the copy summons served had upon it the required reference to the cause of action, and the copy summons was served with the alias summons, the object of the statute was accomplished as well and as effectually as though such indorsement had also been made upon the alias summons. It does not appear that the defendants made any objection to the filing of the \"amended affidavit of service,\u201d which was evidently made for the purpose of showing that the copy summons, with the proper indorsements thereon as aforesaid, was served with the copy alias summons. It is therefore now too late to question the right of the \u2022 plaintiff to file such \"amended affidavit.\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Orders in each case affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
