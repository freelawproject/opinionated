It appeared that, after the summons was served, defendant submitted the plans to the building department, and that they were not approved; but there was some question whether the objections were based on the plaintiff\u2019s errors, or could not have been easily obviated. On cross-examination, defendant was asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t deny the fact that you owed the money until you were sued?\u201d and he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t deny it now.\u201d <em>Held </em>insufficient to sustain a judgment for defendant.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-11\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Queens, Second District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-12\">Action by John A.

The action is for architect\u2019s services. If is not clear that the defendant rejected the plans as finally submitted. If he did, it is not clear but that his reason for rejection was his final determination not to put up the house. Of course, the plans must be workable. As to that the experts clashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-17\">The fact that after the summons was served the defendant submitted the plans, with his application, to the building department, in order to test them, and that the plans were not approved, is not controlling in this case. For there is some question whether the plans thus submitted were defective, within all of the objections, and, if objectionable in some respects, whether the objections were based upon the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>tiff\u2019s errors or omissions, or could not have been easily' obviated. Moreover, on cross-examination the defendant was asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t deny the fact that you owed the money until you were sued ?\u201d and he answered, \u201cI don\u2019t deny it now.\u201d He did not attempt to retract or qualify the answer. Judgment of municipal court reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">HOOKER, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
