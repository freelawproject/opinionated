The wager was made with the defendant Rose, a so-called \u201cbookmaker.\u201d The action is brought under the provisions of sections 8, 9, 1 Rev. St. (1st Ed.) pt. 1, c. 20, tit. 8, p. 662 (1 Birdseye Rev. St. [3d Ed.] pp. 299, 300). The trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff by the direction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-18\">At the opening of the trial, and again at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendant, Rose, moved for a dismissal of the complaint on the ground that it failed to allege a demand for the payment of the amount of the wager. The motions were denied, and exceptions taken. The precise question raised by these exceptions has been recently decided adversely to the defendant in Mendoza v. Levy, 98 App. Div. 326, 90 N. Y. Supp. 748, and therefore need not be further considered here. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence sufficiently establishes the cause of action under the statute, and, as none of the exceptions discloses any error calling for a reversal, the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
