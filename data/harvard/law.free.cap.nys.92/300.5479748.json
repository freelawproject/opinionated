A motion was made by the defendant to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction. The plaintiff thereupon offered to waive the interest, and judgment was subsequently rendered for the plaintiff for the sum of $500 and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>We think the motion to dismiss the complaint should have been granted. Section 1, subd. 1, of the Municipal Court Act, gives the Municipal Court jurisdiction in this class of cases only where \u201cthe sum claimed does not exceed $500.\u201d Laws 1902, p. 1487, c. 580. An action is commenced by the service of a summons, and it is such summons, and the service thereof, that gives the court jurisdiction. It was held in Heffron v. Jennings, 66 App. Div. 443, 73 N. Y. Supp. 410, that, although the summons \u201cdid not specify any sum for which judgment would be taken, * * * it did state that judgment would be taken for the relief demanded in the complaint; and that the complaint, which was served at the same time as the summons, demanded a sum exceeding the jurisdiction of the court, * * * the court acquired no jurisdiction for any purpose whatever.\u201d This was followed by this court in Pierson v. Hughes, 88 N. Y. Supp. 1059. In the case at bar both the summons and complaint claimed $500 and interest. Interest is a direct part of the claim upon which the plaintiff sued, and \u201cthe sum claimed\u201d exceeded the jurisdiction of the court. It is true section 250 of the Municipal Court Act (page 1562) permits a party to remit the excess if \u201cthe sum found due exceeds the sum for which the court is authorized to enter judgment,\u201d but that section applies only to cases where the court has acquired jurisdiction in the first instance, and is not, therefore, to be divested of such jurisdiction by a finding that there is an amount due a party greater than the court can enter judgment for, where such party is willing to remit the excess. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
