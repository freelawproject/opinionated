The court below found that all the articles were delivered by defendant according to the contract, except a millinery case. The evidence showed that the millinery case had been completed, but that the plaintiffs told the defendant that he need not deliver it, as they would not accept it, because it was not properly made. This attitude of the plaintiffs made it unnecessary for the defendant to make any further tender, and, under the authorities, he could then pursue one of three courses: He could store or retain the property ,for the vendees, and sue for the entire purchase price; or he could sell the property, and recover the difference between the contract price and the price obtained upon a resale; or he could retain the property as his. own, and recover the difference between the market value at the time and place of delivery and the contract price. Moore v. Potter, 155 N. Y. 481, 486, 50 N. E. 271, 63 Am. St. Rep. 692; Bridgford v. Crocker, 60 N. Y. 627. In the case at bar the answer and the evidence show that the defendant retained the case as the property of the plaintiffs, and sued for the balance of the contract price. In his answer he states that \u201cthe plaintiff notified defendant that he would not receive the millinery case; that the defendant has always been \u2018ready and willing to perform the contract.\u201d Evidence was given by the defendant tending to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>these allegations. Defendant\u2019s bookkeeper, for instance, testified, in effect, that he went to the store of the plaintiffs, and said to them: \u201cThere is a millinery case, and we will put it up, and we will see that it is all right.\u201d The plaintiffs answered: \u201cWe don\u2019t want the millinery case. We won\u2019t have it. You tell your boss we don\u2019t want the millinery case.\u201d In addition to this, the defendant testified at the trial that he was then willing and ready to deliver the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In view of this evidence, it would appear that the defendant had elected to retain the property for the plaintiffs, and not as his own. If so, he has a good cause of action, under the authorities, for the balance of the contract price.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs to the defendant</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b75-7\">MacLEAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1n\">(concurring). By written contract, the party of the first part, the defendant herein, agreed \u201cto make,. deliver and fix up\u201d certain fixtures, among which was a millinery case, for the parties of the second part, the plaintiffs herein; and \u201cthe price for said job including material, labor, and delivery,\u201d was agreed upon. No sufficient reason appears for disturbing the determination of the trial justice upon the claim of the plaintiffs for failure to deliver, what was delivered, pursuant to the terms of the contract, or upon the counterclaim of the defendant for the recovery of the balance of the contract price. The evidence disclosed that the millinery case had been completed when the contract was rescinded by the plaintiffs by informing the defendant that he need not deliver, nor would they accept, the millinery case. In such case the defendant was bound neither to deliver nor tender, for the article had been manufactured; nor was he limited to recover the difference between the contract price and the value of the article at the time and place appointed for its delivery (Todd v. Gamble, 67 Hun, 38, 39, 40, 21 N. Y. Supp. 739, and Bement v. Smith, 15 Wend. 493), but had his election as set forth in Dustan v. McAndrew, 44 N. Y. 72. The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">SCOTT, J., concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
