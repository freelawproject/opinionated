The affidavit of defendant is clearly insufficient. All he says is that after the trial he found a check which he had paid to plaintiff and had not produced or proved on the trial. He does not show that he made any search before the trial, or give any reason why he did not find it. He does not even say that it was paid on account of the debt for which he was sued.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-16\">Order reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
