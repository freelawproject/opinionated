Municipal Court\u2014Appeal\u2014Judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-8\">Under Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1587, c. 580), contemplating the entry of judgment on demurrer, where the record discloses only an-order sustaining a demurrer, without a judgment, an appeal cannot be heard.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-9\">2. Same\u2014Appealable Orders.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-10\">The Supreme Court\u2019s power to entertain appeals from' the Municipal Court is purely statutory, and only such orders are appealable as are enumerated in Municipal Court Act, \u00a7\u00a7 253-257 (Laws 1902, pp. 1562, 1563, c. 580).</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-11\">3. Same\u2014Dismissal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-12\">Though the practice in the Municipal Court might be assimilated with that of the Supreme Court, under Municipal Court Act, \u00a7 20 (Laws 1902, p. 1496, c. 580), an appeal must be dismissed when the record does not contain a judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-13\">4. Same\u2014Notice of Appeal\u2014Recital of Judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b334-14\">Where the record does not contain a- judgment, a recital of a judgment in the notice of appeal is not sufficient, as the court cannot review a \" judgment not before it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-15\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Thirteenth District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-16\">Action by Bessie Smith against Horace S. Ely and others. From an order sustaining a demurrer to the complaint, plaintiff appeals. Dismissed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b334-17\">Argued before SCOTT, GIEGERICH, and McCALL, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-18\">Joseph Gans, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b334-19\">Elbert B. Hamlin, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b334-20\">GIEGERICH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcY\">The notice of appeal recites that the plaintiff appeals \u201cfrom the order and judgment entered herein sustaining the demurrer of the defendants to the plaintiff\u2019s complaint.\u201d The record, however, discloses that the only step taken in the lower court was the entry of an order sustaining such demurrer, and granting leave to the plaintiff to file an amended complaint upon terms, and that no judgment was ever entered upon such order.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-21\">Section 334 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1587, c. 580) clearly contemplates the entry of a judgment upon a demurrer; and, unless such act contains a provision for the taking of an appeal from an order sustaining or overruling a demurrer, the appeal cannot be heard. Our attention has not been called to any, nor have we been able after diligent search to discover any such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-22\">The power of the Supreme Court to entertain appeals from the Municipal Court is purely statutory. Pascocello v. Brooklyn Heights R. Co., 26 Misc. Rep. 412, 56 N. Y. Supp. 177; Leavitt v. Katzoff, 43 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Misc. Rep. 36, 86 N. Y. Supp. 495. And only such orders are appeal-able as are enumerated in sections 253, 354, 355, 256, and 357 (pages 1562, 1563) of the said act. Leavitt v. Katzoff, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">If it could be said that by virtue of section 20 of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1902, p. 1496, c. 580), the practice in the Municipal Court might be assimilated with that of the Supreme Court, the appeal must nevertheless be dismissed, as the record does not contain a judgment. Cambridge Valley National Bank v. Lynch, 76 N. Y. 514; Ridgway v. Bacon, 68 Hun, 506, 22 N. Y. Supp. 1016. See McKeown v. Officer, 127 N. Y. 687, 28. N. E. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The mere recital of a judgment in the notice of appeal is not sufficient, since the court cannot review a judgment not before it. Ridgway v. Bacon, 68 Hun, 506, 22 N. Y. Supp. 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The appeal should therefore be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">Appeal dismissed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
