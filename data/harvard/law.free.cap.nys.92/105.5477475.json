Such services have heretofore been rendered by county judges and by judges of the City Court upon the assumption that, inasmuch as compensation had not been so fixed for them, they should not receive it. See Matter of W. S. A. &amp; P. R. Co., 115 N. Y. 442, 447, 22 N. E. 356; Easton v. Pickers-gill, 55 N. Y. 310; Sutherland on Stat. Cons. \u00a7 309. The present provision, so far as it affects the relator, was in force when he took office. We must presume that he knew of it. He rendered these services from year to year, throughout his term, without seeking action to afford him any compensation for them. The first intimation or suggestion of any claim therefor is a demand made more than two years after the close of his term, and consequently after the end of his services. We think that the relator has so far acquiesced in this practical construction as to forfeit all right to the relief demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The order should be reversed, without costs, and the application denied, without costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">HOOKER, not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
