The performance of plaintiff\u2019s work was not seriously disputed, and the conclusion of the trial justice that there was an amount due from the defendant to the principal contractor sufficient to cover plaintiff\u2019s claim- is amply supported by the evidence. The judgment however, must be reversed for a defect in the notice of lien and for failure of necessary averments in the complaint. The mechanic\u2019s lien stated that \u201cthe agreed price or value thereof is two hundred and fifty dollars.\u201d It has been frequently held that a statement in the disjunctive excludes both of the matters thereby sought to be affirmed, and is not in compliance with the law. In Villaume v. Kirchner (Sup.) 85 N. Y. Supp. 377, this court held a lien defective because of the alternative statement of \u201cthe agreed price or value.\u201d The validity of this lien cannot, therefore, be upheld, and a personal judgment cannot be awarded against the owner, as it is not alleged or claimed that a contractual relation existed between him and the lienor. The omission to state in the complaint that any sum was actually due to the original contractor was fatal, apart from the defect in the lien, and no attempt was made upon the trial to amend. Ball v. Clark, 31 App. Div. 356, 52 N. Y. Supp. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to defendant to abide event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
