The ground upon which the attachment was applied for was that defendant had departed from the state with intent to defraud his creditors and avoid the service of summons, and kept himself concealed with like intent. Not one evidentiary fact is contained in the affidavit upon which the warrant was issued. The plaintiff swears that defendant has so departed with said intent, but clearly this is merely a statement of his belief, and he does not say upon what such belief was founded. He says that he and his employ\u00e9s have made diligent efforts to find defendant, but he does not show in what those efforts consisted, so that the court could form a judgment whether they were really diligent or not. He swears that his \u201cemploy\u00e9s have been informed that he [defendant] has so departed as above set forth,\u201d but he does not show what his employ\u00e9s were told, or who told them, or who the employ\u00e9s were that were <em>told; </em>nor does he furnish the affidavits of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>the employ\u00e9s themselves, or of the persons who informed them, or give any reason for not furnishing them. It is difficult to imagine a more completely insufficient affidavit, and it obviously conferred no jurisdiction upon the justice to issue a warrant. Steuben Co. Bank v. Alberger, 78 N. Y. 252, 258. The attachment itself was irregular and void, in that it was not signed by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, as required by section 641, Code Civ. Proc. McDonald v. Kieferdorfer, 18 N. Y. Supp. 763. And finally the evidence taken upon the inquest failed to show that anything was due to plaintiff. It consisted merely of the contract, and plaintiff\u2019s conclusion that something was due, but included no proof of performance by plaintiff. The jurisdictional defect, however, is fatal to the judgment and to the maintenance of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Judgment reversed and complaint dismissed, with costs to appellant in this court and the court below.
