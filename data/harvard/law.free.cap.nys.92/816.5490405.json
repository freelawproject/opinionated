The covenants were not identical in language, and, in my opinion, were not identical in effect. The covenant in Purdy\u2019s lease to defendant was that defendant would \u201cproperly and fully comply with all the orders, rules and regulations of the Board of Health and other municipal departments as may be issued or apply to said premises.\u201d This covenant was without limitation in \u25a0 terms, and may be broad enough to cover the erection of a fire escape under an order of the tenement house department, although we are not called upon to determine that question here. The plaintiff\u2019s covenant is that he will \u201cpromptly execute and comply with all the statutes, rules, orders, ordinances and regulations of the State or City Governments and of any and all their departments .and bureaus applicable to said premises, for the correction, prevention and abatement of nuisances or other grievances in, upon or connected with said premises during said term.\u201d By this covenant the tenant\u2019s obligation respecting orders of a city department is limited to those issued for the \u201ccorrection, prevention and abatement of nuisances or other grievances,\u201d and these words are to be taken in their natural and usual sense. The absence of a fire escape is not a \u201cnuisance,\u201d as that word is commonly used, and we are referred to no statute which so classifies it. The more generic words \u201cother grievances\u201d do not extend the plaintiff\u2019s liability so far as to render him liable for the cost of the fire escape. To this covenant should be applied the common rule of construction, equally applicable to contracts and statutes, that \u201cwhen two or more words of analogous meaning are coupled together, they are understood to be used in their cognate sense, express the same relation, and give color and expression to. each other.\u201d Wakefield v. Fargo, 90 N. Y. 213, 218. The learned justice expressed himself as of the opinion that it was .\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>not within the contemplation of the parties to provide for an order to do such an important piece of work. What may have been in their minds it is impossible to tell except from their contract, but it seems to me quite clear that the work for which it is sought to hold plaintiff was not within the letter of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
