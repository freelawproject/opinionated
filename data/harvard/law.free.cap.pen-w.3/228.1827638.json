Fas. Foss, </em>was issued, and A was put into the possession of the land by the sheriff. B a few days afterwards, and before the return day of tire <em>Hub. Fas. Foss., </em>again got possession of the land by fraud or deceit, and retained it by force. In a second ejectment by A against B for the same land, proof of these circumstances alone, \u25a0were held not to be sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover.</headnotes>\n\n<summary id=\"b228-8\">This was an action of ejectment, in which <em>John R. Dobson </em>was plaintiff, and <em>Thomas Griffeth </em>was defendant, for a tract of land, thus described in the writ: \u201cThat the said <em>Thomas Griffeth </em>now is in the actual possession of a tract of land, situate, lying and being in <em>Dickinson </em>township, <em>Cumberland </em>county, bounded by lands of <em>Peter Bge </em>and the <em>Jldams </em>county line, the right of possession,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b228-9\">To January term, 1825, an ejectment was brought for the same land, by the same plaintiff, against the same defendant; in which, at January term, 1827, a judgment by default was rendered for want of a plea by the defendant; upon this judgment, an <em>Hab. Fas. Poss. </em>was issued, and the plaintiff was put into possession of the land by the sheriff; \u2014 two days afterwards, the defendant obtained the possession from a tenant whom <em>Dobson </em>had put into possession to keep it for him, by fraud and deceit; and when in the possession thus obtained, he held it by force. Upon these facts the court below, at the instance of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, thus instructed the jury:</summary>\n\n\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b229-7\">\n<em>F. Watts, contra.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<opinion><p id=\"b228-5\">The <em>quality of </em>land in a tract, for which ejectment was brought, is not essential to the description contained in the writ, if the land be otherwise sufficiently described..</p><p id=\"b228-7\">Error to <em>Cumberland </em>county.</p><p id=\"b228-10\">\u201cIt seems that <em>Griffeth, </em>under his lease from <em>Groop, </em>got into possession in 1825. Ejectment was immediately brought against him by <em>Dobson, </em>and are covery was had; and upon a writ of <em>Hab. Fas. Poss., </em>the defendant was put put of possession on. <em>Wednesday, </em>and the plaintiff, by his agent <em>Kennedy, </em>was put in; but before the <em>Friday </em>following, <em>Groop </em>and <em>Griffeth </em>had again entered the house with <em>Kennedy, </em>and <em>Dobson </em>was then expelled. If they did it by fraud or force, it was in contempt of the law and the process of the court; and on application, before the return of the execution, the court would have awarded another writ of <em>Hab. Fas. Poss. </em>This is the well settled law and practice. Such fraudulent and illegal acts could not confer the right of possession on <em>Groop </em>and <em>Griffeth, </em>nor take it away from <em>Dobson. </em>Therefore, upon this ground, if the testimony as I have stated it is true, the plaintiff should recover.\u201d</p><p id=\"b228-11\">There were various other facts in the cause, which gave rise to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>other points; all of which were decided in favor of the plaintiff, for whom the jury found a verdict. But the alleged insufficiency of the description contained in the writ, and the eharge of the court in answer to the point mentioned, need only be here stated.</p><p id=\"b229-5\">In this court, the judgment was reversed, on the ground, alone, that the charge of the court below, in answer to the point put, was erroneous.</p><p id=\"b229-6\"><em>Carothers </em>for the plaintiff in error,</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
