The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress identification testimony.</p><p id=\"b540-3\">Ordered that the judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered, to be preceded by an independent source hearing.</p><p id=\"b540-4\">We agree with the defendant that, due to disparities between the defendant and the lineup fillers, the lineup procedure was unduly suggestive (see, <em>People v Owens, </em>74 NY2d 677). Thus, because no basis was developed at the <em>Wade </em>hearing for an independent source for the victims\u2019 in-court identifications of the defendant, a new trial is required, to be preceded by an independent source hearing <em>(see, People v Burts, </em>78 NY2d 20). O\u2019Brien, J. P., Ritter, Thompson and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
