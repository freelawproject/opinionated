GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">In this appeal we are asked by plaintiff-appellant Prestige Ford (\u201cPrestige\u201d or \u201cPrestige Ford\u201d) to review a district court\u2019s decision upholding a commercial arbitration award rendered in favor of defendant-appellee Ford Dealer Computer Services (\u201cDCS\u201d). For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">I. FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">Prestige Ford is an automobile dealership located in Garland, Texas. DCS, located in Houston, Texas, sells computer systems, which are designed to assist Ford dealers in managing their operations. On January 28, 1993, Prestige Ford entered into a written contract with DCS, under which DCS agreed to provide Prestige with hardware, software and maintenance related to one of its computer systems. According to the arbitration panel, the contract\u2019s initial five-year term was extended for an additional five years, amounting to a total contract period of ten years, commencing at the installation date.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">In September of 1997, Prestige Ford announced its intention to terminate the agreement with DCS. Prestige later alleged that it terminated the agreement because the computer system DCS had provided did not operate correctly and because DCS was unable to perform maintenance for the system in a timely fashion. The contract between the parties contained an arbitration clause, which provided that disputes would be governed by the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-20\">In July of 1998, DCS filed a claim in arbitration against Prestige Ford, alleging that Prestige had breached the contractual agreement. In response, Prestige Ford filed a series of counterclaims against DCS, including claims of fraud, antitrust violations, and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Prior to the arbitration hearing, Prestige Ford filed five separate motions to compel DCS to produce documents. The three-member arbitration panel heard oral argument on each of the motions to compel, and issued written orders granting or denying each of the various requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Arbitration proceedings were held in Austin, Texas, beginning August 6, 2001 and continuing through August 14, 2001. Following the proceedings, the arbitration panel issued its decision. The panel found that Prestige\u2019s letter purporting to terminate the agreement with DCS amounted to a breach of contract, and awarded damages in the amount of $101,752.32. The panel also found that Prestige Ford had not met its burden of proof with regards to any of its counterclaims, and, consequently, rejected each such claim in turn. Finally, citing to the \u201cDefault\u201d provision of the agreement between DCS and Prestige, the panel awarded DCS $337,459.76 in costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Following the panel\u2019s decision, Prestige Ford filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. On March 13, 2002, DCS filed both a response to Prestige\u2019s motion and its own motion seeking confirmation of the award. In addition, DCS filed a Motion for Protection and to Have Exhibits Kept Under Seal, which the court granted. After reviewing the remaining motions, the district court refused to vacate the arbitration award and granted DCS\u2019s motion to confirm the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">After the district court entered its final judgement in the matter, Prestige Ford moved for rehearing pursuant to Fed. R. Crv. P. 59. The district court denied the motion for rehearing and ordered Prestige Ford to pay all costs related to the preparation of DCS\u2019s response to the motion. Thereafter, Prestige filed timely notice of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">On appeal, Prestige Ford presents a number of arguments related to the arbitration award and the fairness of the proceedings leading up to it. In cases like this, we review the district court\u2019s decision using a de novo standard. <em>Forsythe Int'l, S.A. v. Gibbs Oil Co. of Texas, </em>915 F.2d 1017, 1020-21 (5th Cir.1990). \u201cUsually, however, the district court\u2019s review of an arbitration award is extraordinarily narrow.\u201d <em>Gateway Technologies, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications Corp., </em>64 F.3d 993, 996 (5th Cir.1995) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cDe novo review on the ultimate issue of unfairness enables us to assess whether the district court accorded sufficient deference in the first instance, an assessment that a more restrictive appellate review would cripple.\u201d <em>Forsythe Int\u2019l, S.A., </em>915 F.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">As noted above, Prestige Ford offers a number of arguments related to the fairness of the arbitration proceedings and the arbitration award that resulted therefrom. Ultimately, Prestige seeks vacatur of the award, or, in the alternative, modification of the award. Before addressing Prestige\u2019s several arguments, it should be noted that the central tenet of their appeal involves the contention that they should have been provided with the \u201ccomplete general ledger and other financial documents\u201d they sought to discover from DCS. According to Prestige, these documents were \u201cessential\u201d in order to \u201cdevelop and prove its case against DCS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-13\">Although DCS urges that this matter is little more than a discovery dispute, Prestige fervently argues that the \u201cthrust of-this appeal is far more fundamental.\u201d Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>cording to Prestige, \u201cthe deprivation of complete financial documentation in this case resulted in the wholesale denial of Prestige\u2019s ability to defend itself against DCS or prove its counterclaims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Despite their continued attempts to downplay the discovery-dispute-like nature of their appeal, even Prestige admits that their position centers on the arbitration panel\u2019s refusal to compel the discovery of certain evidence. In fact, the district court hit the proverbial nail on the head when it noted that the gravamen of Prestige\u2019s case is that the arbitration panel ruled incorrectly on Plaintiffs motions to compel production of certain DCS financial documents. It is in this light that Prestige\u2019s appeal must be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">A. <em>Prestige\u2019s Argument that DCS\u2019s Alteration and Withholding of Evidence Resulted in the Denial of a Fair Hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Prestige argues that DCS\u2019s general ledger was produced in altered form and that key sections of the document had been deleted. Prestige also avers that other financial records which were necessary to properly analyze DCS\u2019s claims for damages were withheld by DCS. According to Prestige, the arbitration panel\u2019s lack of action in response to DCS\u2019s alleged misconduct presents a number of grounds for vacatur of the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The arbitration process is a speedy and informal alternative to litigation, and, by its very nature, is intended to resolve disputes without confinement to many of the procedural and evidentiary strictures that protect the integrity of formal trials. <em>For-sythe Int\u2019l, S.A., </em>915 F.2d at 1022. Parties to voluntary arbitration may not superimpose rigorous procedural limitations on the very process designed to avoid such limitations. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Submission of disputes to arbitration always risks an accumulation of procedural and evidentiary shortcuts that would properly frustrate counsel in a formal trial; but because the advantages of arbitration are speed and informality, the arbitrator should be expected to act affirmatively to simplify and expedite the proceedings before him. <em>Id. </em>Thus, whatever indignation a reviewing court may experience in examining the record, it must resist the temptation to condemn imperfect proceedings without a sound statutory basis for doing so. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">The statutory basis for vacatur of an arbitration award is found in 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a). According to the statute, the district court has the authority to vacate an arbitration award if: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) there is evidence of partiality or corruption among the arbitrators; (3) the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct which prejudiced the rights of one of the parties; or (4) the arbitrators exceeded their powers. <em>Id. </em>(citing 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Prestige does not meet any of the \u00a7 10(a) requirements. What Prestige does not emphasize when presenting its arguments to this Court is that the reason documents were \u201cwithheld\u201d by DCS is that the arbitration panel, after holding hearings on motions to compel the very evidence at issue, explicitly decided against ordering DCS to produce such documents. Furthermore, even if a fraud of some sort did occur relating to the form in which DCS presented portions of its general ledger, the requisite nexus between the fraud and the basis for the panel\u2019s award does not exist. In this case, the record indicates that the panel heard arguments regarding the allegations that the general ledger had been altered and reached its decision on grounds indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>dent of the alleged fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 1022-23 (where the panel hears the allegation of fraud and then rests its decision on grounds clearly independent of the issues connected to the alleged fraud, the statutory basis for vacatur is absent; the panel effectively ruled that the asserted fraud issue was immaterial).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">As noted, we find no particular statutory basis for attacking the propriety of the panel\u2019s action in deeming specific portions of DOS\u2019s general ledger \u2014 and other documents \u2014 irrelevant. Arbitrators are not bound to hear all of the evidence tendered by the parties; however, they must give each of the parties to the dispute an adequate opportunity to present its evidence and arguments. <em>Id. </em>at 1023 (citing <em>Hoteles Condado Beach v. Union De Tronquistas Local 901, </em>763 F.2d 34, 39 (1st Cir.1985)). In the case at hand, hearings were held and each disputed item was given consideration by the panel; thus, more than adequate opportunity was afforded to the parties and the minimum standards of fundamental fairness were met. <em>See id.; Teamsters, Local Union 657 v. Stanley Structures, Inc., </em>735 F.2d 903, 906 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Bowles Financial Group, Inc. v. Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co., </em>22 F.3d 1010, 1013 (10th Cir.1994); <em>see also International Union UAW v. Kraft Foods, Div. Of Kraftco, Inc., </em>409 F.Supp. 559, 562 (E.D.Pa.1976) (decisions as to relevance and admissibility of evidence belong to arbitrators alone).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">B. <em>Prestige\u2019s Argument that the Award Should be Vacated on Norir-Statutory Grounds.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Prestige also urges that vacatur is justified based on the panel\u2019s manifest disregard of the law and on public policy grounds. This Court has adopted the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standard as a non-statutory ground for vacating an arbitration award. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. Cigna Financial Advisors, Inc., </em>197 F.3d 752, 759 (5th Cir.1999). Though it was handed down prior to this Circuit\u2019s adoption of the \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d standard, our decision in <em>R.M. Perez &amp; Associates, Inc. v. Welch, </em>960 F.2d 534, 539 n. 1 (5th Cir.1992), contains a brief description of its nature. In addition, <em>Welch </em>cites the Second Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Bobker, </em>which offers the following insight:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6D\">\u201cManifest disregard of the law\u201d by arbitrators is a judicially-created ground for vacating their arbitration award, which was introduced by the Supreme Court in <em>Wilko v. Swan, </em>346 U.S. 427, 436-37, 74 S.Ct. 182, 187-88, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953). It is not to be found in the federal arbitration law. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10. Although the bounds of this ground have never been defined, it clearly means more than error or misunderstanding with respect to the law. The error must have been obvious and capable of being readily and instantly perceived by the average person qualified to serve as an arbitrator. Moreover, the term \u201cdisregard\u201d implies that the arbitrator appreciates the existence of a clearly governing principle but decides to ignore or pay no attention to it. To adopt a less strict standard of judicial review would be to undermine our well established deference to arbitration as a favored method of settling disputes when agreed to by the parties. Judicial inquiry under the \u201cmanifest disregard\u201d standard is therefore extremely limited. The governing law alleged to have been ignored by the arbitrators must be well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-9\"><em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Bobker, </em>808 F.2d 930, 933-34 (2nd Cir.1986) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">If it is not clear from the above paragraph, the \u201cmanifest disre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>gard\u201d standard is an extremely narrow, judicially-created rule with limited applicability. In the case at hand, the record does not indicate that the arbitrators ignored the existence of any clearly governing principle in reaching its award. <em>See id. </em>Furthermore, given the limited record available to this Court, absent further documentation in the record suggesting a willful inattentiveness to the governing law, it would be difficult to find that the arbitration panel acted with manifest disregard for an applicable legal principle without undermining our stated deference to the arbitration process. <em>See id.; see also ARW Exploration Corp. v. Aguirre, </em>45 F.3d 1455, 1463 (10th Cir. 1995). Thus Prestige\u2019s arguments related to the arbitrators\u2019 \u201cmanifest disregard of the law\u201d ultimately prove unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Prestige also argues that public policy supports vacatur. According to Prestige, \u201cvacatur of this award would reinforce the integrity of arbitration and encourage the long-held public policy of encouraging arbitration.\u201d The Fifth Circuit, following the Supreme Court\u2019s lead, does recognize some circumstances in which a court may refuse to enforce an arbitration award that is contrary to public policy. <em>See Gulf Coast Industrial Workers Union v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>991 F.2d 244, 248-49 (5th Cir.1993). This Court \u2014 citing one of the leading Supreme Court cases on the issue, <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v. Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 108 S.Ct. 364, 98 L.Ed.2d 286 (1987) \u2014 has noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">[W]hen applying the narrow public policy exception, courts are forbidden to use imprecise notions of public policy which would allow ill-defined considerations to negate the rule favoring judicial deference. At the very least ... an alleged public policy must be properly framed under the approach set out in <em>W.R. Grace, </em>and the violation of such a policy must be clearly shown if an award is not to be enforced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\"><em>Gulf Coast Industrial Workers Union, </em>991 F.2d at 249 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The Supreme Court has made clear that any public policy used to vacate an arbitration award must be \u201cexplicit,\u201d \u201cwell defined,\u201d and \u201cdominant.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Rubber Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766, 103 S.Ct. 2177, 2183, 76 L.Ed.2d 298 (1983). In addition, the public policy must be ascertained by reference to laws and legal precedents, and not from general considerations of proposed public interests. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The arguments Prestige offers \u2014 and in particular, the evidence in support of those arguments \u2014 fall well short of establishing an explicit, well-defined and dominant public policy. <em>See id. </em>Therefore the arguments related to vacatur based on public policy are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">C. <em>Prestige\u2019s Argument that the Arbitration Award Should be Modified.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Prestige also submits that this Court should modify the arbitration award pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 11(a). According to Prestige, the award should be modified so that DCS would receive a total of zero dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Under the Federal Arbitration Act, awards may be modified, but only in the event of \u201can evident material miscalculation of figures.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 11(a). This Court has previously noted that an \u201cevident material calculation\u201d occurs \u201cwhere the record that was before the arbitrator demonstrates an unambiguous and undisputed mistake of fact and the record demonstrates strong reliance on that mistake by the arbitrator in making his award.\u201d <em>Valentine Sugars, Inc. v. Donau Corp., </em>981 F.2d 210, 214 (5th Cir.1993) (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number><em>National Post Office v. United States Postal Service, </em>751 F.2d 834, 843 (6th Cir. 1985)). In the case at hand, there was no \u201cevident material miscalculation.\u201d <em>See id.; see also Apex Plumbing Supply, Inc. v. U.S. Supply Co., Inc., </em>142 F.3d 188, 194 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">As the district court noted in its opinion, when parties agree to arbitration, they agree to accept whatever reasonable uncertainties might arise from the process. Undoubtedly, one party will emerge from an arbitration feeling that they were in some way shortchanged. That, however, does not alter or affect the limited role of the courts in reviewing arbitration awards. For the aforementioned reasons, the judgement of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
