Specifically, Nickels argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3552(c) motion. He also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 because there existed reasonable cause to believe that he was incompetent to stand trial or to be sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-11\">Section 3552(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-12\">If the court, before or after its receipt of a report specified in subsection (a) or (b) desires more information than is otherwise available to it as a basis for determining the mental condition of the defendant, the court may order the same psychiatric or psychological examination and report thereon as may be ordered under section 4244(b) of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(c). We review the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3552(c) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Limberopoulos, </em>26 F.3d 245, 254 (1st Cir.1994). Because the district court had adequate information to make a decision regarding Nickels\u2019s mental condition, and did not believe that it needed additional information to make its determination, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Nickels\u2019s motion for a presentence psychological examination under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-16\">Nickels also argues that the district court erred in denying his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 because reasonable cause existed to believe that he was incompetent to stand trial or to be sentenced. He further contends that the district court used an incorrect legal standard to determine whether to grant his \u00a7 4241 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-17\">Section 4241 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-18\"><em>(a) Motion to determine competency of defendant. </em>\u2014 -At any time after the commencement of a prosecution for an offense and prior to the sentencing of the defendant, the defendant or the attorney for the Government may file a motion for a hearing to determine the mental competency of the defendant. The court shall grant the motion, or shall order such a hearing on its own motion, if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1265-19\"><em>(b) Psychiatric or psychological examination and report. </em>\u2014 Prior to the date of the hearing, the court may order that a psychiatric or psychological examination of the defendant be conducted, and that a psychiatric or psychological report be filed with the court, pursuant to the provisions of section 4247(b) and (c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1265-20\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-21\">We review the denial of a \u00a7 4241 motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. General, </em>278 F.3d 389, 396 (4th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. George, </em>85 F.3d 1433, 1436-37 (9th Cir.1996). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>have held that \u201ca trial court may rule on a \u00a7 4241 motion of incompetency without benefit of a full dress hearing so long as the court has no \u2018bona fide doubt\u2019 as to the competence of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. </em>Cruz, 805 F.2d 1464, 1479 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cThe legal test for competency is whether the defendant had \u2018sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding\u2019 and whether he had \u2018a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 789 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the district court used the proper standard in denying Nickels\u2019s motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241. Nickels did not present any bona fide doubt as to his competency to be sentenced. The district court also determined that Nickels had consulted rationally with his attorney, had an understanding of the proceedings against him, and was competent to enter a guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Nickels\u2019s motion for a presentence or psychological examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1266-9\">. The government\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal is DENIED.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
