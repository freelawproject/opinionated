INS took Rios into custody in 1998 following his state conviction and sentence for attempted indecency with a child, the latest conviction in his extensive criminal history within the United States. The record shows that he has received parole review but has been repeatedly denied release on account of his criminal history and disciplinary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Relying on <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001), Rios contends that his continued detention violates his constitutional rights. The district court did not err in determining that Rios is not entitled to relief. <em>See Gisbert v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>988 F.2d 1437, 1439 (5th Cir.1993), <em>amended by Gisbert v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>997 F.2d 1122 (5th Cir. 1993). Although <em>Zadvydas </em>held that a deportable alien may contest his continued detention in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 proceeding, the Court distinguished the status of deportable aliens from that of excludable aliens like Rios. <em>See Zadvydas, </em>533 U.S. at 682, 692-94, 121 S.Ct. 2491. Rios\u2019s petition is governed by <em>Gisbert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
