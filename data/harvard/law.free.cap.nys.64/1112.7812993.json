In re Humfreville, 6 App. Div. 535, 39 N. Y. Supp. 550. No attempt was made to offer such testimony. The defendant\u2019s testator was, so far as the evidence in this case shows, apparently entirely ignorant of the fact that the said services were rendered, or material furnished. Therefore plaintiff has no legal right to ask compensation therefor. The verdict is therefore against the law and the evidence, and must be reversed. It is so directed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">SCHUCHMAN, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
