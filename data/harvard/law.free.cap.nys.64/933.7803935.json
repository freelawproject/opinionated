This was settled, if any doubt theretofore existed, by the recent decision of Devlin v. Hinman, 161 N. Y. 115, 55 N. E. 386. But, in a civil action, before a defendant can be punished for a contempt of court, either by the imposition of a fine or the striking out of his answer, there must first be an adjudication that he is not only guilty of a contempt of court, but that his act of which the opposing party complains not only has a tendency to, but actually does, defeat, impair, impede, or prejudice the rights or remedies of the party complaining. Fischer v. Raab, 81 N. Y. 235; Bank v. Fitzpatrick, 80 Hun, 75, 30 N. Y. Supp. 15; Boon v. McGucken, 67 Hun, 251, 22 N. Y. Supp. 424; Coal Co. v. Hecksher, 42 Hun, 534; Sandford v. Sandford, 40 Hun, 540; Swenarton v. Shupe, Id. 41. In the order appealed from there is no adjudication either that the defendants have been guilty of a contempt, or that the acts of which the plaintiff complains have defeated or impaired, impeded or prejudiced, its rights or remedies in any respect. It is true that the order recites that the answer is stricken out \u201cfor the willful and contumacious disobedience of the defendants of the order of injunction herein, dated September 1, 1899, and for their contempt of this court.\u201d By this recital the court gives its reason for striking out the defendants\u2019 answer, but, without saying that it is not equivalent to an adjudication that the defendants have committed a contempt of court, it surely cannot, be construed to adjudge that their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>acts constituting such contempt defeat, impair, or prejudice the rights or remedies of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">For the failure, therefore, of the court to adjudge the defendants guilty of a contempt of court, and that- their acts constituting such contempt have been of injury to the plaintiff, the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to strike out the answer denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice, however, to the plaintiff\u2019s right to renew the motion upon other or additional papers. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
