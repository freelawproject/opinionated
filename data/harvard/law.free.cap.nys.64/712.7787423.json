The exceptions on which the appellants rely were taken by both appellants, and not separately. As to one of the appellants the rulings were right. It has frequently been held that a general exception by two defendants t\u00f3 a ruling which was not erroneous as to one of them is not avail\u00e1ble on behalf of the other. Bosley v.
