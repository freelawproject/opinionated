We cannot yield our assent to this contention. A reading of the entire section of the Code in question seems to warrant the conclusion that subdivision 3 applies to all parties, whether domestic corporations or not; and where, as in the case before us, it appears by the attorney\u2019s verification that all the officers are absent from the county where the attorney resides, the verification should be held to be a proper one. Knitting Co., v. Bronner, 18 Misc. Rep. 627, 43 N. Y. Supp. 725, affirmed in 29 App. Div, 627, 52 N. Y. Supp. 1143; Molding Co. v. Squires (Co. Ct.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 547. In the cases cited by the appellants the precise point under consideration was not involved. Defendants\u2019 claim, therefore, that the court was without jurisdiction to render judgment on the verified complaint, is not well taken; and, as the other points raised are without merit, the judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
