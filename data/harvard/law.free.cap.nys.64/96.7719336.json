The authority to issue these certificates is found originally in chapter 143 of the Laws of 1850, which provides (section 5) that the superintendent of common schools \u201cshall examine the qualifications of teachers, and grant certificates in such manner and form as may be prescribed by the state superintendent, which shall not be in force longer than a year, and may at any time be revoked by the board of education.\u201d This act was amended by chapter 112 of the Laws of 1857, but without materially altering this provision. By the provisions of chapter 420 of the Laws of 1873 the board of education was directed to elect a superintendent of public instruction, and one or more associate superintendents, and to \u201cfix and determine the duties, powers and functions of the said superintendent and associate superintendents, so far as relates to their several departments,\u201d and by section 3 of the act it was provided that \u201call the duties now prescribed by law for the office of superintendent of common schools of the city of Brooklyn shall devolve upon, and be performed by, the superintendent and associate superintendents to be elected under the provisions of this act, in such manner as the said board shall prescribe.\u201d By section 5 of the same act it is provided, \u201cAll acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed.\u201d But it can hardly be said that an act Avhich refers to acts in existence for the rule of conduct of the officials created repeals the original acts by such a clause. It merely repeals the acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of the enactment. The provision of the law of 1850 and 1857 that the city superintendent of common schools \u201cshall examine the qualifications of teachers, and grant certificates in such manner and form as may be prescribed by the state superintendent, which shall not be in force longer than a year,\u201d is not inconsistent with a statute which provides that \u201call the duties now prescribed by law for the office of superintendent of common schools of the city of Brooklyn shall devolve upon, and be performed by, the superintendent and associate superintendents to be elected under the provisions of this act, in such manner as the board shall prescribe.\u201d In fact, it is the law which prescribes the duties, and to repeal it would be to destroy the rule of conduct which the legislature intended to establish. If we are right in this proposition, the law, at the time of the granting of the 0 certificates, limited the time of their effectiveness to one year. After that they ceased to be of any force or effect. The fact that the board of education may have construed the provisions of the laws of 1850 and 1857 to have been repealed, or that that body, in 1874, adopted1 by-laws providing that \u201cthere shall be three grades of certificates of fitness to teach granted by the superintendent, the first and second of which shall require a standard of scholarship equal to that demanded for graduation by pupils in the supplementary classes, which certificates shall be designated A, B, and 0,\u201d can have no bearing upon the question; nor can the fact that the certificates do not show the time limit upon their face give any vitality beyond the period fixed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It appears from the record that a large number of these O certificates were issued, and that in October, 1882, the board of educa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>tian adopted a resolution that \u201chereafter no teacher shall be employed by this board who does not hold a certificate of grade A or of grade B.\u201d In 1888 (chapter 583, tit. 17, \u00a7 5) the law governing the schools of Brooklyn was changed, and the board of education was given \u201centire charge and direction of all the public schools of said city, and of the school moneys raised for the support of the same,\u201d and it was to \u201cpossess the powers and be subject to the general duties of trustees of common schools in this state.\u201d It was also authorized to \u201cmake its own by-laws, keep a journal of its proceedings, define the duties of its officers and committees, and prescribe such, rules and regulations for instruction and discipline in the said public schools as are not inconsistent with the laws of the state,\u201d etc. Acting under the authority of this act, the board of education, some time prior to the year 1895, enacted certain by-laws, which have remained in force since that time, in which the superintendent of public instruction is authorized to issue certificates, to be known as \u201cProbationary Licenses,\u201d \u201cTemporary B Certificates,\u201d \u201cPermanent B Certificates,\u201d \u201cA Certificates,\u201d \u201cHead of Department A,\u201d and \u201cPrincipal A.\u201d It is then provided that no one shall be appointed, temporarily or permanently, unless he shall have the certificate necessary to show his qualification in the grade for which he seeks such employment. It thus appears that since 1895 the holders of 0 certificates, even assuming them to have a lawful existence, would have no standing upon an eligible list; and the question presented upon this appeal is whether the relators gained any rights under the provisions of chapter 644 of the Laws of 1899, which amends section 1117 of chapter 378 of the Laws of 1897, which, in so far as it has any relation to the question here presented, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">\u201cAnd all licenses to teach, or certificates of qualifications for teaching, granted by the superintendent of public instruction of the city of Brooklyn, or by authority of the bbard of education of said city of Brooklyn, prior to February first, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, or recognized by the board of education of said city of Brooklyn, or the state superintendent of public instruction as in force at that date in said city, shall, unless revoked for cause by the state superintendent of public instruction, be recognized by the city superintendent of schools, and the board of examiners of the city of New York, as in full force and shall entitle the holders to appointment or promotion to any position to which they were respectively eligible by the possession of such licenses or certificates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">As this statute seeks to regulate the discharge of the duties of a public officer, and to place upon the eligible list persons who would otherwise not be entitled to consideration, it is proper that it should be confined strictly to its terms. The certificates set out by the relators in their brief show that they were not issued by the \u201csuperintendent of public instruction of the city of Brooklyn,\u201d as provided in the statute now under consideration, nor yet by the authority of the board of education, but by the \u201ccity superintendent of public schools.\u201d Nor does it appear from the petition of the relators that these certificates were \u201crecognized by the board of education of said city of Brooklyn, or the state superintendent of public instruction as in force at that date [February 1, 1898] in said city.\u201d On the contrary, it affirmatively appears from the record that the board of education, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>by a by-law, which it was authorized to adopt, had limited the certificates which should be recognized to those enumerated in the by-law, which does not extend to G certificates. We are of opinion, therefore, that the G certificates held by the relators were governed by the earlier statutes, that they ceased to have any force or effect after the expiration of one year from the time of \"their issuing, and that chapter 644 of the Laws of 1899 does not operate to give them new-life. This being true, the defendant owed the relators no duty, under the provisions of section 1081 of the Greater Hew York charter, and the peremptory writ of mandamus ought not to issue. The order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion for a peremptory writ of mandamus should be denied, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and application denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
