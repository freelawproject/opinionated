The rule of law that, where a statute prescribes a particular mode of prosecution, no other mode can lawfully be pursued, has no relation to the facts in this case; the provisions of section 37 of the liquor tax law relating wholly to the duties of special agents, sheriffs, peace officers, etc., and in no wise limiting the jurisdiction of the courts. It would be a strange construction of the law creating misdemeanors, in connection with the trafficking in liquors, to say that any citizen possessed of any knowledge of violations of the law could not make an information before a magistrate, and cause the arrest of such offenders, without the information being first laid before the district attorney; especially when it is provided in section 35 \u201cthat a magistrate shall issue a warrant of arrest upon information and depositions and examine the case as now provided by law, but if it shall appear upon such examination that a crime, not triable by a court of special sessions has been committed, and that there is sufficient cause to believe that the person or persons charged with such crime is guilty thereof, such magistrate shall admit such person or persons to bail, in a sum not less than one thousand dollars, and in default of bail shall commit him or them to the sheriff of the county,\u201d etc. The fact that the person making the information now before us was a policeman does not change the rule governing the jurisdiction of the court or committing magistrate. The magistrate is directed to \u201cissue a warrant upon information and depositions,\u201d and the question of his official position does not enter into the transaction. This makes it apparent that in the case of Gallen the order appealed froin should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">The suggestion, however, that there is that degree of uncertainty in the information against Schuler which vitiates the warrant of arrest is, we think, well founded. By the provisions of section 31 of the liquor tax law, it is not \u201clawful for any corporation, association, co-partnership or person, whether having paid such tax or not, to sell, offer or expose for sale, or give away, any liquor on Sunday, or before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>five o\u2019clock in the morning on Monday.\u201d The information charges that \u201cCharles Schuler did sell or give away certain strong and spirituous liquors, to wit, ale and lager beer, at his saloon on the northeast corner of Franklin avenue and Third street, in the city of Mt. Vernon, N. Y.; that said 7th day of January, 1900, being Sunday.\u201d We think that this information, being in the alternative, fails to inform Schuler of the specific offense with which he is charged; in fact, it charges no offense. See People v. Gilkinson, 4 Parker, Cr. R. 26. In the case cited Mr. Justice Emott said that, if it were alleged in an indictment that \u201cthe defendant sold rum, or gin, or brandy, that would leave it entirely uncertain what precise offense he had committed, or in what particular he had violated the law.\u201d For this reason the order appealed from in the Schuler case should be reversed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
