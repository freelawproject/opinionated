No payments have been made upon the note, and the only question in the case is whether or not a letter written by the defendant to the payee and holder of the note is a sufficient acknowledgment of the debt to suspend the operation of the statute of limitations. The letter reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b879-14\">\u201cBuffalo, N.

It found me sick in bed and on the verge of pneumonia, but am glad to report that I am better now and with good luck will be out in a tew days. I fully appreciate your letter, and tried to call on you and let you know all about the \u2018gun\u2019 business and how I was fixed when I was in N. Y. ten days ago, but could not do so and get my train. We expect to have a board meeting soon, and I will be there and shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>call on you, sure, and set all things right to your satisfaction. While we have now plenty of business so far as the \u2018gun\u2019 is concerned, yet, as our contracts-are not yet completed, there has no money come in yet, except for one gun that is on the Brazilian boat \u2018El Cid,\u2019 and what we have made out of that had to go in to complete other contracts now on hand, but which will bring us in a handsome profit and enable me to settle all up with you, and pay \u2018interest on interest\u2019 as well. I assure you, Fletcher, that this matter has troubled me much more than it has you, and I will be a happy man when I get it all made right with you.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b880-4\">\u201cVery truly, etc., C.

It unmistakably recognized the existence of an indebtedness, and an expectation on the part of the writer to pay it. He intends \u201cto set all things right and to your satisfaction,\u201d and \u201cto settle all up with you and pay 'interest on interest\u2019 as well,\u201d and that he \u201cwill be a happy man when I get it all made right with you.\u201d Section 395 of the Code of Civil Procedure makes an \u201cacknowledgment or promise\u201d in writing signed by the party to be charged thereby sufficient to take the case out of the operation of the statute of limitations. It will be observed the language used is in the alternative; and a recognition of the debt\u2014an admission that the writer is the debtor of the person addressed\u2014is all that is necessary to make a new date from which the statute commences to run. Cudd v. Jones, 63 Hun, 142, 17 N. Y. Supp. 582; Wright v. Parmenter, 23 Misc. Rep. 629, 52 N. Y. Supp. 99; Shaw v. Lambert, 14 App. Div. 265, 43 N. Y. Supp. 470. It is not essential that the amount or character of the obligation be specified in the written acknowledgment. Kincaid v. Archibald, 73 N. Y. 189. The defendant can be identified by paroi evidence. Manchester v. Braedner, 107 N. Y. 346, 14 N. E. 405. A promise to pay is not necessary. Henry v. Root, 33 N. Y. 526, 530 et seq.; Kahn v. Crawford, 28 Misc. Rep. 572, 59 N. Y. Supp. 853. It is essential that the writing, either in precise terms or fairly construed, disclose a purpose to recognize the claim as an obligation. The letter in suit seems to have been written for the purpose of assuring the holder of the note that, while it had been long overdue, the debtor still had it in mind as a debt against him, and still expected to meet it. The reference to the \u201cgun business\u201d was apparently with the object of showing that the defendant still had money in that venture, and anticipated a return therefrom. He did not make his willingness or intention to pay conditional in any way upon the result of that investment. It was rather in extenuation of his failure to pay, coupled with an assurance that the obligation would still be met. it is the letter of a man who-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>has a debt which he cannot pay. He keenly feels Ms inability to do so, and is not seeking to shirk the indebtedness, but to quiet his creditor with a promise. The judgment is affirmed, with costs to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
