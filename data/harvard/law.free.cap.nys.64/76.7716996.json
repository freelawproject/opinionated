The specific charge was that the driver of a truck belonging to the defendant carelessly backed into the sidewalk of one of the public streets in New York, borough of Manhattan, and injured the plaintiff, a pedestrian on the sidewalk, and at the time entirely free from blame. The case was carefully tried, and was submitted to the jury in an unexcep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>tionable charge, and to which no exception was taken. The only question presented on the appeal is that there was not sufficient evidence of the ownership of the truck. It is apparently undisputed that the defendant was at one time the owner of the truck, and it was proved that his name as owner was painted on it at the time of the accident. This made a prima facie case. Seaman v. Koehler, 122 N. Y. 646, 25 N. E. 353. The defendant testified that he did not own any truck at the time of the accident, but that the trucks which formerly belonged to him had been sold before the accident to his wife. The driver testified that he was in the employ of the defendant\u2019s wife, but admitted that he never received any pay from her, or any orders, and that all his orders came from the defendant, or some other employ\u00e9. The facts that the name upon the truck had not been changed, but that it was still used with the defendant\u2019s name as owner; that the driver was working under the defendant\u2019s orders; that no papers or other documentary proof indicating a change in the ownership of the business was produced; that the wife of the defendant was not a witness, although residing at the time in the borough of Brooklyn, where the trial was had; and the defendant\u2019s interest in the case,\u2014required the submission to the jury of the question as to whether or not the driver was not in fact engaged in the defendant\u2019s business, and with the defendant\u2019s truck, at the time of the accident. The question was so submitted without exception, and the verdict and judgment were warranted by the proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-3\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
