The pleadings were oral, and the complaint was for goods sold and delivered. It was sought to hold the defendants jointly, but it was not, in terms, alleged that they were partners, or that the defendant Max Berger acted as agent for Ms wife. The plaintiff did not produce any evidence of a partnership between the defendants, and it appeared that he had for a long time sold goods to the defendant Max Berger, and rendered bills to him under the \u00f1ame of M. E. Berger; the bill of particulars in this very case being in the form of a bill against M. E. Berger. Both defendants swore positively that there was no partnership between them, each pursuing a separate business. WMle some of the circumstances under which the business was carried on, coupled with the relationship of the parties, warrant a suspicion that they may really be co-partners, there is no proof of the fact, and a mere suspicion cannot be allowed to prevail against their positive and uncontradicted testimony. There was no evidence to justify a judgment against the appellant, Carrie Berger, and as to her the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to her to abide the event. Judgment as to Max Berger affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
