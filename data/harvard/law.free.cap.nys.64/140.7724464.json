Plaintiff, a printer, sued the defendant for a balance of $538.67 due for services rendered and materials furnished at its request through one1 Frank F. Yanderveer, its attorney. The performance of the work, its value, and nonpayment are not in dispute. A payment of $300 on account of the work had been made by defendant\u2019s check to the order of its attorney, who indorsed it over to the plaintiff. The only question litigated was whether the defendant or its attorney was liable for the balance due. The attorney urges that he alone is liable, but there was no distinct agreement that the plaintiff looked to him for payment. The work done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>by the plaintiff consisted of certain printed matter, purporting to be an argument by defendant\u2019s said attorney in its behalf in opposition to a threatened revocation of its charter. At the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, the complaint was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The manuscript furnished to the plaintiff by defendant\u2019s attorney apprised it of the relations existing between the defendant and its attorney. An attorney is the same as any other agent, and, as such, is not liable personally, when he keeps within the limits of his authority, and discloses the name of his principal. Bonynge v. Waterbury, 12 Hun, 534; Judson v. Gray, 11 N. Y. 408; Packard v. Stephani, 85 Hun, 199, 32 N. Y. Supp. 1016; 1 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law (2d Ed.) 405. He is then presumed to be acting as agent, and not as principal. The plaintiff, therefore, was justified in treating the defendant as its debtor, and, for tire purpose of showing authority in defendant\u2019s attorney to order the work in question, endeavored to prove certain admissions and declarations made to plaintiff\u2019s employ \u00e9 during the progress of the work by one Weisse, an officer of the defendant. On defendant\u2019s objection, such evidence was excluded. This was error. The conversations between Weisse and the witness at the time in question constituted part of the res gestae of the transaction in suit, and were competent. Printing Co. v. Coursey (Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 497; Anderson v. Railroad Co., 54 N. Y. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">It appeared that bills for the work were sent by plaintiff to the defendant\u2019s said attorney. Plaintiff attempted to explain why this course was followed, but on objection this evidence was rejected. This was obvious error. The question to whom credit was given by the plaintiff was the vital one in the case, and, while the sending of bills to the attorney direct justified inferences favorable to the defendant, it was the privilege of the plaintiff to rebut these inferences by explaining that through courtesy, or from other motives, it was the usual custom to send bills to the attorneys of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Without considering the other errors assigned, the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
