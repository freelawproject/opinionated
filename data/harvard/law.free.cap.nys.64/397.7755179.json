In January, 1899, the school house in his district was broken into by one Joe White, and a quantity of property stolen therefrom or destroyed. The trustee, probably by authority of the citizens of the district, although his authority is not in question, offered a reward of $25 \u201cfor the arrest and conviction of the party or parties\u201d who perpetrated the crime. The evidence shows that White and the plaintiff lived together, and were cronies. White, after breaking into the school house in the night, returned to plaintiff\u2019s house, bringing with him chalk, flags, window catches, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and other stuff which he had taken from the school house. He also had two chickens, evidently stolen, which were eaten in the household. Plaintiff saw White bum two of these flags, and secrete the other stuff under a board of the floor. White told plaintiff not to \u201csay anything about this.\u201d The testimony, therefore, shows that plaintiff knew that White had stolen this stuff. Later on, after the reward, and with notice of it, he testified that he told the bartender in the saloon of Maher &amp; Byrnes that Joe White broke into the school house; that Peter Hayes, who was working up the case, was called in from the back room, and the plaintiff then voluntarily told him what he had seen incriminating White. Hayes, contradicted the plaintiff, and said he was called from the back room, and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">\u201cI said, T want you to come up to the sheriff\u2019s office, and make a statement as to what you know about breaking into this school house.\u2019 He says, T don\u2019t know anything about it; I was home in bed the night the school house-was broken into.\u2019 I said, \u2018From what I hear, either you or Joe or both went into that school house.\u2019 He said, T didn\u2019t go in there.\u2019 X said, \u2018If you don\u2019t come up to the sheriff\u2019s office, and tell what you know about it, I will swear out o a warrant against you.\u2019 He said that if he told what he knew about it he would have no place to stay. I said, \u2018I will find you a place to stay; come with me;\u2019 and we went to the court house, and called the sheriff out. I said, \u2018This man will make a statement.\u2019 We went into a side room. He said about, what he testified this forenoon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">If his version of the transaction is correct, plaintiff did not voluntarily give up the information with the expectation of obtaining the reward, but it was extorted from him, through fear that he might be arrested himself for complicity with White. There is considerable contrariety in the decisions as to the real basis to the right to a reward. It, however, seems to be settled in this state-that it is in the nature of a contract inuring to the benefit of the person who gives the information. A few principles out of the conflicting cases, I think, may be stated, although there is no uniformity among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">1. The information must be given with knowledge of the reward.. Fitch v. Snedaker, 38 N. Y. 248; Howland v. Lounds, 51 N. Y. 604. I think the evidence warrants the conclusion that plaintiff knew of the reward, although that is a little shadowy; for apparently he could not read.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">2. As I have suggested, it is a contract obligation. This being so, it must be the voluntary giving up of the information by the person. If corkscrewed out of him by threats inducing fear of prosecution, I take it no recovery could be had. That would destroy the contract element. In the early English case (Williams v. Carwardine, 4 Barn. &amp; Adol. 621), the question of the motive was held to be unimportant; but the text writers and American authorities do not seem to have followed this doctrine strictly, although I find no case in this state distinctly overruling it. That case cannot be good law if the liability is contractual, as assent and a voluntary surrender of the information would be essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">3. The authorities hold that the information must be imparted with a view to obtaining the reward (18 Enc. Pl. &amp; Prac. p. 1155; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Hewitt v. Anderson, 56 Cal. 476); and in Howland v. Lounds, 51 N. Y. 604, the court say, at page 609:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">\u201cThat a party claiming a reward of this character must give information, or do something having some reference to the reward offered, is very obvious. The action is, in fact, upon contract. Where a contract is proposed to all the world, in the form of a proposition, any party may assent to it, and it is binding, but he cannot assent without knowledge of the proposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In the present case the plaintiff does not claim there was any talk between him and Hayes to the effect that he expected the reward. The information given by the plaintiff was undoubtedly valuable, and even essential, to secure the conviction of White. The justice, however, on conflicting evidence, or upon inferences properly deducible from the evidence, has decided adversely to the plaintiff. This decision implies that he reached the conclusion that the information was imparted through fear of arrest, or without any expectation of receiving the reward. The conclusion is supported by the proofs, and we are not inclined to interfere with the disposition made by the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
