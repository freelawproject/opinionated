The objection, however, is not well taken. In such a case it will be presumed, where the contrary does not appear, that the justice gave the requisite authority to the process server. Hess v. Smith, 16 Misc. Rep. 55, 27 N. Y. Supp. 635. The order, therefore, cannot be impeached for want of jurisdiction. The justice erred, however, in assuming that the court was without power to entertain the tenant\u2019s motion to open the default. Although it was decided in Cochran v. Reich, 20 Misc. Rep. 593, 16 N. Y. Supp. 441, that a justice of the district court had no power to open a default in summary proceedings, this is no longer the law. Under the statute as amended (Laws 1896, c. 748), such power may be exercised by a justice of the municipal court. As there is no appeal, however, from an order of the municipal court denying a motion, we cannot reverse for the error complained of. Sinsheimer v. Railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Co., 21 Misc. Rep. 46, 46 N. Y. Supp. 887; Boyd v. Milone, 24 Misc. Rep. 734, 53 N. Y. Supp. 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The appeal from the order denying tenant\u2019s motion to open the default is dismissed, and the final order in the proceeding affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
