Clerihew against the Standard Railroad Signal Company. From a judgment in favor of plaintiff (62 H. Y. Supp. 1133), defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ajnl\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1126-12\">This action was brought by the plaintiff to recover from defendant a balance due him on account of commissions earned in procuring a leasehold and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1109\">*1109</page-number>option of purchase of certain property for defendant, and in the securing of certain loans and advances of capital for the defendant. Defendant admitted the performance of the services alleged, but disputed the terms of the Contract under which it is alleged the services were performed. Defendant called the president, and Mr. Cade, the vice president, of the defendant corporation, to prove the terms of the contract which existed between the parties. He submitted an offer of proof to the effect that at the interview where the contract was made between the defendant and plaintiff, plaintiff presented a paper to defendant\u2019s vice president, and tried to induce him to sign it; that the vice president thereupon refused to sign the same on the ground that it would bind the defendant to a contract similar to the one alleged in the complaint, the vice president at the same time setting forth the terms of an agreement by which the defendant was willing to be bound. The court refused to receive the proof offered, and the defendant duly excepted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1127-5\">Argued before TRTJAX, P.

The statement was relevant, as tending to show one of the circumstances surrounding the making of the alleged contract, and bore upon the probability of the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s version. It might, if admitted, have had material weight with the jury, and so its exclusion was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1127-9\">The judgment is reversed, and a new trial is ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
