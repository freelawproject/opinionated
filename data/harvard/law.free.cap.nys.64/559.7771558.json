The plaintiff testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">\u201cI got about the middle of the block, where there was some sewering oi-gas fixing going on, so that one-half of the street right near the sidewalk was blocked up with it. * * * There was only room for one wagon to-pass there. I was trying to get past and get beyond, and I saw a big truck coming down, and I saw I could not get out, so I tried to get back upon the-uptown track. I observed the car coming downtown. That car was then on the other side of the corner of Eighty-Second street, and was about 100 feet away from me; that is, when I first started to cross the track. * * * The-head of the horse was upon the first rail upon the downtown track, and while-the horse was between the two tracks the car was about 25 feet away. The-horse had got across upon the uptown track, across the downtown track. * * * I had the front part of the wagon almost out as the car was coming at its full speed, and he hit the hind wheel, and the wagon was swung around, and I was thrown off the wagon upon the street, my head and my forehead: striking the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-15\">The plaintiff called one witness,\u2014Nicholas Sherman,\u2014who owned the wagon which the plaintiff was driving. He testified to the same facts as the plaintiff. The plaintiff called no other witnesses. His-case is made up of the testimony of himself and Sherman. The defendant\u2019s theory of the accident is entirely different. The crew of the-car and four disinterested witnesses were called to show that the accident occurred in an entirely different manner. The conductor testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-16\">\u201cI was standing on the rear end of the car, a\u00f1d I first saw the wagon upon, the up track. He was partly over between the up and the down track. I noticed him as I came pretty close to him. * * * I noticed the driver-looking over as to see how close he was, and, as he reached near the rear end of the car, a little back of the center, the hub of the wheel of the wagon seemed to catch the side of the car, and the jolt of the wagon against the car-caused him to drop off between the car and the wagon. The front part of his-wagon had got past the car, and after it had passed it hit my car,\u2014as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>passed it hit my car. That is all I saw of that accident. I stopped my car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Edwin C. Greear, the motorman, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">\u201cWe were upon the south-boun'd track, and this wagon was going up on the north-bound track. I paid no attention to it until after the plaintiff had passed the front of the car, when I got three bells to stop the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">William Reynolds was driving on the street. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201cI saw the plaintiff\u2019s wagon upon the same track ahead of me. I was driving right behind him then. I was 50 feet behind him. There was nobody between me and him. * * * I was driving up Eighth avenue, and I noticed this wagon ahead of me. He was upon the same track as I was, and I saw a car coming down, and noticed the car passed this wagon, and I noticed this man fall off the wagon, but I did not know what part of that wagon struck the car. I saw the front wheels of the car pass the wagon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">George W. Smith, a passenger on the car, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201cI was sitting in that car about the fourth seat in the front, and upon the east side. I was sitting' against the guard rail. The step on that side of the car was turned up, and it attracted my particular notice. I know that the front part of the car had passed this peddler\u2019s wagon before I heard the jolt. I heard .the jolt as the wheel of the wagon struck that running board of the car, and I jumped' out of the way, fearing that the wagon would strike me, .after which I slid under the guard rail, and got off, after which the car came to a stop; that is, after it had 'gone a short distance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">George F. Groff, a passenger on the car, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">\u201cI was a passenger on this car when this accident happened. I think I did not give my name to the conductor or to the inspector of that company on the occasion of the accident, but I sent a letter to the president, Mr. Vreeland, after the accident, because I understood that the motorman would be arrested. I was sitting in the fourth seat back from the front of the car. To the best of my recollection the car was upon the downtown track, and the wagon was upon the up track. For some reason the head of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon wheel struck directly under the seat upon which I was sitting, and this was four or five seats back from the motorman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">Daniel Ryan, a police officer, who had been on the force eight years, was a passenger on the car. He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">\u201cI was upon the third seat rear, and I noticed this wagon coming up upon the east track. It passed Eighty-First street while the car was going south and the wagon was going north, and I saw the front part of the car pass the wagon, while the driver of the wagon, instead of pulling the off line, pulled upon the nigh line, and the consequence was that his wagon struck the car at about the middle of the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-14\">These witnesses, four of whom were disinterested, testified to a plain, consistent state of facts which exonerates the defendant from blame. Goldschmidt v. Railway Co., 1 App. Div. 309, 37 N. Y. Supp. 299; Bello v. Same, 2 App. Div. 313, 37 N. Y. Supp. 969; Reynolds v. Railroad Co., 20 App. Div. 339, 46 N. Y. Supp. 763; McDonald v. Railway Co. (Sup.; not yet officially reported) 61 N. Y. Supp. 817; Steuer v. Same, Id. 1059; Trotcky v. Railroad Co., 73 Hun, 26, 25 N. Y. Supp. 1054; Kaare v. Iron Co., 139 N. Y. 369, 34 N. E. 901; Pierce v. Railway Co., 21 App. Div. 427, 47 N. Y. Supp. 540; Fick v. Same, 26 App. Div. 84, 49 N. Y. Supp. 693. All of these cases recognize and apply the rule that, where the plaintiff\u2019s case is overborne by the weight of evidence, a verdict in his favor will not stand. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Notwithstanding that in each of these cases there was evidence, which, if believed, would have justified a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, the appellate divison in this department and in the Second department and the court of appeals have held consistently that, where the defendant produced clear, concise, and rational theory opposed to the theory presented by the plaintiff, and supported the theory by the evidence of numerous disinterested witnesses, justice required that the appellate court exercise its jurisdiction to review the verdict, and set it aside .as against the weight of evidence. Upon the whole testimony we are satisfied that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, and the ends of justice will be subserved by the submission of the case to another jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The judgment appealed from and the order denying a new trial must be reversed, and a new trial granted, upon condition that the defendant pay to the plaintiff a trial fee and disbursements of the former trial; the appellant to have costs of this appeal to abide the event of the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
