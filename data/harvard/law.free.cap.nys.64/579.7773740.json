Code, \u00a7 188, defines manslaughter as homicide other than murder, and not justifiable or excusable, and as the facts stated were insufficient to show murder, but did allege a homicide under circumstances precluding either justification or excuse, the indictment charged manslaughter.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-11\">Appeal from Chemung county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-12\">Patrick H.

The conviction was of the crime of manslaughter in the second degree. The indictment accused the defendant of the crime of \u201cmanslaughter in the first degree,\u201d and so named the offense in the indictment. The indictment then alleged the facts as follows: \u201cWith force and arms feloniously, willfully, and unlawfully did assault one James Murphy with a sharp knife, the same being a dangerous weapon, * * * and the said James Murphy did strike, cut, stab, and wound, * * * and did inflict a mortal wound, of which * * * the said James Murphy did * * * die.\u201d The indictment was not demurred to, and the plea was, \u201cNot guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b597-14\">Argued before PABKEB, P.

I do not see in the record before this court any error committed upon the trial subject to serious criticism, except in the admission of testimony of witness Knipp as to what was said by John Maine, not apparently in the hearing of defendant, \u201cCome down to the corner under the light, and I will give you all you want, or what you want.\u201d This seems to have been said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>to Frank Bower, and to John Murphy, who was killed, and bears upon the intent in the minds of these three persons in getting together, by.t not upon the intent of defendant, nor upon his knowledge of the intent of the others in their assembling. If the testimony in the case left the question of intent on the part of defendant anyway in doubt, or the situation disclosed to defendant after he arrived upon the scene in any doubt; or if the testimony, leaving out this statement, did not, beyond all doubt, abundantly show the defendant guilty of a crime of a grade not less than manslaughter,\u2014I think it would be the duty of the court, for this error, to grant a new trial. But, as the evidence stands, this piece of evidence becomes immaterial. With this testimony out, no other conclusion on the part of the jury was possible, and it cannot be claimed that this in any degree influenced them.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The other question, \u201cDo the facts stated in the indictment constitute a crime?\u201d must be, I think, answered in the affirmative. If this-indictment had not characterized the crime described by the stated facts as \u201cmanslaughter,\u201d and had used the words with \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d \u201cmalice prepense,\u201d or \u201cpremeditated design,\u201d it would have been a sufficient statement of facts and intent to charge murder in the first degree. Fitzgerrold v. People, 37 N. Y. 413; People v. Conroy, 97 N. Y. 62. The absence of apt words characterizing the acts to have been done with \u201cmalice aforethought,\u201d and the declaration that the crime intended to be charged is \u201cmanslaughter,\u201d is a sufficient declaration that the homicide was accomplished without design to effect death. Here a homicide is charged, and charged to have been committed under circumstances which preclude the idea of its being .either justifiable or excusable, and the stated facts are insufficient to make it murder in either the first or second degree, and that seems to be the exact definition of \u201cmanslaughter.\u201d Pen. Code, \u00a7 188: \u201cIn a case other than one of those specified in sections 183, 184 and 185 [murder in 1st and 2nd degree], homicide, not being justifiable or excusable, is manslaughter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The omission to declare in the indictment the ameliorating features which reduce homicide to the grade of manslaughter by stating it to have been produced \u201cwithout design to effect death,\u201d or \u201cin the heat of passion,\u201d will not vitiate the indictment when the homicide is charged as a crime committed under circumstances which preclude the idea of its being justifiable or excusable. The whole function of a proper -\u25a0iv-tu'\u00bb-. , =pan to be present when it complies with the requirement of section 284 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, when \u201cthe act or omission charged or the crime is plainly and concisely set forth\u201d; when \u201cthe act or omission charged as the crime is stated with such a degree of certainty as to enable the court to pronounce judgment on conviction, according to the right of the case.\u201d The judgment and conviction should be affirmed, and the case remanded to the county court for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Judgment of conviction affirmed.
