While the evidence offered upon the trial amply supported this defense, the plaintiff was, nevertheless, entitled to recover, inasmuch as there was a waiver on the part of the defendant by its acceptance of dues from the plaintiff with full knowledge of the falsity of the representations now complained of. Plaintiff became a member of the defendant association in January, 1898. In June, 1899, he was taken ill, and then informed the president of the defendant, as well as defendant\u2019s physician, that prior to his admission into the society he had been subject to attacks of epilepsy. This is the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>evidence now relied upon by the defendant. It appears, however, without contradiction, that, notwithstanding this disclosure as to his previous physical condition, the defendant paid the plaintiff sick benefits for his illness in June, 1899, permitted him to remain in the association thereafter, and continued to receive dues from him down to the time of his illness in question, which occurred in August, 1899. This conduct on the part of the defendant, with full knowledge of the falsity of the statements in plaintiff\u2019s application for admission into the society, precludes the defendant from now availing itself of the defense interposed in this action.
