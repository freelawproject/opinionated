It is evident that the jury believed that the plaintiff received from the defendant all the goods that she had delivered to the defendant. There were no errors made on the trial by the learned trial justice that call for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
