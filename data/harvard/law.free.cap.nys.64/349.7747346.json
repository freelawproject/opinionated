The only paper offered in evidence, according to the return, was the note. The evidence upon a former trial and the exhibits used at that trial are in the return, but to no purpose. The evidence did not warrant a judgment upon the merits. There was simply a failure of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">The judgment is therefore modified so that the action is dismissed without prejudice to a new action, and as modified is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
