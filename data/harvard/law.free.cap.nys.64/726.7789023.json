The verified account presented to the board is for expenses incurred by the relator.as district attorney\"of Washington county, and the claim is made under section 230 of the county law, which provides that \u201call expenses necessarily incurred by the district attorney in criminal actions or proceedings arising in his county\u201d are county charges. The disallowed items are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Dec. 6. People vs. Capo,\u2014habeas corpus at S.

It is the plain intention of the statute that the board of supervisors shall be possessed of such information in respect to the nature of a claim presented as shall enable' it to determine whether or not the claim is a proper county charge. The relator\u2019s account fails to furnish such information in respect to the rejected items. The items simply designate \u201cexpenses\u201d to and at different places within the county, on the dates named, and in some instances state in what matters; but do not specify the particular nature of the expenses. It is evident that they might be such expenses as are properly chargeable against the county, or they might be otherwise; and it was not only the right, but the duty, of the board to know to which class they belonged.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-21\">At the suggestion of the committee to whom the account was referred, the supervisor who had presented it in behalf of the relator for audit was permitted, by unanimous consent of the board, to withdraw the account, and return it to the relator, with the request that it be properly itemized; stating to him the particulars in which the board desired to have it corrected. This the relator declined to do, and returned the account, unaltered, to the board, who thereupon disallowed the objectionable items. I think the dis-allowance was right. It was the manifest duty of the relator to so specifically state the nature of the expenses for which he sought reimbursement from the county that the board of supervisors could determine whether or not they were \u201cexpenses necessarily incurred\u201d by him, within the provisions of the statute. In the absence of this information, the board could not properly audit and allow these items, and the court properly denied the relator\u2019s motion. The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-22\">Order affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
