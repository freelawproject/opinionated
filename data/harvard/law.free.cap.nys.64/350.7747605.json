The testimony on the part of the defendant tended to show that the plaintiff received her injuries while attempting to get off the car while it was still in motion; that is to say, the defendant\u2019s testimony contradicted that of the plaintiff. Under these circumstances, it was error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>for the court to refuse to charge that, if the plaintiff stepped off the car while the same was in motion, the verdict of the jury should be for the defendant.
