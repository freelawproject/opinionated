The jury rendered a verdict for the defendant thereupon.\u201d It is true that there is a statement immediately preceding that quoted that a motion was made to dismiss the complaint, and that the motion was granted, but the certificate of the justice indicates that the ruling was not adhered to, and that the cause was submitted to the jury, and a verdict rendered. In this condition of the record, the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
