Proc. The plaintiff\u2019s practice conformed to the requirements of the statute, and his right to a preference was not lost by neglect. Issue was joined on October 21, 1899, by the service of the defendant\u2019s answer. The time to serve an amended answer would not have expired until November 20th. The first term for which the case could have been safely noticed for trial, in view of what was decided in Haskin v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Murray, 29 App. Div. 374, 51 N. Y. Supp. 542, was January, 1900, and during that month the plaintiff was absent in Europe. Notice of trial for February, accompanied by an affidavit stating the claim for a preference, was served for the February term. \u201cThere is nothing in the practice which requires a party to notice his cause for trial for the first term after it shall have been at issue, or imposing any penalty, upon the plaintiff for a failure to so notice it.\u201d Bailey v. Miles, 46 App. Div. 608, 61 N. Y. Supp. 977. \u201cThere is no provisi\u00f3n requiring a notice of trial for any particular term after the joinder of issue, except that neglect for an unreasonable time to prosecute the action may result in its dismissal.\u201d Levy v. Hanneman, 47 App. Div. 32, 62 N. Y. Supp. 240. Under the circumstances of this case there was no neglect or delay for an unreasonable time. The cas\u00e9 was noticed for trial, and a preference was claimed immediately upon the plaintiff\u2019s return from Europe, and with but one term intervening between the time at which notice of trial could with safety have been given and the term for which the notice was actually served.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. Motion for a preference granted, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
