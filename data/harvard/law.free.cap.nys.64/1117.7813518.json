John Smith only defends. The issues . herein, with the exception of one, have been discussed and decided by the appellate division on a former appeal. See McMahon v. Smith and Keegan v. Smith, 24 App. Div. 25, 49 N. Y. Supp. 93. The defense or issue which constitutes the one exception above mentioned is set up in an amended answer, interposed after the decision of the above-cited cases, and is as follows: That the surety of the administrator is not liable for the three judgments obtained by the administrator\u2019s intestate in her lifetime against the administrator, because the latter was at the time of the death of the intestate, and- ever since has been, insolvent, and wholly unable to pay said indebtedness. The liability imposed by 2 Eev. St. p. 84, \u00a7 13, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1136-5\">\u201cAny just claim which a testator had against one named as executor of his will [or who is appointed administrator] shall be included in the inventory, \u2018and such executor shall he- liable for the same as for so much money in his hands, * * * and he shall apply and distribute the same in the payment of debts,\u2019 etc. An executor, although insolvent at the time of his appointment, is bound to account for a debt so due' from him, and should be charged therewith on settlement of his accounts as for sio much money in his hands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">It has been held that under this statute the liability of an executor or administrator is a qualified one, and that, if the proofs show that the executor was wholly unable to pay his debt to the estate, for want of property, he cannot be punished for contempt, nor would he be guilty of embezzlement. Baucus v. Stover, 89 N. Y. 5; Baucus v. Barr, 45 Hun, 582, affirmed in 107 N. Y. 624, 13 N. E. 939. The execu - tor or administrator is, however, subject to all provisions of law applicable to the enforcement of decrees and orders of surrogates relating to 'the estate and its property, when he has received property, or ought to have received it by the exercise of proper diligence, as enjoined upon an executor or administrator by law. The question now is: \u201cWill the surety of an administrator be held responsible for the latter\u2019s debts to the estate as for so much money received?\u201d Certainly he will be, provided it was established by the evidence that by proper diligence and faithful execution of the trust on the part of the executor or administrator he ought to have or could have so much money in his hands. The evidence adduced at the trial is sufficient to sustain the sixth finding of the court, to wit: \u201cThat the debts were due from him to said estate, as he was able to pay them, and that the said administrator should be charged with the same.\u201d There is evidence that the administrator, about five or six months before the deceased\u2019s death, disposed of a liquor store at $5,250, and sold a horse for about $700 to $800, and that from $2,000 to $3,000 of that money was deposited in his, wife\u2019s name in a savings bank. From this the inference may well be drawn that the administrator was able to pay the three judgments owing by him to the estate. Furthermore, the-question of the administrator\u2019s ability to pay-was inquired into by the referee, Bradley, on the administrator\u2019s accounting before the surrogate; and the said referee\u2019s report, with the evidence taken by the referee annexed, and surrogate\u2019s decree thereon, were put in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>evidence herein. Said referee did report in his fifth finding that the administrator should have accounted for said judgments and debts-due said estate from him, and the said surrogate\u2019s decree entered on said report and evidence annexed adjudges that the administrator should account for such judgments, and should be personally charged, therewith; and the evidence then before the surrogate warranted said conclusion. On the former appeal (24 App. Div. 25, 49 N. Y. Supp. 93) the appellate division held that this decree is conclusive-upon the administrator and also upon the surety, who is in privity with the administrator. For said indebtedness on the part of the-administrator his surety is liable, because the surety\u2019s obligation under the bond is conditioned upon \u201cMichael Keegan [the administrator] faithfully executing the trust reposed in him as administrator-of all and singular the goods, chattels, and credits of Jane Keegan, deceased, and obeying all lawful decrees and orders of the surrogate\u2019s-court of the city and county of New York touching the administration of the estate committed to him.\u201d The administrator failed to fulfill either of the said two obligations. His failure makes the surety liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">FITZSIMONS, C. J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
