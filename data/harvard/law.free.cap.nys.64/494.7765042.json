Its manufacturing business is carried on wholly within the state of New York. It makes what is known as dry colors, paints, and varnish. The dry colors, so called, are made by it from various chemicals. The process of such making is described in the testimony in the case, and I think as to such dry colors no question can be raised but what the process of maldng them is \u201cmanufacturing,\u201d within the meaning of the law. The principal business of the relator is making mix\u2019ed paints. The dry colors are used in the making of colored paints by mixing with linseed oil, turpentine, and a dryer. Perhaps, one-half of their product of mixed paints is made from colors or-pigments manufactured by them, and the one-half from an admixture of ingredients none of which are made by them, as, for instance,, white mixed paint, which is made from white lead, linseed oil, turpentine, and a dryer; none of these ingredients being made by the-relator. The proportions of the various ingredients are known, only to the maker of the paint. The oil and the white lead are put into what is known as an \u201ciron mixer,\u201d with arms in it,, by which, the mixture is stirred up for several hours, until it becomes a homogeneous mass,\u2014a paste. The paste is then taken out of the mixer, and put into a wooden tank. Then more oil is added, and turpentine and a dryer. The mixture is again stirred up, by mechanical power, for two or three hours, and the resulting mass is then ground in buhrstone mill, so that all small particles of undesirable matter in it are ground out. Then it is run into a receiving tank, ready to be placed in cans. None of the separate ingredients can be used for any of the purposes for which the mixed paint is used. The-article thus produced by the relator is a commercial article of value, recognized by a specific and distinctive name,\u2014a result of the use-of capital, labor, and machinery. It is a new article, different from any of its ingredients, fitted for sale, use, and consumption, and is within the definitions of what constitutes a \u201cmanufactured article,\u201d' and the making of it manufacturing. See Cent. Diet.; Stand. Diet.; Worcest. Diet.; People v. Roberts, 145 N. Y. 375, 40 N. E. 7; People v. Wemple, 129 N. Y. 543-552, 29 N. E. 808,14 L. R. A. 708; Evening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Journal Ass\u2019n v. State Board of Assessors, 47 N. J. Law, 38; Carlin v. Assurance Co., 57 Md. 515-526; U. S. v. Hathaway, 4 Wall. 404, 18 L. Ed. 395. The fact that the relator did not make the white ' lead or other pigments, the linseed oil, the turpentine, or the dryer does not take the process by which those several articles were combined to make paint without the process known as \u201cmanufacturing.\u201d It is not necessary to constitute one a manufacturer that he should make all the ingredients or articles which go to make up the finished product. People v. Morgan (Sup.) 63 N. Y. Supp. 76. It appears that, in addition to the manufacturing of paints, varnish, and articles incidental to such manufacture, the relator also imports some merchandise; constituting, however, but a small proportion of its business. All the business that it was carrying on in this state under its charter was manufacturing business,-and within the case of People v. Campbell, 144 N. Y. 166, 38 N. E. 990, that portion of its capital employed in this state wholly in manufacturing is exempt from taxation, and that portion of it which was engaged or employed in other than manufacturing business\u2014business which under its charter it was not authorized to do\u2014was properly subject to taxation. The amount of such capital so employed, I understand, is practically undisputed, being for the year 1891 $84,000, and the tax thereon $126; for the year 1892 $125,000, tax $187.50; 1893 $104,000, tax $156; 1894 $101,000, tax $151.50; 1895 $97,500, tax $146.25. And the determination of the comptroller as to the tax for these several years should be modified accordingly, and, as so modified, his determination affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements to the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Determination of the comptroller modified in accordance with opinion, and as so modified affirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements to the relator. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
