Proc. \u00a7 2863, provides that a justice of the peace cannot take cognizance of a civil action in a matter of account where the sum total of the accounts of both parties exceeds $400. Section 3228 provides that the plaintiff is entitled to costs of course, on the rendering of a final judgment in his favor in an action where a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction for the reason that the accounts between the parties exceed in the aggregate the sum of $400. Defendant, in an action for services, set up a counterclaim, which, with plaintiff\u2019s claim, aggregated more than $400. On the return day the cause was removed to the county court for the reason that the justice had no jurisdiction of the action. <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was entitled to costs on entry of judgment in his favor, though the judgment was for less than $50.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1033-12\">Appeal from Kings county court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1033-13\">Action by Silas A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa6\">This action was commenced in December, 1897, in the court of a justice of the peace in Brooklyn, to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>the value of the legal servic\u00e9s of the plaintiff on an account stated of $183.58, and on quantum meruit for other similar services alleged to be worth $30. The answer set up payment, denied an account stated, and, by way of counterclaim, alleged a payment of $1,000 for the plaintiff\u2019s use, on which he had paid $500, and also an advance of $225- for the use of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, both of which the plaintiff promised to pay. The defendant demanded judgment for these counterclaims. The plaintiff served a reply denying the counterclaims. On the return day, in December, the action was removed to the county court. In the county court a jury rendered a verdict of six cents for the plaintiff. The court denied a motion for a new tri\u00e1l,\" handing down the following memorandum: \u201cThe jury evidently found' against the account stated, and against both counterclaims. That left' the claim for $27.50 for services. Under the proof, it was competent to find that the value of the plaintiff\u2019s services in those matters was six cents. Motion for new trial denied.\u201d The clerk taxed the costs in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff moved to set aside the taxation, and from the order denying the motion the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">Section 2863 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a justice of the peace cannot take cognizance of a civil action \u201c(4) where, in a matter of account, the sum total of the accounts of both parties, proved to the satisfaction of the justice, exceeds four hundred dollars.\u201d Section 3228: \u201cThe' plaintiff is entitled to costs, of course, upon the rendering of a final judgment in his favor, -in * * * (3) an action specified in subdivision * * fourth * * * of section twenty-eight hundred and sixty-three of this act;\u201d that is, an action where the justice of the peace has no jurisdiction because the accounts between the parties exceed $400. The word \u201caccounts,\u201d in section 2863, has been construed as relating to demands, and is not restricted to running accounts. Glackin v. Zeller, 52 Barb. 147; Crim v. Cronkhite, 15 How. Prac. 250. It follows that the plaintiff, having recovered a judgment in his favor in an action of which the justice of the peace could not take cognizance, is entitled on the recovery of a judgment in his favor to receive costs, irrespective of the fact that the judgment does not exceed $50. The order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">Order reversed, with \u00a710 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
