Titus has succeeded to the rights granted to the said Townsend, and is now in possession of, and claims to be the owner of, the same. The agreement made by Townsend to maintain a crossway 18 feet wide upon the top of the dam for the passage and repassage of ox carts and teams has not been observed within the memory of man, and the evidence taken upon the trial justifies the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>elusion, and I so find, that the cross way has never, from the time of the making of the grant to the present time, been made 18 feet wide at the top, and in a condition for carts and teams to pass and repass. The claim of -the plaintiff is that these covenants and agreements made by Townsend, above referred to, were conditions subsequent, and that upon the failure to perform any one of them the grant became forfeited to the town of Huntington, and this action is brought to enforce such forfeiture; and, if the court should find that the covenants are not conditions subsequent, they ask for a specific performance of the covenant to make and maintain an 18-foot crossway,\u2014that being the covenant which it is alleged has never been performed by Townsend or by his successors in title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">I decide that the covenant to maintain an 18-foot crossway is not a condition subsequent, because the grant itself provides that \u201cin case it should so happen that the said Sylvanus Townsend should not go on to build a mill or mills at the place aforementioned, and should at any time hereafter fail, he or his successors or assigns, of keeping a good mill or mills, and should fail and neglect or refuse to grind all the grain of the country people as aforesaid, that then and in that case this present grant shall be absolutely null, void, and pf none effect, and all the privileges aforementioned shall revert to the said trustees and their successors.\u201d Inasmuch as some of the covenants made by Townsend are specified as conditions upon failure to perform which the grant should be forfeited, and there is no mention in that connection of the covenant to make and maintain the 18-foot crossway, I conclude that it was not the intention of the parties to the agreement to make the performance of that covenant a condition subsequent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">The defendant claims that an action to enforce the covenant referred to is barred by the statute of limitations; that the town has failed to assert its right to have the covenant performed for 125 years,\u2014ever since the making of the grant,\u2014and is now barred by the lapse of time. The plaintiff claims that the covenant is a continuing covenant, running with the land, and that a right of action constantly accrues for its enforcement. I am of the opinion that a cause of action to enforce the construction of the dam 18 feet wide, as prescribed by the grant, accrued upon failure of Townsend within a reasonable time to perform that covenant, and that a continuous right to enforce the cause of action has not existed down to the present time. It may be, however, if it could be shown that the covenant had once been complied with, that the right to have the crossway maintained, as erected in pursuance of the grant, would be a continuous right, and could be asserted and enforced now; but in this case there never was any compliance whatever with the covenant. From the fact that the covenant was never complied with in accordance. with its terms, and that 125 years have elapsed, and during that time there never has been any action on the part of the town authorities to enforce its performance, or so far as it appears, no complaint ever made because of its nonperformance, the presumption arises that the town waived its performance. The reasons for such waiver may not be now apparent, but the performance of the covenant was seemingly of so much importance to the inhabitants of the town, that the failure of the town to enforce it, or to complain of its nonperformance, justifies the conclusion that for some sufficient consideration the mill owner was relieved from its performance. At all events, it. seems to me the burden is upon the town to explain its nonaction and silence, and that burden has not been met upon this trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">If I were to decide, however, that the statute of limitations did not apply, and that there had been no waiver on the part of the town, I think this is not a case where the specific performance of this covenant should be enforced. The granting or withholding of a specific performance of a contract is within the discretion of the court, and it will not be granted when it is against equity and good conscience to do so. It appears by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence that it would cost about \u00a1\u00a1-'3.000 to put the dam in condition for travel. To impose this burden upon the present owner would amount to a practical confiscation of his property. When the grant was made to Townsend, and for many years thereafter, the milling privilege was a very valuable one. At the present time it is of but little value. The property has been transferred from time to time in its present condition, and without any express notice on the part of the town that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>the covenant might be enforced. It would be exceedingly unjust and oppressive, in the present changed condition of affairs, to impose upon the present owner, who, if not legally, is morally, an innocent purchaser, a burden which, in effect, would deprive him of his property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-4\">For these reasons, I conclude that the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief demanded in the complaint, and the complaint, must be dismissed, with costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b78-5\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.

SMITH, with a single qualification, which in no wise affects his conclusions. We doubt whether any distinction can be recognized by the courts, growing out of the fact that a party is morally an innocent purchaser, if he be not an innocent purchaser in the eyes of the law. This characterization of the defendant in the special term opinion, however, is merely incidental to the argument showing that it would be most unjust at this time to enforce the town\u2019s claim against him, and it in no respect impairs the validity of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Judgment affirmed, with costs, upon the opinion of SMITH, J.\u201e at special term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
