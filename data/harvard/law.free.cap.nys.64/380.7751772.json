The answer admits that at the time of the accident the defendant owned the premises, and that prior to that time defendant caused to be commenced the work of making the excavation, and plaintiff is entitled to have the full benefit of those admissions, without regard to the affirmative allegations of the answer not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>proved. The proof shows that the lot was about <em>25 </em>feet wide, and was excavated the whole width about 8 to 12 feet deep. The excavation came to within 1 foot of the sidewalk flags. A plank about 3 inches thick, 8 inches wide, and 25 or 26 feet long was placed in front of the excavation, across the top of three empty barrels set on end. The plaintiff lived with his parents at 588 East 134th street, and the excavation was at ISTo. 60S East 134th street, and had been there four or five months. The plaintiff was playing tag with a number of other boys in the neighborhood of the excavation, and, with a lot of other boys, jumped into the excavation. The plank that was across the barrels was thrown down on top of him, and inflicted the injuries. The plaintiff had come out of school at 3 o\u2019clock, and went home, and asked his mother for leave to go out to play, and she said, \u201cAll right.\u201d The statute required the defendant to properly guard and protect the excavation. \u201cAll excavations shall be properly guarded and protected so as to prevent the same from becoming'dangerous to life and limb, * \"\"\" * by the person or persons causing the excavations to be made.\u201d Laws 1892, c. 275, \u00a7 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The plaintiff claimed that it could not be said, as matter of law, that the 6 year old plaintiff was personally negligent, nor that it was negligent as matter of law for his parents to permit him to go unattended on the sidewalk in the neighborhood of his home, and that the question of the defendant\u2019s negligence in maintaining the guard was for the jury to determine. In these contentions the plaintiff is sustained by ample authority. Whatever the rule would have been if the plaintiff had been an adult, this 6 year old plaintiff was entitled to have the question of his negligence submitted to the jury, and, if they found him to be non sui juris, then to have the question of his parents\u2019 negligence in permitting him to play upon the sidewalk determined by them. Earl v. Crouch (Sup.) 16 N. Y. Supp. 770; Crawford v. Manufacturing Co., 8 Misc. Rep. 48, 28 N. Y. Supp. 514; Schmidt v. Cook, 12 Misc. Rep. 449, 33 N. Y. Supp. 624; Mullaney v. Spence, 15 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">It was competent, on the evidence, for the jury to find that the defendant had not properly guarded and protected this excavation. Brown v. Wittner, 43 App. Div. 135, 59 N. Y. Supp. 385; Stewart v. Ferguson, 34 App. Div. 515, 54 N. Y. Supp. 615; Dorrity v. Rapp, 72 N. Y. 307; Downey v. Low, 22 App. Div. 460, 48 N. Y. Supp, 207; Berg v. Parsons, 156 N. Y. 109, 50 N. E. 957, 41 L. R. A. 391. The plaintiff or his parents can not be held negligent as matter of law. Kunz v. City of Troy, 104 N. Y. 350, 10 N. E. 442; Costello v. Railroad Co., 161 N. Y. 317, 55 N. E. 897; Birkett v. Ice Co., 110 N. Y. 504, 18 N. E. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The excavation adjoining a public highway, the plaintiff in this case (6 year old boy) was not a trespasser. Mullaney v. Spence, 15 Abb. Prac. (N. S.) 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">We are of opinion that the facts proved in regard to the injuries and the negligence of the person who maintained the alleged guard entitled the plaintiff to have those issues submitted to the jury. .</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>It follows that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
