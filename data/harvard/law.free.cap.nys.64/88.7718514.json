The plaintiff was thrown upon the pavement by the violent forward movement of the car, and so severely bruised that he became and remained unconscious for several days. One of his arms was also disabled to some extent, and he claims that his memory has been seriously impaired as a result of the accident. The jury awarded him a verdict of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">There are only two points in the appellant\u2019s brief: First, that the verdict was against the weight of evidence; and, second, that the trial court erred in refusing to charge that the plaintiff could not recover damages for any permanent injury. As to the first point, it is sufficient to say that we have read through the entire record, and think that the proof is ample to sustain the judgment. The second point, however, requires a little, more discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In the course of his .charge, the learned trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cThe plaintiff claims that his injuries are of a permanent character; and, if you find that they are in fact permanent to any extent, you may make an amount which would afford reasonable compensation for that permanent in-, jury. The evidence bearing upon the question of permanent injury, however, is principally the opinion of the physician called to testify as a witness in the plaintiff\u2019s behalf. But you are not concluded by this opinion, which is to be viewed as more in the nature of advice to you; and if, after giving due consideration to such evidence, you are led to a contrary view by your own experiences, and by inferences to be drawn from the proof in the case, you are at liberty to refrain from following the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">No exception was taken to this instruction, but, just before the jury went out, counsel for the defendant made the following requests, which were disposed of as indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201c(14) The plaintiff cannot recover damages for any permanent injury. (Refused. Defendant excepts.)\u201d \u201c(16) I charge you that you can award no damages for any loss of memory. (Refused, except as charged. Defendant excepts.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">If, as matter of fact, nothing that occurred in the course of the trial would warrant the jury in finding that some of the injuries which the plaintiff sustained in consequence of the accident were of a permanent character, it was reversible error for the court to refuse to charge the fourteenth request. This rule has quite recently been asserted in the First department, whence the present appeal comes, in the case of Reardon v. Railroad Co., 24 App. Div. 163, 48 N. Y. Supp. 1005, where Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-13\">. \u201cIn the absence of proof, in the shape of an opinion or otherwise, that such injuries were reasonably certain to be permanent, it was the duty of the court to charge in accordance with the undisputed facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>We must therefore look into the evidence to see what was the state of the proof on this subject. After the plaintiff himself had described the accident and his injuries, and given testimony indicating that his memory had been impaired since he was hurt, Dr. Hugo P. Mayer, the physician who treated him, was called to the stand. He gave an account of the plaintiff\u2019s illness, and the treatment which he adopted. He then testified as follows in regard1 to the probable effects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201cI heard Mr. Jena testify this morning that he suffered from loss of memory. I can state the reasonably certain result of such injuries, as I have described, as the plaintiff was suffering from. Q. Now tell us what the reasonably certain result of such injuries is. A. Loss of memory. 1 can with, reasonable certainty tell whether that loss of memory is permanent or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On cross-examination the same witness gave this testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201cQ. In regard to the memory, you do not know of your own knowledge any specific occasions of loss of memory, do you, on the part of the plaintiff? A. Not to my knowledge. Q. And when you testified that, in your opinion, the loss of memory might be permanent, that was largely based upon the fact that there had been some testimony in the case, given by the plaintiff, that his memory was impaired, was it not? A. No; the result of my examinations and his statements to me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">When we consider together the direct examination of this witness, his cross-examination, and that portion of the charge relating to the character of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries, it' is perfectly plain that the medical witness, the counsel for the defendant, and the learned judge who presided at the trial, were all under the impression that Dr. Mayer had given testimony, in substance, to the'effect that it was reasonably certain that some of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were of a permanent character. Counsel for the defendant assumed such to be the fact in his cross-examination of the witness, and the witness made the sam\u00e9 assumption in his answers. It is manifest, therefore, that he meant to be understood, and doubtless was understood, by the jury, as having testified precisely as counsel and the court supposed. In other words, the jury must have derived from his testimony the impression which he intended to give to them, and which he did give, for the time being, at least, to defendant\u2019s counsel and the trial judge. Under these circumstances, it does not seem to me that we should hold that the record is so utterly devoid of proof relative to the permanency of the plaintiff\u2019s injuries as to make it a fatal error for the court to have refused to charge as requested by the defendant on that subject. There is no injustice to the defendant corporation in holding that it was permissible for the jury to construe the opinion evidence of an expert witness in the way that the witness himself intended it should be interpreted, and in the way in which it was understood by the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time the testimony was given. I think the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
