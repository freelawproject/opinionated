As no waiver of this time provision was alleged, none could be shown. Elting v. Dayton (Sup.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 849. If, however, it be assumed that a waiver of strict performance as to time could be shown, evidence of performance within a reasonable time would be necessary, and there is no evidence as to the time of the completion of the work. The only witness (Edward Rode) who testified as to completion did not state the time.
