On October 8th of the same year the \u2018plaintiff was discharged,- as he claims, without cause, and immediately brought suit to recover $500 for \u201cbreach of contract.\u201d Upon the trial the question was litigated as to whether the discharge at that time was justifiable. We are to infer from the finding of the court below that this question was resolved in favor of the plaintiff. It was stipulated, however, upon the record, that the plaintiff made no claim for loss of wages from the date of his discharge to December 21, 1899, the date of the trial, and confined his right to recover to the $500 mentioned in the contract. Under the circumstances, the judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $500 must be reversed; for, even though the defendants discharged the plaintiff before the expiration of the year, they were not required to pay the $500, if at all, until the date mentioned in the agreement. As the defendants, however, conceded, notwithstanding plaintiff\u2019s disclaimer on the trial, a liability to the extent of $266.66, covering the period from October 8, 1899, to December 21, 1899, the judgment will be modified by reducing the judgment to $266.66 and costs, and as modified affirmed, without costs to either party, if the plaintiff, within 10 days after the service of a copy of the order and notice of entry, file a stipulation in the office of the clerk of this court, consenting to such modification; and if such stipulation is not filed the judgment will be reversed, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur, BEEKMAN, P. J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
