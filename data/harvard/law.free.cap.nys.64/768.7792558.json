His attorney in that proceeding failed to inform him that it was necessary to obtain an injunction staying plaintiff\u2019s' action in a state court, and his attorney in such action, who did not appear for him in the bankruptcy proceedings, not being aware of his discharge, did not apply for leave to file a supplemental answer. On the trial a verdict was rendered against both defendants, on which judgment was entered; and on January 20, 1900, defendant Mass moved for a perpetual injunction staying execution against him, and was granted leave to move within 10 days to be allowed to plead his discharge in bankruptcy and to open the judgment for that purpose, which order was subsequently granted on payment of $20 costs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b786-11\">Argued before FITZSIMONS, C.

But because of the fact that he elected only to take advantage of the defense which he now seeks to avail himself of, after a fair and full trial and the entry of judgment thereon, such relief should only have been granted upon payment of full costs, and all disbursements as taxed in the judgment roll, and $10 costs of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-15\">The order appealed from must therefore be modified. . Defendant must pay all such costs, disbursements, and motion costs, and as so modified said order is affirmed, without costs or disbursements to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
