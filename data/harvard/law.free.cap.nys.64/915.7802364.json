In the case of a nonsuit we must adopt those inferences which are most favorable to the plaintiff. Rehberg v. City of New York, 91 N. Y. 137, 141; Weil v. Railroad Co., 119 N. Y. 147, 152, 23 N. E. 487; Ladd v. Insurance Co., 147 N. Y. 478, 482, 42 N. E. 197; Costello v. Railroad Co., 161 N. Y. 317, 320, 55 N. E. 897. The plaintiff, a child between 7 and 8 years of age, was seriously injured by one of defendant\u2019s cars while he was crossing Flushing avenue in the evening. The hour was between 6 and 7 o\u2019clock, and it was getting dark; but one witness testified that she could see a distance of <em>2-} </em>blocks. At the time the plaintiff started to cross the street\u2014 possibly at the time he reached the track\u2014there is proof that the car was at least 55 feet distant. The plaintiff was struck before he actually got on the railroad track, but he was struck by the fender of the Car, by the side, but near the front; and the jury would have been fully justified in concluding that the accident was directly attributable to the negligence of the motorman. The car was running very fast, considerably beyond the usual rate of speed. The motorman did not look in the direction the car was going, but was looking at the sidewalk towards which the plaintiff was proceeding. Ho bell or warning of any kind was sounded or given. The car did not slacken its speed at all, but proceeded for at least two blocks before it stopped, and then continued to its destination. It certainly cannot be said as matter of law that the defendant\u2019s negligence was not sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>As to the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence, much evidently depends upon whether or not he is to be regarded as sui juris. That was a question for the jury. If he was non sui juris, he could not be chargeable with negligence of his own, under the circumstances of this case, nor is it a matter of law that he could be if sui juris. Costello v. Railroad Co., supra. Assuming that he was answerable for his own negligence, he would only be held to the exercise of care commensurate with his age, and it would be for the jury to apply the standard when they had determined the facts. So, too, under the circumstances disclosed, the question of the negligence of the parents of the plaintiff, in the event that he is held to be non sui juris, is one of fact, and not of law. The judgment and order should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
