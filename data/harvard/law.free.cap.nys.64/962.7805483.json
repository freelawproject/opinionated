J.</author>\n<p id=\"AG-d\">The respondent\u2019s counsel, by his motion to dismiss the appeal, challenges the jurisdiction of this court <em>to </em>entertain an appeal from the municipal court of the city of-New York, borough of the Bronx, First district, which district is a part of the territory exscinded from Westchester county, and annexed to the county of New York, by chapter 934 of the Laws of 1895. The Greater New York charter (section 1359) provides that there shall be in the borough of the Bronx two districts of the municipal court, the First embracing the territory annexed to the city and county of New York by chapter 934 of the Laws of 1895. Section 1367 of the charter, as amended by chapter 546 of the Laws of 1898, provides for appeals from judgments rendered in the municipal court in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-5\">\u201cSuch appeal shall be heard in such manner and by such justice or justices as the appellate division of the supreme court in the judicial department embracing the district wherein the action is brought shall direct, except that the appellate division of the Second judicial department may direct that such appeal be heard directly before that court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">In People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Westchester Co., 147 N. Y. 1, 41 N. E. 563, 30 L. R. A. 74, the effect of the act of 1895 was under consideration. The Special term in this department had directed the issue of a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring the board of supervisors of the county of Westchester to reassemble, and divide the said county into three assembly districts. The general term affirmed the order, and on appeal the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the general term. The court, Andrews, C. J., writing, said (pages 23, 24, 147 N. Y., and page 569, 41 N. E.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-7\">\u201cWe think the construction of the act of annexation; which affirms its validity as such, but leaves the annexed territory part of the Twenty-Second district and of the Second judicial district and departmept, and within the jurisdiction of the board of supervisors of Westchester county for the purpose of\" forming assembly districts, most nearly harmonizes the provisions of the constitution relating to senate, judicial, and assembly districts, and the power possessed by the legislature to divide counties and towns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Referring to this case, the appellate term of the First department, in Duckworth v. Cunningham, 26 Misc. Rep. 403, 404, 56 N. Y. Supp. 191, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-9\">\u201cIn the case at bar the question simply is whether the First district of the borough of the Bronx is within the First or the Second judicial department. If in the First department, this court has jurisdiction to entertain the appeal; if in the Second department, this court is without jurisdiction. The question has been practically decided by the court of appeals in People v. Board of Sup\u2019rs of Westchester Co., 147 N. Y. 1, 41 N. E. 563, 30 L. R. A. 74. The effect of that decision is that the territory now embraced within the boundaries of the First judicial district of the municipal court, borough of the Bronx, remains, notwithstanding its former annexation to the city and county of New York, part of the Twenty-Second- senate district and of the Second judicial district and department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">Counsel for the respondent claims that a later decision of the court of appeals (Hawkins v. Power Co., 158 N. Y. 417, 53 N. E. 162) has limited the scope of the decision in the Henderson Case. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>the Hawkins Case the court said (page 420, 166 N. Y., and page 163, 53 N.E.):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b982-4\">\u201cWhile it is true that in that [Henderson] case the court held that this change of the lines of the two counties did not change the senate, assembly, \u25a0or judicial districts, so far, at least, as to control in determining the electors who should be entitled to vote for senator, assemblymen, or judges of the supreme court, still it is distinctly held that the portion of the territory which was annexed to the county of New York was to be considered a part of that county for other purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">It is to be observed that this quotation uses the words \u201cother purposes,\u201d but this does not necessarily include all other purposes; and we do not find in either case any authority for the claim that the territory of the Bronx is not within the Second judicial department, for the purposes of this appeal. Indeed, on principle, as the court held that the voters of the district of the Bronx were entitled to vote for the justices of the supreme court in the Second judicial \u25a0department, it is reasonable to infer that the voters, and all others who have the right to sue and are subject to be sued living in that district, are entitled to have their actions at law and equity adjudicated by the justices whom such voters have elected. We are unwilling, therefore, to construe the Hawkins Case as overruling the Henderson Case in any respect which would require us to say that the district of the Bronx is not a part of the Second judicial department; all the more, that by reason of the decision in the Duckworth Case the appellate term in the First department has refused to entertain appeals from the municipal court of the city of New York, borough of the Bronx, First district. The result of holding that the Henderson Case was overruled in the respect indicated would be to deny the suitor.-in the territory in question the \u25a0right of appeal to the Second department, as well as the appellate term in the First department. The motion to dismiss the appeal \u2022.should therefore be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The appeal from the judgment involves a pure question of fact -on conflicting evidence. The plaintiff sued to recover the balance &lt;of a bill, the last item of which is dated December 17, 1883. The defendant set up the statute of limitations. The plaintiff testified that the defendant\u2019s testator paid him $25 on October 25, 1893, and there is such an entry on the plaintiff\u2019s books, a leaf of which is included in the return. On another bill, dated November 29, 1884, rendered by the plaintiff to the testator, appears the plaintiff\u2019s receipt for $25, the date being October 26, 1888. When the receipt .was presented to him, the plaintiff testified that it was in his handwriting. Afterwards, but at the same examination, the attention of the court apparently was attracted to an evident difference between the chirography of the date and that of the rest of the receipt, and the court asked the witness: \u201cTell me in whose handwriting that date on the defendant\u2019s exhibit is. A. It is my handwriting. Q. Look at the date. A. That date is not my handwriting. That is as sure as you live. I did not look at that date business.\u201d In his brief the appellant\u2019s counsel makes these questions \u25a0of the court the subject of animadversion on the conduct of the jus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>tice. The strictures are utterly unfounded. The action of the justice was wholly within the line of his duty in eliciting facts, and the counsel\u2019s citation of the provision of the Greater New York charter, which forbids a justice of the municipal court to practice as an attorney, and hence to act as counsel for either party on a trial before himself, is neither dignified nor humorous, and justly merits the reprobation of an appellate tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The court rendered judgment for $196.87, the amount of principal and interest, with costs, demanded in the complaint. No deduction was made for the $25 mentioned in the questioned receipt, but the plaintiff\u2019s exhibits show that there was a payment of $25 made on October 25,1893, for which allowance was made in the prayer of the complaint. The court, on the evidence, was justified in finding that the $25 named in the receipt was the same payment which appeared, in the account under the date of October 25, 1893. In any event, there was a conflict of evidence, and we neither propose, nor are we at liberty, to interfere with a judgment rendered on a disputed question of fact. The motion to dismiss should be denied, and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Judgment of municipal court affirmed, with costs. All concur, except JENKS, J., who takes no part</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
