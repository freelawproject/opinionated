We think the motion should have been granted. The order appealed from must be reversed, and defendant allowed to serve his proposed answer within 5 days from the service of the order herein, on payment of costs before and after notice of trial, together with $10 costs of the motion. No costs of this appeal. Issue to remain and cause to be tried on short-cause calendar when reached.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
