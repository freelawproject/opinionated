Such judgment was entered in Montgomery county, and on August 12th a transcript thereof was filed and docketed in Schoharie county. On the same day an execution was issued on such judgment, and delivered to the sheriff of Schoharie county, who passed the same over to the defendant Schoolcraft, as one of his deputies, to be by him executed. Schoolcraft lost such execution before any levy was made, and a duplicate was sent him by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. After receipt of such duplicate, he proceeded to levy the same upon certain personal property which he\"found in the possession of said Clark Crouse, and subsequently sold it in satisfaction of such judgment. On the 11th of January, 1898, said Clark Crouse executed to Walter Crouse a chattel mortgage upon the property so sold to secure a valid debt then owing from Clark to said Walter Crouse. Such mortgage was not filed until the 8th day of March, 1898, and the property remained in the possession of said mortgagor until the sale aforesaid. The mortgagee, Walter Crouse, commenced an action against these defendants for the unlawful sale and conversion of such property. He subsequently died, and this plaintiff, as his administrator, revived and continued such action. Upon the trial before the court without a jury, the complaint was dismissed, with costs, and from the judgment so entered this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b659-12\">Argued before PAEKEE, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbFr\">The chattel mortgage under which the plaintiff claims the property in question was utterly void as against the judgment creditor, Albert Getman. Not having been filed until some two months after its execution, it was void as against Getman from the time it was given, although he was then only a simple contract creditor. The fact that it was filed before Getman obtained a judgment upon his note did not give it validity at and after that date. This is distinctly held in Karst v. Gane, 136 N. Y. 316, 326, 32 N. E. 1073, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and has not, in my judgment, been since overruled or modified. See, also, Thompson v. Van Vechten, 27 N. Y. 568. Although the mortgage was, by force of the statute, void, as against G-etman, from the time of its execution, he was not in a position to avail himself of that fact, nor to malte any claim to the property mortgaged, until by some legal process he had impressed upon it a lien for the amount of his debt. But as soon as he had obtained his judgment, and issued execution to the sheriff, he had acquired that lien; and from that time his right to take possession of the property, and appropriate it to the satisfaction of his debt, was superior to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It is claimed by the plaintiff that the defendants proceeded in an irregular manner to take and sell the property, and that hence this action may be maintained. There is no dispute but that execution had been regularly issued to the sheriff of Schoharie county on Get-man\u2019s judgment, and that the defendant Schoolcraft was the sheriff\u2019s deputy, and authorized to execute it. From the time of the issuing of such execution, Getman had obtained the lien which authorized him to take the property as against the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. Even if it be conceded that the issuing of the duplicate execution under which the sale was had was an irregularity, nevertheless, the proceeding by defendants was but a taking of this property for the satisfaction of Getman\u2019s judgment. It was applied on such judgment, and, the plaintiff\u2019s only interest in such property being that which he acquired through this mortgage, he cannot complain of such application, inasmuch as his mortgage, as against such judgment, is utterly void.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">If, under the circumstances of this case, the issuing of the duplicate execution was irregular without an order of the court, it but rendered the process voidable at the option of the defendants. It was not void, and hence none but the defendants in the execution could take advantage of such irregularity. It was so decided by the general term in this department in the case of Horton v. Borthwick, reported in 15 Wkly. Dig. 309, 310. That it was, at most, irregular, and not void, see 8 Enc. PI. &amp; Frac. p. 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">As to the claim that the execution has never been regularly returned, I do not see that it would in any way affect the plaintiff\u2019s rights as a mortgagee if it never is returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">I conclude that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
