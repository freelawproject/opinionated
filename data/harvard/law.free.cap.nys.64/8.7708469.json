The defense was that the plaintiff failed to perform the conditions of the agreement on his part, without any fault of the defendant, and that the former had so unreasonably delayed the completion of the work that the latter was compelled to finish it at his own expense. The questions of fact so raised by the pleadings and the proof were fairly subtiiitted to the jury, who resolved the conflict of testimony in the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>favor, and we see no reason for disturbing their verdict. The solitary exception taken by the defendant at the trial to the admission of evidence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The judgment must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
