It will be observed that the plaintiff was bound by the very terms of the contract to obtain from the department a permit for the construction of the building. This it is apparent he could not do unless the plans for construction were acceptable; so that there is internal evidence, within the four corners of the written agreement, which, disregarding the oral evidence that was admitted upon the subject, supports the construction which the court below has adopted. As the plaintiff has not as yet complied with the condition, as we construe the agreement, upon which his right to the first installment of his compensation depends, it follows that the judgment dismissing his complaint must be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
