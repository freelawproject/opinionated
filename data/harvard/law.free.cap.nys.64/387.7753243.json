If there was any usury, it must have been at this time. Whitehead cannot be heard to say that he did not at this time have authority to represent the payee; for he represented himself to the -defendants as having this authority, and, as between him and the defendants, is bound by his representation. The plaintiff, as representative of Whitehead, has no right beyond such as his principal has. It seems, further, that the $200 were advanced by Mr. Weil to 'Whitehead upon the security of the note. If this is so, Whitehead was the owner of the note at all times, subject to Mr. Weil\u2019s rights \u00a1upon the security.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
