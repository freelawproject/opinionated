She had testified to the accident, and, being asked: \u201cJust what happened to you in the way of injury? Didn\u2019t break any bones, did you?\u201d\u2014the witness replied: \u201cNo, sir; I didn\u2019t break any bones. I fell violently on my side. My whole side was badly bruised, and also my hip., Of all the injury, that was the most severest injury I had. It' pained and ached me continually all along. It pains me even until now. I never got any relief.\u201d She was then asked: \u201cYou also worry considerable over it?\u201d To this an objection was interposed that it was immaterial, irrelevant, and incompetent. The objection was overruled, and an exception taken by the defendant. The rule is well established that when the injury to an- intelligent being, caused either by willfulness or by negligence, produces mental as well as bodily anguish and suffering, independently of any extraneous consideration or cause, it is impossible to exclude the mental suffering in estimating the extent of the personal injury for which compensation is to be awarded. Kennon v. Gilmer, 131 U. S. 22, 26, 9 Sup. Ct. 696, 33 L. Ed. 110; Ransom v. Railroad Co., 15 N. Y. 415. Worry is an element of mental suffering, and it was therefore competent in the connection in which the question was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The husband, who was away from home at the time of the accident, and who returned some weeks afterwards, testified without objection: \u201cWhen I came back, and found my wife, she was complaining in general. She was complaining with her side, and her head was affected a good deal.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cDid she act anything different from what she did formerly?\u201d This was objected to as \u201cimmaterial and irrelevant, the conversation between this witness and the plaintiff being had four weeks after the time of the accident.\u201d The objection was overruled, and defendant excepted. No answer was made to this question, and plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cNow, how did she act?\u201d To this defendant made a general objection, which was overruled, and an exception taken. Witness answered: \u201cShe acted different in every way, of course. She was very nervous. She was not feeling well.\u201d There was no motion to strike out any part of this answer, and we find no authorities which hold that the acts of persons may not be proved. \u201cEvidence,\u201d say the court in Hagenlocher v. Railroad Co., 99 N. Y. 136, 1 N. E. 536, \u201cmay be given that a person appeared to be in great agony; was emaciated; looked haggard and feeble; and why not that he screamed with pain?\u201d To the same effect, see Roche v. Railroad Co., 105 N. Y. 294, 11 N. E. 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s attending physician was asked: \u201cThis neurasthenia that you find the plaintiff is suffering from may be a perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>nent condition, may it not, doctor?\u201d A general objection was made to this question, and was overruled, when the witness answered: \u201cA recovery in these cases is possible where the person can meet the indication of it successfully. It involves considerable expense.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel moved to strike the answer out, which mo: tian was denied, and an exception taken. The rule is well established in this state that where there is a general objection to evidence, and it is overruled, and the evidence is received, the ruling will not be held erroneous unless there be some ground which could not have been obviated if it had been specified, or unless the evidence in its essential nature be incompetent. Tooley v. Bacon, 70 N. Y. 34, 37, and authorities there cited. On the merits, however, we are of opinion that under the rule laid down in Griswold v. Railroad Co., 115 N. Y. 61, 63, 21 N. E. 726, the question was competent, though it is possible that, had defendant moved to strike out that portion of the answer which was not responsive to the question, it would have been entitled to have it eliminated. The motion to strike out the answer asked for more than the defendant was entitled to, and, having failed to call the attention of the court to that portion of the answer which was not responsive to the question, at a time when the matter might have been corrected, it is too late now to urge the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
