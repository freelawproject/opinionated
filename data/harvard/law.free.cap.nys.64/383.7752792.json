The action is to recover damages for an alleged injury to a carriage belonging to the plaintiff by being in collision with a car of the defendant at Lexington avenue and Sixtieth street, New York City, on the night of the 7th of- December, 1897; and such collision it is charged was the fault or negligence of' the defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9s. The only question submitted for review on this appeal is whether or not the court erred in permitting the jury to consider the depreciation of the value of the wagon. The court, in its charge to the jury, upon this precise question said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">\u201cThe evidence introduced here as to depreciation in value o\u00a3 the carriage is rather meager, and I shall not allude to it except to say that the witness who testified concerning the value has duly qualified himself as an expert. His knowledge, however, of the vehicle in question, seems to be very slight, and you will consider that in a settlement upon the verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">The witness in question had testified to almost daily visits to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business, and generally to the condition of the plaintiff\u2019s carriages. He was a carriage maker and repairer of 15 years\u2019 standing; also did the repairs on the carriage in question; and was, therefore, competent to testify as to the value of the repairs, which he stated were worth $158.70, and, under objection, he was permitted to say that the difference in value before the accident and after the repairs was \u00bfbout $300. The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $208, and it does not, therefore, appear that the charge of the court had been prejudicial to the defendant. Indeed, it would seem that the charge was entirely fair to the defendant; and, having reached this conclusion, we see no reason for disturbing the finding's of the jury. It may be said that the defendant gave no evidence whatever as to the value, and ought not, for that reason, to be heard in complaint. There was a conflict of evidence upon the question of negligence, and the jury determined that also in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
