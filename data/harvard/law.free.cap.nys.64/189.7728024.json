Their general manager and attorney in fact in that business was one Benjamin T. Rhoads, Jr. A policy of fire insurance was issued to James C. Bradford in the amount of $2,000 in April, 1896. It was signed by Benjamin T. Rhoads, Jr., and it contained, among other things, the provision that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-18\">\u201cNo action shall be brought to enforce the provisions of this policy, except as against the general manager as attorney in fact, and representing all the underwriters; and each of the underwriters hereby agrees to abide the result of any suit so brought, as fixing his individual liability hereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-19\">A loss occurred under this policy on the 11th of July, 1896; and Bradford, after taking the necessary steps to entitle himself to recover, assigned the policy to the plaintiff, who brought an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>against Rhoads as general manager and attorney in fact of all the underwriters, including the defendant in this action. Rhoads appeared and answered, and by his action there was put in issue the execution and delivery of the policy to Bradford; the agreement of the underwriters to insure him against loss by fire on the property specified, and to pay him, in the event of such loss, upon his complying with the terms of the policy, their proportionate share, to wit, one-seventeenth; the destruction of the premises by fire, and the right of the insured to recover the full amount of the policy; the various steps taken by the insured' to comply with the conditions of the policy; and the assignment in writing by Bradford to the plaintiff of the policy. All these matters were necessarily determined in favor of the plaintiff in the action against Rhoads as general manager and attorney in fact of the underwriters. Judgment was entered in that action against Rhoads for $2,597.16 in favor of the plaintiff, and an execution was issued against him, which was returned wholly unsatisfied. This action was then begun against Jones to recover the amount of his individual liability as one of the underwriters, being one-seventeenth part, or $152.78. The action was tried before the court without a jury, and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff for the amount claimed, with costs, from which this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">It is objected that the execution against Rhoads was not issued against the fund, but against him as general manager and attorney in fact, but this objection is of no importance. There is no requirement in the policy that an execution should be issued upon the judgment, as a condition precedent to the action of the insured against the und\u00e9rwriters.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The complaint in this action alleges that the defendant and 16 other persons named were associated together and doing business in the city of Mew York as individual underwriters of certain policies of insurance issued by their general manager and attorney in fact, Benjamin T. Rhoads, under the name and style of the People\u2019s Fire Lloyd\u2019s in the City of Mew York. That allegation is not denied in the answer. . The policy signed by Rhoads was put in evidence, and the plaintiff then proved the judgment which had been procured against Rhoads. It is objected that that judgment was not evidence against the defendant. But that objection does not need much consideration. When one agrees to be bound by the result of a suit against another party, he puts himself in privity with that party, and a judgment in the suit is evidence against him, although he was not a party to it, in terms, and had no notice of the action. Rapelye v. Prince, 4 Hill, 119; Douglass v. Howland, 24 Wend. 35-50 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The defendant insists that the policy upon which the action was brought was void, because it was issued in violation of the provisions of section 54 of the insurance law (Laws 1892, c. 690). That section prescribes that no person, partnership, or association of persons shall engage in the business of insurance, except as agents of a person or corporation authorized to do so, unless he or they shall have deposited with the superintendent of insurance securities of the same amount required of an insurance company, and shall have received from him a certificate to the effect that they have complied with the law. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>plaintiff made no effort to prove that the law had been complied with, or that any certificate had been issued to the defendant, and the defendant claims, therefore, that this policy was void. But in this regard, also, the defendant is concluded by the judgment against Rhoads. Strictly speaking, this action is not brought upon the policy to insure, but upon the agreement of the defendant to be bound by the judgment against Rhoads. But it may be conceded that, if the policy was void, any agreement to be liable either for the whole or any part of it was also void. So far as the execution, delivery, and validity of that contract were concerned, \"it was necessarily determined in favor of the plaintiff by the judgment against Rhoads, because no judgment could have gone against Rhoads in that case unless the policy upon which the action was brought was valid. This suit is brought upon precisely the same agreement, and therefore the judgment against Rhoads is conclusive against the defendant here, not only as to every matter which was actually litigated in that suit, but as to every fact which, if set up, would have constituted a defense upon the policy, although it was not made use of. Cromwell v. Sac Co., 94 U. S. 351, 24 L. Ed. 195; Pray v. Hageman, 98 N. Y. 351; Embury v. Conner, 3 N. Y. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The objections taken in this action are therefore not well founded, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
