Proc. \u00a7 1268, authorizing cancellation and discharge of a judgment on application therefor after one year from discharge in bankruptcy.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b856-10\">Appeal from special term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b856-11\">Action by L. &amp; M.

The motion therefore presented the ordinary case of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>a person who asks leave to set up in a supplemental answer what seems to be a complete defense to the action, which has come into existence since the original answer was served. In such cases, when the motion for leave to serve a supplemental answer is granted, it is usual and proper to impose terms; and that should always be done, unless, perhaps, some especial reasons are made to appear to the contrary. There are no such reasons in this case, and, therefore, while it was not improper to grant the motion, even in view of the very considerable delay in making it, it should not have been granted without terms;, and the order is therefore modified by requiring, as a \u2022condition for the granting of the leave to serve a supplemental answer, that he should pay all the costs of the action, including the \u25a0costs of entering judgment upon the default, and that, if the plaintiff desires to discontinue the action as to Charles 'Casper, he should be permitted to do so without costs, and as so modified the order should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
