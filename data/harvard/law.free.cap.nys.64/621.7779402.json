Immediately after, the defendant made a motion to open the default and to set aside the judgment, and for leave to answer. Upon that motion an order was entered opening the default, setting aside the judgment, and allowing the defendant to answer within 20 days from the entry of the order, upon payment of $10 costs. The plaintiffs appealed, not from the order, but from so much of the order as refuses to allow the judgment entered in the creditors\u2019 action brought thereon to stand as security. We think no question is presented upon this appeal. There is nothing in the order which refuses to allow the judgment to stand as security, nor does it appear that any application for such a provision was made. The plaintiffs have not seen fit to appeal from the order setting aside the judgment and opening the default. The determination as to the terms imposed by the court as a condition, for opening the default could only be reviewed by a direct appeal from the order which imposed them, and such an appeal has not been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
