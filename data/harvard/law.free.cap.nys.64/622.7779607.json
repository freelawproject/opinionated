The affidavit upon which the motion was based specified such fact, and certain questions and answers which form a part of the deposition were set out, and form a part of this record. No affidavits were read in opposition. The court denied the motion, and made an order that all questions as to the sufficiency, responsiveness, or relevancy of the plaintiff\u2019s answers on cross-examination under said commission \u201cbe, and are hereby, reserved to be disposed of on the trial of the issues in this action.\u201d It is therefore apparent that the defendant did not obtain the relief for which he moved, and the plaintiff is presently unable to tell whether he has a commission or not. The motion to re-execute is properly made before trial, and questions relating thereto are not permitted to be raised at the trial. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 910; Bank v. Reichmann, 9 App. Div. 596, 41 N. Y. Supp. 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">By the reservations made in the order, it is impossible to say whether the court will suppress the commission, or whether it will strike out the part of which complaint is made, or whether it will permit the deposition to stand, and to be read as it stands. The plaintiff is entitled to know before the trial whether he is to have the benefit of his\" commission or not, and, as this order leaves this matter in an uncertain state upon this point, it should be reversed, with f 10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
