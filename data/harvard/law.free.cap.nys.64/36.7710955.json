The answer is a general denial. The plaintiff testified that at his office, in the spring of 1897,\u2014in April or May,\u2014 an agreement was made between the parties litigant, by the terms of which he was to procure a loan of $15,000 upon the defendant\u2019s real property, and, when procured, the latter was to pay him a commission of 1 per cent, upon the amount of such loan. The defendant denied that he ever met the plaintiff at the latter\u2019s office, and that he made such an agreement. As to several other material matters there was a conflict of testimony. At the close of the entire case the plaintiff moved for a direction of a verdict by the jury in his favor, which motion was granted, and the defendant took an exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-17\">As the defendant did not, when the proofs were all in, move for a nonsuit, or do any other act from which a waiver of the right to go to the jury may be implied, the exception so noted by him is sufficient to require a reversal of the judgment, if there was any evidence tending to establish any material fact in his favor, which, if found by the jury, might have changed the result; and it was not necessary for the defendant, in order to preserve such right, to go further, and request that any fact be submitted to the jury. Haines v. Railroad Co., 145 N. Y. 235, 237, 39 N. E. 949; Baylies, Tr. Prac. (2d Ed.) 323. As we have noted, there was a conflict of testimony upon material questions of fact, which should have been submitted to the jury for their determination, and under these circumstances the direction of a verdict was not justified. Schillinger v. McGarry, 25 Misc. Rep. 745, 749, 55 N. Y. Supp. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-18\">The defendant\u2019s contention that during the course of the trial the trial justice admitted testimony against his objection and exception, and, upon the plaintiff\u2019s objection, excluded testimony of the same character and equal relevancy when offered by the defendant, seems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>to be well founded; and this, likewise, is good ground for reversal. Sentenne v. Kelly, 59 Hun, 512, 517, 13 N. Y. Supp. 529. It results from these views that the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
