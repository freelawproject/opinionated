Proc. \u00a7 1216, provides that where other than personal service is had on a defendant, and judgm\u00e9nt is taken by default, the court must require proof of the cause of action set forth in the complaint. <em>Held, </em>that where, after substituted service, judgment was taken by default, and defendant moved to vacate the judgment on the ground that the court did not take proofs, but his affidavit in support of the motion did not state that no proofs were taken, the motion was properly denied.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b157-11\">2.

The defendant, assailing the judgment on the ground of an alleged irregularity, was required to affirmatively establish it by affidavit. The absence of the proof from the judgment roll does not aid the defendant\u2019s contention, because the proof, taken either on a default or on a trial of issues, never forms part of the judgment roll. Nothing appearing to the contrary, we are to assume that the court below performed its duty, and took the necessary proof to establish the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
