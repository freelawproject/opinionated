A team belonging to the defendant, and in charge of its servant, ivas left standing, without hitching, in front of a hardware store a few doors up the street. The team became frightened and started to run. Immediately in the pathway of the advancing team a child was playing in the street; and the plaintiff, in a laudable ambition to save the child from injury, ran out into the highway, secured a hold upon the reins, and succeeded in stopping the team, though not until he had been dragged under the feet of the horses, sustaining the injuries of which he here complains. Upon the trial the facts necessary to establish the cause of action for negligence on the part of the defendant were established by the plaintiff, and the court rendered a decision, upon which judgment was entered for $200 damages, with costs and allowances. From the judgment entered, appeal comes to this court; the defendant alleging error in the admission of evidence as to the character of the injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s physician, who was shown to have been in practice for about 30 years, was asked: \u201cHow, doctor, from your experience as a physician and surgeon, can you state whether the injuries sustained at that time, and discovered by you, may be permanent in their nature?\u201d This question was objected to \u201cas improper in form and incompetent; and, further, on the ground that the witness has not been shown competent to express an opinion; and, further, upon the ground that the hypothesis is-.not sustained by the evidence.\u201d The court overruled the objection, and the doctor answered: \u201cThey may be permanent; yes.\u201d He was then asked: \u201cIn what way? (Same objections and ruling.) A. Well, the knee joint, when once injured quite severely, is liable to chronic inflammation from subsequent slighter injuries.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel moved to strike this answer out'as incompetent, and upon, the ground that the proper foundation had not been laid for it; but the court admitted the answer, and the defendant took an exception. We are quite clear in the opinion that these answers constitute reversible error, under the rule laid down by the court in Strohm v. Railroad Co., 96 N. Y. 305, and followed since that time. \u201cConsequences which are contingent, speculative, or merely possible,\u201d say the court in a leading case, \u201care not proper to be considered in ascertaining the damages. It is not enough that the injuries received may develop into more serious conditions than those which are visible at the time of the injury, nor even that they are likely to so develop. To entitle a plaintiff to recover present damages for apprehended future consequences, there must be such a degree of probability of their occurring as amounts to a reasonable certainty that they will result from the original injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
