For about four months prior to the shooting, Buck had been acting as a night watchman for the firm of Young &amp; Metzner, whose bagging works were situated on \"Vernon avenue, between Harris avenue and Bodine street. The object of the present action is to hold the members of this firm civilly responsible for the atrocious crime which Buck committed in wantonly killing the Grimes boy. The learned judge before whom the case was tried dismissed the complaint at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, and the plaintiff has appealed to this court, insisting that he was improperly nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">It appears that Buck had succeeded a man named Loew as night watchman for the defendants. A pistol had been furnished to Loew by the defendants, one of whom had cautioned him to use it simply for self-defense, and then to shoot in the air and frighten away anybody. When Buck took Loew\u2019s place, Loew gave him the revolver, \u201cand told him that if ever there was any danger, that if the property was in danger, or if he was in danger, he was to shoot in the air.\u201d According to Loew\u2019s testimony, he gave this instruction to Buck by the express direction of Mr. Metzner, one of the defendants. Taking all the evidence on this subject together, we have the case of a watchman armed with a revolver by his employers, and authorized by them to fire with it into the air in order to frighten away intruders, for purposes of self-defense, or to protect the property which he was employed to watch. If, under these circumstances, it appeared that the watchman, either to defend himself or to protect the property of his employers, had fired at a person and killed him, instead of firing into the air according to the direction of his employer, it might very well be that the master would be responsible for the wrongful act of the servant. Such a question of liability would be presented if Buck had shot Grimes while Buck was on duty acting as a watchman for the defendants, and was engaged in an endeavor to shield their property or his own person from some attack on the part of the lad. If he had aimed at Grimes and fired and killed him under such circumstances, although in disregard of the defendants\u2019 directions to fire in the air, his employers might be chargeable with his act under the well-established doctrine that the master may be held responsible for the acts of the servant within the general scope of his employment while engaged in the master\u2019s business, even though the servant\u2019s act be negligent, wanton, or willful. Mott v. Ice Co., 73 N. Y. 543; Ochsenbein v. Shapley, 85 N. Y. 214; Burns v. Railroad Co., 4 App. Div. 426, 38 N. Y. Supp. 856; Higgins v. Turnpike Co., 46 N. Y. 23. The wantonness or willfulness of an assault makes no difference if the act was done in the scope of the master\u2019s employment. Meehan v. Morewood, 52 Hun, 566, 5 N. Y. Supp. 710, affirmed in 126 N. Y. 667, 27 N. E. 854. \u201cBut if a servant goes outside of his employment, and without regard to his service, acting maliciously, or in order to effect some purpose of his own, wantonly commits a trespass, or causes damage to another, the master is not responsible.\u201d Mott v. Ice Co., supra. It seems to us that the facts of the present case bring it within the rule thus stated. It is not clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>evidence that when Buck fired the fatal shot he had gone on duty for the night as the defendants\u2019 watchman; but, whether he had or not, it is manifest that his assault upon Grimes was an act wholly outside the scope of his employment, and having no connection whatever therewith. The Grimes boy was not upon the premises of the defendants, nor had he made any attempt to trespass upon their property, or interfere therewith. He had been bathing in the river with a number of companions, and after leaving the water, and while standing upon the public wharf, was shot down by Buck without the slightest provocation. Indeed, the testimony of one of the witnesses is to the effect that Buck was unarmed when he first saw the boy, and went away to get the revolver with which he subsequently did the shooting. It is difficult to find language strong enough to justly characterize Buck\u2019s conduct, but it would be unwarrantably extending the doctrine of a master\u2019s liability for the acts of his servant to hold that Buck\u2019s employers were in any wise responsible for his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The nonsuit was right, and the judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
