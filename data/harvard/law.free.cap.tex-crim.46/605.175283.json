Defendant agreed to do so and told witness to return next day for it. He stated next day that orders from Mineral Wells were coming in too slow and that he ordered the alcohol from Port Worth, and that it had not yet arrived. Soon thereafter, upon witness\u2019 return to defendant, on the same day, he handed witness a quart of alcohol, and she and her companion proceeded to drink some of it. Defendant is a barber; he was given <em>25 </em>cents for his trouble. The constable testified for the State that defendant told him that he ordered the alcohol through a stranger who had stayed* all night with him and to whom he gave the money and told him to get the alcohol from Mineral Wells, where the stranger said he was going. Defendant told this witness that he had never heard of the stranger before, did not know his name, gave him no money to pay his railroad fare to Mineral Wells; the stranger had no money; was broke, left his bundle in defendant\u2019s barber shop while he was gone to Mineral Wells, and that he had never heard of him since, after he brought back the alcohol.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b625-19\">By the express agent the State proved that no shipment of alcohol had been made to defendant at the time in question.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b625-20\"><em>R.

He cites us to Trimble v. State, 16 Texas Crim. App., 115. This was a robbery case, and was not reversed on the ground of any such omission as contained in this information, but because no direct averments of the essential elements of the alleged offense were used in the indictment. The State contends that the word' \u201cunlawfully\u201d is not used in the statute, and that the information is sufficient in this respect if it follows the language of the statute. Mr. Bishop, in his work on Criminal Law, volume 1, sec. 503, says: \u201cIt is not necessary to use the word unlawfully, where the statute defining the offense does not use it.\u201d And see 2 Bishop Crim. Proc., secs. 58, 290, 292. As stated, our statute makes certain acts a violation of the local option law: any sale of intoxicating liquors, where local option is in force, except for medicinal and sacramental purposes, is unlawful. Our Constitution does not in terms exempt such sales, but it has been construed to exempt sales above referred to. These sales are matters of defense, and must be proved by defendant. We hold that it is not necessary that the information or indictment for selling intoxicating liquors in a local option territory, to allege it was'unlawfully done.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">We have examined the record, and in our opinion the testimony is sufficient to support the verdict. The testimony for the State excludes the theory of any agency on the part of the alleged seller for the prosecutor; and it also excludes a sending by express. The account or explanation given by appellant of sending for the whisky by a stranger who was going to Mineral Wells is too absurd for serious consideration. The charges given were sufficient and adequately presented both the State\u2019s and appellant\u2019s theories, and the requested charges were properly refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Appellant\u2019s own affidavits do not make out misconduct on the part of the jury; and the affidavits on the part of the State explain the alleged misconduct satisfactorily. The custom of jurors making affidavits in impeachment of their verdicts is not to be encouraged; and even if the affidavit of the recalcitrant juror had sufficiently made the issue, his statement was overwhelmingly contradicted by the counter affidavits of the other members of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">There being no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
