We find neither statement of facts nor bill of exceptions in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">Appellant moved to quash the indictment on account of the misspelling of \u201cGuadalupe County.\u201d In one place the county is spelled \u201cGuadalupu,\u201d using the final letter \u201cu\u201d instead of \u201ce.\u201d We think this objection is hypercritical. Furthermore the names as spelled are idem sonans. Reys v. State, 8 Texas Ct. Rep., 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-19\">Appellant further insists that the indictment fails to allege venue. The indictment alleges that appellant did \u201cfraudulently break and enter a house then and there owned and occupied by one Theo. Wagner,\u201d etc. We think this is a sufficient allegation of venue, having stated that the county was Guadalupe in the previous portion of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-20\">Appellant further insists that the verdict of the jury is not intelligible. The verdict is as follows: \u201cWe the jury find the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment assess his punishment in the penitentiary for two years.\u201d While the original verdict is badly written, it is intelligible, and the intent of the jury is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-21\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-22\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
