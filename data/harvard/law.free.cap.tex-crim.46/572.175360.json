The indictment is attacked because it begins, \u201cIn the name and the authority of the State of Texas,\u201d the word \u201cby\u201d being omitted and \u201cthe\u201d inserted, whereas the constitutional requirement is that it shall begin \u201cIn the name and by the authority of the State of Texas.\u201d This objection is well taken. The question has been so often decided we deem it unnecessary to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>into a further discussion of it. Saine v. State, 14 Texas Crim. App., 144; Jefferson v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App.. 535; Owens v. State, 25 Texas Crim. App., 552; Thompson v. State, 15 Texas Crim. App., 39; Thompson v. State, 15 Texas Crim.

The judgment is reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
