The State by way of rebuttal showed counterwise that the reputation of prosecutrix for chastity was good.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b516-14\"><em>R. B.

In such case it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to the legal definition of the terms, so that they may be fully informed as to the essential ingredients of the offense charged in the indictment, and intelligently apply the facts to the case in hand. Especially is it material and' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>prejudicial error to refuse a special charge interpreting the meaning of these necessary terms in this kind of case, when, if their true legal definition and significance is understood, the defendant may he completely exonerated as provided by statute, or his punishment at least mitigated.

Appellant tendered to the court the following special instruction: \u201cThe jury are further charged as part of the law of this case, that the indictment charges that defendant falsely and maliciously and falsely and wantonly did impute to Mrs. B. P. Henderson a want of chastity, etc., by the use of the words uttered of and concerning said Mrs. B. P. Henderson alleged in the indictment. In order to convict defendant of the charge alleged in the indictment, you must believe from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the alleged false words charged in the indicement were uttered as alleged, by defendant, but the State must further show by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that said words so alleged were .uttered by defendant maliciously or wantonly. By the expression and word maliciously, is meant that said words must have been so uttered as to imply by defendant an evil intent or legal malice, or without reasonable grounds for believing that the words uttered were true, and without reasonable ground for believing that the witness Mrs. B. P. Henderson had a bad reputation for virtue and chastity, or was an unchaste woman; and defendant must believe her reputation to be bad or that she was unchaste. By the expression wantonly, as used in the indictment in this case is meant, that the words charged to have been uttered by defendant must have been uttered regardless of the consequences, in a rckless manner, or under such circumstances as evinced a wicked and mischievous intent and without excuse.\u201d We think the court should have given this charge to the jury, since it is a part of the statutory definition of slander.
