Said indictment appears to have been filed in 'said district court on the 10th day of December, 1903. According to the two transcripts of the order of said 'district court, transferring said cause to the County Court of Zavala County, filed in the latter court on the 11th and 29th days of December, 1903, respectively, said orders of transfer being in evidence before the county court upon the presentation of the above motion, the District Court of Zavala County adjourned on the 10th day of December, A. D. 1903, for the term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-20\">The witness W. T. Childress, district clerk of Zavala County, admits in his testimony, adduced before the county court upon presentation of the aforesaid motion, that at the time of the adjournment of said district court the minutes of the proceedings of said court did not show any presentment of the indictment against the defendant in this case i by a quorum of the grand jury of Zavala County in open court, but on the other hand admits in his said testimony that he entered the fact of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>presentment of said indictment after the 10th day of December, 1903, to wit, after the day upon which said court adjourned for the term. The minutes of the proceedings of the District Court of Zavala County, the court in which the indictment in this case appears to have been persented, said minutes also adduced as evidence before the court on presentation of defendant\u2019s motion, show that the entry of the presentment of said indictment was not made in regular order on said minutes, but appears upon the margin of said record, and, though dated December 10, the district clerk admits, in his testimony above cited, that said marginal entry was not made until after, adjournment of the term of the district court\u2014after the district judge had signed said minutes and left the town and county. And no order authorizing an amendment of said record appears anywhere upon the minutes of the proceedings of the district court.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-6\"><em>Geo.

This prosecution was on an indictment transfered from the District Court of Zavala County to the county court, the indictment being for an aggravated assault. Appellant made a motion to quash and dismiss the case in the county court because, as he alleged, the indictment was not regularly presented in the district court; that no order was entered during the term of said district court showing the presentation of said indictment therein. The evidence elicited on this subject shows that' the district court adjourned on December 10th, and on some account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the minutes showing the presentation of said indictment in the district court were not entered during the term, but after the adjournment of the term. Said order was entered on the margin of said minutes, to wit: \u201cDecember 10, this day the grand jury came into open, court, a quorum thereof being present, and presented to the court through their foreman, the following indictment, to wit:\u201d Then follows the file number of the indictment, with the name of appellant and the offense. The court overruled the motion to dismiss. Appellant reserved an exception and assigns this action of the court as error. Article 433 Code or Criminal Procedure, requires indictments found by the grand jury to be presented in open court. Article 434 requires the fact of a presentation of indictment in open court by a grand jury to be entered upon the minutes of the proceedings of the court. It has been held that this requirement of the law must be complied with. See authorities cited in sec. 330, White\u2019s Ann. Code Crim. Proc. However, an objection to the failure to make this entry must be made in limine; that lg, before or at the trial of the case. See authorities cited in sub. 4 sec. 330, White\u2019s Ann. Code Crim. Proc. The record may be amended as to such omission by order nunc pro tune even at a subsequent term. Sec. 330, subdiv. 5, supra. In this case it appears that motion was made at the earliest opportunity; that is, after the case was transferred to the county court when it was called for trial. We hold that the motion to dismiss should have been granted, and the case returned* to the district court, when, at the succeeding term, the minutes might have been amended. Hardy v. State, 1 Texas Crim. App., 556; Walker v. State, 7 Texas Crim. App., 52; Swing v. Perry, 35 Texas, 778; Ex parte Ellis, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 539. The cases cited show that the order of presentment must be made and entered of record in the minutes of the district court. Of course, this apprehends that said order must be entered during the term and not after the term. Article-1120, Revised Civil Statutes, requires that all the proceedings of the district court shall be read and corrected, and then signed in open court by the judge. This clearly cuts off an entry by the. clerk or signing by the judge after the adjournment of the court; and as we understand no judge is authorized to have his minutes made up after the adjournment of the court, nor is he authorized to sign the minutes leaving a space to be filled in by the clerk after court has actually adjourned. To authorize such a proceeding would be exceedingly unsafe and would inevitably open the door to confusion and fraud, as to the orders of ther court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">For the error of the court overruling the motion, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\"><em>Reversed and </em>remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
