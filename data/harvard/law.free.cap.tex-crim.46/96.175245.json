We rode up and Hodges hallooed \u2018Hello!\u2019 and defendant came to the door. Hodges told him to come out, that he wanted to see him a minute, and the defendant started out towards us and then stopped, but finally came out to the gate. I introduced the sheriff as Mr. Hodge=, and Hodges then said, \u2018We came to inquire of you about a beef that has been killed up in the pasture and thought you could give us some information.\u2019 Defendant said that he did not know whether he knew anything about it. Hodges then said, \u2018We have tracked a wagon from where the beef was killed, here in the sand hills, to your place, and wo thought that you could tell us something about it.\u2019 Defendant then said, \u2018I killed that cow; who has lost one?\u2019 Hodges answered th\u00e1t Mr. Simpson had. Defendant said, 'Ev God, Simpson, I don\u2019t want you coming around here accusing me; I did not kill your damn cow; I did kill that cow up in the sand hills, but it was my father\u2019s cow, if you. must Imow, and was branded Bain.\u2019 Defendant during this conversation stood in the gate and held to the wire that connected the two gate posts at the top\"; his hands and knees were trembling, and he looked pale and showed to be excited. Hodges then asked defendant if he had the hide of the cow that he had killed, and he said he had a part of it. He then showed us a portion of the hide that he had staked down in the back yard. This portion of the hide was from the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>side of the cow; the branded side was gone; the ears were gone. I spread the hide and stood on it and examined it, and told defendant it was a portion of my cow\u2019s hide. Defendant hung his head, and said, \u2018You are mistaken, Simpson; it is not your cow\u2019s hide,\u2019 and commenced to curse and abuse me. Hodges then asked defendant what he had done with the balance of the hide. Defendant answered that .he had bottomed chairs with it. Hodges then asked him where were the chairs that he had bottomed. Then he said, TBy God, I did not say that I had bottomed chairs with it, but that I had cut it up to bottom chairs with.\u2019 Hodges then told the defendant to let us see the strips and he said he had used the strips up, and Hodges then asked for the head. Defendant said it was in the hog pen, which was under the crib, and we went to the crib and found the head, and when I saw and examined it I said, \u2018Mr. Bain, that is my cow\u2019s head, and if I have to be shot for it I would have to swear to it.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">This testimony was substantially corroborated by Hodges, the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">Defendant tried to show by several witnesses that the animal he killed was one of the animals his father gave him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">As to the arrest the sheriff testified that after the defendant had made the above statement to him and Simpson, he told defendant that he would have to go to town with him, warning him that anything he might say would be used against him, and defendant said no more about the ease. Up to that time the sheriff stated he had not arrested the defendant, but had gone there intending to arrest him if Simpson identified the head and hide as that of his cow. Other essential facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-8\">6r. <em>B.

This is the second appeal. See 7 Texas Ct. Rep., 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Appellant complains of the refusal of the court to exclude the testimony of B. W. Simpson and J. H. Hodges. The testimony of these witnesses as disclosed in this record is substantially the same as stated in the original opinion on the first appeal of this case. Appellant urges the same objections here. In the former appeal we held tills testimony was admissible because it did not show appellant was under arrest. Through inadvertence in writing the former opinion we placed in juxtaposition to the statement of the conversation that occurred between the sheriff and Simpson and appellant this statement: \u201cAppellant stated that when he started on the call of the sheriff from the house to the gate, he thought the sheriff had come to arrest him on account of a difficulty, or as he terms it, a \u2018feud/ that had occurred at his house a few days previously, as he had been threatened with arrest on this account, thus excluding the idea that he was anticipating any trouble with reference to the cow. He attributes his excitement to fear of arrest for the difficulty.\u201d This statement should not have been coupled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the witnesses and appellant; and we did not intend to be understood as holding, as appellant\u2019s counsel now insist, that the fact that appellant apprehended arrest for another offense, than the one he is now being prosecuted for, would authorize the introduction of the testimony; but what we intended to hold was that the facts as disclosed by with the recital of the facts leading up to the conversation between the bill of exceptions did not show that appellant was under arrest, or thought himself under arrest, at the time of the conversation detailed by said witnesses. In placing the statement as above, we were merely stating appellant\u2019s insistence. If he was anticipating arrest for another and different offense than the one he was arrested for, this per se would not preclude the conclusion that he was under arrest at me time of the conversation detailed by the witneses. If he was under arrest, or thought or believed he was under arrest, under the authorities, the statement would not be admissible. But the facts preclude either of these conclusions, and show he was not only not under arrest, but that he \u25a0did not think he was under arrest. In Connell v. State, 75 S. W. Rep., \u2014, 45 Texas Crim. Rep., 142, we held that the appellant in that case was not under arrest, under circumstances much like those now under consideration. Mere purpose on the part of an officer to arrest a party, where the purpose has not been carried into effect by an actual arrest, will not render the confession made by the party to the officer incompetent or inadmissible as evidence. Or where the evidence clearly shows, as it does in this case, that appellant did not think himself under arrest, the statement would be admissible. Holmes.v. State, 32 Texas Crim. App., 361. Accordingly we hold the testimony of these witnesses was admissible, and the court did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Appellant also insists in the above bills that the court erred in permitting Hodges and Simpson to testify that, at the time they approached the house and begun the conversation with defendant, defendant held to the wire over the gate, and was trembling badty, and seemed that he was about to fall; his knees were trembling and shaking, scarcely able to stand, and he turned very pale. Appellant objects to this portion of the statement on the ground that it is a conclusion of the witnesses. We take it that this is a short-hand rendering of the facts, and was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Appellant insists that the court erred in refusing the following special charges, to wit: \u201cThe court charges the jury, if they believe from the evidence that defendant was under arrest, or thought himself to be under arrest by sheriff Hodges, when Hodges and Simpson went to his house and had the conversation with defendant as testified by them, you will disregard and not consider any statement made by defendant to them which appears in evidence.\u201d It follows from what has been said above that it was not error to refuse this charge, since the evidence dearly shows appellant was not under arrest; nor does the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>raise any issue on this question. The facts show conclusively that appellant was not under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\">And the court also refused this instruction: \u201cThe jury will not consider as evidence showing defendant\u2019s guilt as to the animal alleged, any testimony as to defendant\u2019s killing any other animal; but such testimony will only be considered by you for the purpose for which it was introduced, i. e., as bearing or not on the question of the intent of defendant with which he killed the animal in question; and you will consider it for no other purpose.\u201d There was no error in the refusal of this charge. The court properly presented appellant\u2019s defense, if the animal in question was the animal appellant claimed, to wit, <em>the </em>Bain cow, or if they had a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the Bain cow to acquit appellant. This was as favorable to appellant as he could ask-</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Appellant also objects to the form of the verdict of the jury, which is as follows: \u201cWe the jewors fined the defindet guilty and assess his penish in the Penerty for two year. Steve. Daffern, Foreman.\u201d It has been held that bad spelling will not vitiate the verdict of the jury. The verdict, in our opinion, when construed in the light of the record, is readily comprehended and understood. It would not mean otherwise than that the jury found defendant guilty and assessed his punishment at two years confinement in the State penitentiary. As appellant insists, words in the verdict are misspelled; but the clear legal intendment and purpose is made manifest. McGee v. State, 45 S. W. Rep., 709. The proper judgment was entered, confining appellant in the penitentiary for a term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Ho error appearing in the record requiring a reversal, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
