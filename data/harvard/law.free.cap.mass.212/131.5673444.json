The defendant filed an answer and a final decree was entered by order of <em>Jenney, </em>J., overruling the demurrer, and ordering the defendant, upon tender to her of the sum of $1,000 by the plaintiff, to execute a release of all her interest in the real estate of her late husband, John Collins.

The bill of complaint alleges that the plaintiff, who is the sole heir of the deceased husband, has duly tendered this money and is ready and willing to pay it to the defendant, but that she refuses to release her interest in the estate. The contract is a lawful one and will be enforced in equity. <em>Paine </em>v. <em>Hollister, </em>139 Mass. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">The provisions of R. L. c. 153, \u00a7 26, relied upon in the defendant\u2019s demurrer, apply only to antenuptial contracts enabling the respective parties to hold their separate property after marriage, and do not affect an antenuptial agreement relating only to the rights which a widow may claim in the estate of her deceased husband. So far as the bill discloses, the defendant, had no separate property. Even assuming that the statute may apply to the agreement in question, it does not affect her obligation to release <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>all interest in the estate of her late husband; and the demurrer was rightly overruled. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>109 Mass. 261. <em>Freeland </em>v. <em>Freeland, </em>128 Mass. 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
