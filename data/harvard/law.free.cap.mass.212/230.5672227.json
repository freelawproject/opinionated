The memorandum concluded as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">\u201cOn the foregoing facts, I rule that this action cannot be maintained, and sustain the answer in abatement and order judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">\u201cI am somewhat in doubt as to whether the matters set forth in said answer are properly matters in abatement, but inasmuch as the parties have been fully heard and have introduced such evidence as they desired as to all matters involved in the action, I have made the order as indicated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-8\">The plaintiffs filed the following statement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-9\">\u201cNow come the plaintiffs in the above entitled cause and appeal from said court to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County, for deciding the issues raised by the defendant\u2019s answer in abatement for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-10\">The case, was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-11\"><em>S.

If dissatisfied with the ruling sustaining the defendant\u2019s answer in abatement they should have excepted. No judgment having been entered there is no question of law apparent upon the record for this court to decide and the appeal must be dismissed. R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 96.
