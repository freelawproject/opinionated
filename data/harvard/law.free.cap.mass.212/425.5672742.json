Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated July 6, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Bell, </em>J., without a jury. The facts in favor of the plaintiff which could have been found upon the evidence are stated in the opinion. The defendants asked the judge to make the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">\u201c1. That the sale set forth and contained in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration was a sale of merchandise without representation, and was not a sale by sample.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>That the plaintiff, at the time of purchase, had a full opportunity to and did inspect the goods prior to delivery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-8\">\u201c3. That the defendants saw the bags while being filled, and had a full opportunity to ascertain the contents, and that the defendants did so ascertain the contents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-9\">\u201c4. That the delivery was made at the defendants\u2019 place of business, and an acceptance of said goods in law was made at the same place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-10\">\u201c5. That the plaintiff did not inspect shipments within, a reasonable length of time after date of delivery. Therefore he must be presumed in law to have accepted such property as was delivered in satisfaction of the order placed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-11\">\u201c6 If it shall be established that the defendants made the promise complained of, such promise or agreement was -without consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-12\">\u201c7. That at the time the plaintiff alleges the promise or agreement was made with him by the defendants, there was no obligation of the defendants to make such promise, and the plaintiff had no claim on said defendants in force at law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-13\">\u201c8. If there was any liability from the defendants to the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tiffs, such liability was waived and accord and satisfaction entered into between the plaintiff and the defendants at the time when the defendants sold to the plaintiff at a reduced price the cotton, which the plaintiff furnished to \u2018sweeten' the goods already shipped.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\">The judge refused to make any of these rulings. He found for the plaintiff in the sum of $231.31; \"and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-6\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-7\"><em>J.

And there would be a breach of the implied warranty, entitling the plaintiff to rescind upon reasonable notice to the defendants if the four shipments in question fell below the quality bought, or he might retain the cotton and recover damages. <em>Whitmore </em>v. <em>South Boston Iron Co. </em>2 Allen, 52. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>101 Mass. 134. <em>Gilmore </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>162 Mass. 351, 352. <em>Fullam </em>v. <em>Wright &amp; Colton Wire Cloth Co. </em>196 Mass. 474, 476. <em>Procter </em>v. <em>Atlantic Fish Co. </em>208 Mass. 351, 354. St. 1908, c. 237, \u00a7\u00a7 14, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The sample must be deemed to have been one of the essential terms of sale, and, although the plaintiff availed himself of the opportunity for inspection before the shipments to his consignee, the cotton had been bagged by the defendants, and he testified, that during the customary examination<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> he rejected such portions as he observed to be defective, but the bags were not emptied, and the remainder was expected to be in conformity with the sample. It was a question of fact independently of the place of delivery, whether the plaintiff waived the warranty, and accepted the contents of the bags, and whether after arrival at the place of business of the consignee the cotton upon assortment proved to be of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>inferior quality. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>111 Mass. 363. <em>Androvette </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>207 Mass. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence, if believed, having supported his contention, that there had been a breach, and that he had not relinquished his right to insist upon performance of the contract, these issues of fact, as well as the further issue whether after receiving information from the consignee he seasonably inspected the cotton, and gave notice to the defendants of the deficiency, with his claim for reclamation, ar\u00e9 settled conclusively in his favor by the judge\u2019s finding. <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Lally, </em>130 Mass. 485. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89. <em>Androvette </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>207 Mass. 86, 90. St. 1908, c. 237, \u00a7 49. The first, second, third, fourth and fifth rulings could not have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">It follows that there was a valuable consideration for the alleged' .promise of the defendants to reimburse the plaintiff for the difference between the price paid and the price obtained at the resale, which according to his evidence he made at their request. <em>Blount </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>199 Mass. 330. The testimony is conflicting as to the existence of such an agreement, but the judge, as shown by his findings, must have accepted the plaintiff\u2019s statements as controlling, and the sixth and seventh requests became inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The defense of accord and satisfaction is not raised by the answer. Grinnell <em>v. Spink, </em>128 Mass. 25. But apart from any question of pleading the plaintiff denied that his purchase, after the defendants\u2019 failure to perform, of certain additional cotton of higher grade was in settlement and adjustment of his demand for damages, and the judge, not having been bound to accept the testimony of the defendants to the contrary, rightly refused to give their eighth request.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The exceptions to the admission of evidence not having been argued must be treated as waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-11\"> The plaintiff testified that he cut open such bags as he selected for the purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
