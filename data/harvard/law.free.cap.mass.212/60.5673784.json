Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated October 22,1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-13\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was heard by <em>Crosby, </em>J., without a jury, upon an agreed statement of facts, from which the following facts appeared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-14\">The plaintiff was born on October 27, 1889. On August 16, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>1909, he gave to the defendants an order to purchase for him ten shares of a certain corporate stock and paid to them for that purpose $868.75, and the defendants on the same day purchased the shares for the plaintiff from certain other brokers in the open market for the designated sum, and upon receipt of the stock certificates placed them in a private envelope marked with the plaintiff\u2019s name, separate and apart from their own securities, and held them at his disposal. Subsequently the shares were sold by the defendants for the plaintiff upon his order at a slight profit, and, with the proceeds thereof and some further cash provided by the plaintiff, the defendants purchased for him in the same manner twenty shares of another corporate stock. There were several further transactions of purchase and sale, all conducted in the same manner and during the plaintiff\u2019s minority. The plaintiff from time to time drew from his account with the defendants various sums in cash, aggregating $397.40, the account finally being closed on October 20, 1910, upon which date he received from the defendants a check for $171.25. The net result of the transactions was a loss to the plaintiff of $471.35.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">On October 22, 1910, Sophia Benson, the plaintiff\u2019s mother, was appointed his temporary guardian and on the same day she demanded from the defendants in the name of the plaintiff the return of $471.35.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">The defendants asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-7\">\"1. Relations between the defendants and Alfred S. Benson were those of principal and agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-8\">\u201c2. The facts disclosed an executed agency which cannot be avoided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-9\">\u201c3. The facts disclosed payment by an infant\u2019s direction which cannot be avoided after the infant becomes of age.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-10\">The judge refused the rulings and found for the plaintiff in the full amount claimed with interest. The defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-11\"><em>L. A. Ford, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-12\"><em>A. L.

Co. </em>184 Mass. 348. The defense is, that the plaintiffs money which he advanced with the first order having been invested as he directed, and his subsequent orders having been duly executed he cannot rescind. If in <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Judd, </em>1 Gray, 455, and <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>103 Mass. 562, it was held, that an executed contract beneficial to the minor could not be rescinded unless he restored the consideration, the plaintiff did not receive any of the shares of stock which the defendants purchased for him, and no inference can be drawn, that after his incapacity had been removed he intended to ratify the acts of his agents. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Soper, </em>6 Gray, 279, 283. <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>118 Mass. 495. The money received from the defendants as the net result of all the purchases and sales, never equalled the amount of the first advancement. A substantial loss resulted, and neither as matter of fact nor as matter of law has the plaintiff been benefited. <em>White </em>v. <em>New Bedford Cotton Waste Co. </em>178 Mass. 20, 24. The law because of his minority confers upon him the unqualified right to disaffirm the agreement, and the judgment of the Superior Court should be affirmed. <em>Dub\u00e9 </em>v. <em>Beaudry, </em>150 Mass. 448. <em>Gillis </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>180 Mass. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
