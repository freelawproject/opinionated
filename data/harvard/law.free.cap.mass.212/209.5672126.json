The defendant appealed to the Superior Court. The appeal was entered on July 3,1911, and on the same day the defendant filed a motion for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty. The motion was accompanied by affidavits of the defendant and of his counsel. On July 10, 1911, the defendant filed a claim for a trial by jury. On October 30, 1911, the defendant\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty was denied by <em>Sanderson, </em>J., who filed a memorandum of his decision as follows: \u201cThe-defendant, in response to a statement of the court that the court was ready to hear testimony in support of his motion, if he had any to offer, stated that he would not call any witness, but that he would rely entirely upon the affidavit annexed to the motion. This motion is denied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-14\">The defendant appealed from the order denying the motion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>W.

It was incumbent on the defendant, if required, to offer evidence to support the request; but at the hearing, and in response to a statement by the presiding judge that the court would hear testimony if he had any to offer, the defendant stated that he would rely entirely upon the affidavit annexed to the motion. The memorandum and order denying the motion are equivocal. It is not certain whether the denial rested on the ground that the affidavit could not be received as evidence, or whether its recitals were rejected because the judge did not believe them to be true. But while the affidavit is sufficient in form and substance, yet, if treated as testimony, the credibility of the affiant and the truth or falsity of the statements were questions of fact upon which the decision of the judge is final. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89. <em>Deane </em>v. <em>American Glue Co. </em>200 Mass. 459, 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The objection to evidence resting only on <em>ex parte </em>affidavits, when application is made to the court for permission to withdraw an incriminating plea, is that the means of knowledge, or the truth of. the intermediate facts on which the general conclusions are founded, cannot be ascertained. The affiant, especially if he is an interested party, can mould the evidentiary statements in conformity with the exigencies of the case. At the hearing the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence was not in issue, and he could have testified as a witness in his own behalf without being compelled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>to give evidence which could be used against him at the trial of the complaint. R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 20. By his resorting to a statement in writing, even if made under oath, the court was not required to receive in evidence the affidavit, and whichever way was taken no error of law appears. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>13 How. 283. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Flagg, </em>14 Vroom, 495. Wigmore on Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 1384, 1708. See also R. L. c. 175, \u00a7 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
