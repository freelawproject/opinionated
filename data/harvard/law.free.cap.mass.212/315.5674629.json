The employee thereupon was paid at the rate agreed upon for \u201csecond quality \u201d production, which was the alleged offense. The amount by which the employee\u2019s wages were decreased as the result of the classification of the qualities of the cloth was less than the loss to the defendant resulting from the production of \u201c second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>quality\u201d cloth. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had not imposed a \u201cfine\u201d as prohibited by the statute, and that a verdict should have been ordered for him.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b346-4\">St. 1911, c. 584, does not repeal St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7\u00a7 114r-116.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">Complaint, received and sworn to in the Second District Court of Eastern Worcester on December 21, 1911, charging a violation on December 12 of St. 1911, c. 584, in that the defendant, \u201cbeing an employer of labor did impose a fine of seventy-one cents upon Henry Dilling, an adult employee engaged at weaving\u201d in its mills at Clinton \u201cfor imperfections arising during the process of weaving.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">The case was tried before <em>Hall, </em>J., upon an agreed statement of facts substantially as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">During the week ending December 2,1911, Dilling was employed as a weaver of cloth by the defendant and had been so employed for several months. Posted in the weaving room where Dilling worked and forming the basis of compensation for weaving, were placards entitled \u201cPrice List for Weaving,\u201d which stated the price paid to the employees for \u201cfirst quality\u201d and for \u201csecond quality\u201d of various Hnds and sizes of cloth there woven. The price for \u201csecond quality\u201d was in each case one half of the price for \"first quality.\u201d When Dilling was paid for weaving done during the week ending December 2, 1911, it was found by competent inspectors that a certain portion of his work came within the class of work known as second quality, and that the weaver was responsible for such condition. He was paid at the rates named in the posted notice for such work as he had produced of first quality, and for such work as he had produced of second quality. It was not contended that there was any unfairness in the grading of the work or that Dilling was not paid properly on the basis of the posted schedule. Dilling could read and write, and was working with knowledge of the terms of his employment as set forth by the notice and had accepted them. The amount by which the wages were decreased as a result of the classification was less than the loss to the defendant resulting from the production of second quality cloth by the weaver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">The defendant asked the judge to rule, \u201cthat the jury be instructed that on the evidence as presented the defendant as matter of law must be found not guilty\u201d and to\" order a verdict accordingly; \u201d and, \u201cthat the action of the defendant corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>upon, the agreed statement of facts did not constitute a \u2018fine\u2019 within the meaning of the above-named statute.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">The judge refused so to rule and ruled that the acts described were in violation of St. 1911, c. 584, and that a verdict of guilty was warranted.

It is intended to prevent the employer from imposing a penalty for an imperfection in the finished product, whether or not due to the fault of the employee, and enforcing its collection by deducting it from what has become due to the employee. . So construed, as was said by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, ubi supra, </em>on pages 120,121, it could perhaps be sustained as a valid police regulation. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>163 Mass. 589; <em>Squire </em>v. <em>Tellier, </em>185 Mass. 18, 20; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strauss, </em>191 Mass. 545, 550, <em>et </em>seq.; <em>Mutual Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Martell, </em>200 Mass. 482, 484; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>208 Mass. 619. But that question is not presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">In the case at bar, it could at any rate have been found that the weaver had received exactly the wages for which he had contracted. The system adopted by the defendant was within the authority given by St. 1909, c. 514, \u00a7\u00a7 114-116, and it is not contended that any of the requirements of those sections have been violated. The act of 1911 does not purport to repeal any of those provisions, and it is not necessary to construe it as having that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">If the present act did repeal the provisions of St. 1909, c. 514, above referred to, and went to the full extent for which the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>monwealth has contended in this case, it would be difficult, without overruling <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>155 Mass. 117, to maintain its constitutionality.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\">The rulings requested by the defendant should have been given. <em>Gallagher </em>v. <em>Hathaway Manuf. Co. </em>172 Mass. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
