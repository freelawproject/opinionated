There was an entrance leading from the rear room into the corridor, which was used exclusively by the plaintiff\u2019s employees, and an entrance from the corridor into the front room. In the workroom were several garments belonging to customers, on which the plaintiff had no claim for labor or material. The larger part of the furniture in the front room was held by the plaintiff under contracts of conditional sale, but some of the articles, such as pictures and other small article's, belonged to him, as did the tools and implements in the rear room.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-4\">The plaintiff becoming in arrears in the payment of rent, Stone brought an action against him and the writ was given to the defendant for attachment and service. The defendant went to the plaintiff\u2019s place of business and placed a keeper in charge on December 10, 1908. There was evidence that the defendant at once put a lock on the door of the rear room and prevented the plaintiff and his employees from using that door. On December 12, while the defendant still was in possession of the premises under the writ of attachment, Stone took possession of the premises for breach of covenants in the lease and left the defendant in charge of the premises on his behalf, and thereafter the defendant pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>vented the plaintiff from using the premises except that he permitted the removal of tools and implements of trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-3\">Other facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-4\">At the close of the evidence the judge ordered a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-5\"><em>W. Hirsh, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-6\"><em>A. F.

Of the goods of the plaintiff in the rooms occupied by him as a place of business, some were and some were not exempt from attachment. There was nothing to indicate that the defendant interfered with any of the former goods, and it cannot be presumed that he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Upon the testimony of both parties it appeared that the plaintiff voluntarily surrendered his keys to the defendant, and assented to the defendant\u2019s remaining through his keeper in possession of the attached property upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises. Certainly the plaintiff made no request for the removal of the keeper or of the property attached under R. L. c. 167, \u00a7\u00a7 43, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">So far as appears the entry of Stone, the plaintiff\u2019s landlord, to take possession of the premises for non-payment of rent was lawful. <em>Fifty Associates </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>5 Cush. 214. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Middleby, </em>197 Mass. 485, 489. <em>Gunsenhiser </em>v. <em>Binder, </em>206 Mass. 434. There is nothing contrary to this in <em>Desseau </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>187 Mass. 486, or <em>Fifty Associates </em>v. <em>Howland, </em>11 Met. 99, relied on by the plaintiff. The defendant did nothing unlawful or in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s rights in regard to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">The action cannot be maintained on any of these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">But there was evidence that the defendant put a lock on the rear door of the plaintiff\u2019s rooms and prevented the plaintiff and his servants from using that door. If, as might have been found, this was without the plaintiff\u2019s assent, it was a wrongful act and entitled the plaintiff to maintain his action. <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>194 Mass. 317. <em>Morrin </em>v. <em>Manning, </em>205 Mass. 205. It follows that the verdict for the defendant ought not to have been directed, and for this reason alone the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\"><em>Exceptions </em>sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
