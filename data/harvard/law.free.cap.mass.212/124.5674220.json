The horses were sold to Terrell \u201cupon conditional sales or leases.\u201d These \u201cleases\u201d signed by Terrell contained the clause which is quoted in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-13\">Terrell paid on account of the \u201cleases\u201d something over $500. On January 18,1911, when no payments were due on the \u201cleases,\u201d Terrell made a mortgage of the property to the plaintiff to secure his note for $756, giving the plaintiff a power of attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>pay off any incumbrances against the property. This mortgage was recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">On February 18, 1911, Terrell sold the horses to one Coolidge for $1,050 and delivered to him a receipted bill thereof, which was put in evidence. Later the plaintiff looked for Terrell to get something paid on his mortgage and found that the horses were in the possession of Coolidge. On March 10, 1911, the plaintiff assigned the mortgage to Coolidge and indorsed the notes to him without recourse. On the same day Coolidge accompanied by an attorney, went to Lowell and saw C. H. Hanson, the manager of the defendant corporation, and talked the matter over with him. Hanson told them that there was then due him upon the property $695.75, and they thereupon offered to pay Hanson that amount, which he refused to receive. On March 11, the assignment of the mortgage and the indorsement of the notes to Coolidge were cancelled. On March 13, the defendant took the horses, claiming the right to do so because of the acts of Terrell in mortgaging and selling the property. On the next day, March 14, the plaintiff with his attorney went to Lowell and tendered to Hanson the sum of $700 in bills in payment of any amounts due upon the \u201cleases.\u201d Hanson refused to receive it. The horses had ever since been in the possession of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">The defendant asked the judge on the evidence to find for the defendant. He asked him to rule, that no title to the horses passed to the plaintiff at the time of the mortgage by Terrell, and that the title to the horses did not pass to the plaintiff at the time of the tender of $700 by the plaintiff to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">The judge refused to find for the defendant or to make either of these rulings. He found that the plaintiff, upon payment by him to the defendant of the amount due to the defendant on the \u201cleases\u201d given by Terrell, was entitled to the possession of the horses. By order of the judge a final decree was entered, ordering the defendant, upon payment to him by the plaintiff of $695.75 to deliver the horses to the plaintiff. The defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-9\"><em>J. J. Hogan &amp; W. A. Hogan, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-10\"><em>F. Keezer &amp; E. M. Shanley, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b155-11\">Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKB\">The property in question was sold by the defendant to one Terrell, upon what are termed \u201c conditional sales or leases.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The condition was as follows: \u201cSigned by me [Terrell] and payable to C. H. Hanson &amp; Co., Inc., or order that if said goods and chattels or any part thereof shall be attached or if I shall sell, mortgage, pledge or attempt to sell, mortgage or pledge the same or any part thereof, or shall fail to pay said note at maturity, said C. H. Hanson &amp; Co., Inc., shall have the right without any demand or notice to take immediate possession of said property and hold the same absolutely free from all claims and demands from me.\u201d Taking the condition as it reads, the title to the property would seem to have passed to Terrell subject to be divested at the option of the defendant upon the happening of either of the contingencies named and the taking possession of the property by the defendant pursuant to the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">But however that may be, and assuming that the title was in the defendant, it was held by it subject to the performance by Terrell of the conditions named, and Terrell had therefore a right or interest which he could and did convey in mortgage to the plaintiff. <em>Chase </em>v. Ingalls, 122 Mass. 381. <em>Currier </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>117 Mass. 324. <em>Swallow </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>111 Mass. 355. <em>Day </em>v. <em>Bassett, </em>102 Mass. 445. Upon tender of the amount due by Terrell or his assignee before possession was taken by the defendant, the title vested in Terrell or his assignee. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Colby, </em>34 N. H. 29, 37. <em>Cutting </em>v. <em>Whittemore, </em>72 N. H. 107, 111. The case differs from those cases relied on by the defendant where no right or interest whatever passed until the goods were paid for by the purchaser according to the contract. In <em>Cottrell &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Carter, Rice, &amp; Co. </em>173 Mass. 155, possession was taken several months before a tender was made. In the present case possession was not taken till after the tender when the rights of the plaintiff to redeem had become fixed. It is not necessary to consider the scope or effect of R. L. c. 198, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
