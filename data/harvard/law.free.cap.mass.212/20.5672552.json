Parkman, late of Boston, who died on September 16, 1908, giving the residue of the estate to the defendant to constitute a fund, the income of which was to be applied to the maintenance and improvement of the Common and parks of Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-12\">On March 9, 1909, the defendant\u2019s city council adopted an order, which the mayor approved, accepting the devise and au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>thorizing the city treasurer, \"on behalf of the city, to receive and receipt for said bequest, convert the same into money, and invest and reinvest it in proper securities, and hold the same to be expended for the purposes and objects named in said bequest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-3\">The executor of the will of George F. Parkman never made any formal tender to the treasurer of the property devised, and until after May 1, 1909, he collected rents accruing from all the real estate included in the devise. He made payment of some of the income so received to the defendant\u2019s treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">On May 1, 1909, the tax in question was assessed to \"the devisees of George F. Parkman.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-5\">On June 14, 1909, an agreement in writing was made between the plaintiff, the defendant and the executor of the will of George F. Parkman, for the sale for $200,000 by the defendant and the executor to the plaintiff of the property in question. This agreement contained the provision, \u201cRents, taxes and insurance are to be adjusted as of the day of the delivery of the deeds.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-6\">On July 14, 1909, two deeds were delivered to the plaintiff, one from the executor and the other from the defendant, each of which contained the statement that the premises were conveyed \"subject to taxes for the current year.\u201d The next day the defendant\u2019s treasurer received from the executor who conducted the negotiations a letter enclosing $197,298.53, which represented the purchase price, $200,000, less the broker\u2019s commission, which the defendant had agreed to pay, and a deduction for a sewer assessment. The letter stated, \u201cThe rents and water rates were apportioned and will be accounted for by\u201d the executor\u2019s assistant \u201cin due course.\u201d The treasurer signed an acknowledgment of the receipt of the money as \u201cnet proceeds of the sale ... in pursuance of\u201d the agreement of June 14, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-7\">The judge found for the plaintiff and reported the case for determination by this court, \u201csuch judgment to be entered as justice may require.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-9\"><em>J. </em>Abbott, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b51-10\"><em>T. M. </em>Babson, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b51-11\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhU\">This case is governed by <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>208 Mass. 537. As was said there, the city had unconditionally accepted Mr. Parkman\u2019s devise on the terms on which it was made. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>authority given by the city to its treasurer to receive and hold the property was merely its designation of the officer who was to have charge thereof. The title was not in the executor, but in the city. If the executor was allowed to manage the property, to collect the rents and profits and mingle these with other funds for which he was afterwards to account, this in no way affected the legal title or the property rights of the city. <em>Towle </em>v. <em>Swasey, </em>106 Mass. 100, 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\">The plaintiff\u2019s agreement of purchase stipulated that \u201crents, taxes and insurance . . . [were] . . . to be adjusted as of the day of the delivery of the deeds.\u201d This did not import a promise by the plaintiff to pay in full or in part taxes which had not been and could not be assessed lawfully upon the property and which did not constitute a lien thereon. The provision in the deed that the conveyance was \u201csubject to taxes for the current year\u201d has no broader meaning. There were no taxes for the current year to which the property was subject. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Haven, </em>211 Mass. 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">If, as the defendant has argued, the plaintiff has not paid in full the price which it agreed to pay, yet that fact raises no question to be considered in this case. There has been no claim of a set-off, and we need not consider whether such a claim could have been maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">It may be added, as that question has been suggested by the defendant, that neither in <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Boston, ubi supra, </em>nor in the present case, has the court considered whether real estate situated in other towns and included in Mr. Parkman\u2019s devise to the defendant is liable to taxation in those towns.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Judgment must be entered for the plaintiff on the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
