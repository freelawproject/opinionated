The district court granted Plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">1. We assume without deciding that the Defendant\u2019s umbrella policy dropped down to the primary coverage layer. Even with this drop down coverage, Plaintiff cannot seek equitable contribution. No \u201coccurrence\u201d triggered Defendant\u2019s umbrella policy because the policyholders intended the harm they caused. <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Henderson, </em>189 Ariz. 184, 939 P.2d 1337, 1344 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">2. Defendant issued a director, officer, and trustee liability policy to the insureds even though Defendant knew of allegations of fraud against the insureds\u2019 directors and officers. To protect itself, Defendant added a manuscript exclusion that explicitly precluded coverage for wrongful acts arising from the operation of Paradise Valley Estates. Plaintiffs argument that the exclusion was limited to only certain kinds of claims is refuted by the sweeping text of the exclusion. Because all the claims made in the underlying litigation arise from the operation of Paradise Valley Estates, the exclusion applies and the insureds are not entitled to coverage under Defendant\u2019s director, officer, and trustee liability policy. It follows that Plaintiff is not entitled to equitable contribution based on this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">3. Finally, Defendant issued multi-peril policies that provided \u201ccounseling coverage\u201d for liability arising from the insureds\u2019 counseling activities. The allegations in the underlying litigation reveal that some of the plaintiffs may have relied on the insureds\u2019 fraudulent representations simply because the persons making them were ministers. Further, Paradise Valley Estates was being touted as a Christian retirement community designed to provide for its residents\u2019 spiritual needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-13\">Even if those allegations could form the basis of coverage, however, exclusions provide that the counseling liability coverage does not apply to \u201cinjury resulting out of a wilful violation of a penal statute or ordinance\u201d and does not apply to \u201cany dishonest, fraudulent, or criminal acts or omissions.\u201d Because the underlying complaints allege only dishonest, fraudulent, and criminal behavior on the part of the insureds, those exclusions preclude coverage for counseling liability under Defendant\u2019s multi-peril policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">4. In view of our disposition of the appeal on the merits, we also reverse the fee award to Plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to enter judgment in favor of Defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
