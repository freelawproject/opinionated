For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the damages award, reverse the district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees to Lauder, and remand for a calculation of reasonable fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-13\">First Unum challenges $141,427.21 of the $153,512.41 that the district court awarded Lauder in disability benefits. First, First Unum argues that we should vacate our decision in <em>Lauder v. First Unum Life Ins. Co., </em>284 F.3d 375 (2002), in which we affirmed the district court\u2019s finding that First Unum waived its defense of lack of disability. First Unum argues that \u201cnewly-discovered evidence\u201d demonstrates Lauder\u2019s lack of disability. We find no special conditions that warrant reconsideration of First Unum\u2019s waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-14\">Second, relying on <em>Peterson v. Cont'l Cas. Co., </em>282 F.3d 112 (2d Cir.2002), First Unum argues that we should reconsider our determination that the period of liability covered by its waiver extends to April 6, 2001, and suggests instead that the effect of its waiver could only apply to the first month of liability <em>(i.e., </em>November 1996). First Unum\u2019s reliance on <em>Peterson </em>is misplaced. As an initial matter, First Unum brought the <em>Peterson </em>decision to the <em>Lauder </em>panel\u2019s attention in a 28j letter filed in February 2002. The <em>Lauder </em>panel neither cited nor addressed the relevance of <em>Peterson </em>and First Unum gives no reason for us to reconsider that panel\u2019s decision to <em>sub silentio </em>reject First Unum\u2019s argument regarding the relevance of <em>Peterson </em>to this case. Second, even if this panel were to consider the purported relevance of <em>Peterson, </em>we conclude that case has no significance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">Third, First Unum argues that the terms of the policy required the district court to offset Lauder\u2019s early retirement benefits against her disability benefits. This argument is not supported by the terms of the policy. Under the policy, voluntary acceptance of-retirement benefits terminates_ disability benefits, but the policy explicitly excludes from the defin\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tion of \u201cretirement benefits\u201d \u201cthose which reduce the amount of money which would have been paid as retirement benefits at the normal retirement age.\u201d Lauder provided evidence that the early retirement benefits she elected to receive diminished the amount of money she will be able to collect when she reaches normal retirement age. Hence, the benefits that Lauder opted to take do not trigger the termination or offset of disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We have considered First Unum\u2019s other arguments on its appeal and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s September 16, 2002 judgment awarding Lauder benefits for the period November 1,1996 through April 6, 2001, in the amount of $153,512.41, with the understanding that First Unum did not appeal $12,085.20 of that award.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">On the other hand, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Lauder\u2019s application for attorney\u2019s fees. On this issue, our <em>Chambless </em>opinion directs consideration of (1) culpability or bad faith, (2) ability to satisfy a fee award, (3) deterrence effect, (4) relative merits of the parties\u2019 positions, and (5) common benefit. <em>Chambless v. Masters, Mates &amp; Pilots Pension Plan, </em>815 F.2d 869, 871 (2d Cir.1987); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g)(1). These factors overwhelmingly support an award in this case. There was ample demonstration of bad faith on First Unum\u2019s part, including its persistence in advancing its defense of lack of disability in the district court after we had ruled that it had waived this contention, as well as the frivolous nature of virtually every position it has advocated in the litigation. Each of the other <em>Chambless </em>factors also favors an award. In our view, upon this record denial of fees is unjustified. We therefore remand for calculation of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">We hereby AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order awarding damages of $153,512.41 to Lauder, REVERSE the district court\u2019s order denying Lauder\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees, and REMAND solely for calculation of reasonable fees and costs. Lauder may recover costs for the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
