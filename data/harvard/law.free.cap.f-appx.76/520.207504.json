R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted pursuant to Fed. R. Crv. P. 12(b)(6). Because Manor\u2019s alleged deprivation of constitutional rights arose solely from the state-court divorce and child custody proceeding and was \u201cinextricably interwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s judgment, the district court did not err in dismissing it in part for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Davis v. Bayless, </em>70 F.3d 367, 375 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also Musslewhite v. State Bar of Texas, </em>32 F.3d 942, 946 (5th Cir.1994). Because the state judges were entitled to absolute immunity from liability and Manor did not allege that they acted in the absence of all jurisdiction, the district court did not err in dismissing Man- or\u2019s complaint in part for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See Malina v. Gonzales, </em>994 F.2d 1121, 1124 (5th Cir.1993). Manor\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Manor\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. Manor\u2019s motion for an extraordinary writ that the \u201cagreed decree of divorce\u201d be voided and held unenforceable is also DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-17\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
