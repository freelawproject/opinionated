On appeal, Andrade challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting each conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">\u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this court must determine whether any reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Casilla, </em>20 F.3d 600, 602 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cIn evaluating such a challenge, we must examine the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to the verdict and must afford the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences and credibility choices drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>United States v. Ayala, </em>887 F.2d 62, 67 (5th Cir. 1989) (following <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">As we explained in <em>United States v. Medina:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">To establish a conspiracy under either 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 or \u00a7 963, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that an agreement existed between two or more persons to violate the applicable narcotics law (i.e., a conspiracy existed), (2) that each alleged conspirator knew of the conspiracy and intended to join it and (3) that each alleged conspirator participated (i.e., joined) voluntarily in the conspiracy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">161 F.3d 867, 872 (5th Cir.1998); <em>see also Casilla, </em>20 F.3d at 603. Each element may be inferred from circumstantial evidence; that is, the \u201cagreement may be inferred from a \u2018concert of action\u2019 \u201d and \u201c Knowledge of a conspiracy and voluntary participation ... may be inferred from a \u2018collection of circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Once the government proves that the defendant was involved in a conspiracy to import marijuana, the jury \u201c[is] entitled to infer from the quantity [of marijuana] involved that the defendant [is] also guilty of participation in [a] conspiracy to possess the marijuana with intent to distribute it.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams-Hendricks, </em>805 F.2d 496, 503-04 n. 5 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">At trial, the Government presented evidence that Andrade entered the United States on May 24, 2001. Andrade\u2019s answers to a border patrol agent\u2019s routine questions appeared \u201cstrange,\u201d and the officer directed Andrade to enter secondary inspection for more questioning. At that time, the first agent\u2019s shift was ending and a second agent came on duty and directed a white van, which had been immediately behind Andrade\u2019s car in one of the vehicular entry lanes, to enter secondary inspection. The agents discovered that eighty-eight pounds of marijuana had been loaded into the white van\u2019s gas tank through a trap door in the floor of the vehicle. Later, they learned that Andrade owned the white van and that Manuel Rueda, the van\u2019s driver, was Andrade\u2019s cousin. When Andrade was arrested, he asked the agents for a signed \u201cdeal\u201d and, when they told him that they lacked the authority to make a deal, he responded that he would \u201cdo\u201d five years for his crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">We hold that the jury could reasonably infer that Andrade knowingly and intentionally conspired to assist Rueda, by diverting the border patrol\u2019s attention away from the white van (the \u201cload car\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), based on: (1) the fact that Andrade and Rueda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>are cousins,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) Andrade\u2019s ownership of the van, (3) Andrade\u2019s strange answers to the border patrol agent, (4) the fact that Andrade\u2019s car immediately preceded the van in the entry lane, and (5) Andrade\u2019s apparently incriminating statements upon arrest. In addition, the jury could also infer, from the large load of marijuana in the van\u2019s gas tank, that Andrade was present to assist Rueda if he ran out of gas while importing the marijuana. Andrade argues that this latter inference is improper without additional technical evidence regarding the van\u2019s gas mileage and remaining fuel capacity. His argument fails, however, because juries may \u201cuse their common sense\u201d in evaluating the evidence presented at trial. <em>United States v. Lechuga, </em>888 F.2d 1472, 1476 (5th Cir.1989) (citations omitted). Based on the large volume of marijuana found in the van\u2019s gas tank, it was also reasonable for the jury to conclude that the conspiracy extended to distributing the marijuana once the two men entered the United States. Thus, we uphold the jury\u2019s verdicts with respect to the two conspiracy charges in counts one and three of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On appeal, Andrade concedes that, in this circuit, evidence supporting a conspiracy conviction is sufficient to support a conviction for aiding and abetting. <em>See Casilla, </em>20 F.3d at 603. Therefore, we uphold the jury\u2019s verdicts with regard to the second and fourth counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">For the foregoing reasons, Andrade\u2019s convictions are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is <em>not </em>precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">. <em>See United States v.
