The Khweises first argue that the BIA improperly accepted and considered an untimely opposition to their motion to reopen submitted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">This court \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration regulations if the interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>268 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Given that the BIA had the discretion to consider an untimely \u201cbrief,\u201d see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(g)(3), the BIA\u2019s acceptance and consideration of the opposition was reasonable. Further, to the extent the Khweises argue that their due process rights were violated, their argument fails because they cannot demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Hernandez-Garza v. INS, </em>882 F.2d 945, 947 (5th Cir.1989). Likewise, the Khweises cannot show that their due process rights were violated by the BIA\u2019s single-member disposition of their motion to reopen. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The Khweises also contend that the BIA\u2019s retroactive application of the stop-time provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d) violates their right to due process. The Khweises\u2019 challenge to the retroactive application of the stop-time provision is foreclosed. <em>See Gonzalez-Torres v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Finally, citing evidence attached to their motion to reopen, the Khweises contend that the BIA\u2019s denial of the motion was error. In their motion the Khweises sought, <em>inter alia, </em>asylum, withholding of deportation, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The Khweises have failed to show, however, that the BIA\u2019s determination that they had failed to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought was an abuse of its discretion. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 106, 110-11, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988); <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903-06 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Faddoul v. INS, </em>37 F.3d 185, 188 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
