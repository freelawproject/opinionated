For the reasons set forth below, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s decision to dismiss the Property Owners\u2019 three federal claims. However, we conclude that the District Court erred when it exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims and then dismissed those claims with prejudice. Accordingly, we vacate the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the state law claims with prejudice and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the claims without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Plaintiffs are the owners and licensees of advertising space on One Times Square, Two Times Square, and 1600 Broadway (collectively, \u201cthe Buildings\u201d). Defendants produced and distributed the motion picture <em>Spider-Man, </em>which includes a scene set in Times Square during a fictional \u201cWorld Unity Festival.\u201d In order to generate revenue, Sony made agreements with various companies to superimpose their advertising on the Buildings as they appear in the recreated version of Times Square.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">The complaint alleges violations of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a), as well as unfair competition, deceptive trade practices, dilution, and trespass claims under New York law. Sony moved for judgment on the pleadings on all seven claims under Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court granted the motion, and dismissed the Property Owners\u2019 claims. The Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">As to plaintiffs claim of confusion \u2014 as between whom was any purchasing decision affected? <em>Lang v. Retirement Living Publg. Co., Inc., </em>949 F.2d 576 (2d Cir.1991); as to trade dress \u2014 these buildings constantly change their advertisement dress, <em>FM 103.1 v. Universal Broad, of New York, </em>929 F.Supp. 187 (D.N.J.1996); and trespass? \u2014 bouncing a laser beam off a building to create a digital photograph? Light beams bounce off plaintiffs\u2019 three buildings day and night in the city that never sleeps.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-13\"><em>Sherwood 48 Assocs. v. Sony Corp. of Am., </em>213 F.Supp.2d 376, 377 (S.D.N.Y.2002). The Court concluded also, apparently as an alternative ground for its decision, that Sony\u2019s conduct was protected by the First Amendment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Apk\">I. Federal Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act provides a private cause of action against any person who, \u201cin connection with any goods ... or any container for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof, ... which ... is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods ... by another person____\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a). The protection against unregistered trademark infringement extends to \u201ctrade dress,\u201d <em>see Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., </em>505 U.S. 763, 773, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992), which encompasses the design and appearance of a product along with all the elements that serve to identify the product to consumers, <em>see Jeffrey Milstein, Inc. v. Greger, Lawlor, Roth, Inc., </em>58 F.3d 27, 31 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">To plead a claim of trade dress infringement involving the appearance of a product, Property Owners must allege that (1) the claimed trade dress is non-functional; (2) the claimed trade dress has secondary meaning; and (3) there is a likelihood of confusion between the plaintiffs good and the defendant\u2019s. <em>See Yurman Design, Inc. v. PAJ, Inc., </em>262 F.3d 101, 115-16 (2d Cir.2001). A plaintiff must also offer \u201ca precise expression of the character and scope of the claimed trade dress.\u201d <em>Landscape Forms, Inc. v. Columbia Cascade Co., </em>113 F.3d 373, 381 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The Property Owners have not identified their purportedly protectable trade dress with precision. In the Amended Complaint, the trade dress is described as \u201cthe unique configuration and ornamentation of One Times Square, Two Times Square and 1600 Broadway and the advertising and signage display on One Times Square, Two Times Square and 1600 Broadway.\u201d (Am.Compl.1l 66) On its face, the Amended Complaint thus claims trade dress rights in <em>both </em>the configuration and ornamentation of each building <em>and </em>the advertising and signage display on each building.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">This description is inadequate. We have stated that the \u201cfocus on the overall look of a product does not permit a plaintiff to dispense with an articulation of the specific elements which comprise its distinct dress.\u201d <em>Landscape Forms, </em>113 F.3d at 381. By seeking protection of both \u201cthe configuration\u201d of the three buddings and the advertising and signage display on the faces of the buildings, the Property Owners plainly seek to protect the \u201coverall look\u201d of each of the buddings, and yet they fad to identify the specific elements that comprise each budding\u2019s identifiable trade dress. This basic defect in the Property Owners\u2019 pleadings, <em>i.e., </em>the vague and overbroad articulation of the trade dress elements in the Amended Complaint, cannot be cured, notwithstanding the Property Owners\u2019 attempts to recharacterize their adeged trade dress on appeal. <em>Compare, e.g., </em>Plaintiffs-Appedants\u2019 Reply Br. at 9 (describing the adeged trade dress as \u201cthe appearance of each budding, <em>stripped </em>o/the specifics of their signage\u201d (emphasis added)) <em>with </em>Am. Compl. 1166 (adeging that \u201cthe advertising and signage display\u201d on each budding is part of the \u201cprotectible trade dress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">II. State Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b419-13\">The Amended Complaint adeges four claims under New York law. Count IV adeges the tort of unfair competition. Count V adeges the tort of deceptive trade practices. Count VI adeges the tort of ddution, and Count VII adeges the tort of trespass. We conclude that the District Court erred in asserting supplemental ju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>risdietion over these claims and then dismissing them with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367 gives District Courts discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims, that discretion is not unlimited. <em>See Valencia v. Lee, </em>316 F.3d 299, 305-306 (2d Cir.2003) (explaining that, under certain circumstances, \u201ca federal court\u2019s determination of state-law claims [can] conflict with the principle of comity to the States and with the promotion of justice between the litigating parties\u201d). In several cases, this Court has held that district courts erred as a matter of law when they dismissed federal claims early in the case and then exercised supplemental jurisdiction over state claims that involve unsettled questions of state law. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 306; <em>Morse v. Univ. of Vermont, </em>973 F.2d 122, 127-28 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">This case presents an unsettled question of New York state law, to wit, whether a trespass is committed under New York law when a party\u2019s physical contact with another party\u2019s personal property diminishes the value of that property without damaging that property. Although a federal district court applying New York law has suggested that a \u201ctrespasser is hable when the trespass diminishes the ... value of personal property\u201d even in the absence of physical damage to the property, <em>Register.com, Inc. v. Verio, Inc., </em>126 F.Supp.2d 238, 250 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), the California Supreme Court, in an exhaustive opinion, recently concluded that \u201cthe tort [of trespass to chattels] does not encompass, and should not be extended to encompass, an electronic communication that neither damages the recipient computer system nor impairs its functioning,\u201d <em>Intel Corp. v. Hamidi, </em>30 Cal.4th 1342, 1347, 71 P.3d 296 (2003). A New York court should determine whether physical damage to the Buildings in this case is a prerequisite to a trespass claim. A New York court should likewise decide whether the Property Owners\u2019 other state claims, which were dismissed without discussion by the District Court, have any merit. The First Amendment does not compel dismissal of the state claims at the pleading stage. This Court has consistently recognized that, with respect to artistic works, the First Amendment will not bar trade dress claims \u201cwhere the public interest in avoiding consumer confusion outweighs the public interest in free expression.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Grimaldi, </em>875 F.2d 994, 999 (2d Cir.1989). In balancing these two interests, the key question is whether an alleged trademark infringement has any artistic relevance to the underlying work. <em>See id. </em>Here, the Property Owners have alleged that Sony altered the billboards in Times Square to generate revenue for their film. (Am. Compl.HH 49-50) Although Sony need only prove that replacing the ads in Times Square had at least some artistic relevance in order to assert a valid First Amendment defense, it has not done so at the pleading stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">So much of the District Court\u2019s judgment as grants Sony\u2019s motion to dismiss the Lanham Act claims on the pleadings is AFFIRMED. That portion of the judgment granting Sony\u2019s motion to dismiss the New York claims is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the New York claims without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
