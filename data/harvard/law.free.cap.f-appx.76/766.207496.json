Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), to test the veracity of the affidavit supporting the search warrant in this case. A <em>Franks </em>hearing is not necessary if the affidavit contains enough information to support a finding of probable cause even if the challenged information is ignored. <em>See United States v. Meling, </em>47 F.3d 1546, 1556 (9th Cir.1995). In this case, even if the information received from Sam Roberts (the part of the affidavit Baeza challenges) was completely ignored, the affidavit contained sufficient information based on the law enforcement officers\u2019 direct observations to support a finding of probable cause. The district court, therefore, did not err in denying the motion for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Baeza also argues that the district court committed plain error by failing to give Ninth Circuit Model Jury Instruction 4.10 (the \u201cinformant instruction\u201d). Because Baeza did not object to the jury instructions, the district court\u2019s jury instructions are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Monzon-Valenzuela, </em>186 F.3d 1181, 1182 (9th Cir.1999). Under plain error review, we may correct an error only if it is plain and affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Klinger, </em>128 F.3d 705, 712 (9th Cir.1997). Here, any error in failing to present the informant instruction did not affect Baeza\u2019s substantial rights because there was ample evidence against Baeza that corroborated Roberts\u2019 testimony. Because Roberts\u2019 testimony was corroborated and was not the only evidence of Baeza\u2019s guilt, any error in failing to give the informant instruction was harmless. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>229 F.3d 782, 788 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">Finally, Baeza argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for his conviction for being a felon in possession of ammunition. Any error, however, was harmless because Baeza was subject to the statutory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Because Baeza was sentenced to the statutory minimum for both imprisonment and supervised release, his sentence would not have been reduced even if the district court did not impose the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) enhancement. Therefore, any error that the district court committed was harmless. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>151 F.3d 957, 962 (9th Cir.1998) (declining to reach challenge to application of sentencing guidelines where defendant was sentenced to the mandatory minimum sentences of imprisonment and supervised release).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-13\">Baeza\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b795-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-16\">.
