Sturm appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims that Navy policies unconstitutionally discriminate against himself and other nonliturgica! Protestants. The district court found that the majority of these claims were moot, and it granted summary judgment for the Navy on the other claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of mootness, standing, and the propriety of summary judgment. <em>Cole v. Oroville Union High Sch. Dist., </em>228 F.3d 1092, 1097-98 (9th Cir.2000); <em>Balint v. Carson City, </em>180 F.3d 1047, 1050 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that Sturm\u2019s personal claims relating to his promotions are moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A case is moot \u201cwhen the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d <em>Clark v. City of Lakewood, </em>259 F.3d 996, 1011 (9th Cir.2001). \u201c \u2018Past exposure to illegal conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy ... if unaccompanied by any continuing, present adverse effects.\u2019 \u201d <em>Renne v. Geary, </em>501 U.S. 312, 320-21, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991) (quoting <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 495-96, 94 S.Ct. 669, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974)). Decisions of the Board of Corrections of Naval Records have provided Sturm with a retroactive promotion, back pay, and a corrected fitness report, in addition to other relief. Sturm is correct that the belated nature of his promotion may continue to affect his career prospects. However, this allegation is not in his complaint, and his prayer for relief contains no proposal regarding a potential remedy. Although a past deprivation of constitutional freedoms may be justiciable despite the fact that it is not destined to be repeated, Sturm has not requested damages, and thus there is no relief available for any such past injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">Sturm also alleges that past and present practices of the Navy violate the Establishment Clause and the free exercise rights of servicemembers. However, Sturm does not have standing to bring such a challenge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A plaintiff must have \u201csuch a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues.\u201d <em>Larson v. Valente, </em>456 U.S. 228, 238-39, 102 S.Ct. 1673, 72 L.Ed.2d 33 (1982) (quoting <em>Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, </em>438 U.S. 59, 72, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978)). \u201cA plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\u201d <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">Because Sturm\u2019s own religious freedoms are not infringed, Sturm does not allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>personal injury sufficient to establish standing on his own behalf. Moreover, his claim to taxpayer standing is unpersuasive, because he does not allege an injury resulting from Congress\u2019s exercise of its power under the Taxing and Spending Clause. <em>See Western Mining Council v. Watt, </em>643 F.2d 618, 631 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 102, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). Finally, Sturm has not convinced us that he can overcome the general rule that a litigant may not raise the rights of another. <em>See Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. at 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Sturm\u2019s challenges raise complex constitutional issues. However, because his personal claims are moot and he lacks standing to bring the remaining claims, the district court\u2019s judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b862-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b862-9\">.

In light of our disposition, Sturm\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s discovery rulings are moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
