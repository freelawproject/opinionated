We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Sharma v. INS, </em>89 F.3d 545, 547 (9th Cir.1996). We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The IJ abused his discretion by denying Carrasco\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See Jerezano v. INS, </em>169 F.3d 613, 615 (9th Cir.1999) (holding that denying a petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen when he arrived 15 to 20 minutes late was an abuse of discretion). Carrasco concedes that he arrived 21 minutes late for his hearing, due to \u201cunusually heavy automobile traffic,\u201d but his attorney was present and ready to proceed at 8:00 a.m., the scheduled hearing time, and so informed the court. In light of these facts, the IJ\u2019s in absentia order of removal was an abuse of discretion because he treated a \u201cslightly late appearance as a nonappearance.\u201d <em>See Jerezano, </em>169 F.3d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
