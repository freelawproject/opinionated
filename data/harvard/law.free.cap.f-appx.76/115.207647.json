The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced Ramirez to 120 months imprisonment and 8 years supervised release. On appeal, Ramirez\u2019s counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing the government unreasonably refused to file a motion for a downward departure based upon Ramirez\u2019s substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-22\">In the plea agreement, however, Ramirez waived his right to appeal, with limited exceptions not applicable here. After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude Ramirez\u2019s challenge to his sentence is within the scope of the waiver, he entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily, and no miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing the waiver. <em>See United States v. Andis, </em>333 F.3d 886, 889-91 (8th Cir.2003) (en banc). Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-17\">.
