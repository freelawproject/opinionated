We have jurisdiction to review purely legal determinations, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>Montero-Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>277 F.3d 1137, 1144 (9th Cir.2002), and we review de novo, <em>Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">Petitioner contends that being put into removal proceedings rather than deportation proceedings deprived him of the opportunity to apply for suspension of deportation relief and thereby violated equal protection. This contention lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Petitioner must show that the classification that caused him to be placed into removal proceedings is wholly irrational to succeed on his equal protection challenge. <em>See Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161, 1163 (9th Cir.2002). The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d) replaced \u201csuspension of deportation\u201d with the more restrictive \u201ccancellation of removal\u201d for aliens placed into proceedings on or after April 1, 1997. <em>See id. </em>at 1162. This classification is not wholly irrational. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1164-65 (approving \u201cCongress\u2019s natural line-drawing process in choosing a date to limit relief\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated lacks merit because IIRIRA made suspension of deportation no longer available to him. <em>Cf. Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 517 (9th Cir.2001) (explaining application of IIRIRA to bar the prospective relief of suspension of deportation does not offend due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s contention that removal proceedings were improperly initiated against him. <em>See Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594, 598-99 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b191-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
