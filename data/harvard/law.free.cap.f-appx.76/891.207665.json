These probate proceedings concerned the estate of Plaintiff\u2019s mother. The district court dismissed the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). Plaintiff appeals. \u201cWe review dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Kiowa Indian Tribe of Okla. v. Hoover, </em>150 F.3d 1163, 1165 (10th Cir.1998). Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-13\">\u201cSince federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, we presume no jurisdiction exists absent an adequate showing by the party invoking federal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Karnes v. Boeing Co., </em>335 F.3d 1189, 1194 (10th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). In her appellate brief filed August 13, 2003, Plaintiff argues that there are grounds for both diversity jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction over her suit. We conclude that neither diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, nor federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, exists in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\">First, Plaintiff cannot satisfy one of the fundamental requirements for diversity jurisdiction \u2014 that there be <em>complete </em>diversity of citizenship among the parties. Plaintiff maintains that \u201c[tjhere is clearly diversity of citizenship\u201d because \u201cthe oil companies reside in the State of Kansas and Plaintiff-Appellant resides in the State of Oklahoma.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 1. Plaintiff does not appear to have named the \u201coil companies\u201d as defendants in this case. But even if the companies were defendants, showing that they are citizens of a different state than Plaintiff would not be sufficient to establish diversity jurisdiction. \u201cA case falls within the federal district court\u2019s \u2018original\u2019 diversity \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 only if diversity of citizenship among the parties is complete, <em>i.e., </em>only if there is no plaintiff and no defendant who are citizens of the same State.\u201d <em>Wisconsin Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Schacht, </em>524 U.S. 381, 388, 118 S.Ct. 2047, 141 L.Ed.2d 364 (1998). Plaintiff has not alleged that Defendant William Collins is a citizen of a state other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Oklahoma; indeed, the caption of her complaint states an Oklahoma address for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">We also reject Plaintiffs other proposed basis for federal jurisdiction, which she characterizes as a \u201cfederal question.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 1. Plaintiffs theory is that the state court effected a taking, in violation of the United States Constitution, by determining that certain property interests at stake in the probate proceedings belonged to people other than Plaintiff. This theory does not provide a ground for reversing the district court\u2019s ruling that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, because a federal district court cannot exercise jurisdiction over the type of claim described by Plaintiff. \u201c[Ujnder [the] <em>Rooker/Feldman </em>abstention doctrine, ... a party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing party\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s federal rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-1006, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994) (citing <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 482, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 416, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923)).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">We determine that Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate a basis for federal jurisdiction over this case. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b920-12\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
