We agree with the Tax Court that the claimed deductions are \u201cstart-up expenses\u201d that are not immediately deductible. Accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-20\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-21\">In a preliminary matter, we agree with the Commissioner that McKelvey\u2019s notice of appeal is timely. A misdirected notice of appeal may be deemed timely by application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, authorizing \u201cfederal courts to transfer appeals in civil matters in order to cure a lack of subject matter or appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Kolek v. Engen, </em>869 F.2d 1281, 1284 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-22\">On the merits, the Tax Court correctly rejected McKelvey\u2019s claimed business deductions because he was not yet \u201ccarrying on a trade or business\u201d as required by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 162(c). The record indicates that McKelvey had only investigated the possibility of a tree farm by conducting studies and making a pilot planting. Even at the time of the Tax Court\u2019s decision, McKelvey had not planted trees, harvested trees, or even decided what trees to plant. Accordingly, the Tax Court did not err by ruling that McKelvey\u2019s expenses were start-up expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">Finally, McKelvey seeks to renew arguments that he abandoned in Tax Court. We decline to address issues abandoned and not addressed by the lower court. <em>See Harik v. California Teachers Ass\u2019n, </em>326 F.3d 1042, 1052 (9th Cir.2003), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>72 U.S.L.W. 3105 (U.S. July 11, 2003) (No. 03-89).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b834-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
