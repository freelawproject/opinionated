Jones appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of defendants in his action alleging that defendant City of Reedsport (\u201cthe City\u201d) and its employees and contractors violated 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Oregon law by turning off the power in a building he owned. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, <em>Patel v. Penman, </em>103 F.3d 868, 874 (9th Cir.1996), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the City on Jones\u2019s constitutional claims, because Jones failed to allege the City had a policy to deprive him of his constitutional rights, and the City\u2019s evidence showed that there was no such policy. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Sevs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">The district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of city employees and contractors on Jones\u2019s due process claim, because the record shows Jones sought Oregon administrative remedies, which were adequate to protect his procedural due process rights. <em>See Brogan v. San Mateo County, </em>901 F.2d 762, 764 (9th Cir.1990). Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider Jones\u2019s contention that he had a constitutionally protected property interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Jones\u2019s conspiracy claim, because there is no evidence that the defendants conspired to deprive Jones of his constitutional rights because of a discriminatory animus. <em>See Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, </em>506 U.S. 263, 268-69, 113 S.Ct. 753, 122 L.Ed.2d 34 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on Jones\u2019s state law emotional distress claim, <em>see Hammond, v. Central Lane Communications Ctr., </em>312 Or. 17, 816 P.2d 593, 598-99 (1991) (en banc), because the evidence does not show a special relationship existed between Jones and the defendants, <em>see Stover v. Or. State Bd. of Clinical Soc. Workers, </em>144 Or.App. 565, 927 P.2d 1098, 1103 (1996) (\u201cUnless the applicable statutes so provide, a regulatory body does not have a fiduciary relationship with those whom it regulates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-13\">Finally, the statements in the August 27, 2002 letter are privileged, because they were reviewed by building inspectors in determining whether to grant Jones\u2019s electrical permit. <em>See Moore v. West Lawn Mem\u2019l Park, Inc., </em>266 Or. 244, 512 P.2d 1344, 1346-47 (1973) (en banc). Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Jones\u2019s state law claim for defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-14\">Contrary to Jones\u2019s contention on appeal, he is not entitled to a jury trial. <em>See Etalook v. Exxon Pipeline Co., </em>831 F.2d 1440, 1447 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">Jones\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b830-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
