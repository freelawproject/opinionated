He was sentenced to a term of sixty-three months in the custody of the United States Bureau of Prisons. The sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to the Defendant\u2019s undischarged term of imprisonment in Pemiscot County, Missouri, Case No. CR598-754FX,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and concurrently with two other undischarged terms of imprisonment, one in Pemiscot County, the other in Dunklin County, Missouri.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-27\">The sole issue on appeal relates to the district court\u2019s order that the Defendant serve his term consecutively to his undischarged term in Pemiscot County Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>No. CR598-754FX. The Defendant asserts that based upon application note 6 of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5G1.3, his sentence should not run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of his probation. The Defendant asserts that the district court had discretion to impose a sentence to run concurrently with the state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">This issue has been passed upon in several cases in this circuit. We have consistently held that the language of application note 6 is mandatory. <em>See United States v. Lathern, </em>No. 02-2789, 2003 WL 145638, 59 Fed.Appx. 167 (8th Cir. Jan. 22, 2003); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>282 F.3d 1045, 1048 (8th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Goldman, </em>228 F.3d 942, 944 (8th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Dungy, </em>No. 95-3997, 1996 WL 193150 (8th Cir. April 23, 1996). Several other circuits have reached the same conclusion. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Lugo, </em>238 F.3d 305, 309-10 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Gondek, </em>65 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Bernard, </em>48 F.3d 427, 430-32 (9th Cir.1995); <em>But see United States v. Maria, </em>186 F.3d 65, 70-74 (2d Cir.1999) (holding that the Guidelines did not strip the sentencing court of its discretion to impose a concurrent sentence).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">As acknowledged by both the Defendant and the Government, it is axiomatic that a panel of this court may not overturn the opinion of another panel. <em>See Goldman, </em>228 F.3d at 944. On this basis, we reject the Defendant\u2019s challenge to this court\u2019s previous interpretation of the United States Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The judgment and sentence of the district court is hereby affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-16\">. The execution of the sentence in this case was originally suspended and the Defendant was placed on probation. Following his arrest for the instant offense, however, this probation was revoked.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b140-6\">. Judge Lay in <em>Smith, </em>282 F.3d at 1048, stated in dissent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">Although the Sentencing Guidelines suggest a preference for the district court to make the sentence consecutive, by not using the word \"shall\u201d there is no question the Sentencing Commission has left discretionary room for the district court to do that which is fair and equitable under the circumstances. In the present case, I think the only opinion that makes any sense is that of the Second Circuit in <em>United States v. Maria....</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
