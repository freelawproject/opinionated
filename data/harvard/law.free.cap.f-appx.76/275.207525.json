R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b304-11\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b304-12\">PAUL KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">Defendant-Appellant Joe Gutierrez appeals following his conviction for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Mr. Gutierrez accidentally shot himself while cleaning a gun at his home and instructed a friend to remove the gun and two others. Counsel for Mr. Gutierrez has filed a brief</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. In those circumstances, our local rule contemplates notice to the defendant and 30 days within which he may raise any challenges to his conviction and sentence. 10th Cir. R. 46.4(b). Additionally, the <em>Anders </em>brief reflects service on Mr. Gutierrez. No response has been received. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">Mr. Gutierriez was charged with possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, having been convicted previously of a felony. He pled to the offense, admitting that he was convicted in 1997 in California state court of residential burglary, a felony. He was sentenced to 70 months imprisonment followed by 36 months of supervised release. In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel for Mr. Gutierrez raises two issues at the behest of Mr. Gutierrez, but concedes that these issues lack merit. Aplt. Br. at 3-4, 6. In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that if appointed counsel \u201cfinds [her] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, [she] should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744. Where counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, we must conduct a \u201cfull examination of all the proceedings\u201d to determine if the appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we concur in counsel\u2019s evaluation of the ease, we may grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>After a thorough review of the record we conclude there are no meritorious issues for appeal. By pleading guilty, Mr. Gutierrez has waived all non-jurisdictional defenses, and he does not contend that the plea was involuntary and unintelligent. <em>See United States v. Salazar, </em>323 F.3d 852, 856 (10th Cir.2003). Mr. Gutierrez was convicted of residential burglary, which is first degree burglary under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 460(a), and punishable \u201cby imprisonment in the state prison for two, four, or six years.\u201d Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 461. Plainly, the burglary conviction qualifies as a \u201ca crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). His argument that his residential burglary plea was entered before a municipal court judge lacking authority to accept the plea is of no moment \u2014 the fact of his conviction is sufficient, even if the conviction might be subject to collateral attack. <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 55, 65, 100 S.Ct. 915, 63 L.Ed.2d 198 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Mr. Gutierrez also argues that a 1999 Colorado conviction for criminal mischief should not have been used in calculating his criminal history because his plea to that offense was uncounselled. This argument is without merit given the documentary evidence indicating that Mr. Gutierrez waived his right to counsel in entering the plea to criminal mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal and GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b304-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
