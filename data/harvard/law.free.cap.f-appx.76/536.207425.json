The insurers seek a declaration that they are not obliged to pay certain repair costs or loss of profits or use paid by the shipbuilder to its customers. In counterclaims, the shipbuilder seeks approximately $7 million in coverage. The district court granted summary judgment for the insurers but ordered each party to bear its own costs. All parties appealed. We now AFFIRM summary judgment, VACATE the denial of attorney fees and costs, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with Part IV of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Bollinger Shipyards Lockport, LLC (\u201cBollinger\u201d), built three lift boats for Cardinal Services (\u201cCardinal\u201d) under a \u201cVessel Construction Agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It built one lift boat for Monteo, Inc. (\u201cMonteo\u201d), under a \u201cConstruction Contract.\u201d These contracts warrantied workmanlike performance but limited Bollinger\u2019s obligation to repair and replace defects to those problems arising from faulty workmanship discovered within 180 days of delivery and reported to Bollinger within 180 or 210 days of delivery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The agreements expressly disclaimed any obligation on the part of Bollinger for consequential damages, including loss of profits and/or use. The Cardinal contract stated that the warranty was \u201cin lieu of all other express or implied warranties.\u201d The Monteo contract stated that all other warranties by Bollinger were \u201cexpressly excluded and negated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Amk\">The three lift boats that Bollinger built for Cardinal under the \u201cVessel Construction Agreement\u201d are the J. HANKINS, the W. LOPEZ, and the P.G. JONES.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The boat built for Monteo under the \u201cConstruction Contract\u201d is the TAMMY. The TAMMY was completed on May 15, 1997; the J. HANKINS on June 12, 1997; the W. LOPEZ on January 15, 1998; and the P.G. JONES on February 27,1998.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">On July 27, 2000, a crew member of the P.G. JONES noticed water seeping from one of the vessel\u2019s jack-up legs. The boat was taken to a Bollinger facility, where further inspection revealed cracks in each of its legs. Bollinger began repairs on August 1, 2000. The parties do not dispute that it was quickly determined that Bollinger had performed faulty welds during the original construction of the vessels; that the defective welding had, at some point, resulted in cracks in the gear racks attached to the legs; and that this cracking had propagated into the legs. The W. LOPEZ, the J. HANKINS, and the TAMMY were subsequently inspected and discovered to have similar cracks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bollinger began repairs on the J. HANKINS on August 14, 2000. In a letter dated August 19, 2000, Bollinger informed Cardinal that it was \u201cready, willing, and able\u201d to repair \u201cweld cracking\u201d on the W. LOPEZ. Ultimately, Bollinger replaced a total of ten legs on four vessels, at a cost of approximately $4.5 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-12\">Bollinger owned a comprehensive general liability (\u201cCGL\u201d) policy issued by XL Specialty Insurance (\u201cXL Specialty\u201d) that provided coverage between July 1, 2000, and October 1, 2001. The policy provided primary liability coverage for sums that Bollinger became \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d because of \u201cproperty damage\u201d that was caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d during the policy period. It further provided that XL Specialty had \u201cthe right and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>duty to defend any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking these damages,\u201d defining \u201csuit\u201d as \u201ca civil proceeding in which damage because of \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 \u2018property damage,\u2019 \u2018personal injury\u2019 or \u2018advertising injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies are alleged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Bollinger also purchased $25 million worth of excess CGL coverage for the policy period October 1,1999, to October 1, 2001. The excess coverage was subscribed to by XL Specialty, Navigators Insurance Company, Inc. (\u201cNavigators\u201d), and National Union Fire Insurance Company.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This umbrella policy also covered sums that Bollinger became \u201clegally liable to pay.\u201d Its terms were essentially identical to those of the primary coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">On August 18, 2000, Bollinger\u2019s insurance agent, Willis of Louisiana, Inc. (\u2018Willis\u201d), notified XL Specialty\u2019s managing general partner, Trident Marine Managers, Inc. (\u201cTrident\u201d), of a new CGL claim involving vessels Bollinger had built for Cardinal and Monteo. On August 30, 2000, Willis sent a notice of loss to Trident. The notice stated that four vessels built by Bollinger had \u201csustained cracks in some of the legs\u201d sometime \u201cafter 10/1/98.\u201d It did not identify any related claims, demands, or suits. On August 31, 2000, Willis informed Trident that Bollinger had begun to repair the vessels because it believed it bore responsibility for the damages: \u201cBollinger has investigated the matter and ... feels responsible for the damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">On September 18, 2000, Cardinal issued a written demand to Bollinger relating to Bollinger\u2019s \u201cbreach of its vessel construction contracts.\u201d The demand letter specifically stated that Cardinal\u2019s remedies against Bollinger lay \u201cin contract rather than in tort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">At some point, Montco\u2019s president told Bollinger\u2019s chairman that his company expected the shipbuilder to pay for repairs to the TAMMY, as well as for its downtime. According to the testimony of Montco\u2019s president, Bollinger\u2019s chairman agreed to the demand, even though he questioned his company\u2019s obligation to do so under the terms of the Construction Contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">On September 19, 2000, Trident acknowledged its receipt of the loss notice sent by Willis on August 30. Following additional correspondence, Trident sent Bollinger a reservation of rights letter on September 25, 2000, reserving the insurers\u2019 right to contest coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">On November 2, 2000, Bollinger notified Cardinal that it would pay up to $1.5 million to cover loss of use of the W. LOPEZ, the J. HANKINS, and the P.G. JONES, in the event that its insurers denied coverage. On February 13, 2001, Bollinger notified Monteo that it would pay $875,000 to cover loss of use of the TAMMY, in the event that its insurers denied coverage. Bollinger and Monteo entered into a formal settlement agreement on June 28, 2001. Bollinger and Cardinal entered into such an agreement on July 25, 2001. Subsequently, Bollinger entered into new agreements with both Cardinal and Monteo to build additional vessels. Those agreements were worth approximately $33 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">On March 9, 2001, XL Specialty filed suit seeking a declaration of its rights and obligations. On March 13, 2001, it denied Bollinger\u2019s claim. Bollinger filed a counterclaim seeking coverage and bad faith damages. Navigators also filed a deelara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tory judgment action contesting coverage, in response to which Bollinger filed a counterclaim. The suits were consolidated. All parties moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment for the insurers but denied costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Bollinger appeals from the court\u2019s judgment finding a lack of coverage. The insurers appeal from the court\u2019s order that the parties bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We likewise review matters of contract interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if the movant demonstrates that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, \u201csummary judgment is appropriate if the nonmovant fails to establish facts supporting an essential element of his prima facie claim.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The policies at issue limited coverage to those sums that Bollinger was \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because the record does not reasonably support the finding of a factual basis upon which Bollinger could potentially be liable to Cardinal or Monteo, we conclude that there was no coverage under the policies.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-16\">The contracts under which Bollinger constructed the lift boats included express warranty provisions limiting Bollinger\u2019s obligation to repair and replace defects to those problems discovered and reported within 180 or 210 days of delivery. The lift boats were completed and delivered in 1997 and 1998, and the defective welds were discovered between July 27, 2000, and September 18, 2000. Hence, the express warranties had expired before the cracking in the jack-up legs was discovered and reported. Furthermore, the construction contracts expressly precluded any obligation by Bollinger for consequential damages, including loss of profits and use. Because the warranty limitations included in the contracts were allowable under Louisiana law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> neither Cardinal nor Monteo had a valid warranty claim against Bollinger. Accordingly, Bollinger faced no potential liability in contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-17\">Bollinger argues that it was subject to potential liability for breach of the implied warranty against redhibitory vices and defects. We disagree. Under the Louisiana Civil Code, redhibition is the rescission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>a sale on account of a defect in the manufacture or design of a thing sold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-5\">The seller warrants the buyer against redhibitory defects, or vices, in the things sold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">A defect is redhibitory when it renders the thing useless, or its use so inconvenient that it must be presumed that a buyer would not have bought the thing had he known of the defect. The existence of such a defect gives a buyer the right to obtain rescission of the sale.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Because redhibition is the avoidance of a sale, there can be no redhibition in the absence of a contract of sale.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">We find that there is no genuine issue of material fact about the nature of the contracts under which Bollinger built the lift boats for Cardinal and Monteo. They were contracts to build. The record unequivocally shows that the vessels were built to the specifications of Cardinal and Montco; that both contracts were negotiated; and that Bollinger supplied the skill, labor, and materials.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the contracts between Bollinger and both Cardinal and Monteo were contracts to braid rather than contracts of sale, and because redhibition is not applicable to construction contracts, Bollinger faced no potential liability for a breach of the warranty against redhibitory vices and defects.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-13\">In sum, we find that there was no coverage of Bollinger\u2019s claim because it was not potentially obligated to pay the sums it expended on repairs and paid to Cardinal and Monteo for down time.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-15\">Bollinger contends that the insurers forfeited their right to invoke the coverage limitation imposed by the phrase \u201clegally obligated to pay as damages\u201d be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>cause they refused to defend Bollinger against Cardinal\u2019s and Montco\u2019s claims and then denied coverage. This argument is meritless. By its terms, the primary insurance policy required XL Specialty to provide a defense only for any \u201csuit\u201d seeking damages.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Because neither Cardinal nor Monteo named Bollinger in a \u201csuit,\u201d defined in the policy as a \u201ccivil proceeding,\u201d there was no duty to defend.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In any event, the wrongful denial of a defense would not have <em>expanded </em>coverage.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Finally, in response to Bollinger\u2019s assertion that its settlement was reasonable, we note that Bollinger assumed responsibility for the damages almost immediately after they were discovered and negotiated down-time compensation with Cardinal and Monteo long before the insurers denied coverage. Bollinger may have made an astute business decision in paying for Cardinal\u2019s and Montco\u2019s losses. But Bollinger cannot transfer costs it was not legally obligated to pay to the insurers.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The insurers complain that the district court erroneously ordered the parties to bear their own costs. \u201c[C]osts ... shall be allowed as of course to the prevailing party unless the court otherwise directs____\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Our cases recognize that there is a strong presumption that the prevailing party will be awarded its costs.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> While the court has wide discretion to award or deny costs,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> it must provide reasons if it denies costs.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Because the district court here did not provide reasons, we vacate that portion of the judgment ordering each party to bear its own costs and remand for either an award of costs to the prevailing parties or an explanation of reasons for the denial of such an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM summary judgment, VACATE the denial of attorney fees and costs, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with Part IV of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Bollinger asserted at oral argument that the replacement leg used in reconstructing the J.
