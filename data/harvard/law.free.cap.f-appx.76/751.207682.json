On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief in which he argues that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Ruiz-Ahumada at the top of the Guidelines range. In a pro se supplemental brief, Ruiz-Ahumada raises speedy-trial, due process, and ineffective-assistance issues, all in relation to continuances the district court granted before he entered his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-24\">Counsel\u2019s argument fails, as this court does not review a sentence merely because it has been imposed at the top of a Guidelines range that the defendant does not challenge. <em>See United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per cu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>riam). Further, Ruiz-Ahumada\u2019s guilty plea forecloses the speedy-trial and due process claims he raises in his pro se brief, <em>see United States v. Beck, </em>250 F.3d 1163, 1166 (8th Cir.2001) (valid guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects); <em>Cox v. Lockhart, </em>970 F.2d 448, 453 (8th Cir. 1992) (speedy-trial claim is nonjurisdictional and therefore waived by guilty plea), and his ineffective-assistance claim is not properly before us, <em>see United States v. Martin, </em>59 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Moreover, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-25\">. The Honorable Mark W.
