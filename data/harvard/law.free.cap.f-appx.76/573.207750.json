The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment because it was impossible for the court to determine whether the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, inasmuch as the Wards failed to include a transcript of the trial in the bankruptcy court in the record on appeal. The Wards argue that the district court\u2019s judgment was biased because it gave no weight to the their trial testimony, and that the district court violated their rights to due process and equal protection because it did not ascertain why a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>transcript was not ordered \u2014 they claim, for the first time on appeal, that they lacked financial resources to pay for a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Because a trial transcript was not made a part of the record on appeal, it was impossible for the district court to give weight to the Wards\u2019 trial testimony. The district court\u2019s failure to inquire about the reason why the transcript was not part of the record did not violate the Wards\u2019 due process and equal protection rights. The Wards did not seek leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>or request a transcript at public expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
