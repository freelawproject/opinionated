On appeal, he argues that the ALJ erred in two respects. The district court upheld the denial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits. <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 509 (9th Cir.2001). This Court must affirm if substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision and if the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla, but may be less than a preponderance. Substantial evidence is relevant evidence that, considering the entire record, a reasonable person might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. If the evidence can reasonably support either affirmance or reversal, a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Commissioner. The ALJ is responsible for determining credibility and resolving conflicts in medical testimony and ambiguities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-15\">Jeter contends that the ALJ failed to develop the record fully before disregarding the evidence provided by two physicians who treated him after his insured status expired. Although \u201c[t]he ALJ in a social security case has an independent duty to fully and fairly develop the record and to assure that the claimant\u2019s interests are considered,\u201d <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1150 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), there is no indication here that the record was not adequately developed. The ALJ found that the opinions of treating Drs. Kerwin and Lengyel were conclusory, brief, unsupported by clinical findings, and contradicted by prior medical observations and opinions from other treating physicians. <em>Id. </em>at 1149. The ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-16\">Jeter also maintains that the ALJ erred in failing to develop the record adequately before making an adverse credibility determination regarding Jeter\u2019s statements concerning his impairment. We disagree. \u201cIn assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, the ALJ may use ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>techniques of credibility evaluation, such as considering the claimant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and any inconsistent statements in [his] testimony. The ALJ must give specific, convincing reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s subjective statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The ALJ did that here, citing Jeter\u2019s activities as inconsistent with his claimed level of disability (including his admission of continuing free-lance work while claiming total disability), the limited degree of medical treatment sought by Jeter, the lack of prescription of strong pain medication, and other discrepancies. The finding that Jeter\u2019s statements regarding his impairments and their impact on his ability to perform work lacked credibility was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b838-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
