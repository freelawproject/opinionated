We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Vasquez contends that the California state court violated his due process rights when it failed to hold a hearing on the voluntariness of his statements to a police officer while Vasquez was under the influence of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">Assuming, without deciding, that the state trial court\u2019s actions violated Vasquez\u2019s rights to a hearing on whether his statements were voluntary, Vasquez nonetheless failed to demonstrate that the admission of these statements affected the outcome of the trial in light of the overwhelming evidence in support of his conviction. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (holding that petitioners are entitled to habeas relief only if a trial-type error, in light of the record as a whole, had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict). The district court therefore properly denied Vasquez\u2019s petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>Woodford v. Visciotti </em>537 U.S. 19, 27, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002) (per curiam) (stating that the federal habeas scheme \u201cauthorizes federal-court intervention only when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
