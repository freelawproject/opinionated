Melntee specifically contends that the district court used this information in applying a firearm enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, in not departing further downward under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and in imposing a sentence at the high end of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-22\">Mclntee\u2019s contention regarding the firearm enhancement is incorrect. Although the district court disregarded a (non-binding) recommendation in the plea agreement against application of the firearm enhancement, the factual basis for the enhancement was a gun discovered by agents during a search of Mclntee\u2019s residence, not information provided by Melntee in debriefing. To the extent that the district court considered covered information in not departing further downward or in imposing a sentence at the high end of the guideline range, such consideration did not violate either the proffer agreement or \u00a7 1B1.8, both of which only prohibit use of the information in the determination of the applicable guideline range. Neither the proffer agreement nor \u00a7 1B1.8 prohibits use of the information in imposing a sentence within the applicable guideline range or in determining the extent of any downward departure. The sentence is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b174-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b174-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
