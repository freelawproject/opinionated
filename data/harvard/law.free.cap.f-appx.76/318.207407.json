(\u201cSenior Tech\u201d) appealed a judgment in favor of one of its competitors, R.F. Technologies, Inc. (\u201cR.F.Tech\u201d), upon the conclusion of a bench trial by the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska. On March 12, 2001, this court issued a ruling that affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusions of noninfringement, noninvalidity, and no inequitable conduct, and its denial of R.F. Tech\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Senior Techs., Inc. v. R.F. Techs., Inc., </em>No. 00-1089, -1090, 2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179 (Fed.Cir. Mar. 12, 2001) <em>(\u201cSenior Tech III\u201d). </em>Senior Tech petitioned the Supreme Court for review, and on June 3, 2002, the Court granted certiorari, vacated our decision, and remanded the case to this court for reconsideration in light of <em>Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., </em>535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002) <em>(\u201cFesto VIII\u201d). Senior Techs., Inc. v. R.F. Techs., Inc., </em>535 U.S. 1108, 122 S.Ct. 2323, 153 L.Ed.2d 151 (2002). Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction, we have reconsidered this case and, once again, <em>affirm </em>the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Because we have previously discussed the background of this patent dispute in detail, <em>Senior Tech III, </em>2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179, at *2-5, we need not repeat it here. We provide only the relevant facts salient to the instant disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">As we explained in our previous opinion, Senior Tech has accused R.F. Tech of infringing claims 1 and 6 of U.S. Patent No. 4,682,155 (\u201cthe T55 patent\u201d), which is directed to a monitoring system used in nursing homes and other care facilities to monitor patients or residents who have a tendency to wander. <em>Id. </em>at *2. Claim 1 calls for a \u201csensing module <em>including a receiving circuit and associated sensing means </em>located adjacent to the door opening to be monitored,\u201d while claim 6 requires \u201ca receiving device for mounting adjacent to the doorway including <em>a housing and a receiving circuit therein.\u201d Id. </em>at *2-4 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">According to the patentee, four models of R.F. Tech\u2019s Code Alert products infringed the two asserted claims of the \u2019155 patent: the CA9000, CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models. The CA9000 model, first introduced in 1992, consisted of (1) an antenna mounted near a doorway, and (2) a \u201ccontrol unit,\u201d containing both the microprocessor and the preceding circuitry, located ideally at a distance of 10 feet from the door opening. <em>Id. </em>at *5. The later-introduced CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models removed the preceding circuitry originally located in the control unit and placed that circuitry in the antenna mounted near the door, while leaving the microprocessor in the control unit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-12\">In <em>Senior Tech III, </em>we held that \u201cthe district court erred by not including the microprocessor in its comparison of the accused device with the construed \u2018receiving circuit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at *11-12. The infringement analysis should have instead compared the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d claim term with the preceding circuitry and the microprocessor, together as a unit. <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at *17 (\u201cAs discussed above, both the microprocessor and the preceding circuitry corresponds [sic] to the limitation of \u2018receiving circuit\u2019 in the \u2019155 patent.\u201d). However, we deemed the error harmless and affirmed the judgment of noninfringement on alternative grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">We first determined that the CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models did not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>fringe the asserted claims because those devices did not satisfy the claims\u2019 \u201csingle housing\u201d limitation either literally or by equivalents. <em>Id. </em>at *12-18. As a matter of claim construction, claim l\u2019s \u201clanguage, specification, and prosecution history all indicate that the receiving circuit must be contained within the housing of the sensing module.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *13-14. For similar reasons, we determined \u201cthat claim 6 is limited to a device in which a receiving circuit is located within a housing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *15. Based on these claim interpretations, we concluded that the accused CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models did not literally infringe the asserted claims, because R.F. Tech had separated the preceding circuitry from the microprocessor and placed the two components of the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d in two different housings. <em>Id. </em>at *16-17. Then, invoking our now-vacated <em>Festo </em>opinion, <em>Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabuskiki Co., </em>234 F.3d 558 (Fed.Cir.2000) (en banc) <em>(Festo VII), vacated, </em>535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002), we held that \u201cinfringement under the doctrine of equivalents with regard to the CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models is precluded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Having disposed of those three accused models, we further concluded that the fourth accused device, the CA9000 model, could not infringe the asserted claims. Addressing the alleged infringement of claim 1 by the CA9000 model, we determined that the proper construction of claim 1 required the \u201cassociated sensing means\u201d to \u201cbe contained within the same housing as the receiving circuit,\u201d thus precluding any literal infringement since the antenna was in a different housing from the \u201creceiving circuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *19-21. Relying on the same construction, we then ruled that the CA9000 model could not infringe under the doctrine of equivalents, lest the application of that doctrine completely vitiated the single housing limitation of the \u201cassociated sensing means.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *21-22. As to the alleged infringement of claim 6 by the CA9000 model, we determined that the accused device did not infringe, literally or by equivalents, the \u201cenable the receiving circuit\u201d of claim 6, because the preceding circuitry could continuously receive signals without needing to be \u201cenabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *22-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Having concluded that the district court did not commit reversible error in its non-infringement determination, we turned to R.F. Tech\u2019s cross-appeal. On the merits of the cross-appeal, we determined that the district court correctly held that the claims in suit were not invalid or unenforceable, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying R.F. Tech\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Id. </em>at *27-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Prosecution history estoppel stands \u201cas a legal limitation on the doctrine of equivalents.\u201d Warne<em>r-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 30, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997). Since this restriction on the doctrine of equivalents applies \u201conly where claims have been amended for a limited set of reasons,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 32, 117 S.Ct. 1040, prosecution history estoppel does not apply to claim construction, literal infringement analysis, or when there is no relevant amendment during the prosecution of the patent application. Consequently, our constructions of the disputed claim terms and our determinations of no literal infringement do not implicate prosecution history estoppel; they are therefore unaffected by the holding of <em>Festo VIII </em>and are restored in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">In <em>Festo VIII, </em>the Supreme Court vacated this court\u2019s en banc decision and estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>lished a new framework for analyzing the interaction of the doctrine of equivalents and prosecution history estoppel. We must therefore determine whether the Court\u2019s holding affects our doctrine of equivalents analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In <em>Senior Tech III, </em>we held that \u201cinfringement under the doctrine of equivalents with regard <em>to </em>the CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models is precluded\u201d because amendments to the asserted claims during prosecution completely barred the application of the doctrine of equivalents. <em>Senior Tech III, </em>2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179, at *17-18 (citing <em>Festo VII, </em>284 F.3d 558). In light of <em>Festo VIII, </em>our conclusion based on that reasoning is no longer valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Although the underlying reasoning can no longer stand, the holding may nonetheless remain valid on other grounds. As we recently explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">[w]e do not interpret the Supreme Court\u2019s order in this case as requiring us to address the <em>Festo </em>issue or as precluding us from deciding the case on some other ground. Because the Court vacated our prior judgment affirming the district court\u2019s order ..., the case on remand stands in the same posture as it did in the earlier appeal before our decision there. We think that all the Supreme Court intended was that, if we again considered the prosecution history estoppel point, we should do so in light of the Court\u2019s elucidation of that doctrine in its <em>Festo </em>opinion. There is no reason to believe, however, that the Supreme Court intended to require us on remand to limit our analysis to the theory we previously had followed. Indeed, our disposition of this appeal on grounds other than prosecution history estoppel literally complies with the Supreme Court\u2019s order in the sense that, \u201cin light of <em>Festo, \u201d we </em>have \u201cfurther considered\u201d the case and concluded that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed on another ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-10\"><em>Lockheed Martin Corp. v. Space Sys./Loral, Inc., </em>324 F.3d 1308, 1310-11 (Fed.Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">As in <em>Lockheed, we </em>have reconsidered the case and concluded that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed on another ground. That other ground is the patentee\u2019s implicit and necessary exclusion of a structural feature opposite from the claimed structure. <em>See SciMed Life Sys. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc., </em>242 F.3d 1337, 1345-47 (Fed.Cir.2001). In <em>SciMed, </em>we explained that \u201cbecause the scope of the claim was limited in a way that plainly and necessarily excluded a structural feature that was the opposite of the one recited in the claim, that different structure could not be brought within the scope of patent protection through the doctrine of equivalents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1346. In other words, in a binary choice situation where there are only two structural options, the patentee\u2019s claiming of one structural option implicitly and necessarily precludes the capture of the other structural option through the doctrine of equivalents. <em>See id. </em>at 1345-46 (citing and discussing <em>Moore, U.S.A., Inc. v. Standard Register Co., </em>229 F.3d 1091, 1106 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>Sage Prods., Inc. v. Devon Indus., Inc., </em>126 F.3d 1420, 1425 (Fed.Cir.1997); <em>Eastman Kodak Co. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>114 F.3d 1547, 1561 (Fed.Cir. 1997); <em>Dolly, Inc. v. Spalding &amp; Evenflo Cos., </em>16 F.3d 394, 400 (Fed.Cir.1994)). To illustrate, \u201cif a patent states that the claimed device must be \u2018non-metallic,\u2019 the patentee cannot assert the patent against a metallic device on the ground that a metallic device is equivalent to a non-metallic device.\u201d <em>SciMed, </em>242 F.3d at 1347. If \u201cmetallic\u201d were allowed to be the equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>lent of \u201cnon-metallic,\u201d such approach would wholly vitiate the claimed \u201cnon-metallic\u201d limitation and negate the \u201cclear and binding statement to the public that metallic structures are excluded from the protection of the patent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">In this case, as in <em>SciMed, </em>the patentee\u2019s choice of claim terms has plainly, necessarily, and implicitly excluded from the scope of the patent the embodiment it now seeks to capture through the doctrine of equivalents. In <em>Senior Tech III, </em>we ruled that the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d corresponded to the accused devices\u2019 unit composed of the microprocessor and preceding circuitry together. <em>Senior Tech III, </em>2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179, at *9-12. We further determined, as a matter of claim construction, that the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d had to be in a single housing. ' <em>Id. </em>at *12-17.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hence, the microprocessor and the preceding circuitry-the components of the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d in the accused devices-have to be in the same housing for infringement to attach. That was not the case however. \u201c[I]n the CA9100, CA9120, and CA600, the circuitry preceding the microprocessor was removed and placed in the antenna unit mounted near the door, while the microprocessor remained in the control unit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *17. Because the elements corresponding to the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d in those three models were not in the same housing, those three devices could not infringe literally. Nor could they infringe under the doctrine of equivalents, since the patentee\u2019s decision to claim a \u201creceiving circuit\u201d located in the \u201csame housing\u201d necessarily and implicitly excluded from the scope of equivalents an embodiment of the \u201creceiving circuit\u201d which is <em>not </em>located in the \u201csame housing.\u201d Were we to allow a finding of infringement by equivalents despite the two distinct and separate housings for the elements of the \u201creceiving circuit,\u201d we would permit the vitiation and deletion of the claimed \u201csame housing\u201d limitation. If we upheld such a finding, we would impermissibly allow the doctrine of equivalents \u201csuch broad play as to effectively eliminate that element in its entirety.\u201d War<em>ner-Jenkinson, </em>520 U.S. at 29, 117 S.Ct. 1040. Because such a result is repugnant to Supreme Court and Federal Circuit precedent, we again hold that the CA9100, CA9120, and CA600 models do not infringe claims 1 and 6 of the \u2019155 patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In light of this ruling, we do not need to reach the issue of prosecution history estoppel. <em>See Lockheed, </em>324 F.3d at 1321-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">In <em>Senior Tech III, </em>we analyzed the alleged infringement by the CA9000 model separately from the other three models. In that analysis, we did not rely on prosecution history estoppel, and accordingly did not implicate <em>Festo VIII. See Senior Tech III, </em>2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179, at *19-27. Instead, we reached that conclusion based on the patentee\u2019s necessary and implicit exclusion of the embodiment it sought to capture through the doctrine of equivalents. <em>See SciMed, </em>242 F.3d at 1346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Applying the well-settled rule summarized in <em>SciMed </em>to the alleged infringement of claim 1 by the CA9000 model, we explained that \u201can attempt to expand the scope of claim 1 under the doctrine of equivalents to encompass the accused devices, which have antennae located outside of the receiving circuit\u2019s housing, would <em>eviscerate </em>the construed limitation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>they [the antenna and the receiving circuit] be contained within the housing.\u201d <em>Senior Tech III, </em>2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179, at *21 (emphasis added). In other words, a finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, despite the fact that the CA9000 model\u2019s antenna was located outside of the receiving circuit\u2019s housing, would vitiate the requirement that the antenna (corresponding to the \u201cassociated sensing means\u201d) be located in the same housing as the receiving circuit. Such a finding would impermissibly delete an express limitation from the claims and abrogate the notice function of the patent claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The same principle also compelled a conclusion that the CA9000 model could not infringe claim 6 under the doctrine of equivalents. Properly construed, claim 6 required \u201ctotal enablement,\u201d i.e. \u201cunless the receiving circuit has been \u2018enabled,\u2019 it [the invention] is inoperative with respect to all of its functions-receiving signals, responding to them, or producing an output response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *24. Under the settled rule of <em>SciMed, </em>the patentee\u2019s decision to require \u201ctotal enablement\u201d in claim 6 necessarily and implicitly excluded the opposite of that requirement (non-enablement) from the scope of equivalents. <em>See SciMed, </em>242 F.3d at 1346-47. Yet, the patentee essentially asserted that a structure that required no enablement actually infringed the \u201ctotal enablement\u201d limitation by equivalents. <em>See Senior Tech III, </em>2001 U.S.App. LEXIS 4179, at *26 (explaining that \u201cthe structure in the accused products corresponding to the \u2018receiving circuit\u2019 in the T55 patent d[id] not have to be \u2018enabled,\u2019 as claim 6 require[d], in order to receive transmitted signals.\u201d). The patentee\u2019s assertion cannot prevail however, because infringement of a claim requiring \u201ctotal enablement\u201d by an accused device that did not need to be enabled would contravene both the notice function of the claims and settled Supreme Court case law. <em>See SciMed, </em>242 F.3d at 1346-47. Consequently, the CA9000 model could not infringe claim 6 under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In sum, we reaffirm our initial conclusion that the CA9000 device did not infringe either claim 1 or claim 6 under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">As mandated by the Supreme Court, we have reconsidered our original decision in this case in light of <em>Festo VIII. </em>Based on this reconsideration and as explained above, we again hold that none of the accused products infringe the asserted claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of noninfringement. Moreover, for the reasons explained in our original opinion, we also affirm the district court\u2019s ruling that the patent in suit is not invalid or unenforceable and that R.F. Tech was not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-5\">.
