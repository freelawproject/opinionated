Hodge contends that the ALJ erred by improperly rejecting Hodge\u2019s subjective pain testimony. Although the ALJ found much of Hodge\u2019s symptom testimony credible, the ALJ found that Hodge\u2019s testimony was not credible to the extent that Hodge claimed that her symptoms totally disabled her from performing any work.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The rule is well established that \u201c[t]he ALJ is responsible for determining credibility and resolving conflicts in medical testimony and ambiguities.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 509 (9th Cir.2001) (internal citation omitted). The ALJ may not reject a claimant\u2019s statements regarding her limitations merely because they are not supported by objective evidence, nor solely on the basis of the ALJ\u2019s own observations of the claimant at the hearing. <em>Tonapetyan v. Halter, </em>242 F.3d 1144, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cIn assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, the ALJ may use ordinary techniques of credibility evaluation, such as considering the claimant\u2019s reputation for truthfulness and any inconsistent statements in her testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148 (internal quotation marks omitted). Also, the ALJ may not reject a claimant\u2019s testimony without offering clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s subjective statements. <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281-82 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cWhere the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, it is the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that must be upheld.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Here, the ALJ discredited Hodge\u2019s testimony because of Hodge\u2019s inconsistent statements, because of Hodge\u2019s presentation at the hearing, because of the unexplained failure of Hodge to seek and follow treatment, and because Hodge\u2019s daily activities were inconsistent with Hodge\u2019s contention that she suffered from a total disability. The ALJ gave a detailed explanation supporting each of these reasons. Because the ALJ offered clear and convincing reasons, we conclude that the ALJ properly rejected the portion of Hodge\u2019s subjective pain testimony urged to show total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">2. Hodge next contends that the ALJ erred by rejecting the testimony of Nurse Practitioner Suzanne Waritz. Hodge argues that it was improper for the ALJ to reject Nurse Practitioner Waritz\u2019s assessment on the ground that Waritz\u2019s testimony in a questionnaire, to the effect that Hodge\u2019s pain and other symptoms were disabling, was contradictory to Waritz\u2019s prior medical chart notes. Hodge contends that the ALJ should have recontacted Waritz for clarification of her opinion instead of disregarding it. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e)(1). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">Waritz is not an acceptable medical source pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(a). She is an \u201cother source\u201d that the ALJ may consider pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(d). An ALJ may reject the testimony of an \u201cother source\u201d by providing reasons germane to that witness. <em>See Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 919 (9th Cir.1993). Here, the ALJ noted that Waritz\u2019s testimony in her questionnaire was out of line with the testimony of Hodge\u2019s other medical sources and did not corroborate Waritz\u2019s own prior physical examinations and observations of Hodge. We conclude that the ALJ was entitled to reject Waritz\u2019s testimony in the questionnaire because the ALJ gave germane reasons from the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>3. Hodge further contends that the ALJ erred by posing an improper vocational hypothetical to a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d). The ALJ posed to the VE this hypothetical: \u201cI am going to limit the claimant to light work, simple routine-type tasks but with a need to be able to change position frequently and alternate between standing and sitting.\u201d Hodge argues that the ALJ erred by not specifying the <em>frequency </em>that Hodge must alternate between sitting and standing. Social Security Ruling 96-9p requires the ALJ to be specific as to frequency of an individual\u2019s need to alternate between sitting and standing when determining whether a claimant\u2019s limitations significantly erode the full range of <em>sedentary </em>work that might be available to the claimant. However, Ruling 96-9p does not apply to light work. Additionally, the VE stated that all the occupations that he identified included \u201cthe option to sit or stand.\u201d We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical to the VE sufficiently set forth all the limitations and restrictions of Hodge. Even if the ALJ was required to state the frequency that Hodge needed to alternate between sitting and standing, any error was harmless because the VE stated that all the jobs that he identified for Hodge included \u201cthe option to sit or stand\u201d at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">4. Hodge also contends that the ALJ erred by improperly ignoring a lay witness statement of Hazel Dryer. An ALJ may not discount lay witness testimony without giving germane reasons for doing so. <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996). Here, however, the ALJ did not reject the lay witness statement of Dryer. The ALJ cited and referred to Dryer\u2019s statement in concluding that Hodge\u2019s lifestyle is inconsistent with total disability. Furthermore, even though Dryer stated that Hodge \u201ccould [not] handle working in a hospital for all the miles of walking and standing on her feet,\u201d this statement was not inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s determination that, although Hodge could not perform her past work as a respiratory therapist, she could perform other work in the economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">5. Finally, Hodge contends that the ALJ erred by failing to comply with Social Security Ruling 00-3p, which states that an ALJ must consider the effects of obesity on the claimant\u2019s ability to function. Social Security Ruling 00-3p also states that the commissioner will evaluate obesity \u201cbased on the information in the case record.\u201d We recently held in <em>Celaya v. Halter, </em>that it was error for an ALJ not to develop the record on an obesity condition when that condition was likely a partial basis for the clamaint\u2019s disability and where the claimant had proceeded pro se and likely never knew that \u201cshe <em>could </em>assert obesity as a partial basis for her disability.\u201d 332 F.3d 1177, 1183 (9th Cir. 2003). Unlike the claimant in <em>Celaya, </em>Hodge did not show that she was impaired from her \u201cmoderate obesity\u201d or that her \u201cmoderate obesity\u201d exacerbated her other disabilities. We agree with the district court that the ALJ properly developed and gave adequate consideration to the medical record.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b826-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-13\">. Hodge also contends that the ALJ erred by improperly ignoring Waritz's characterization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>of Hodge\u2019s manual dexterity limitations in the questionnaire Waritz answered about Hodge. In her questionnaire, Waritz stated that Hodge could only repetitively use her hands, fingers, and arms for short portions of the day. However, the AU permissibly noted that Hodge\u2019s lifestyle was inconsistent with Waritz\u2019s disability determination. Because we conclude that the ALJ properly rejected Waritz\u2019s observations in the questionnaire, we also conclude that the ALJ did not improperly ignore Hodge\u2019s manual dexterity limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
