However, we have read the opinions of Judge Woodside and Judge McClure and are satisfied that they got it right. The standards which are generally applied by virtually all courts across the land in determining whether a motion for relief from automatic stay satisfies the requisites of an informal proof of claim under the Bankruptcy Code are those stated in <em>In re McCoy Management Services, Inc., </em>44 B.R. 215 (B.R.W.D.Ky. 1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-24\">courts have interpreted the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rule to require five elements in order for an informal proof of claim to be valid and amendable:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-25\">(1) the proof of claim must be in writing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-26\">(2) the writing must contain a demand by the creditor on the debtor\u2019s estate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-27\">(3) the writing must express an intent to hold the debtor liable for the debt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-28\">(4) the proof of claim must be filed with the Bankruptcy Court; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-29\">(5) based on the facts of the case, it would be equitable to allow the amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-30\">These requirements are not stricti juris in the sense that any minor deviation will be fatal to the claim. They merely state broad general guidelines, judicially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>formulated, which must be followed if a claim is to be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 217-18. We too will apply them.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">I will not take the time to recite the facts and procedural history \u2014 the tortuous facts and long procedural history of this unfortunate case, which deserves at this late date to be disposed of quickly. The panel is satisfied that no valid purpose would be served to taking this matter under advisement and writing a lengthy opinion. We are satisifed that the motion for relief from automatic stay, which is found at the Appendix, pages 16A-18A, does meet the <em>McCoy </em>requirements \u2014 it is in writing; it contains a demand by the creditor on the debtor\u2019s estate; it expresses an intent to hold the debtor liable for the debt; it has been filed with the Bankruptcy Court; and we feel that it would be equitable to allow the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Mr. Kodak has very forcefully argued that the Turners have in effect abjured proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code and have in effect forfeited their right to contend that they have a valid informal proof of claim by stating that \u201cthey don\u2019t have a claim.\u201d However, we are satisfied that that statement is a function of the rather unusual Illinois statute and procedures which give the disappointed <em>seller </em>the right to claim some kind of equitable damages against the buyer who does not fulfill a contract for sale of real estate. We do not see the Turners having announced or telegraphed that they do not have a claim. Indeed the history of this litigation suggests that they have and that they have long felt that they do. We are satisfied that there was an informal proof of claim filed here. Judge McClure in his opinion affirming Judge Woodside\u2019s order was satisfied that there was a valid informal proof of claim filed here, and we are satisfied that both Judge Woodside and Judge McClure were correct. The notice of appeal is from the order entered October 21, 2001. That order will be affirmed and this bench opinion will be transcribed and constitute the opinion and judgment of the Court. The formal judgment of the Court will follow. I simply want to add that Judge McClure\u2019s order concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">We agree with the Bankruptcy Court that the motion for relief from the stay constitutes an informal proof of claim subject to amendment after the claims bar date since attorneys properly amended their proof of claim, the claim is not barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">We announce our endorsement of that. Judge Barry, anything to add?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">Judge Barry: I would simply add as Judge Becker noted that the final order in this case was not Judge McClure\u2019s but was entered by the Honorable John E. Jones, III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">Judge Becker: Yes, of course, it was Judge Jones. Judge McClure did the opinion, but the order was done by Judge Jones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">Judge Barry: The attorneys have argued this very, very capably and we thank them for that.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
