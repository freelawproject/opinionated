The district court held that Article III standing had not been established. We consider de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). <em>McGraw v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 997, 1001 (9th Cir.2002), <em>as amended, </em>298 F.3d 754 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">To establish standing, APORPMA must meet three requirements. First, APORPMA \u201cmust show that [they have] suffered an \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019 to a legally-protected interest that is both \u2018concrete and particularized\u2019 and \u2018actual and imminent,\u2019 as opposed to \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical.\u2019 \u201d <em>LSO, Ltd, v. Stroh, </em>205 F.3d 1146, 1152 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Second, APORPMA \u201cmust show a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1153. Third, APORPMA must show that it is \u201c \u2018likely\u2019not merely speculative-that [their] injury will be \u2018redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">APORPMA has cited a number of incidents in which they allege the Suquamish tribe has unlawfully exercised jurisdiction over them. This showing of past enforcement consists of three traffic citations since 1982, a consensual search conducted by Tribal police and County authorities, and a stop work order issued by the County. While these events demonstrate that the Tribe has exercised its jurisdiction to a minimal degree, APORPMA\u2019s allegations do not establish a \u201csufficiently imminent threat of injury\u201d to create a case or controversy. <em>Mayfield v. Dalton, </em>109 F.3d 1423, 1425 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">APORPMA. also alleges that they will be injured by sewage and traffic problems resulting from the proposed Angeline housing development. However, there is no evidence that APORPMA faces any actual and imminent injury. Any threat of injury is at best remote and speculative, and courts \u201chave repeatedly found a lack of standing where the litigant\u2019s claim relies upon a chain of speculative contingencies.\u201d <em>Lee v. Oregon, </em>107 F.3d 1382, 1389 (9th Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">APORPMA alleges that non-Indians residing on Tribal lands face a constant threat of enforcement of Tribal laws or exercise of Tribal jurisdiction. <em>Appellants\u2019 Opening Brief </em>at 22-23. However, \u201cneither the mere existence of a proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution satisfies the \u2018case or controversy\u2019 requirement.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Anchorage Equal Rights Comm\u2019n, </em>220 F.3d 1134, 1139 (9th Cir.2000)(en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">In short, APORPMA has not presented a case or controversy sufficient to warrant consideration of the issues presented. The district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
