Shadur, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b801-22\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-24\">Antonio Bugarin-Juarez (\u201cBugarin\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>motion for a preliminary injunction, filed concurrently with a petition for habeas corpus, that sought to preclude the United States Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) from transferring him from the community correctional facility where he was serving his 12 month sentence to a federal penal facility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 10, 2003 the respondentsappellees moved to dismiss the appeal as moot because, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(c), the BOP no longer sought to transfer Bugarin, who was serving the final 10% of his sentence, to a federal jail or prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">On July 3, 2003, while that motion and this appeal were pending, Bugarin was in fact discharged from BOP custody. Because Bugarin has been released and can no longer be subject to the BOP\u2019s assignment policies, his claim for injunctive relief is now moot <em>(Dilley v. Gunn, </em>64 F.3d 1365, 1368 (9th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">None of the exceptions to mootness on which Bugarin seeks to rely is applicable here. As explained in <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 17, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted, and emphasis added), a claim is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review\u201d only where \u201cthere is a reasonable expectation that the <em>same </em>complaining party will be subject to the <em>same </em>action again.\u201d There is no possibility here (let alone any expectation) that Bugarin can face BOP reassignment, because he is no longer in BOP custody.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And although Bugarin\u2019s submissions refer to other cases challenging BOP\u2019s assignment policy, there is no class certification here that would allow the case to continue despite its mootness as to named plaintiff Bugarin (contrast <em>Sosna v. Iowa, </em>419 U.S. 393, 399, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Accordingly, respondents\u2019 motion is granted. We DISMISS this appeal for lack of jurisdiction <em>(see, e.g., Sample v. Johnson, </em>771 F.2d 1335, 1338 (9th Cir. 1985)).</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b801-28\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-7\">. On January 24, 2003 a motion panel of this court granted a motion by Bugarin for an emergency stay and enjoined the BOP from transferring Bugarin to a federal jail or prison. Although Bugarin\u2019s motion was originally styled as a motion for a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\u201d), the panel also ruled that the district court\u2019s denial of the TRO was tantamount to denial of a preliminary injunction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-16\">. Any hypothetical prospect that Bugarin might again become subject to BOP assignment policies if he were to violate his supervised release, get caught, be found guilty of the violation and be incarcerated once more is far too \"iffy\u201d to establish current standing <em>(Spencer, </em>523 U.S. at 15, 118 S.Ct. 978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
