We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the determination unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1090-91 (9th Cir.2000). We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Singh lied about being a member of the All India Sikh Students Federation (\u201cAISSF\u201d), because he did not testify to performing \u201cmeaningful\u201d duties for the AISSF, was impermissibly based on the IJ\u2019s conjecture about what duties an AISSF member would perform. <em>See Bandari v. INS, </em>227 F.3d 1160, 1167-68 (9th Cir.2000). Singh\u2019s testimony must therefore be considered credible. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 603 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The record compels the conclusion that Singh was persecuted on account of his political opinion because his credible testimony established that he was arrested by Indian police and tortured for his political activities. <em>See Gonzales-Neyra v. INS, </em>122 F.3d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">The IJ\u2019s country condition findings do not rebut the presumption that Singh would be subject to future persecution because he testified that he was arrested and tortured for his political activities <em>after </em>the general country conditions improved. <em>See Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1079 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
