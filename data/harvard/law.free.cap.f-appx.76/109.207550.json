Lansford sought disability insurance benefits asserting he was disabled by obesity, hypertension, chronic knee problems, status post-prostate cancer, urinary stress incontinence, and degenerative joint disease. An administrative law judge (ALJ) held Lansford was not disabled before his insured status expired. The ALJ found Lansford\u2019s impairments or combination of impairments did not meet or equal any listed impairment, Lansford\u2019s claims of physical disability were not credible, and Lansford retained the residual functional capacity to perform medium work in the national economy. The district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-15\">Because substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, we affirm the denial of benefits. First, the ALJ properly found Lansford\u2019s impairments or combination of impairments did not meet or equal any listed impairment. The listing for arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint was not met because Lansford did not have a gross anatomical deformity of his hip or knee or reconstructive surgery or surgical arthrodesis. The ALJ also adequately considered Lansford\u2019s obesity, from which Lansford suffered years before the alleged onset of disability. Second, the ALJ properly discredited Lansford\u2019s subjective complaints based on the lack of supporting objective medical evidence, Lansford\u2019s noneompliance with recommended treatment, his reported search for other work and receipt of unemployment benefits, his daily activities, and the lack of any contemporaneous report of disability by his doctors. Third, the ALJ properly decided Lansford retained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>residual functional capacity to perform medium work based on the impairments the ALJ found to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Having considered and rejected all of Lansford\u2019s arguments, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s memorandum and order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b138-11\">The Honorable Catherine D.
