An administrative law judge (ALJ) decided Barton was not disabled because she had the residual functional capacity to perform a significant range of light work and there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy she could perform. While Barton\u2019s case was pending before the Appeals Council, she filed a new application for benefits and another ALJ found Barton was disabled beginning March 8, 2000. The Appeals Council in the earlier action found the later claim reflected a deterioration in Barton\u2019s mental condition and concluded substantial evidence supported the earlier ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits beginning January 1, 1989. Barton sought judicial review, and the district court <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits based on a magistrate judge\u2019s fifty-page report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-19\">On appeal, Barton contends the ALJ improperly assessed her residual functional capacity because he failed to provide medical grounds for his decision, faded to incorporate Barton\u2019s mental limitations, and posed an incomplete hypothetical question. Barton also contends the ALJ improperly discounted the opinion of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>treating psychiatrist. Having carefully reviewed Barton\u2019s contentions, the record, and the applicable law, we conclude substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny benefits. Because we have nothing to add to the magistrate judge\u2019s analysis as amended by the district court, we affirm without additional discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b786-14\"> The Honorable Carol E.
