Beistline, United States District Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b847-13\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">Petitioner Preston Roosevelt Catlin (\u201cCatlin\u201d) appeals the denial of his 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition challenging his conviction and his sentence of life without parole plus four years. More specifically, Catlin contends: (1) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to voir dire potential jurors on the issue of racial basis; (2) his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move for change of venue; and (3) that the trial court failed to ensure an unbiased jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">The Court concludes there was no ineffective assistance with respect to the voir dire of jurors about race since Catlin failed to proffer any evidence as to actual bias, and there was no showing that a different result would have occurred had counsel questioned the jury panel concerning their attitude(s) toward race. Indeed, not only was the circumstantial evidence against Catlin overwhelming; but, because \u201cone black person ultimately served on the jury, Catlin\u2019s jury panel composition was exactly 1 to 11 \u2014 the same ratio as defense counsel for Catlin alleged the state\u2019s racial distribution to be.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-19\">Moreover, there was no ineffective assistance in the failure to move for a change in venue since Catlin has neither (1) shown a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different had counsel made a motion for a change in venue, nor (2) demonstrated that a motion for change of venue would have been meritorious. In fact, it is highly unlikely, in accordance with California law, that such a request would have been granted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-20\">As to the alleged due process violation, the trial court had no duty to raise the race issue, and/or to test jury bias, absent a request by counsel. <em>Turner v. Murray, </em>476 U.S. 28, 37, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27 (1986) (\u201c[A] defendant cannot complain of a judge\u2019s failure to question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>the venire on racial prejudice unless the defendant has specifically requested such an inquiry.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Consequently, the district court\u2019s judgment denying Catlin\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b847-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
