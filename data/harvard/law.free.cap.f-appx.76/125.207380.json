We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-29\">The district court correctly held that it lacked federal jurisdiction to award injunctive or declaratory relief from decisions of the state court. <em>See Doe &amp; </em>As<em>socs. Law Offices v. Napolitano, </em>252 F.3d 1026, 1029 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Thompson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Thompson, </em>798 F.2d 1547, 1558 (9th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The district court properly found that the Eleventh Amendment barred Tjoelker\u2019s claims against the State of California and state employees acting in their official capacities. <em>See Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., </em>931 F.2d 1320, 1327 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The judge defendants are entitled to absolute immunity for the actions alleged in the complaint. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-57, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>Ashelman v. Pope, </em>793 F.2d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The due process claims brought against the state employees in their individual capacities and the Sonoma County Department of Child Protective Services were properly dismissed because failure to investigate a claim of child abuse does not state a due process violation. <em>See DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 197, 201-02, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The actions alleged against the remaining Sonoma County Defendants are barred by the applicable one-year statute of limitations. <em>See Elliott v. City of Union City, </em>25 F.3d 800, 802 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The claims against the remaining defendants were properly dismissed because Tjoelker failed to demonstrate that they were state actors for purposes of section 1983. <em>See Kirtley v. Rainey, </em>326 F.3d 1088, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Radclijfe v. Rainbow Constr. Co., </em>254 F.3d 772, 783 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 were properly dismissed because \u201cthe absence of a section 1983 deprivation of rights precludes a section 1985 conspiracy claim predicated on the same allegations.\u201d <em>See Caldeira v. County of Kauai, </em>866 F.2d 1175, 1181 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">The district court acted within its discretion in dismissing the state law claims without prejudice. <em>See Imagineering, Inc. v. Kiewit Pacific Co., </em>976 F.2d 1303, 1309 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">We have not considered the claims Tjoelker brought on behalf of his minor son because the minor son\u2019s counsel filed a document with this court stating that he \u201cdoes not appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of the Minor\u2019s action without prejudice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">We grant the motion to take judicial notice of the materials that Tjoelker submitted to the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">We reject the remaining contentions as lacking merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b153-30\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
