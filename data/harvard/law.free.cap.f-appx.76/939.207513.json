Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Albert Morgan, Jr.\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Morgan has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-13\">The certified list of docket entries of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reflects that the judgment denying Morgan\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus was entered on November 15, 2002. The list further reflects that Morgan filed his notice of appeal on January 28, 2003, more than 60 days later.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Thus, Morgan\u2019s appeal is untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-17\">The time limits of Rule 4 are jurisdictional. <em>See Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., </em>459 U.S. 56, 61, 103 S. Ct. 400, 74 L.Ed.2d 225 (1982) (\u201cIt is well settled that the requirement of a timely notice of appeal is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019\u201d (citation omitted)). Thus, Morgan\u2019s failure to file timely a notice of appeal may not be waived. <em>See Christianson v. Colt Operating Indus. Corp., </em>486 U.S. 800, 818, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988) (court may not extend its jurisdiction where none exists); <em>Placeway Constr. Corp. v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 726, 728 (Fed.Cir.1983). Because Morgan did not timely file a notice of appeal, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-19\">Alternatively, we note that in his informal brief, Morgan states that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u201cerred because it didn\u2019t issue an order commanding respondent to continue to process the approve[d] claim C.U.E. under 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3105(a) by taking the false degenerative arthritis off the V.A. rating sheet dated June 22, 1983 and replace it with the word sarcoid and pay the 100 percent rating.\u201d Morgan does not does not challenge the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation or raise a constitutional issue. Therefore, our limited jurisdiction does not permit review. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2) (court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-20\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b968-14\"> We note that in his notice of appeal Morgan indicates that he also seeks review of the January 9, 2003 order of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims denying his motion for leave to file out of time a motion for reconsideration. However, in his informal brief Morgan makes no arguments concerning the January 9, 2003 decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
