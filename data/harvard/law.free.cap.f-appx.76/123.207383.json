However, we must accept the district court\u2019s findings regarding the scale of M2 Software\u2019s business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>unless we have a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we do not.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">M2 Software also argues that the district court erred by failing to consider likelihood of confusion as to \u201csource\u201d and focused only on likelihood of confusion as to goods. However, the district court employed the analysis from <em>AMF v. Sleek-craft Boats</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in evaluating M2 Software\u2019s assertions regarding likelihood of confusion. In so doing, the district court did evaluate whether a likelihood of confusion as to source exists in the minds of consumers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">M2 Software argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the doctrine of reverse confusion. However, M2 Software\u2019s mere use of the term \u201cvice versa\u201d was insufficient to raise this issue properly to the district court. As neither M2 Software\u2019s first amended complaint nor motion clearly raised this issue to the district court, we decline to consider it on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Finally, M2 Software argues that the district court improperly applied the <em>Sleekcraft </em>factors in evaluating whether M2 Communications\u2019s use of the M2 mark would create a likelihood of confusion. We disagree. Although the district court erred in considering M2 Software\u2019s sales and advertising in determining the \u201cstrength\u201d of its mark,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we find that the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Sleekcraft </em>factors as a whole did not amount to an abuse of discretion. Further, because M2 Software\u2019s federal registration and the incontestability of that registration go to the ownership of the M2 mark, they do not bear on the M2 mark\u2019s strength and do not affect the likelihood of confusion analysis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-15\">M2 Software\u2019s arguments raised in the questions presented or its reply brief but not argued in the opening brief are waived.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">The appeal as to Gaylord is moot, and must therefore be dismissed, because the district court dismissed the case against Gaylord for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b151-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\">. <em>See Gonzalez-Caballero v.
