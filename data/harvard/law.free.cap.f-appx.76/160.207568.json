We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>Hernandez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1090-91 (9th Cir.2000). We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">It is uncontested that Singh\u2019s testimony must be considered credible because the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility finding. <em>See Kataria v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1114 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">The record compels the conclusion that Singh was persecuted on account of his political opinion because his credible testimony established that he was arrested by Indian police and beaten over a four day period for his political activities. <em>See id. </em>Singh is therefore entitled to a presumption that he holds a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See Ladha v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 889, 897 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Accordingly, we remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b189-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
