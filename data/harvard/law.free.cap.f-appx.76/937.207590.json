Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Jan Lister\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction or, in the alternative, for summary affirmance of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision dismissing Lister\u2019s\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Lister has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-19\">Lister filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims from a September 3, 2002 Board decision pertaining to her husband. In Lister\u2019s husband\u2019s Board decision, the Board noted that Lister \u201chas made statements suggesting she is also a veteran,\u201d but noted that she had failed to submit \u201cthe required documentation of service.\u201d The Secretary moved to dismiss Lister\u2019s appeal because, in the absence of a final Board decision as to any benefits claim filed by Lister (as opposed to her husband), Lister had not exhausted her administrative remedies. Finding no Board decision in Lister\u2019s name on the record, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims directed Lister to show cause why her appeal should not be dismissed for failure to appeal from a final Board decision. In response, Lister \u201cargue[d] that she is entitled to benefits but [did] not address the Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d to review her appeal in the absence of a final Board decision. Because there was no final Board decision in Lister\u2019s name to review, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed Lister\u2019s appeal pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a). Lister appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-20\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292, this court has limited jurisdiction over appeals from decisions of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). Lister\u2019s appeal does not satisfy any of the grounds for invoking this court\u2019s jurisdiction. In her informal brief, Lister states that she is \u201centitled to 1% of the national debt\u201d pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692 (concerning debt collection practices) and cites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5101 (concerning claims, effective dates, and payments of veterans\u2019 benefits) with no explanation other than an allegation that because she has been deemed disabled by the Social Security Administration, she is entitled to \u201call benefits.\u201d She also lists \u201cVeterans Claims Assistance Act and ADA\u201d and asserts that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \u201cfailed to decide the human factor 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d Lister fails to explain how the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision involved the validity or interpretation of any of these statutes and she does not elaborate on any alleged constitutional issues other than stating \u201ceverything is done by the court to prolong due process.\u201d Her informal brief makes no mention of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 application or interpretation of section 7266 pertaining to Lister\u2019s failure to appeal from a final Board decision adjudicating any claim for benefits she might have.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Lister asks this court to \u201cprovide due process and credit where credit is due,\u201d and states that she is entitled \u201cto food dollars, medical care, house payments, lump-sum payments, free legal help, home improvements, pensions, dental care, [social security] supplements, clothing, transportation, heat and air, lights, telephone, water.\u201d However, because Lister fails to make any specific claims concerning constitutional issues or the validity or interpretation of any statute or regulation implicated by the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision, Lister\u2019s appeal is not within this court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">(1) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">(3) The Secretary\u2019s alternative motion for summary affirmance is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
