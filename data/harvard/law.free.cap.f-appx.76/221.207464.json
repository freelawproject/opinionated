Accordingly, they claimed that the application of IIRIRA\u2019s removal provisions to them was impermissibly retroactive. They also argued that because the denial of an asylum application <em>necessarily </em>results in an INS proceeding, their case is distinguishable from <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594 (9th Cir.2002), and that their placement in removal proceedings violated their due process rights. As the Lopezes concede, however, their arguments are now foreclosed by <em>Vasquez-Zavala v. INS, </em>324 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, the Lopezes\u2019 petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
