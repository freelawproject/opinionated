We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. Hern<em>andez-Montiel v. INS, </em>225 F.3d 1084, 1090-91 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">We assume Centeno-Prado\u2019s testimony was credible because the IJ did not make an explicit adverse credibility finding. <em>See Katana v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1113-14 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">Centeno-Prado failed to establish that he suffered past persecution because the death threats made by the Guatemalan military were not \u201cespecially menacing\u201d or combined with confrontation or other mistreatment. <em>See Lim v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Centeno-Prado did not establish an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution because his father lived safely in Guatemala for several years after the military threatened to kill them both for his father\u2019s alleged eavesdropping. <em>See Anita v. INS, </em>80 F.3d 1389, 1395 (9th Cir.1996). Furthermore, Centeno-Prado did not submit specific, direct, or credible evidence to show that the military still desired to persecute him for his efforts in 1988 to educate the indigenous people of Guatemala about their human rights. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 969-70 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Centeno-Prado necessarily failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal because he failed to meet the standard for asylum. <em>Rivera-Moreno v. INS, </em>213 F.3d 481, 487 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b188-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
