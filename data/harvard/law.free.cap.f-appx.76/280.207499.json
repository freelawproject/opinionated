R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-18\">Louie M. Acevedo, a prisoner in the custody of the State of Utah, filed this civil rights complaint against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. According to his complaint, he started smoking at the age of 11, and recently, at the age of 47, suffered severe health problems relating to his continued and heavy tobacco use.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">The district court dismissed his suit on the ground that R.J. Reynolds is a private entity, not liable under \u00a7 1983 in the absence of proof that the company acted under color of state law. In his handwritten brief in this Court, where he appears pro se, Mr. Acevedo offers no argument in response to the district court\u2019s reasoning, in the apparent misapprehension that his suit was dismissed for failure to pay filing fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-24\">Seeing no error in the district court\u2019s analysis, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-19\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
