King appeals his sentence resulting from the district court\u2019s revocation of his term of supervised release. Because King admitted to the violations of the conditions of his supervised release, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking the term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). We must next decide if the sentence imposed by the district court was plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000). King had two previous revocation hearings before the district court and was warned that his next appearance would result in jail time. The district court was also aware that the United States Sentencing Guidelines recommended a range of imprisonment between five and eleven months given King\u2019s violations. The court also considered mitigating evidence offered by King before revoking the supervised release. Given King\u2019s two prior revocation hearings before the district court and the fact that the court\u2019s sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>within the recommended range of the Sentencing Guidelines, King\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Accordingly, King\u2019s sentence is affirmed. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
