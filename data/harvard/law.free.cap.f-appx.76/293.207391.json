Dyax Corp., </em>226 F.Supp.2d 314 (D.Mass.2002); <em>Pieczenik v. Dyax Corp., </em>Civ. Action No. 00-11370-RGS, 2003 WL 1562239 (D.Mass. Feb. 25, 2003). This court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-20\">In its Markman ruling, the district court construed two phrases appearing only in the \u2019363 patent: \u201cfrom about 4 to about 12\u201d and \u201cat least about 10% of all possible peptide sequences\u201d <em>Pieczenik, </em>226 F.Supp.2d at 321. In addition to the two phrases in the claims of the \u2019363 patent, the district court construed one claim term, \u201coligonucleotide,\u201d in the claims of the \u2019363, \u2019535, and \u2019266 patents. <em>Pieczenik, </em>226 F.Supp.2d at 322. After the district court construed the claims, Dr. Pieczenik moved for partial summary judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>infringement of the \u2019363 patent. Dyax, in turn, cross-moved for summary judgment of noninfringement of all three asserted patents. Apparently conceding noninfringement of the \u2019535 and \u2019266 patents in light of the district court\u2019s claim construction, Dr. Pieczenik did not oppose Dyax\u2019s cross-motions for summary judgment of noninfringement of those patents. Accordingly, the district court granted Dyax\u2019s motion on the \u2019535 and \u2019266 patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Dr. Pieczenik, however, did not concede noninfringement of the \u2019363 patent. Nevertheless, Dr. Pieczenik did not dispute the facts introduced by Dyax, and thus the district court deemed those facts admitted. It, therefore, granted summary judgment on the asserted claims of the \u2019363 patent, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">Because it is undisputed that (1) Dyax\u2019s phage libraries do not meet the \u201cabout 4 to about 12\u201d claim limitation (according to the affidavit of Robert Ladner, Dyax\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer, the smallest Dyax library is 18 nucleotide triplets in length, while the largest exceeds 100 nucleotide triplets), and (2) that Dyax\u2019s phage libraries do not meet the \u201cat least about 10% of all possible peptide sequences\u201d claim limitation (according to the Ladner affidavit the actual number for all libraries is less than one trillionth of the possible peptide sequences), there can be no literal infringement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\"><em>Pieczenik, </em>Civ. Action No. 00-11370-RGS, 2003 WL 1562239, *2 (D.Mass. Feb. 25, 2003). The district court also determined that Dyax\u2019s accused products would not infringe the \u2019363 patent under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">A determination of infringement requires two steps. \u201cFirst, the court determines the scope and meaning of the patent claims asserted. [Second,] the properly construed claims are compared to the allegedly infringing device.\u201d <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454 (Fed.Cir.1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted). Step one, claim construction, is an issue of law, <em>Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., </em>52 F.3d 967, 970-71 (Fed. Cir.1995) <em>(en banc), aff'd, </em>517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577 (1996), that this court reviews without deference, <em>Cybor, </em>138 F.3d at 1456. Step two, comparison of the claim to the accused device, is a question of fact that requires the patent holder to establish that the accused device includes every claim limitation or its equivalent. Warn<em>er-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 29, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997). Summary judgment is appropriate where the record shows \u201cthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). This court reviews a grant of summary judgment by a district court <em>de novo. Cortland Line Co. v. Orvis Co., </em>203 F.3d 1351, 1355-56 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s appeal focuses solely on the district court\u2019s claim construction. This court understands that Dr. Pieczenik argues for the construction of three terms, only one of which coincides with the terms that the district court addressed. Specifically, Dr. Pieczenik appeals the constructions of \u201ccombinatorial libraries,\u201d \u201chaving,\u201d and \u201coligonucleotide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">\u201cIn construing claims, the analytical focus must begin and remain centered on the language of the claims themselves, for it is that language that the patentee chose to use to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which patentee regards as his invention.\u201d <em>Interactive Gift Express, Inc. v. Compuserve, Inc., </em>256 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>F.3d 1323, 1331 (Fed.Cir.2001) (quotation omitted). The terms used in the claims bear a \u201cheavy presumption\u201d that they mean what they say and have the ordinary meaning that would be attributed to those words by persons skilled in the relevant art. <em>CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp., </em>288 F.3d 1359, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2002). With respect to the ordinary meaning of the words, a court may consult a dictionary, encyclopedia, or treatise. <em>Tex. Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix Inc., </em>308 F.3d 1193, 1202 (Fed.Cir.2002). Moreover, \u201c[a]bsent an express intent to impart a novel meaning, claim terms on take their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Elektra Instrument S.A. v. O.U.R. Scientific Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>214 F.3d 1302, 1307 (Fed.Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As previously noted, Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s appeal invokes two terms that were not addressed by the district court: \u201ccombinatorial libraries\u201d and \u201chaving.\u201d As an initial matter, this court notes that \u201ccombinatorial libraries\u201d does not appear in any of the claims of the asserted patents. Because claim construction requires focus on particular claim language, this court is reticent to construe a term not present in the claims, especially a term not construed by the district court. Accordingly, Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s challenge with respect to \u201ccombinatorial libraries\u201d fails. <em>Vivid Techs., Inc. v. Am. Sci. &amp; Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 795, 803 (Fed.Cir.1999) (\u201c[O]nly those terms need be construed that are in controversy, and only to the extent necessary to resolve the controversy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Dr. Pieczenik argues that \u201chaving\u201d is open-ended and, thus, equivalent to \u201ccomprising.\u201d While \u201chaving\u201d may mean, in certain contexts, \u201ccomprising,\u201d this court has never equated the two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">The transition \u201chaving\u201d can also make a claim open. However, the term \u201chaving\u201d does not convey the open-ended meaning as strongly as \u201ccomprising.\u201d \u201cHaving,\u201d for instance, does not create a presumption that the body of the claim is open.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\"><em>Crystal Semiconductor Corp. v. TriTech Microelectronics Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>246 F.3d 1336, 1348 (Fed.Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Examining the term within context of the claims, this court concludes that this usage of \u201chaving\u201d is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The asserted independent claims of the \u2019363 patent, namely claim 24 and 34, contain the phrases \u201csaid oligonucleotide population has a coding region having a length from about 4 to about 12 nucleotide triplets\u201d and \u201ceach structural gene having inserted therein one member of an oligonucleotide population wherein each member of said oligonucleotide population has a length from about 4 to about 12 nucleotide triplets.\u201d \u2019363 patent, col. 46,11. 55-57; col. 47,11. 56-60. Because the claims refer to a coding region that designates multiple nucleotide triplets, i.e., about 4 to about 12, the claims manifest an objective intent to close their scope to oligonucleotide populations consisting of members of specified lengths. In other words, substituting \u201ccomprising\u201d for \u201chaving\u201d would read the specificity-in particular, the upper bound of \u201cabout 12\u201d-out of the claim. <em>See Tex. Instruments, Inc. v. United States Int\u2019l Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>988 F.2d 1165, 1171 (Fed. Cir.1993). Thus, \u201chaving,\u201d in this context, is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">Lastly, Dr. Pieczenik challenges the construction of \u201coligonucleotide.\u201d Rather than construe the claim blindly, this court begins with a careful consideration of the district court\u2019s opinion regarding this claim term. <em>Key Pharms. v. Hercon Labs. Corp., </em>161 F.3d 709, 713 (Fed.Cir. 1998). With respect to the \u2019535 and \u2019266 patents, Dr. Pieczenik argued before the district court that \u201c\u2018oligonucleotide\u2019 as used in these two patents would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>art to mean a polymer of nucleotides comprising at least a few nucleotides in length and not usually more than about 100.\u2019\u201d <em>Pieczenik, </em>226 F.Supp.2d at 322 (quoting Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s Markman Brief at 18). With respect to the \u2019363 patent, however, Dr. Pieczenik argued that the file history \u201c \u2018makes clear\u2019 that the \u2018oligonucleotide\u2019 as used in that patent signifies an oligonucleotide with \u2018an upper limit at about 600 to about 750 nucleotide triplets in length.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s Markman Brief at 8). But the district court dismissed Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s attempt to broaden the plain meaning of oligonucleotide using the \u2019363 patent\u2019s prosecution history, instead construing the term according to scientific and medical texts. The district court thus construed oligonucleotide as \u201ca compound created by the condensation of a small number of nucleotides with 20 specified as the upper limit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Because the \u2019535 and \u2019266 patents<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> do not share the same lineage as the \u2019363 patent, their claim terms in the first two patents must be construed separately. <em>See Biovail Corp. Int\u2019l v. Andrx Pharms., Inc., </em>239 F.3d 1297, 1301 (Fed.Cir.2001). Independently evaluating the specifications of the \u2019535 and \u2019266 patents, this court agrees that there is no \u201cexpress intent to impart a novel meaning.\u201d <em>Elektra Instrument, </em>214 F.3d at 1307. Thus, \u201coligonucleotide\u201d takes its common, ordinary meaning with respect to these patents. Dyax provides three references that define \u201coligonucleotide.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The first defines it as \u201c[a] compound made up of a small number of nucleotides (2 to 10).\u201d <em>Melloni\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>343 (1979). The second defines it as \u201ca polymer made up of a few (2 to 10) nucleotides.\u201d <em>Dorland\u2019s Illustrated Medical Dictionary </em>920 (26th ed. 1981). And the third defines it as \u201c[a] compound made up of the condensation of a small number of nucleotides.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>980 (24th ed. 1982).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because these definitions do not vary significantly, this court holds that \u201coligonucleotide\u201d means, for the purposes of the \u2019535 and \u2019266 patents, \u201ca compound made up of two to ten nucleotides.\u201d Even though this court adopts a slightly different claim construction than the district court, any error is harmless. A determination of noninfringement under a broader claim construction compels a determination of noninfringement under a narrower claim construction. <em>Cf. Teleflex, Inc. v. Ficosa N. Am. Corp., </em>299 F.3d 1313, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2002) (\u201cIf a reasonable juror could have found literal infringement under a more narrow reading of claim 1, then the same reasonable juror could not have avoided finding literal infringement under the correct, broader construction of the claim. Thus, the district court\u2019s error was harmless.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The \u2019363 patent, however, yields a different conclusion. The patentee became a lexicographer and particularly defined \u201coligonucleotide.\u201d <em>See Beachcombers Int\u2019l, Inc. v. WildeWood Creative Prods., Inc., </em>31 F.3d 1154, 1158 (Fed.Cir.1994). In part, the patent states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-4\">The oligonucleotide population may also be composed of members, each of which contains the same number of tandem repeats of each peptide coding sequence, where the number of tandem repeats is from two to about fifty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">\u00ed \u00ed \u00cd</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-6\">The recombinant vector population can also be made up of individual vectors each containing the same number of tandem repeats of an oligonucleotide sequence as defined above. The number of tandem repeats can be from two to about fifty in number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">The recombinant vector population can also be made up of individual vectors each containing the same number [of] tandem repeats of an oligonucleotide sequence as defined above. The number of tandem repeats can be from two to about fifty in number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u2019363 patent, col. 3, 11. 58-62; col. 4, 11. 41-51. These passages indicate that an oligonucleotide has from two to about fifty tandem repeats, i.e., an oligonucleotide is a polymer with a number of nucleotides ranging from four to about one-hundred. Nevertheless, the context of the disputed claims of the \u2019363 patent demonstrate that any error on the part of the district court was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">As noted above with respect to \u201chaving,\u201d claims 24 and 34 recite similar limitations: \u201csaid oligonucleotide population has a coding region having a length from about 4 to about 12 nucleotide triplets\u201d and \u201ceach structural gene having inserted therein one member of an oligonucleotide population wherein each member of said oligonucleotide population has a length from about 4 to about 12 nucleotide triplets.\u201d \u2019363 patent, col. 46,11. 55-57; col. 47,11. 56-60. While \u201coligonucleotide\u201d has a more expansive meaning set forth in the written description, these claims particularly limit the number of nucleotide triplets to a number ranging from about 4 to about 12. In other words, the <em>claimed </em>oligonucleotides are chosen from a oligonucleotide population with lengths ranging from about 4 to about 12. The <em>claimed </em>oligonucleotides, therefore, are a subset of oligonucleotides as defined by the \u2019363 patent. It is undisputed that the smallest Dyax library is 18 nucleotide triplets in length. <em>Pieczenik, </em>Civ. Action No. 00-11370-RGS, 2003 WL 1562239 at *2. Accordingly, Dyax does not infringe claims 24 and 34 of the \u2019363 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">This court considered Dr. Pieczenik\u2019s other arguments but finds none persuasive. Because the district court properly granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the \u2019363, \u2019535, and \u2019266 patents, this court affirms.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-11\">. The \u2019266 patent is a divisional of the '535 patent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\">. Neither party has argued that because the '266 patent is a divisional of the '535 patent, they should be analyzed separately. Thus, the court assumes that the same interpretation should be treated as the same. <em>See Desper Prods., Inc. v. QSound Labs, Inc., </em>157 F.3d 1325, 1338 n. 5 (Fed.Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b325-7\">. The ordinary, common meaning of \"oligonucleotide\u201d is not alleged to have changed between the filing date of the '535 patent, i.e., Oct. 1, 1979, and the issue dates of the '535 patent, i.e., Nov. 16, 1982, or the '266 patent, i.e., July 9, 1985. Thus, this court need not decide which precise date among those should fix the meaning. <em>Inverness Med. Switz. GmbH v. Princeton Biomeditech Corp., </em>309 F.3d 1365, 1370 n. 1 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b325-11\">. A later version, published after the relevant timeframe, refines the definition: \"A compound made up of the condensation of a small number <em>(typically less than twenty) </em>of nucleotides.\u201d <em>Stedman\u2019s Medical Dictionary </em>1244 (26th ed. 1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
