We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Fung Choi Wong is a Chinese national who attempted to enter the United States at Newark International Airport in 1992. Because she lacked a valid, unexpired visa she was placed in exclusion proceedings by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. When Wong arrived in the United States, her husband was already here, having left China sometime before she did. Wong conceded her excludability but applied for asylum and withholding of her deportation. In her application, she stated that her reason for leaving China was to escape the tyrannical Chinese government. She mentioned that the Chinese authorities were attempting to make her pay a fine for having her second child and that they had given her notice that she was to be sterilized. App. II at 233. However, the application made no mention that the Chinese government had actually sterilized her. Thereafter, in her first exclusion hearing in 1993, Wong testified that she had been forcibly sterilized in 1990. <em>Id. </em>at 175. She also testified that she had left China, in part, to conceive a daughter and to avoid the consequences of opposing the Chinese family planning policy. <em>Id. </em>at 172-73. Finding that Wong was not credible, the Immigration Judge denied her applications for asylum and withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Wong then appealed the decision to the BIA, but the BIA dismissed the appeal. In the fall of 1997, Wong moved to have the BIA reconsider its decision in light of medical records showing that she had been sterilized and in light of changes to the immigration law dealing with forced sterilization and abortion. In February 1998, the BIA granted the motion and remanded the case to the Immigration Judge. <em>Id. </em>at 114. After examining and considering the additional evidence and the change in the immigration law, the IJ again denied Wong\u2019s claim, basing this denial on Wong\u2019s lack of credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Wong again appealed to the BIA, but the BIA dismissed her appeal and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. After examining the record, the BIA concluded that questions concerning Wong\u2019s credibility remained even after the submission of the new evidence. The BIA specifically pointed to the following: (1) Wong\u2019s failure to mention the forced sterilization in her asylum application; (2) the lack of detail in her testimony concerning the alleged forced sterilization; (3) her failure to produce corroborating testimony; (4) the lack of a statement from her husband about her opposition to her own sterilization; and (5) the fact that Wong already had two male children. Taken together, the BIA concluded, these factors called \u201cinto question the degree\u201d of Wong\u2019s \u201copposition to her own sterilization.\u201d App. I at 4. The BIA also found Wong\u2019s explanation that she had omitted mention of the sterilization from the asylum application because she could not find her sterilization certificate to be \u201cunconvincing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the BIA noted that Wong had wholly failed to address these credibility concerns on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">An alien seeking asylum bears the burden of establishing that he or she is a \u201crefugee\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a). In order to qualify as a \u201crefugee,\u201d an alien must show that he or she has been subject to \u201cpersecution\u201d or harbors a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). To successfully petition for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), an alien must \u201cshow that if returned to his country, it is more likely than not that the alien\u2019s life or freedom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Amanfi v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 719, 726 (3d Cir.2003); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In addition, a person will \u201cbe deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion\u201d if she \u201chas been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization\u201d or \u201chas been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Under the law applicable here, a determination that an applicant is ineligible for asylum \u201cmust be upheld if \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under this standard, the judgment of the BIA \u201cmust be upheld unless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 483-84. Where the immigration judge finds a witness\u2019s testimony to lack credibility, we have said that the judge must \u201coffer a specific, cogent reason for [his or her] disbelief.\u201d <em>Senathirajah, v. INS, </em>157 F.3d 210, 216 (3d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, we must \u201cevaluate\u201d the proffered \u201creasons to determine whether they are valid grounds upon which to base a finding that the applicant is not credible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In this proceeding, Wong first argues that the BIA did not discharge its duty to review the entire record and improperly relied on the IJ\u2019s findings of fact. However, we reject the factual predicate of this argument because it is apparent from the BIA\u2019s opinion that it examined the record in detail and cited facts that support its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Wong raises a number of arguments that boil down to a challenge to the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, but we conclude that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. The BIA noted specific, cogent reasons for disbelieving Wong. While Wong proved that she had been sterilized, this proof was offered long after her first hearing in front of the IJ. In addition, Wong failed to mention her sterilization in her asylum application; she was hazy when detailing the sterilization and surrounding events; there were inconsistencies in her description of her interactions with the Chinese authorities; and she offered no corroborating testimony about her opposition to China\u2019s birth control policy. Wong\u2019s explanation that she omitted information about her sterilization on her asylum application because she could not locate her sterilization certificate was also another piece of evidence from which the BIA could make a negative credibility assessment. A fact finder could reasonably regard these circumstances as showing that she was not credible, that her sterilization was not involuntary, and that she did not have a reasonable fear of persecution in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Wong attacks the BIA\u2019s reliance on her failure to mention the sterilization in her asylum application and points to our deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>sion in <em>Senathirajah, </em>157 F.3d at 221. We agree with Wong that an asylum applicant must be given an opportunity to expand upon his or her reasons for seeking asylum. This means that an applicant may elaborate \u201cupon the circumstances underlying an asylum claim when given the opportunity to take the witness stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Senathimjah, </em>we concluded that the BIA\u2019s decision to uphold the deportation of the petitioner was not based upon substantial evidence in part because the BIA had placed too much weight upon the discrepancies between the claimant\u2019s airport interview and his application for asylum and testimony at his immigration hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 218. Wong argues that <em>Senathimjah </em>shows that the BIA is not allowed to place undue weight on discrepancies between an initial application for asylum and subsequent testimony expanding upon the reasons for one\u2019s application. In addition, Wong contends that her situation is analogous to that in <em>Senathimjah </em>and therefore that the BIA erred by basing its adverse credibility determination on the fact that Wong failed to mention the coerced sterilization in her 1-589 application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">This argument fails in several respects. First, in <em>Senathimjah, </em>the discrepancy was between an initial airport interview and the subsequent application and testimony. The claimant\u2019s 1-589 form made claims that were not present in his initial interview. In the instant case, it is the application itself-the 1-589 form-that fails even to mention the forced sterilization, which is central to her asylum claim. The BIA could rightly consider this omission as evidence of lack of credibility. Second, the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not based on this fact alone but rather took into account a variety of testimonial discrepancies and inconsistencies. In sum, we are convinced that the BIA had a sufficient basis for its negative credibility assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We also reject Wong\u2019s argument that her petition should be granted because the IJ did not further explore the record on remand. Among other things, Wong did not raise this argument in her brief to the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Wong maintains that her husband\u2019s failure to appear in the proceedings was not relevant. According to Wong, the husband was not an essential witness because he had already left China when the sterilization occurred, and he therefore lacked relevant firsthand knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">This argument is weak at best. First, the BIA\u2019s decision shows that it did not consider the absence of the husband\u2019s testimony to be essential but merely that Wong\u2019s position was damaged to some degree by the fact that her husband did not offer \u201ca statement concerning her opposition to sterilization.\u201d App. I at 4. Furthermore, even if we grant that the absence of such a statement should not have been assigned any weight, it is apparent that this fact was not vital to the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Wong\u2019s final argument is that the BIA misconstrued the notice of sterilization. However, we believe that the BIA\u2019s interpretation was entirely reasonable. We have considered all of the petitioner\u2019s arguments and find no ground for granting the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">For these reasons, the petition for review is denied, and the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4), though repealed, applies here because the asylum proceedings began before April 1, 1997 when new provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\u201d) went into effect. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 306(c)(1), 110 Stat. 3009-612, as technically corrected by Act of Oct. 11, 1996, Pub.L.
