R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-24\">Plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendant in this civil rights suit brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 alleging retaliatory and constructive discharge in violation of plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment rights. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-25\">The parties are familiar with the facts and we need not repeat them in detail here. Plaintiffs were all discharged (Mr. Hankins alleges that he was constructively discharged) from their jobs as electrical inspectors for the defendant City of Oklahoma City. Plaintiffs contended that they were discharged in retaliation for speaking out on a matter of public concern, specifically, health and safety matters related to their duties as electrical inspectors. Defendant asserted that plaintiffs were dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>charged for falsifying time reports and misusing work time. Messrs. Wiedemann, Churchill, and Lane grieved their discharges under their union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement and were ordered reinstated by the arbitrator. Mr. Wiedemann also grieved other matters with success in a separate arbitration proceeding. Mr. Hankins did not file a grievance, but joined in this suit. The district court granted summary judgment to defendant on the basis that plaintiffs failed to present evidence that they were discharged pursuant to a custom, policy, or practice and, therefore, defendant, as a municipality, could not be held liable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. of City of New York, </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Plaintiffs argue on appeal that the district court erred: (1) in refusing to give preclusive effect to the arbitrators\u2019 findings that defendant failed to advance legitimate, non-diseriminatory reasons for discharging plaintiffs; and (2) in holding that plaintiffs failed to show that defendant had established a custom, policy, or practice that led to their discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">\u2018We review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\u201d <em>Scarberry v. Exxonmobil Oil Corp., </em>328 F.3d 1255, 1256 (10th Cir.2003). Summary judgment is warranted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Rule 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first argument is without merit. The Supreme Court has held \u201cthat \u2018in a \u00a7 1983 action, a federal court should not afford res judicata or collateral-estoppel effect to an award in an arbitration proceeding brought pursuant to the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ryan v. City of Shawnee, </em>13 F.3d 345, 347 (10th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>McDonald v. City of West Branch, </em>466 U.S. 284, 292, 104 S.Ct. 1799, 80 L.Ed.2d 302 (1984)). Since <em>McDonald, </em>the Court no longer views \u201carbitration [as] inferior to the judicial process for resolving statutory claims.\u201d <em>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 34 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991). <em>Cf. McDonald, </em>466 U.S. at 291 (holding that \u201carbitration is an inadequate substitute for judicial proceedings\u201d). The Court has reiterated, however, that the conclusion that arbitration under a collective-bargaining agreement does not preclude a subsequent statutory claim is supported by the \u201cdifference between contractual rights under a collective-bargaining agreement and individual statutory rights, the potential disparity in interests between a union and an employee, and the limited authority and power of labor arbitrators.\u201d <em>Gilmer, </em>500 U.S. at 34; <em>see also McDonald, </em>466 U.S. at 290-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">The Court has also decided since <em>McDonald </em>that a collective bargaining agreement may preclude a legal action, but only if the waiver of the employee\u2019s statutory rights is \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d <em>Wright v. Universal Maritime Serv. Corp., </em>525 U.S. 70, 80, 119 S.Ct. 391, 142 L.Ed.2d 361 (1998). Defendant presented evidence that the collective bargaining agreement covering plaintiffs contains no such explicit waiver. Aplee. Br. at 7 (citing Aplt. App. at 46, 48). Plaintiffs have offered no evidence in opposition and therefore have not shown that the district court should have given preclusive effect to the arbitrators\u2019 findings in their favor in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>McDonald, Gilmer, </em>and <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 second issue is without merit for the reasons already thoroughly discussed by the district court in its September 20, 2002 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b959-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
