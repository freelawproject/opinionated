R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b210-9\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">Dilpreet Singh, native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order affirming, without opinion, the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) ruling which denied his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility finding and a denial of asylum, and will uphold the decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1244, 45 (9th Cir.2000). We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-11\">The M\u2019s adverse credibility finding that Singh failed to mention on direct examination or in his affidavit that the police who arrested and tortured him in September 1997 also made death threats against his brother is not a material omission that goes to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111-12 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding it is improper to invoke adverse credibility finding based on minor omission).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-16\">Moreover, Singh\u2019s inconsistent statements regarding his relative\u2019s membership in the political group Babar Khalsa are immaterial to Singh\u2019s claim that he was persecuted because the police believed that Singh\u2019s relative belonged to the group. <em>See Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996) (stating that \u201c[mjinor inconsistencies that reveal nothing about an asylum applicant\u2019s fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding\u201d). Likewise, Singh\u2019s purported discrepant testimony regarding the date of his second arrest and the name of the doctor who treated him do not go to the heart of his asylum claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-17\">Finally, the IJ failed to provide a legitimate articulable basis for disbelieving Singh\u2019s explanation about whether he was charged with a crime. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-18\">Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, we remand to the BIA for further proceedings and to determine whether, viewing Singh\u2019s testimony as credible, Singh has made out a claim for past persecution. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b210-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
