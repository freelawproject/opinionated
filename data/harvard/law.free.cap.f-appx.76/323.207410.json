Milanak seeks review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) denying Mr. Milanak\u2019s petition for review of an administrative judge\u2019s initial decision dismissing Mr. Milanak\u2019s appeal. <em>Milanak v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>MSPB Docket No. CH-315H-01-0041-B-l, 93 M.S.P.R. 304 (Sept. 17, 2002). Although designated as a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, this was actually a decision on the merits after a hearing. This court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">On October 12, 1999, Mr. Milanak was hired as a motor carrier safety specialist for the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (Safety Administration) of the Department of Transportation (the agency) in Springfield, Illinois, subject to a one-year probationary period. On February 18, 2000, Mr. Milanak submitted to the agency a declaration for federal employment form disclosing that the Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service (INS) had previously terminated him. In June 1998, the INS terminated Mr. Milanak from his position as Deportation Officer for mistreat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>ing a person in custody, for making a false statement to a supervisor, and for making a false statement during an official investigation. Following Ms termination from the INS, Mr. Milanak filed an individual right of action appeal with the Board, wMch the Board ultimately dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In August 15, 2000, the agency stated in an internal memorandum that Mr. Milanak was \u201csuitable for employment ... as he presents himself as a competent employee who works hard.\u201d On September 5, 2000, Mr. Milanak\u2019s supervisor at the Safety Admimstration wrote Mr. Milanak stating that he would be terminated effective September 15, 2000, for failing to properly conduct a compliance review, repeatedly reportmg to work late without authorization, and failing to follow office guidelines for scheduling compliance reviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Mr. Milanak appealed Ms termination to the Board, wMch issued an imtial decision dismissmg the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Milanak filed a petition for review of the imtial decision. On October 18, 2001, the Board vacated the imtial decision and remanded to the regional office. The Board found that Mr. Milanak had raised a non-frivolous allegation that the agency terminated Mm for pre-appointment reasons without followmg the procedures required for such termination. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">On remand, the admimstrative judge conducted a hearing and Mr. Milanak elected not to testify. The agency supplemented the record with evidence about why it terminated Mr. Milanak. Mr. Milanak filed two motions to compel discovery about an alleged negative suitability determination of Mr. Milanak by the agency. On January 10, 2002, the admimstrative judge demed the motions, ruling that the requested evidence was not relevant because the Board found no non-frivolous allegation of a negative suitability determination. On February 20, 2002, the administrative judge issued an rnitial decision dismissing the appeal. The administrative judge found that Mr. Milanak had failed to prove that he was terminated for preemployment reasons and thus 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805 did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Mr. Milanak filed a timely petition for review of the imtial decision. On September 17, 2002, the Board concluded that there was no legal error and no new, previously unavailable evidence, and demed the petition for review. Mr. Milanak appeals that decision to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">TMs court sustains a final decision of the Board unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law. When the Board\u2019s final decision rests on fact-finding supported by substantial evidence, tMs court must accept those facts as true. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000). TMs court reviews for abuse of discretion a Board ruling on procedural matters such as discovery. <em>Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">In the final order of September 17, 2002, the Board concluded that there was no new, previously unavailable evidence before it and that the admimstrative judge made no error in law or regulation. Mr. Milanak does not contend and tMs court does not find that there was new, previously unavailable, evidence before the Board. Absent such evidence or error, the Board correctly demed the petition for review. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">Mr. Milanak contends that the Board erred in denying Ms two motions to compel discovery and m denying him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>jurisdictional hearing. This court discerns no error in the Board\u2019s actions. Mr. Milanak filed the motions to uncover evidence that the agency terminated him based on a negative suitability determination. But the Board found that Mr. Milanak had not raised a non-frivolous allegation of a negative suitability determination, and correctly concluded that any evidence about the issue would be irrelevant. The Board therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Milanak\u2019s motions to compel discovery. The Board also did not err in denying Mr. Milanak a jurisdictional hearing. <em>See Dick v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>290 F.3d 1356, 1361-62 (Fed.Cir.2002) (stating that the Board properly establishes jurisdiction by the written record and that \u201c[tjhere is no right to a hearing on the threshold issue of jurisdiction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Mr. Milanak also contends that the administrative judge erred in ruling on the merits of this case and in determining witness credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">A probationary employee may only appeal an agency\u2019s termination decision if the employee alleges that the decision was based on partisan politics or marital status, or that the termination was for preappointment reasons and the agency did not follow required termination procedures. <em>See 5 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 315.805, 315.806 (2003). An administrative judge\u2019s credibility determination is \u201cvirtually unreviewable\u201d on appeal. <em>Bieber v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>287 F.3d 1358, 1364 (Fed.Cir.2002).z</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Mr. Milanak does not allege termination based on partisan politics or marital status. Instead, he alleges that the agency terminated him for pre-appointment reasons without following the required procedures for such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">On remand from the Board\u2019s decision of October 18, 2001, the administrative judge found that the agency supplemented the record with evidence showing that the agency did not terminate Mr. Milanak for pre-appointment reasons. The administrative judge considered Safety Administration state director Mr. John Muleare\u2019s testimony that Mr. Milanak\u2019s performance started deteriorating in July 2000. Mr. Mulcare testified that Mr. Milanak made field trips to motor carriers for compliance reviews without notifying the motor carriers in advance, contrary to agency policy. To support this testimony, the agency presented documents showing that Mr. Milanak scheduled visits to two motor carriers that were not in business. Mulcare also testified that a compliance review that Mr. Milanak had conducted was deficient for failing to cite numerous violations, and that when questioned about the review Mr. Milanak said that he had \u201cscrewed up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Mr. Milanak\u2019s training coach Mr. Jimmy Fox corroborated Mr. Muleare\u2019s testimony. Mr. Fox testified that Mr. Milanak\u2019s performance deteriorated in August 2000, in that Mr. Milanak arrived to work late on several occasions and Mr. Milanak\u2019s compliance reviews were deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Mr. Mulcare also testified that Mr. Milanak\u2019s INS history was not a factor in terminating him. Douglas Sawin, midwest field administrator and the reviewing official for terminating Mr. Milanak, corroborated Mr. Muleare\u2019s testimony. Mr. Sawin testified that Mr. Mulcare never mentioned Mr. Milanak\u2019s INS history and that Mr. Sawin did not consider Mr. Milanak\u2019s INS history when he agreed to the termination of Mr. Milanak.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">The administrative judge found Mr. Muleare\u2019s testimony credible and found no evidence contradicting Mr. Muleare\u2019s and Mr. Sawin\u2019s testimony that they did not consider pre-appointment reasons in deciding to terminate Mr. Milanak. This court finds no basis in the record for rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the administrative judge\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the administrative judge\u2019s findings that the agency had valid reasons to terminate Mr. Milanak and that the agency did not rely on pre-appointment reasons. The administrative judge therefore did not err in concluding that the procedures set forth in 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.805 do not apply and properly dismissed the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
