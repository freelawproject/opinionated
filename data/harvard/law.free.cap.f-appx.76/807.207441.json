Cook seeks to challenge his 1991 juiy-trial conviction and sentence for second-degree murder with a firearm. This court reviews for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion. <em>Greenawalt v. Stewart, </em>105 F.3d 1268, 1273 (9th Cir.1997). We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-22\">Cook argues that he is entitled to relief under Rule 60(b) because he mistakenly requested dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition due to his mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">At the time the district court dismissed Cook\u2019s federal petition and denied his motion for reconsideration, the court did not have the benefit of our decisions in <em>Ford v. Hubbard, </em>330 F.3d 1086, 1100 (9th Cir. 2003) (as amended) (concluding that the district court erred when it failed to inform a pro se petitioner that, on the face of his first petition, he would be time-barred upon returning to federal court with newly-exhausted claims), <em>Kelly v. Small, </em>315 F.3d 1063, 1070 (9th Cir.) (as amended), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 2094, 155 L.Ed.2d 1077 (2003) (deciding that \u201cthe district court must consider the alternative of staying the petition after dismissal of unexhausted claims, in order to permit Petitioner to exhaust those claims and then add them by amendment to his stayed federal petition\u201d), <em>Smith v. Ratelle, </em>323 F.3d 813, 819 (9th Cir.2003) (determining that district court\u2019s erroneous dismissal of a mixed habeas petition resulted in \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify equitable tolling), and <em>Guillory v. Roe, </em>329 F.3d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that petitioner must demonstrate diligence in exhausting claims, and stating that \u201cthe relevant measure of diligence is how quickly a petitioner sought to exhaust the claims dismissed as unexhausted, and how quickly he returned to federal court after doing so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-26\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Cook\u2019s motion for recon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>sideration, and remand so the district court may determine in the first instance whether the dismissal of his petition warrants relief from judgment in light of this court\u2019s subsequent decisions. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P 60(b)(6) (providing that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for \u201cany [] reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b835-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
