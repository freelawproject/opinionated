Aldisert, Senior Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b183-9\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The Commissioner complied with the district court\u2019s Order of Remand of July 23, 1999, relating to \u201cthe [Administrative Law Judge\u2019s] treatment of Dr. [Wendy] Johnson\u2019s opinions and on the ALJ\u2019s failure to include certain limitations, including one of his own significant findings, in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert.\u201d ER at 169. We are satisfied that, on remand and before another ALJ, there are sufficiently articulated reasons for the conclusions that the ALJ drew from Dr. Johnson\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">In her report, Dr. Johnson wrote, \u201c[Appellant Ida Brook\u2019s] complaints of pain are disproportionate to her physical findings and are fairly non-specific____ I think her disability is more related to her pain syndrome, which I think is disproportionate to her physical finding____ She is actually much stronger than she would report.\u201d Dr. Johnson also wrote on a form that Brooks\u2019 \u201cpain and disability are unusual for her condition and disproportionate to her clinical evaluation.\u201d Finally, as the district court noted, \u201cDr. Johnson believed Brooks was likely to have good days and bad days, but on average, was likely to be absent from work as the result of her condition more than three times a month.\u201d The ALJ discussed Dr. Johnson\u2019s report in depth \u2014 one single-spaced page and two paragraphs \u2014 and emphasized that \u201cDr. Johnson notes that [Brooks\u2019] complaints of pain were disproportionate to her physical findings and were fairly non specific.\u201d ER at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">Moreover, we do not accept Appellant\u2019s argument that the ALJ \u201cflouted\u201d the district court\u2019s order that the Commissioner consider Brooks\u2019 deficiencies of concentration, persistence, or pace, resulting in a failure to complete tasks in a timely manner. The ALJ made a residual functional capacity (RFC) assessment, determining that Brooks could not perform complex tasks, should have only limited interaction with the general public, and could not do work requiring extensive reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">Accordingly, we reject the contention that upon remand from the district court the ALJ did not comply with the district court\u2019s order of July 23,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-22\">We are satisfied that the ALJ gave proper consideration to the medical evidence from Dr. Kelly Krohn and Dr. David <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>N. Sweet. ER at 226-227, 232. The ALJ made findings at step five that were supported by substantial evidence and free of legal error, as were the RFC assessment and the hypothetical to the vocational expert. Not only did the ALJ adequately address the findings of the Psychiatric Review Technique Form, but we conclude that he properly applied the factors set forth in <em>Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996), in assessing the credibility of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Appellant had the burden of establishing her entitlement to Social Security disability benefits. <em>Meanel v. Apfel, </em>172 F.3d 1111, 1113 (9th Cir.1999). We review the decision of the district court <em>de novo </em>to ensure that there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the Commissioner and that the decision is free of legal error. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); <em>Meanel, </em>172 F.3d at 1113. Substantial evidence \u2018\u201cmeans such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). It is more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance, <em>Jamerson v. Chater, </em>112 F.3d 1064, 1066 (9th Cir.1997), and \u201cdoes not mean a large or considerable amount of evidence,\u201d <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988). If the evidence can reasonably support either confirming or reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.1999). The Commissioner\u2019s findings must be upheld if they are supported by inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the record. <em>Gallant v. Heckler, </em>753 F.2d 1450, 1452-1453 (9th Cir.1984). Even if the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, the ALJ\u2019s conclusion must be upheld. <em>Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999). If there is not evidence of malingering, and a claimant produces objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce some degree of pain or other symptoms, the ALJ may reject the claimant\u2019s testimony about the severity of the alleged pain or other symptoms \u201cby offering specific, clear and convincing reasons for doing so.\u201d <em>Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1281-1282 (citing <em>Cotton v. Bowen, </em>799 F.2d 1403, 1407-1408 (9th Cir.1986) (per curiam)). \u201c \u2018The ALJ is responsible for determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and for resolving ambiguities.\u2019\u201d <em>Meanel, </em>172 F.3d at 1113 (quoting <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.1995) (per curiam)); <em>Saelee v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 520, 522 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam); <em>Allen v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 577, 580 n. 1 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Measuring this appeal with the foregoing legal precepts, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s determination and that the ALJ committed no legal error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b183-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided for by Ninth Cir.
