Meadows pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more of cocaine base, and 100 grams or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). Following a jury trial, Harley was convicted of the conspiracy charge, in violation of \u00a7 846; possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, fifty grams or more of cocaine base, and 100 grams or more of heroin, in violation of 21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000); and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Both Meadows and Harley contend that the district court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence seized from a residence because the search warrant affidavit failed to establish that drugs would be found at the residence. We review a district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Our review of the record establishes that the search warrant application established probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. Unlike <em>United States v. Lalor, </em>996 F.2d 1578 (4th Cir. 1993), upon which Appellants rely, there was evidence in this case from which the officers could reasonably infer that drugs would be found at Harley\u2019s residence, including Harley\u2019s evasive answers regarding his place of residence and his use of an alias on paperwork connected with the residence. Moreover, even if the warrant application did not establish probable cause, we conclude that the officers conducting the search properly acted in good faith reliance on the search warrant. <em>See United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3430, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Harley also challenges the district court\u2019s failure to depart downward based on his physical impairment and diminished mental capacity. A sentencing court\u2019s decision not to depart is not reviewable unless the court\u2019s decision is based on a mistaken view that it lacks authority to do so. <em>United States v. Brock, </em>108 F.3d 31, 33 (4th Cir.1997). The record does not indicate that the district court failed to understand its ability to depart. Accordingly, this claim must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">We affirm Meadows\u2019s and Harley\u2019s convictions. We also affirm Harley\u2019s sentence but dismiss the portion of Harley\u2019s appeal that challenges the district court\u2019s decision not to depart. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">No. <em>02-4806 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">No. <em>03-4126 </em>\u2014 AFFIRMED <em>IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
