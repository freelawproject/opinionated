He argues that the district court abused its discretion in relying on impermissible factors in its decision to depart upward due to the inadequacy of Netter\u2019s criminal history category. The district court did not abuse its discretion in considering three prior convictions for which Netter did not receive any criminal history points due to their remoteness in time. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(policy statement); <em>United States v. Harrington, </em>114 F.3d 517, 520 (5th Cir.1997). The district court did not abuse its discretion in considering that Netter had a pending charge for possession of marijuana at the time that he committed the instant offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(d). The district court also considered Netter\u2019s history of domestic violence and his numerous misdemeanor and felony charges which did not result in convictions. Although we have not addressed the subject, three other circuits have held that a district court may rely on conduct underlying dissimilar unadjudicated offenses. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>299 F.3d 143, 147 (2d Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Brewster, </em>127 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Schweihs, </em>971 F.2d 1302, 1319-20 (7th Cir.1992). However, because the district court\u2019s other reasons were valid and sufficient to support its upward departure, any error in consideration of these factors was harmless. <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 204, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992); <em>United States v. Kay, </em>83 F.3d 98, 101 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b583-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
