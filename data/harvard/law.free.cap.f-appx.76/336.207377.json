It is</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">ORDERED that the judgment from which this appeal has been taken be affirmed. Kay O. Kim sued Amtrak for allegedly terminating her employment based on her age and national origin, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 626 <em>et seq. </em>and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>The evidence below showed that Amtrak terminated Ms. Kim\u2019s employment because, in connection with its personnel evaluation process designed to reduce management costs and increase employee productivity, her overall performance ranked below other managers in the Human Resources group. Because Kim failed to demonstrate that a reasonable jury could conclude that Amtrak\u2019s asserted legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for her termination was a pretext for age or national-origin discrimination, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Amtrak. <em>See, e.g., Hall v. Giant Food, Inc., </em>175 F.3d 1074 (D.C.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
