We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Because Martinez-Mechaca failed to depart the United States by the date specified in his voluntary departure order, the BIA properly denied his motion to reopen the removal proceedings to apply for adjustment of status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(d) (alien who fails to comply with voluntary departure order is ineligible for any further relief, including adjustment of status, for a period of 10 years). We reject Martinez-Mechaca\u2019s contention that the agency\u2019s delay in processing the visa petition that his wife filed on his behalf excuses his failure to depart. Section 1229e(d) does not provide for consideration of exceptional circumstances. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">We also reject Martinez-Mechaca\u2019s contention that the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act of 2000 (\u201cLIFE Act\u201d) allows him to remain in the United States to seek adjustment of status. The LIFE Act does not alter the 10-year statutory bar to adjustment of status mandated by section 1229c(d) for aliens who fail to comply with a voluntary departure order. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b198-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
