Temple contends that the defendants conspired to violate his rights by not timely revoking his parole and by not recalculating his sentence during the Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP) that Temple initiated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>at the prison prior to seeking judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Temple concedes that defendant Bonvillian is absolutely immune from suit. The district court correctly determined that defendants Day and Stalder enjoy qualified immunity because Temple failed to show that their actions were not objectively reasonable \u201cin light of clearly established law\u201d in existence at the time of his parole revocation and ARP. <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>488 U.S. 685, 689, 641, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b585-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
