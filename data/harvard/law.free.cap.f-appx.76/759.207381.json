He also appeals the revocation of his supervised release and imposition of an additional term of imprisonment. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that the district court plainly erred by revoking Hernandez-Gomez\u2019s supervised release without making a formal finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review counsel\u2019s argument, because Hernandez-Gomez filed a notice of appeal in only the illegal-reentry case, and not the supervised-release case. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 3(a)(1) (appeal of right may be taken only by filing notice of appeal with district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">We have reviewed the record in the illegal-reentry case independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), and we find no nonfiivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment as to the illegal-reentry conviction, and we dismiss Hernandez-Gomez\u2019s appeal of the revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\">.
