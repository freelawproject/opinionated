Sanitary Landfill, Inc.; L.W.D. Trucking, Inc.; L.W.D. Field Services, Inc.; and Robert Terry, Inc. (collectively \u201cLWD\u201d) challenge certain aspects of the Decision and Order issued against them by the RespondenVCross-Petitioner National Labor Relations Board (\u201cBoard\u201d). The Board found that LWD violated sections \u00a7 8(a)(1), (3), and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d) by unilateral changes in employment conditions, failure to bargain, and a discriminatory discharge. The Board cross-petitions for enforcement of its Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">LWD is in the business of treating, storing, and disposing of industrial waste. In September 1997, the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO (\u201cUnion\u201d) started organizing activities at LWD facilities. On September 23,1997, the Union filed a petition with the Board for an election. The election took place on December 5, 1997, and the Union won representation of LWD employees. On December 12, 1997, LWD laid off 32 of its employees because of its financial difficulties.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Union was certified on December 15,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">In September 1997, LWD hired a new president, Bill O\u2019Brien. He had previously worked for B.F. Goodrich, which used a forced-ranking system in layoffs. Under this system, supervisors rank employees based on performance and lay off the bottom performers. O\u2019Brien testified in an affidavit that he decided to introduce this system at LWD in November 1997. Two other company officials also testified that the decision had been made in November. The implementation of the system was mentioned in the minutes of the board meeting on November 25, 1997. Those minutes state that one of O\u2019Brien\u2019s goals after the election would be to \u201cforce-rank\u201d employees. In the December 12 layoffs, LWD used forced ranking. Thirty-two workers at the bottom of the list were laid off. No negotiations with the Union took place over this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">One of the employees laid off on December 12, 1997 was William Jeffrey Walls, an employee of LWD Trucking, Inc. Walls was the only employee of the trucking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>division who engaged in union activities. His name appeared on Union literature as a supporter of the Union. He was the only employee from the profitable trucking division who lost his job in the December 12 layoffs. He was also the only employee not rehired in February 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In February 1998, LWD received a large job contract. To complete the work, LWD rehired some of the workers it laid off in December 1997, calling the employees into \u201ca general labor pool,\u201d which meant not placing them in their former jobs. LWD decided to terminate these employees in March 1998, at the conclusion of the work. LWD and the Union negotiated regarding the layoffs. The parties met on March 3, 4, 10, and 11. LWD wanted to use the forced-ranking list prepared after the December 5 election. The Union opposed this procedure. The Union requested that the employees be laid off by seniority and that the laid-off workers be placed on a \u201cpreferential hiring list by seniority.\u201d In its counterproposal, LWD attempted to retain some discretion regarding who could be moved up and down in this preferential list. The Union walked out of the negotiations. LWD and the Union continued their dialogue with letters after the meetings until the March layoffs occurred. In a March 15, 1998 letter, the Union acquiesced to the use of forced ranking in the March layoff but rejected its future use. LWD rejected this proposal in a letter of the same date. LWD then reinstated the forced ranking to lay off twelve employees on or about March 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The Board issued a two-part order. The first part requires LWD to cease and desist from certain unfair labor practices, such as the intimidation of pro-union employees. Decision and Order, August 27, 2001 at *3. The second part requires that William Walls and those employees dismissed under the forced ranking system in December and March be rehired and made whole. Decision and Order, August 27, 2001 at *3-4. The second part of the order also directs LWD to bargain over forced ranking and general labor pool policies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The Decision and Order, which in essence adopted the bench decision of the administrative law judge below, had three primary conclusions of law: (1) the forced ranking system was an unlawful unilateral change in employment conditions when it was used in the December 1997 and March 1998 layoffs, violating Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA; (2) the placement of laid-off workers in the general labor pool was an unlawful unilateral change in violation of Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA; and (3) the discharge of employee William Jeffrey Walls was discriminatory in violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">Three different standards of review apply to the Board\u2019s decisions. <em>FiveCAP, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>294 F.3d 768, 776 (6th Cir.2002). First, the Board\u2019s factual determinations and its application of law to those facts are reviewed under a substantial evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>Second, where the Board interprets the NLRA, this court applies the deference standard articulated in <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). <em>Id. </em>Under the first step in the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, \u201cthe court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 842-43. If the statute is ambiguous or silent, however, under the second step in the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the reviewing court will uphold the Board\u2019s reasonable interpretations of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 843. Third, all of the Board\u2019s other legal conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>sions are reviewed <em>de novo. FiveCAP, </em>294 F.3d at 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">B. <em>The Forced Ranking System</em></p>\n<p id=\"AaU\">LWD claims that it made the decision to switch to a forced ranking system prior to the union election. Therefore, it argues, it was not required to bargain over the use of forced ranking. The NLRA does not explicitly state when the duty to bargain attaches. In <em>Consolidated Printers, Inc., </em>305 NLRB 1061, 1992 WL 5863 (1992), the Board ruled that there was no duty to bargain over layoffs where the decision to lay off employees had been made prior to the election. The Board, adopting the opinion of the administrative law judge, held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">The timing of a decision to lay off a particular group of employees at a particular time is critical to determining if the employer was obligated to notify and bargain about the decision or its effects .... The Board in <em>Embossing Printers, </em>268 NLRB 710, 1984 WL 36015 (1984), dismissed a unilateral change 8(a)(5) allegation that an employer had unilaterally canceled employees\u2019 Christmas bonus after a union had been certified as representative of employees. The Board decision turned on its finding that the employer\u2019s decision to cancel the Christmas bonus was made before it became obligated to bargain with the union, i.e., before the Board-conducted election.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">Turning to the instant case, I have found ... that Respondent had determined well before the election to work unit employees through the election irrespective of actual work requirements and then to effect substantial and long term as opposed to short term or shortened week layoffs to bring staffing levels in the bindery into conformity with production needs____ On this record, given the close timing of the end of the balloting and the announcements of the layoffs to the employees as well as the burden of proof the General Counsel bears on each aspect of his prima facie case, it cannot be said that these decisions were made at a time when Respondent was obligated to bargain with the Union. Accordingly, I find that the layoffs initiated the week of the election were decided on by Respondent before it was obligated to bargain with the Union even though the employees were told of the layoffs and even though the layoffs did not actually begin until after the election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The Board cites no case law that suggests that <em>Consolidated Printers </em>and the case cited therein, <em>Embossing Printers, </em>are no longer valid. Instead, the Board has relied on the facts, arguing that they were insufficient to show that LWD\u2019s decision to lay off employees by forced ranking took place prior to the union election.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, evidence to that effect could be found in the testimony of three LWD executives, the minutes of the November 25 LWD board meeting, and the fact that LWD\u2019s new president came from a eompa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ny that had used forced ranking.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In sum, the Board failed to distinguish or alter its own precedent, and all of the considerable available evidence supports the conclusion that LWD\u2019s actions were protected under <em>Consolidated Printers </em>and <em>Embossing Printers. </em>While we are concerned about the short time span between the decision to institute the forced ranking system, the election and the implementation of the forced ranking system, we decline to alter or distinguish the Board\u2019s precedent when no party has asked us to do so. We therefore hold that there was insufficient evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that the forced ranking system constituted an unlawful unilateral change in employment conditions. Thus, there was no duty to bargain over the use of the forced ranking system in the December 1997 and March 1998 layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">C. <em>Placement of Laid-off Workers in the General Labor Pool</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">With respect to placing workers into a \u201cgeneral labor pool,\u201d the Board held that no good faith bargaining impasse could exist in light of the preexisting unfair labor practices involving forced ranking. Decision and Order, August 27, 2001 at *19. Thus, in finding a Section 8(a)(5) violation here, the Board relied on its holding that unfair labor practices existed, a holding that we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">If there are no pre-existing unfair labor practices, the Board uses a five-part test to determine if the parties bargained to a good faith impasse. \u201c[T]he Board traditionally considers (a) the parties\u2019 bargaining history, (b) the parties\u2019 good faith in negotiations, (c) the length of the negotiations, (d) the importance of the issues over which there is disagreement, and (e) the contemporaneous understanding of the parties as to the state of negotiations on the crucial date.\u201d <em>Intermountain Rural Elec. Ass\u2019n v. N.L.R.B., </em>984 F.2d 1562, 1569 (10th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). Because we have reversed the Board\u2019s holding regarding the forced ranking system, we remand the dispute over the common labor pool to the Board for the standard analysis described in <em>Intermountain.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">D. <em>The Discharge of William Jeffrey Walls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA bars employers from discriminating against an employee regarding hiring, firing, tenure or \u201cany term or condition of employment\u201d because of the employee\u2019s union membership and activities. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). To show a violation of Section 8(a)(3), the general counsel must first establish a <em>prima facie </em>case showing an unlawful motivating factor in the employer\u2019s decision. \u201cSpecifically, the general counsel must establish that (i) an individual was engaged in a protected activity, (ii) the employer was aware of the protected activity, and (iii) ... the employee\u2019s protected activity motivated the adverse treatment.\u201d <em>Kentucky Gen., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>177 F.3d 430, 435 (6th Cir.1999). The factors to be considered to infer anti-union animus include \u201ca company\u2019s expressed hostility towards unionization ..., knowledge of the employees\u2019 union activities, proximity in time between the employees\u2019 union activities and their discharges, the inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, and disparate treat&gt; ment of certain employees compared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>other employees with similar work records or offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 435-36 (quoting <em>Hyatt Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>939 F.2d 361, 375 n. 7 (6th Cir.1991)). \u201cCircumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to create an inference of anti-union animus on the part of an employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Once the <em>prima facie </em>case is established, \u201cthe employer can rebut the inference only by demonstrating that it would have taken the adverse action notwithstanding the employee\u2019s protected activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In particular, \u201cif the employer fires an employee for having engaged in union activities and has no other basis for the discharge, or if the reasons that he proffers are pretextual, the employer commits an unfair labor practice.\u201d <em>W.F. Bolin Co. v. N.L.R.B., </em>70 F.3d 863, 870 (6th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>N.L.R.B. v. Transportation Mgmt. Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 397-98, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The Board\u2019s decision that the General Counsel established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination is supported by substantial evidence. As the Board pointed out, \u201cWalls supported the Union and was listed on Union fliers as a supporter.\u201d Decision and Order, August 27, 2001 at *19. His immediate supervisor knew of his Union support, as both Walls and the supervisor admitted that they argued about it when the supervisor spotted Walls distributing Union literature. Thus, the record establishes the employee\u2019s open advocacy and the employer\u2019s knowledge of such advocacy. The Board next considered the circumstantial evidence tending to prove anti-union motivation in Walls\u2019s discharge. In particular, the Board focused on the \u201ctiming [of Walls\u2019s discharge], three days before the Board certified the Union, and a week after the Union election,\u201d Decision and Order. August 27, 2001 at *19, and found the required \u201clink\u201d sufficiently established.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The record contains further evidence of LWD\u2019s anti-union bias. Five workers testified that they were interrogated by a senior operations supervisor about their union activities. The meetings were one-to-one and were conducted on the eve of the union election. In addition, prior to the union election and the meetings, LWD sent a letter to the employees urging them to vote in the upcoming union election, implying that their jobs depended on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">The record also contains substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision that LWD\u2019s proffered reason to discharge Walls was pretextual. The Board considered the Company\u2019s motive for discharging Walls \u2014 lack of work for him on the machine on which he was trained \u2014 and rejected it because LWD \u201cstopped using the [machine] on a regular basis some months previously\u201d and because of the \u201crecord as a whole.\u201d Decision and Order, August 27, 2001 at *19. There is no indication that Walls\u2019s performance was substandard.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we grant LWD\u2019s petition to set aside and deny the Board\u2019s petition to enforce those portions of the order that pertain to LWD\u2019s duty to bargain over the forced ranking system in the December 1997 and March 1998 layoffs. We grant the Board\u2019s petition to enforce and deny LWD\u2019s petition to set aside those portions of the Board\u2019s order that pertain to William Walls\u2019 discharge. We remand to the Board the portion of the order concerning the duty to bargain over the placement of rehired workers in the common labor pool. We grant the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of the remainder of its order and deny LWD\u2019s petition to set it aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-10\">. The Board held that the layoffs were forced by economic necessity and therefore did not have to be bargained over and were not retaliatory. Decision and Order, August 27, 2001 at *19-20. Of course, the manner in which layoffs are conducted may still require bargaining.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">. In its brief, the Board states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">In support of its position, the Company refers to <em>Consolidated Printers, </em>305 NLRB 1061, 1992 WL 5863 (1992), where the Board held that an employer who decided, prior to a representation election, to lay off certain employees did not violate Section 8(a)(5) by implementing that decision soon after the election. <em>Consolidated Printers, Inc., </em>305 NLRB 1061, 1067, 1992 WL 5863 (1992). We now show that the Company failed to demonstrate that the decision was actually made prior to the time that the Union demonstrated its majority support among employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">NLRB br. at 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b105-9\">. The Board argues that the record shows that LWD planned to hire additional people as of September 9. But this plan pre-dated some of LWD\u2019s difficulties and roughly coincided with the switch in management. Thus, the plan to hire additional employees is irrelevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
