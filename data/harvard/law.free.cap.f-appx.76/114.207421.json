The court sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 120 months (the statutory minimum) <em>on </em>Count 1 and 24 months <em>on </em>Count 3, and a mandatory consecutive 60-month term on Count 2, plus 5 years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-23\">On appeal, for the first time, Nairn argues the district court erred in not applying a mitigating-role reduction, given his lesser role in the conspiracy offense and the government\u2019s failure to offer a departure motion despite his cooperation. After careful review of the record, we conclude the district court did not plainly err in sentencing Nairn: the court was without authority to sentence him below the statutory minimum absent a motion by the government, the government was under no obligation to file a substantial-assistance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>departure motion, and Nairn made no showing the government\u2019s decision not to file a departure motion was motivated by anything other than its belief he had not been truthful. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e); <em>United States v. Wolf, </em>270 F.3d 1188, 1189-92 (8th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Montanye, </em>996 F.2d 190, 192 (8th Cir.1993) (en banc) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-16\">. The Honorable Mark W. Bennett, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
