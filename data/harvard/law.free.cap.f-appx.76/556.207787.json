The IJ denied Jamal\u2019s requests for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">As a preliminary matter, we DENY the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. As the respondent concedes, Jamal\u2019s petition for review, which was originally filed in the wrong court, was timely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. Accordingly, we have jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Jamal has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s determination that his asylum application was untimely by failing to brief the issue. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). He has also waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under the CAT, as well as to the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure, by failing to address these claims in his brief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">The IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal was based largely on a determination that Jamal\u2019s testimony was not credible. Given the many inconsistencies in Jamal\u2019s testimony noted by the IJ, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s credibility finding is a reasonable interpretation of the record. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). As Jamal has failed to point to any evidence, other than his testimony, which would support his claim, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s determination that Jamal has not established an entitlement to withholding of removal was based on substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION TO DISMISS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
