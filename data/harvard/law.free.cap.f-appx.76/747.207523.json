In November 2002, shortly after he began serving his supervised release, Horn filed two motions seeking to void his waiver. In the first motion, Horn argued that his right to a hearing on the modification of his release conditions under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1(b) (amended Dec. 1, 2002) was not subject to waiver; in the other, Horn argued that his waiver was not knowing, intelligent, or voluntary. In its petition to modify Horn\u2019s release conditions, also filed in November 2002, the government argued that the modifications were necessary to promote effective supervision and community safety, but noted that Horn had \u201crescinded his agreement to the modification.\u201d By notation on the face of the motions, the district court summarily denied both of Horn\u2019s motions. The court also summarily approved the petition to modify Horn\u2019s release conditions. In this consolidated appeal, Horn challenges the denials of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">Initially, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over these appeals. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (this court has jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions of district courts). Even though the notices of appeal designate the denials of Horn\u2019s motions to void his waiver, he clearly in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>tended to challenge the district court\u2019s acceptance of his waiver and the modification of his release conditions without a hearing. <em>See Sanders v. Clemco Indus., </em>862 F.2d 161, 164 n. 3 (8th Cir.1988) (when notice of appeal is technically defective because it fails to designate appeal as one from final judgment, court of appeals may treat appeal as taken from final judgment if appeal is otherwise properly taken and intent of appellant to appeal from final judgment is clear); <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>988 F.2d 798, 810-12 (8th Cir. 1993) (court of appeals did not lack jurisdiction over appeal of modification of release conditions even though defective notice of appeal referenced district court\u2019s order staying enforcement of modification); <em>United States v. Stocks, </em>104 F.3d 308, 310 (9th Cir.) (court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider appeal from ruling on validity of probationer\u2019s waiver of Rule 32.1(b) hearing), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 904, 118 S.Ct. 259, 139 L.Ed.2d 186 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The district court\u2019s summary denials of Horn\u2019s motions, and its summary grant of the petition modifying his release conditions, include no reasoning or explanation. We are thus unable to determine on what basis the court denied Horn\u2019s requests to void his waiver of rights. Hence, we remand this matter to the district court to determine whether Horn\u2019s waiver is valid or whether a hearing and assistance of counsel are necessary before modifying Horn\u2019s conditions of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
