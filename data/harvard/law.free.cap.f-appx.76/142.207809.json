We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">1. The administrative law judge (ALJ) permissibly found that Gleave can perform work in the economy as a telemarketer, even though she lacked transferable skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) classifies that position as \u201csemiskilled.\u201d The Vocational Expert (VE) who testified characterized the position as \u201ca level of semi-skilled employment, but which ... does not in its existence require skill level.\u201d In answer to a clarifying question whether a telemarketing position was \u201cunskilled,\u201d the VE responded that, in many years of research and placing individuals, she had never encountered an instance in which previous work experience makes any difference whatsoever or is required. \u2018Without exception,\u201d she said, people should be able to step into that job without any previous experience or skills obtained from other jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">An ALJ may rely on expert testimony that contradicts the DOT. <em>Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1435 (9th Cir. 1995).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ permissibly did so in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">2. The ALJ permissibly rejected, in part, Gleave\u2019s testimony regarding excess pain. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1281-82 (9th Cir.1996) (stating standard and identifying bases for adverse finding). For example, the ALJ noted that Gleave is the sole care-giver of an infant, that she does not take pain medication other than aspirin, and that she faded to follow recommended treatments that would alleviate most of her pain and limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">3. The ALJ permissibly rejected Dr. MacCoy\u2019s conclusion of disability. The ALJ reasoned, in part, that Dr. MacCoy\u2019s treatment notes recorded Gleave\u2019s failure to comply with his instructions, but nonetheless reported that her condition had showed improvement. Additionally, the ALJ relied on the incompleteness of the notes. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1513(e) (providing that \u201cother source\u201d evidence, such as a naturopath\u2019s opinion, must be complete and detailed).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-12\">4. The ALJ properly considered the testimony of lay witnesses. The ALJ found Miller\u2019s testimony to be credible but found that it did not establish that Gleave\u2019s symptoms were disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-13\">Gleave\u2019s argument that the ALJ had to explain why he rejected Miller\u2019s testimony is off the mark, because the ALJ credited the testimony. The further argument that the ALJ had to accept her lawyer\u2019s alternative formulation of the hypothetical put to the VE is unpersuasive because that formulation differed from Miller\u2019s testimony in describing the frequency of Gleave\u2019s symptoms. The ALJ did accept the essence of Miller\u2019s testimony in his hypothetical by finding (for example) that Gleave \u201cgets emotional and cries a lot\u201d and by incorporating appropriate nonexertional limitations into the hypothetical.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-14\">5. Because the ALJ did not err in rejecting Gleave\u2019s excess pain testimony, and because he incorporated Miller\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>mony, it follows that he did not err in constructing the hypothetical for the VE at Step 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-15\">.
