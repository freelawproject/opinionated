In documents submitted in conjunction with his February 1996 applications, Lewis alleged disability since December 1992 from hyperhidrosis (excessive perspiration), a nervous condition, back pain, and tendonitis in his right shoulder, elbow, and thumb. After two administrative hearings, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Lewis could not perform his past relevant work but could perform the entry-level unskilled jobs a vocational expert (VE) identified in response to a hypothetical the ALJ posed. Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Jenkins v. Apfel, </em>196 F.3d 922, 924 (8th Cir.l999)(standard of review when records are also submitted to and considered by Appeals Council before it denies review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-17\">We reject Lewis\u2019s challenge to the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings, because the ALJ gave multiple valid reasons for finding Lewis\u2019s subjective complaints not entirely credible. <em>See Lowe v. Apfel, </em>226 F.3d 969, 972 (8th Cir.2000)(if adequately explained and supported, credibility findings are for ALJ to make). We also reject Lewis\u2019s contention that the ALJ failed properly to consider the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA\u2019s) disability determination. According to Lewis\u2019s own testimony, the VA at most gave him a 20% disability rating, not 100% as he suggests on appeal; there were only a few brief VA disability-ratings examination reports before the ALJ; and the ALJ referenced Lewis\u2019s VA disability status in his opinion. <em>See Morrison v. Apfel, </em>146 F.3d 625, 628 (8th Cir.1998)(disability findings by other federal agencies are not binding but must be considered).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-18\">Lewis also contends that the ALJ improperly weighed the opinions of consulting psychologists Moneypenny and Lyon. We disagree. As the ALJ noted, unlike Dr. Lyon, Dr. Moneypenny did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>interpret the results from a Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory he administered to Lewis as showing dementia, and nothing else in the record reflects dementia. Further, there are several notations in the record from Lewis\u2019s treating mental health providers concerning his reported long-term daily marijuana use, and there is no indication that Dr. Lyon (or Dr. Moneypenny) was aware of this factor. <em>See Pearsall v. Massanari, </em>274 F.3d 1211, 1219 (8th Cir.)(2001)(ALJ may reject opinion of any medical expert, even one hired by government, where it is inconsistent with record as whole; it is ALJ\u2019s function to resolve conflicts). As to Lewis\u2019s argument concerning the VE\u2019s testimony, we find it meritless because Lewis has mischaracterized the questions posed to the VE and thus the VE\u2019s responses. Lewis\u2019s remaining arguments similarly provide no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b785-15\">. The Honorable G. Thomas Eisele, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable Jerry Cavaneau, United States Magistrate Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
