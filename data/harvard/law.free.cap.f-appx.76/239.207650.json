R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Defendant Horacio Rodriguez-Villalba pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 78 months. He appeals from his conviction and sentence. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Defendant\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no legitimate challenges to the validity of defendant\u2019s guilty plea or to his sentence. Counsel has also filed a motion to withdraw from his representation of defendant. Counsel provided defendant with a copy of the brief. Neither defendant nor the government has filed a response to the <em>Anders </em>brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Pursuant to our duty under <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted an independent review of the record and agree with defendant\u2019s counsel that the appeal is frivolous. There was a factual basis for defendant\u2019s plea and it was knowing and voluntary. In sentencing defendant, the district court properly calculated the offense level and the criminal history category. The sentence imposed was the lowest allowable under the applicable guideline range. We find no issue that properly might be the subject of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">AFFIRMED. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-30\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
