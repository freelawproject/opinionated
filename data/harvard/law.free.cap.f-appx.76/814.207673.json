We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See Morgan v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir. 1999). The Commissioner\u2019s decision \u201cwill be overturned only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). We find no legal error in the decision below and find that the decision is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Grigsby complains that the administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in relying on the medical-vocational guidelines or \u201cgrids\u201d because of her non-exertional impairments such as fatigue and susceptibility to infection. We cannot say that the ALJ legally or factually erred in this regard. We have held that significant nonexertional impairments may make reliance on the grids inappropriate, but that the ALJ may rely on the grids rather than a vocational expert if the grids <em>\u201ccompletely and accurately </em>represent a claimant\u2019s limitations.\u201d <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1101 (9th Cir.1999) (emphasis in original). The ALJ considered Grigsby\u2019s evidence and concluded that her non-exertional impairments or alleged impairments did not interfere with her ability to perform the full range of medium work. This finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Insofar as Grigsby complains that the ALJ erred in failing to give due weight to the testimony or her treating physician or her own testimony regarding her physical condition, we agree with the analysis offered below by the magistrate judge. \u201cThe ALJ is responsible for determining credibility, resolving conflicts in medical testimony, and for resolving ambiguities.\u201d <em>Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1039 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">Grigsby argues that the case should be remanded to the ALJ to consider medical testimony as to whether, under the third step of the five-step procedure for determining disability, her blood disorder was as severe as a listed impairment, thus compelling a finding of disability. Specifically, she argues that medical testimony is required to determine whether her neutropenia met Listing 7.15, which requires \u201c[ajbsolute neutrophil counts repeatedly below 1,000 cells/cubic millimeter,\u201d and \u201c[djocumented recurrent systemic bacterial infections occurring at least 3 times during the 5 months prior to adjudication.\u201d 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 7.15 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">As to the second requirement, Grigsby relies on records supplied by Dr. Lechner, who stated in a February 25, 1999 note: \u201cOver recent months, however, she has been having repeated infections, including skin infections, bronchitis, etc.\u201d This note, however, indicates that the repeated infections were a new development, in that in the past infections \u201cwere not very frequent,\u201d and Dr. Lechner had earlier stated that Grigsby\u2019s neutropenia was asymptom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>atic. Dr. Thompson had previously noted that Grigsby \u201cretains [a] largely functional immune system.\u201d Dr. Lechner also stated in a January 20, 2000 note that Grigsby \u201cremains disabled from any gainful employment due to chronic and repeated infections.\u201d The February 25, 1999 and January 20, 2000 Lechner notes were generated and submitted after the ALJ ruled, but the appeals council made them a part of the record and considered them.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Assuming that Grigsby has shown good cause for submitting the Lechner notes after the ALJ ruled, <em>see Mayes v. Massanari, </em>262 F.3d 963, 970 (9th Cir.2001), we cannot say under the substantial evidence standard that a finding of disability was compelled, nor do we find the evidence sufficiently material to compel a remand to the ALJ. <em>See id. </em>The Lechner notes refer to a period extending beyond the relevant disability period, which ended on February 5, 1999, the date the ALJ ruled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.330 (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">PAEZ, dissenting.</p>\n<author id=\"b844-7\">PAEZ, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Because I would remand to allow the ALJ to consider the new evidence that the Appeals Council made part of the record, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The majority disposition acknowledges the medical evidence demonstrating that Grigsby \u201cremains disabled from any gainful employment due to chronic and repeated infections,\u201d but concludes that this evidence is not \u201csufficiently material to compel a remand to the ALJ.\u201d Mem. Dispo. at 4. Although this evidence was not considered by the ALJ, it was made part of the administrative record by the Appeals Council, and we must consider it in reviewing Grigsby\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">The majority disposition, however, relying on <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453 (9th Cir.2001), appears to apply a good cause requirement at the district court level to the consideration of whether the new evidence merits remand. In <em>Mayes, </em>however, the claimant urged the district court to remand her case to the ALJ to consider new evidence that had <em>not </em>been made part of the administrative record. Mayes presented this new evidence to the Appeals Council, but the Appeals Council determined that the new evidence was not relevant to whether Mayes was disabled before the ALJ rendered his decision. 276 F.3d at 458. The district court then refused to grant her request for remand because she had failed to show that this evidence was material and that there had been good cause for not offering the evidence at an earlier date. <em>Id. </em>at 462-63. Relying on <em>Mayes, </em>the majority concludes that even if Grigsby had shown good cause for submitting the Lechner notes after the ALJ ruled, the evidence is not sufficiently material to compel a remand to the ALJ. Mem. Dispo. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">However, the good cause/materiality inquiry does not apply when the Appeals Council has already made the new evidence part of the record. <em>Compare Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1179-80 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that where claimant submitted additional materials to the Appeals Council in requesting review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, \u201c[w]e may properly consider the additional materials because the Appeals Council addressed them in the context of denying Appellant\u2019s request for review\u201d) <em>and Ramirez v. Shalala, </em>8 F.3d 1449, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>1451-52 (9th Cir.1993) (noting that where the Appeals Council declined to review the decision of the ALJ after examining the entire record, including new material, we considered both the ALJ\u2019s decision and the additional materials submitted to the Appeals Council) <em>with Burton v. Heckler, </em>724 F.2d 1415, 1417 (9th Cir.1984) (\u201ca remand to the Secretary to consider additional evidence <em>not contained in the administrative record ... </em>[is] provided for by [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) ] where the new evidence is material and there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence in the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d). <em>See also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b) (\u201cIf new and material evidence is submitted, the Appeals Council shall consider the additional evidence only where it relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision. The Appeals Council shall evaluate the entire record including the new and material evidence submitted if it relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision.\u201d); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.976(b)(1). Thus, the Appeals Council must engage in a materiality inquiry, and <em>only if </em>the claimant\u2019s new evidence is material and relates to the period on or before the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision may the Appeals Council then consider the ALJ\u2019s decision in light of the additional evidence. Here, therefore, by adding Grigsby\u2019s new evidence to the administrative record, the Appeals Council determined that Grisby\u2019s new evidence was both material and related to the period on or before the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Although the district court recognized that this new evidence was part of the record, it applied the <em>Mayes </em>test and determined that there was not a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would have changed the outcome of the hearing. It reasoned that because the most compelling evidence of her deterioration was not even available until one year after the ALJ\u2019s determination, the evidence could not possibly have changed the outcome of the proceeding. The district court then stated that Grigsby could reapply for benefits if her condition had worsened. In light of <em>Harman, Ramirez, </em>and 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.970(b) &amp; 404.976(b)(1), however, I would simply consider whether the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and free from legal error while reviewing the entire record, including the additional treatment records covering the periods from December 30, 1996 through January 28, 1999 and from February 25, 1999 through March 23, 2000 that were later added to the record. <em>See Harman, </em>211 F.3d at 1174, 1179-80 (the ALJ issued its decision on June 25, 1996, but we considered treatment records from July 19, 1996, October 24, 1996, and July 1, 1997 in determining whether the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence); <em>Ramirez, </em>8 F.3d at 1451-52, 1454.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">On January 27, 1997, Dr. Lechner noted that Grigsby\u2019s white blood cell disorder \u201cpredisposed her to freq. infections\u201d and that Grigsby requires \u201cfreq. and close observation.\u201d The record further indicates that Dr. Lechner performed weekly blood cell count checks for 8 weeks following her December 1996 visit and noted her numerous bouts with mouth and tongue sores and her frequent visits to the emergency room. In addition, Dr. Lechner\u2019s 1999 and 2000 notes reflect continued bouts with sores, bronchitis and urinary tract infections. Because this new evidence shows that Grigsby\u2019s condition has deteriorated, I believe there is a reasonable possibility that this new evidence would change the outcome of the ALJ\u2019s determination. Consequently, I would remand to allow the ALJ to consider the new evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b843-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
