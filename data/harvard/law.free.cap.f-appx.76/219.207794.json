Mosbacher, </em>924 F.2d 1438, 1441 (9th Cir.1990). We find that the Secretary did not act unreasonably in determining that the license limitation program amendment to the Fishery Management Plan proposed by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council complies with National Standards Two, Four and Five set forth in Section 301 of the Magnuson Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1851(a). We also find that the Secretary did not act unreasonably by finding that the license limitation program properly took into account regulatory factors as required by the Magnuson Act under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1853(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b248-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
