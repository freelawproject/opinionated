On September 15, 2000, the bankruptcy court issued an order in which it allowed this claim in the amount of $86,349.41. The Lores appealed this order to the district court, but while the appeal was pending the bankruptcy court entered another order on October 10, 2000 in which it declared that the Lores\u2019 claim against the Blechers had been discharged.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court concluded on the basis of this second order that since the discharge barred the Lores from recovering from the Blechers personally, the Lores\u2019 appeal of the September 15 order was moot. The Lores appeal, claiming that the district court erred in concluding that their appeal was moot. The Blechers concede that the appeal was not moot but argue that the district court had no jurisdiction over the Lores\u2019 appeal from the September 15 order because that order was not final. We reverse, concluding that the district court had jurisdiction over the Lores\u2019 claim and that the Lores\u2019 appeal of the amount of their allowed claim is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">The district court had jurisdiction over the Lores\u2019 appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (2000), because the bankruptcy court\u2019s September 15 order was a final order. A bankruptcy court order that allows a claim against the bankruptcy estate over the objection of the debtor is final. <em>See Prestige Ltd. P\u2019ship-Concord v. East Bay Car Wash Partners (In re Prestige </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>Ltd. </em>P\u2019ship-Concord), 234 F.3d 1108, 1113-14 (9th Cir.2000). In this case, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order of September 15, 2000 expressly allowed the Lores\u2019 claim against the Blechers\u2019 bankruptcy estate in the amount of $86,349.41. Nevertheless, the Blechers contend that the bankruptcy court\u2019s order did not conclusively determine that the Lores\u2019 claim was allowed because it did not resolve the question of what effect the Blechers\u2019 discharge would have on allowance. In <em>Prestige, </em>234 F.3d at 1114, this Court held that a bankruptcy court order allowing a claim was final even though further proceedings were necessary to determine the amount of that claim, since the question of the amount of the claim would have no effect on the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal conclusion to allow the creditor\u2019s claim. Similarly, in this case, the only consequence of the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling on the discharge was that the Blechers are now no longer personally liable to the Lores for Robert Blecher\u2019s malpractice. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a) (2000). This ruling does not affect either the court\u2019s determination of the validity of the Lores\u2019 malpractice claim under Arizona law or its decision to allow the claim against the Blechers\u2019 estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">We also conclude that the district court erred in dismissing the Lores\u2019 appeal as moot. An appeal cannot be dismissed as moot as long as a party has a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of an appeal and the appellate court can grant some effective relief. <em>See, e.g., Kescoli v. Babbitt, </em>101 F.3d 1304, 1308 (9th Cir.1996). Here, although the Blechers\u2019 discharge prevents the Lores from recovering from the Blechers, the Lores have an interest in a final determination of the amount of their claim since the allowance of a claim against a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy estate is a final judgment with res judicata effect in a subsequent proceeding. <em>See Siegel v. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., </em>143 F.3d 525, 528-30 (9th Cir.1998). The Lores have an interest in such a final judgment because they seek to recover from Robert Blecher\u2019s malpractice insurer, and Arizona law requires the Lores to first obtain a final judgment against Blecher himself. <em>See Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Arizona Health Care Cost Containment Sys., </em>166 Ariz. 514, 803 P.2d 925, 929 (Ariz.Ct.App.1990). Since discharge affects only the Blechers\u2019 personal liability on the Lores\u2019 claim, and not the validity of that claim or the liability of any third party on that claim, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 524(a), (e) (2000), the Blechers\u2019 discharge does not moot the Lores\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Although the Blechers concede that the Lores\u2019 appeal is not moot, they argue that the district court lacks jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b) (2000) over any further proceedings on the Lores\u2019 claim. The Blechers contend that since their discharge includes the Lores\u2019 claim, this claim can no longer affect the Blechers\u2019 bankruptcy estate and thus is no longer \u201crelated to\u201d the underlying bankruptcy case. <em>See Fietz v. Great W. Sav. (In re </em>Fietz), 852 F.2d 455, 457 (9th Cir.1988). However, the discharge of a debtor does not automatically deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction over a claim related to the bankruptcy. <em>See Kieslich v. United States (In re Kieslich), </em>258 F.3d 968, 969, 971 (9th Cir.2001). Rather, the district court has the discretion to retain jurisdiction over this proceeding on the Lores\u2019 claim after considering judicial economy, comity, and fairness and convenience to the litigants. <em>Carraher v. Morgan Elec., Inc. (In re Carraher), </em>971 F.2d 327, 328 (9th Cir. 1992) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is REVERSED and this case is RE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>MANDED for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b840-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b840-15\">. After completing their payments under their Chapter 13 plan, the Blechers received a discharge on December 3, 1998, while the Lores' claim was still pending. The October 10 order simply declared that the Lores\u2019 claim was included in this discharge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
