Torres appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal as untimely of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition, challenging his jury-trial conviction and sentence for child molestation. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Torres contends that he is entitled to tolling for the entire time his first timely-filed mixed federal habeas petition was pending in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">At the time the district court dismissed Torres\u2019 first federal petition, the court did not have the benefit of our decisions in <em>Ford v. Hubbard, </em>330 F.3d 1086, 1100 (9th Cir.2003) (as amended) (allowing a second petition to relate back to the first petition after concluding that the district court erred when it failed to inform a pro se petitioner that, on the face of his first petition, he would be time-barred upon returning to federal court with newly-exhausted claims); <em>Guillory v. Roe, </em>329 F.3d 1015, 1018 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that petitioner must demonstrate diligence in exhausting claims, and stating that \u201cthe relevant measure of diligence is how quickly a petitioner sought to exhaust the claims dismissed as unexhausted, and how quickly he returned to federal court after doing so.\u201d); <em>Smith v. Ratelle, </em>323 F.3d 813, 819 (9th Cir.2003) (determining that district court\u2019s erroneous dismissal of a mixed habeas petition resulted in \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d to justify equitable tolling); and <em>Kelly v. Small, </em>315 F.3d 1063, 1070 (9th Cir.) (as amended), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 2094, 155 L.Ed.2d 1077 (2003) (deciding that \u201cthe district court must consider the alternative of staying the petition after dismissal of unexhausted claims, in order to permit Petitioner to exhaust those claims and then add them by amendment to his stayed federal petition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Torres\u2019 petition, and remand so that the district court may determine in the first instance whether the petition should be considered timely in light of this court\u2019s recent decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">VACATED and REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b218-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-10\">. We decline to address Torres' other claims since they are not encompassed in the certificate of appealability. <em>Hiivala v.
