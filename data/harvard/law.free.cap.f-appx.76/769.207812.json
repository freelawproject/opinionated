Lopez appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of Fox Television Animation, Inc.\u2019s (Fox\u2019s) motion to compel arbitration and the district court\u2019s judgment that his claims for wrongful termination and defamation (in his complaint, his fourth and sixth claims, respectively) were preempted under \u00a7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA). We vacate the district court\u2019s judgment regarding preemption under \u00a7 301 and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-16\">Discussion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-17\">I. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b798-18\">Under the well-pleaded complaint rule, it is settled that \u201ca case may not be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense, including a defense of pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>emption, even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiffs complaint, and even if both parties admit that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.\u201d <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for So. Cal., </em>463 U.S. 1, 14, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). But there is a corollary to the well-pleaded complaint rule under the \u201ccomplete preemption\u201d doctrine, \u201capplied primarily under \u00a7 301 of the LMRA.\u201d <em>Balcorta v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., </em>208 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2000).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because \u201c[t]he pre-emptive force of \u00a7 301 is so powerful as to displace entirely any state cause of action \u2018for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>federal courts have limited jurisdiction to determine whether certain state law claims, over which federal courts generally lack subject matter jurisdiction, are preempted under \u00a7 301 of the LMRA. If a court determines that claims are not preempted under \u00a7 301, jurisdiction ceases, and thus the claims must be remanded to the state court for final resolution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">We review de novo whether a district court has jurisdiction under \u00a7 301. <em>Garvey v. Roberts, </em>203 F.3d 580, 587 (9th Cir.2000). Similarly, we review de novo whether state law claims are preempted under \u00a7 301. <em>Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways, Inc., </em>255 F.3d 683, 689 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1078, 122 S.Ct. 806, 151 L.Ed.2d 692 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">II. Lopez\u2019s Claims and Preemption Under \u00a7 301</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Lopez asserts six claims in his complaint: (1) national origin discrimination; (2) unlawful retaliation; (3) failure to prevent discrimination and retaliation; (4) wrongful termination, demotion, failure to hire, and retaliation in violation of public policy; (5) violation of the Unruh Act, Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 51, 51.5; and (6) defamation. The district court determined, without explanation, that only Lopez\u2019s fourth and sixth claims were preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Lopez\u2019s fourth claim - for wrongful termination, demotion, failure to hire, and retaliation in violation of public policy - does not turn on the interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement between Lopez and Fox. Fox argues that the district court\u2019s ruling should be affirmed because consideration of Lopez\u2019s fourth claim requires analysis and interpretation of several sections of the collective bargaining agreement, namely Articles 9 (Non-discrimination), 12 (Seniority), 16 (Discipline and Discharge), and 19 (Producer\u2019s Rights) of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">\u201cA claim that a discharge violates public policy \u2018is preempted ... if it is not based on any genuine state public policy, or if it is bound up with interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and furthers no state policy independent of the employment relationship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. So. Cal. Gas Co., </em>881 F.2d 638, 643-44 (9th Cir. 1989) (quoting <em>Young v. Anthony\u2019s Fish Grottos, Inc., </em>830 F.2d 993 (9th Cir.1987)). But a claim of wrongful discharge is not preempted if it \u201cposes no significant threat to the collective bargaining process and furthers a state interest in protecting the public transcending the employment rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tionship.\u201d <em>Young, </em>830 F.2d at 1001. California has clearly adopted a public policy against workplace discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">We thus turn to consider whether the claim is \u201cbound up\u201d with interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and furthers no state policy independent of the employment relationship. To resolve this claim, a court need only make factual inquiries. <em>See Lingle v. Norge Division of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 407, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988). We question whether Lopez would even need to refer to the agreement to prove his fourth claim, let alone to interpret the agreement. However, even if the agreement required attention, the provisions concerning non-discrimination, seniority, discipline and discharge, and producer\u2019s rights are all sufficiently unambiguous as to eliminate the need for interpretation. <em>Cf. Balcorta, </em>208 F.3d at 1109-10 (\u201cA court may be required to read and apply [contract] provisions in order to determine whether an employee was discharged ... but no interpretation of the provisions would be necessary.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Lopez\u2019s sixth claim - for defamation - similarly is not preempted. In <em>Tellez v. Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co., </em>817 F.2d 536 (9th Cir.1987), and <em>Jackson </em>we held that \u00a7 301 did not preempt defamation claims because they existed independently of the collective bargaining agreements. Because the elements required to prove the defamation claim derive from California state law of defamation and those elements do not require reference to, much less interpretation of, the collective bargaining agreement in this case, Lopez\u2019s defamation claim is not preempted under \u00a7 301. <em>See Jackson, </em>881 F.2d at 645; <em>Tellez, </em>817 F.2d at 538. Moreover, this case does not fall within the narrow ambit of <em>Shane v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., </em>868 F.2d 1057 (9th cir. 1989), which held the defamation claim in that case preempted under \u00a7 301. <em>Shane </em>held the claim preempted because the allegedly defamatory statements were contained in notices that were required under the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Shane, </em>868 F.2d at 1063. In Lopez\u2019s case, the allegedly defamatory acts were remarks that existed independently of the collective bargaining agreement. Thus, we reverse the district court\u2019s determination that Lopez\u2019s defamation claim was preempted under \u00a7 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-10\">The district court correctly determined that the first, second, third, and fifth claims also do not require interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement; thus we note that these claims are also not preempted. Because we hold that none of Lopez\u2019s claims are preempted, federal jurisdiction ceases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We VACATE the district court\u2019s judgment with respect to the preemption of Lopez\u2019s fourth and sixth claims and REMAND to the district court with instructions to send all of Lopez\u2019s claims to the state court. We also VACATE the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration because the district court lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-19\">.

The doctrine of \"complete preemption\u201d should not be confused with the substantive question of preemption under \u00a7 301, though they are related, as the former is merely a doctrine of jurisdiction. \"Thus, the \u2018complete preemption' doctrine does not abrogate the standard rule that a defense of preemption does not create federal question jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See Balcorta, </em>208 F.3d at 1107 n. 7 (citing <em>Caterpillar, Inc. v.
