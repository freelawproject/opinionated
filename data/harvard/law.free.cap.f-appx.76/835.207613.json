Tobin appeals his 46-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for nineteen counts of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a)(l)(A)(i). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-22\">Tobin contends that the district court incorrectly determined that he was not entitled to a downward departure for diminished mental condition pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. The district court did not clearly err by finding that Tobin\u2019s criminal history demonstrated a need to protect the public and thus, that a downward departure was not appropriate. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>264 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.2001) (concluding that the sentencing guidelines prohibit a departure based on reduced mental capacity where the district court finds that the defendant\u2019s criminal history demonstrates a need for incarceration to protect the public).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b863-25\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
