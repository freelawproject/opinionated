White, object<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>ed to claimed exemptions from the relevant bankruptcy estates. In each case, the debtors sought, pursuant to \u00a7 2329.66(A)(10)(c) of the Ohio Revised Code, to exempt from the claims of creditors their \u201cright in the assets held in ... any individual retirement account,\u201d to the extent that the assets were attributable to contributions made within the applicable limits established by federal law. The trustee did not contest the fact that the claimed exemptions were in fact within those statutory limits. Rather, White insisted before the bankruptcy court only that the Ohio statute permitting such exemptions was improperly passed by the legislature. Specifically, the trustee contended that the bill amending the statute to allow for the exemption violated the \u201cone-subject rule\u201d of Article II, Sec. 15(D) of the Ohio Constitution by combining the amendment with legislation affecting the Retail Installment Sales Act, O.R.C. \u00a7 1317.08. He further contended that the amended bankruptcy exemption statute was void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">In one of the three cases, <em>In re John Robert Long and Sue B. Long, </em>the bankruptcy judge disagreed with those arguments by White and upheld the validity of the state exemption statute in a six-page memorandum opinion. In the other two cases, <em>In re Theodore David Williams and Peggy Ann Williams </em>and <em>In re David Edward Austin and Deborah Ann Austin, </em>a different judge then affirmed the validity of the challenged statutory provisions for the reasons articulated in the <em>Long </em>decision. A subsequent consolidated appeal by the trustee resulted in another determination, this time by the district court, that the relevant statute had been properly enacted by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In resolving the dispute before it, the district court accurately identified the relevant Ohio case law and noted first that \u201cthe mere fact that a bill embraces more than one topic is not fatal \u2018as long as a common purpose or relationship exists between the topics.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 225, 631 N.E.2d 582, 586 (Ohio 1994) (internal citations omitted; emphasis deleted). After determining that the elements of the legislation at issue were in fact related because each of the circumscribed topics dealt with the legal rights of debtors and creditors, the court went on to hold that the trustee\u2019s \u201cvoid for vagueness\u201d argument was equally without merit. As the district judge recognized, for a statute \u201cto constitute a deprivation of due process, it must be so vague and indefinite as really to be no rule or standard at all.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Busbee, </em>644 F.2d 1030, 1033 (5th Cir.1981) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the trustee was unable to come close to satisfying this difficult standard, the district court ruled that the statute passed constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">On appeal, we review questions of law such as those presented by the trustee <em>de novo. See Roach v. United States, </em>106 F.3d 720, 723 (6th Cir.1997). In doing so, it becomes apparent that the district judge accurately identified the relevant law and applied that law to the facts then before him. Because the reasons why judgment should be entered against the trustee have thus been adequately articulated by the district court, the issuance of a full written opinion by this court would be duplicative and serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court based upon the reasoning set out by that court in its Opinion and Order filed on March 21, 2002.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
