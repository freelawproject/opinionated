Tevaian, a citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed an Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) denial of Tevalan\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal. Respondent has moved to dismiss Tevalan\u2019s appeal from the denial of his asylum application, arguing this court lacks jurisdiction to review that matter because the application was dismissed as untimely filed. Af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>ter careful review of the record, we grant respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss that portion of the petition relating to asylum, and we deny the remainder of the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Specifically, we lack jurisdiction to review the Id\u2019s determination that Tevalan did not show changed or extraordinary circumstances justifying his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (no court shall have jurisdiction to review Attorney General\u2019s determination as to timeliness of asylum application). As to the denial of withholding of removal, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s ruling should be affirmed because Tevalan did not show a clear probability that he will face persecution on account of his political opinion upon return to Guatemala. <em>See Kratchmarov v. Heston, </em>172 F.3d 551, 553-55 (8th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Accordingly, we grant respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition as it relates to asylum, and we deny the petition as it relates to withholding of removal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
