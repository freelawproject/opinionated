R.Crim. P. 11 guilty plea colloquy was delegated to the magistrate judge. Serrano concedes that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but raises it to preserve the issue for further review. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>held in <em>United States v. Dees, </em>125 F.3d 261, 266-69 (5th Cir.1997), that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(3) provides a magistrate judge with the statutory authority to conduct a Fed. R.Crim. P. 11 guilty plea proceeding and that this delegation of authority does not violate the Constitution. Therefore, Serrano\u2019s argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Serrano also argues that his state conviction for aggravated assault, for which he received an imprisonment term of one year, was a misdemeanor that does not qualify as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) and therefore the district court erred when it increased his base offense level by eight levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). He concedes that this argument is also foreclosed, but raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">We held in <em>United States v. Urias-Escobar, </em>281 F.3d 165, 167-68 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 913, 122 S.Ct. 2377, 153 L.Ed.2d 196 (2002), that a crime deemed a misdemeanor under state law could fall within the definition of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) as a crime of violence punishable by at least one year of imprisonment and could thus be considered an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. The court in <em>U\u00f1as-Escobar </em>analyzed a pre-2001 version of the Guidelines. Although the 2001 Guidelines were amended to include a definition of a misdemeanor, and that definition is included in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3(A)), there was no change in the Sentencing Guidelines as to what constitutes an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Posadas-Mendez, </em>No. 02-41542, 67 Fed.Appx. 252, 2003 WL 21196167, **1-2 (5th Cir. May 13, 2003)(unpublished). Therefore, the reasoning of <em>U\u00f1as-Escobar </em>forecloses Serrano\u2019s argument, and his state conviction for aggravated assault for which he was sentenced to one year of imprisonment is an aggravated felony under the 2002 version of the Guidelines. <em>See Posadas-Mendez, </em>No. 02-41542, **1-2; <em>Urias-Escobar, </em>281 F.3d at 167-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b579-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
