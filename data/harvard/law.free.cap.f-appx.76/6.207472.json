Dowd, Jr., Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"Al\">DOWD, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Defendant-appellant Stanson Hemphill (Hemphill) challenges his convictions and sentences on charges of bank robbery, conspiracy to commit bank robbery, and use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence. After a thorough review of the trial transcript in light of the claimed errors, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-14\">Hemphill was one of three defendants named in a three-count indictment. He was charged as follows: Count One \u2014 conspiracy to commit bank robbery; Count Two \u2014 bank robbery of the First National Bank of Southwestern Ohio located in Hamilton, Ohio (Butler County) on May 9, 2002; and Count Three \u2014 knowing use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(n). As to Counts Two and Three, Hemphill was also charged as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-15\">Hemphill entered a plea of not guilty to the three counts of the indictment and was subsequently tried and convicted on all three counts. On January 29, 2002, he was sentenced to concurrent terms of 60 months on the conspiracy count and 87 months on the substantive crime of bank robbery. He also received a sentence of 84 months on the \u00a7 924 conviction, to be served consecutive to the other sentences, for a total sentence of 171 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-16\">Hemphill\u2019s co-defendants Richard Depew (Depew) and Douglas E. Brown (Brown) testified for the government, as did an alleged unindicted co-conspirator, Jessica Witt (Witt). Collectively, their testimony identified Hemphill as the planner of the bank robbery that had been carried out by Depew and Brown with the assistance of Witt, the bank teller who gathered the currency under an apparent threat from Depew who displayed a handgun during the robbery. The cooperating defendants and Witt explained how Hemphill planned the robbery, provided Depew with the mask and handgun, and drove the getaway car. Hemphill\u2019s defense was lim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ited to two witnesses who attempted to account for Hemphill\u2019s whereabouts on the day of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Hemphill claims there were four errors committed during his trial which require reversal: (1) the government\u2019s introduction of highly prejudicial bad acts testimony coupled with failure to give a contemporaneous limiting instruction; (2) the government\u2019s misstatement of the law during closing argument; (3) the constructive amendment of the indictment; and (4) the insufficiency of the evidence to support the three convictions. We will address each claimed error separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">Hemphill characterizes his first claim of error as one involving prejudicial \u201cother acts\u201d evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As our lengthy discussion below will show, that is an oversimplification. A careful review of the trial transcript reveals that, in the process of presenting <em>relevant </em>testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 402, two of the government\u2019s witnesses inserted mostly unsolicited and/or gratuitous comments. The trial court was dealing with relevant testimony <em>mixed with </em>improper testimony and the question is, therefore, more accurately framed as whether admissibility of such mixed evidence, without a <em>sua sponte </em>limiting instruction, is plain error requiring a new trial, or is harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">At trial, Hemphill\u2019s position was that the handgun brandished by Richard Depew during the bank robbery belonged to Bobbi Jo Depew. Therefore, the government had to present evidence to connect Hemp-hill to that gun.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, Bobbi Jo Depew, sister of Richard Depew, testified that she purchased the handgun at a pawn shop, in the presence of Hemphill and at his direction. Richard Depew, who brandished the handgun during the robbery, testified that Hemphill provided the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">In addition to that testimony, the government used ballistics testimony to connect Hemphill to a January 22, 2001 use of the handgun. Specifically, testimony was offered by Hamilton. Ohio police officers that a shooting was reported on January 22, 2001. Subsequently, Hemphill appeared to admit firing an unidentified gun. A spent shell casing was located at the scene of the shooting and was retained as evidence. After the bank robbery, that spent shell casing was identified by ballistics experts as having been fired from the handgun brandished in the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-14\">In sum, the testimony of Bobbi Jo Depew and Richard Depew, together with the ballistics testimony, was introduced to support the \u00a7 924 count in the indictment and the proposition that Hemphill was guilty on that count as an aider and abettor.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-15\">The difficulty arising from the ballistics testimony is the gratuitous commentary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that Hamilton Police Officers Ungerbuehler and Hensley made while giving relevant testimony tying Hemphill to the firing of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Hemphill\u2019s counsel made a timely objection prior to the introduction of the officers\u2019 testimony and the following colloquy took place after the government began questioning Officer Ungerbuehler to establish the discovery of the spent shell casing following the shooting on January 22, 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">Q. I want to direct your attention back to January 22nd, 2001. Were you working that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">A. Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">Q. On that date did you have occasion to respond to a scene regarding a shot being fired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-8\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-9\">MR. SNYDER: Your Honor. I have an objection. May we be heard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-10\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-11\">SIDEBAR CONFERENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\">MR. SNYDER: Your Honor, for purposes of making a record. I\u2019m going to renew my objection that I cited in my motion in limine as to any testimony about the Butler County incident that we\u2019re going to hear from a few witnesses today, and again this is for purposes of making a record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-13\">MR. SPRINGER [AUSA]: Opposing counsel has challenged the authenticity of the gun in question here. Testimony already elicited in this trial has indicated that this particular gun was registered in the name of Bobbi Jo Depew. Testimony through one of the witnesses suggested that the Defendant was present when the gun was purchased, that the gun was purchased with the Defendant\u2019s money, that the Defendant took possession of the gun immediately after its purchase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-14\">This testimony that we\u2019re getting ready to elicit from this particular witness will do two things. First of all, it will corroborate Bobbi Depew\u2019s testimony, and, second place, the gun in the\u2014 place the Defendant with access of the gun, thereby giving him the opportunity to provide it during the conspiracy we have charged in the indictment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-15\">THE COURT: What do you anticipate this witness would testify to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-16\">MR. SPRINGER: This witness will testify he recovered a shell casing at the scene of this crime he responded to. That shell casing, through later witnesses, will be shown to have been fired from the gun that\u2019s in question. THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-17\">MR. SNYDER: From the gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-18\">MR. SPRINGER: From Exhibit No. 2. MR. SNYDER: From Exhibit No. 2? MR. SPRINGER: From Exhibit No. 2, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-19\">MR. KOHNEN [AUSA]: I might also add. Your Honor, the Defendant admitted to having fired the gun on the date in question to another Police Officer who will testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-20\">THE COURT: I\u2019m still not seeing a connection with the Defendant. This officer responded to a crime scene, found a shell on the ground; it had been fired from this gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-21\">MR. SPRINGER: We\u2019ll have another witness that will have spoken and arrested the Defendant as a result of this incident, and that Defendant, after being arrested, admitted to that witness that he in fact had fired a gun at that location that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-22\">THE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-23\">MR. SNYDER: Judge, I have a problem with that without that foundation first. I understand the Court\u2019s position as to the motion in limine, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>we\u2019re also talking about a gun which has that serial number on it different from the one that\u2019s in the indictment, and I know that\u2019s an issue that we\u2019ll have to take up at some later point with the Court based on the testimony we\u2019ve heard this morning. But, I\u2019m not seeing that \u2014 the connection here as to the Defendant with just this witness right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">THE COURT: <em>Okay. So, what you\u2019re telling me, this fellow is foundational to the next witness who will put Mr. Hemphill in connection with this firearm.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">MR. SPRINGER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">THE COURT: Okay. But we\u2019re not going to do details of the nature of the other crime or whether Mr. Hemphill was charged\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">MR. SPRINGER: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-9\">THE COURT: \u2014 convicted or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">MR. SPRINGER: No. we\u2019re not. No. Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-11\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ll overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-12\">MR. SNYDER: With that proviso?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-13\">THE COURT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-14\">MR. SNYDER: Thank you, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-15\">R. 84 at 239-42 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-16\">The questioning of Officer Ungerbuehler then continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-17\">Q. Directing your attention, Officer Ungerbuehler, to back to January 22nd, 2001, moments ago I was asking you whether you had an occasion to respond to an incident regarding a shot being fired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-18\">A. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-19\">Q. And where did that shot \u2014 where did that place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-20\">A. We received a call to 518 South Monument Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-21\">Q. Did you respond to 518 South Monument Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-22\">A. Yes. I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-23\">Q. When you arrived at that scene, what were the steps you took?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-24\">A. When I arrived, I also arrived with Officer Topic and I believe two other officers. We <em>all surrounded the building because we didn\u2019t know if the suspect was still inside. </em>One officer went \u2014 or actually two officers went to the front doors to the apartment complex. One officer went to the one corner, one officer went to the other corner. Myself and another officer went inside. As we were walking inside, there was a shell casing from a firearm in the hallway. So, we proceeded to check the building, which rooms were open, what rooms were not open. <em>At that time, came to the conclusion that there was no one else in the building, that the suspect already left. </em>We went inside the apartment and they had gone out one of the bedroom windows in the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-25\">Q. When you observed this shell casing on the ground, were you with the one that observed that shell casing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-26\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-27\">Q. After you observed that shell casing, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-28\">A. Initially, we left it on the floor where it was laying until we could secure the building. After that I came back. I believe we tagged the shell casing, which details putting it in a plastic bag, sealing it with evidence tape, initialing it, dating it from the incident, putting the incident number on it, and returning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>that property over to the evidence room at police headquarters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">R.84 at 242-43 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">The government then introduced the following testimony of Detective William Hensley for the purpose of connecting Hemphill to the firing of a gun during the shooting of January 22, 2001:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Q. I want to direct your attention back to January 22nd, 2001. <em>Did you receive a call regarding a burglary?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">Q. How did you receive that call?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-9\">A. I was in my office and I had my\u2014 our radio on. I just happened to hear \u2014 actually a shooting call went on first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-10\">Q. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-11\">A. And officers responded to the scene, which was 518 Monument Street. At that time, I received a call from the Communications Center that they needed a detective. I collected my equipment and went to that address.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-12\">Q. Did you respond to that scene?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-14\">Q. Did you conduct your investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-16\">Q. During the course of your investigation, did you have an opportunity to speak to an individual you now know to be Stanson Hemphill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-18\">Q. How did you come across that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-19\">A. I responded to that scene and I began speaking to witnesses who were there and they provided me with Stanson Hemphill\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-20\">Q. Did you have an opportunity to speak with Stanson that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-21\">A. It was that night, early the next morning. It may have been after 12 o\u2019clock. But, yes, later that night or early in the morning, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-23\">Q. When did you see him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-24\">A. I\u2019d have to check the case file, but it was somewhere around 12 o\u2019clock, 12:30 a.m., p.m. \u2014 or a.m. On the morning \u2014 the morning of the 22nd, morning of the 23rd \u2014 evening of the 22nd, morning of the 23rd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-25\">Q. What happened when you saw Stan-son that night or early morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-26\">A. He was the individual I was looking for. I responded to his residence, which I knew to be on Petty Drive. Myself and a patrol officers \u2014 patrol officer \u2014 sat at that residence for a while. I then drove to an address off of Wilson Street in our Second Ward area where Mr. Hemphill\u2019s brother lives, and I saw Mr. Hemp-hill exit the residence and that\u2019s when we approached him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-27\">Q. When you approached Mr. Hemp-hill, what did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-28\">A. <em>Well, when he first saw us, he ran, and we got him cornered in between the alley and the street, and I found him sitting on the porch of a residence a couple houses down from his brother\u2019s house.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-29\">Q. What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-30\">A. <em>I knew Stanson Hemphill </em>and I told him \u2014 I said I needed to speak with him. I asked him to come back to my office with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-31\">Q. <em>How did you know Stanson? You said you knew him. How did you know him?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-32\">A. <em>I had had another case involving Mr. Hemphill.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-33\">Q. Okay. When you took him back to the office, did you then have a conversation with Stanson Hemphill?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-34\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-35\">Q. What happened in the conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>A. I spoke to Mr. Hemphill about the shooting on Monument Street and he stated that -</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">R. 84 at 265-67 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">After renewed objections by Hemphill\u2019s attorney, the court immediately attempted to limit the testimony by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">THE COURT: <em>I\u2019m going to overrule the objection at this point, but I do caution the U.S. Attorneys that we don\u2019t want any unduly prejudicial information about other crimes to creep into the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">R. 84 at 269 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">The questioning of Hensley then continued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">Q. Moments ago, Detective, you had informed the jury that the Defendant Stanson Hemphill had accompanied you back to the police interview room: is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">Q. You had a conversation with the defendant at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">Q. What did you ask the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-15\">A. I questioned him in reference to the shooting incident which had occurred several hours before at 518 Monument Street.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-16\">Q. What did the defendant tell you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-17\">A. He stated that, <em>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to believe me, but the gun wasn\u2019t even mine.\u201d </em>I said,\u2018Well, I believe that. Whose was it?\u201d He said, \u201cFrenchman Minnief\u00edeld.\u201d I asked him where the gun was at that time and he didn\u2019t respond. I then tried to get the whole statement that \u2014 we\u2019d been speaking for sometime at that point, and <em>I attempted to get the statement reduced to a written statement, and he stated he </em>didn\u2019t\u2014 <em>he would like to talk to me tomorrow after he went to court, the next day after he went to court. And I explained to him thaU </em>\u2014 first <em>he said, \u201cI think I want an attorney.\u201d I said. \u201cAre you advising me you don\u2019t want to talk to me anymore?\u201d He said. \u2018Well, I want to talk to you tomorrow after I go to court.\u201d I explained that I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to him after that, and I said. \u201cSo, are you saying you don\u2019t want to talk to me anymore and you want an attorney with you?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d At that time the interview was stopped.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-20\">Q. <em>Did he ever tell you what he did with the gun?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-21\">A. <em>No, he wouldn\u2019t respond at all to that.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-22\">R. 84 at 270-71 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-23\">The gratuitous commentary about the \u201cburglary,\u201d the fact that Hemphill \u201cran\u201d (inferring an attempt to escape), the fact that Hemphill was previously the subject of an investigation, and the subsequent refusal of Hemphill to submit to additional questioning, comes within the framework of \u201cother acts\u201d which are not admissible for any purpose under the strict teachings of Rule 404(b) rulings. Moreover, the district court did not engage in a Rule 404(b) analysis or provide any limiting jury instructions that are required when Rule 404(b) evidence is received.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The difficulty presented to the trial court by this mixture of both relevant evidence connecting the defendant to the handgun and the improper gratuitous commentary is obvious. Here the district court admonished the government to limit the testimony, but the government attorney apparently did not ask for a continuance so the witnesses could be instructed to avoid gratuitous commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">So, underlying the issue of a \u201cback door\u201d introduction of Rule 404(b) evidence, without any analysis as to admissibility or a contemporaneous instruction to the jury, is the question of whether introduction of that gratuitous commentary <em>along with </em>the relevant evidence requires a new trial or is merely harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Here, we pause to discuss the defense presented. It was limited to the testimony of LaShandra Cavanaugh<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Billy Garrison,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> friends of Hemphill, who indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>that they were at Hemphill\u2019s apartment on the day of the bank robbery and that he did not leave the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">We observe that, when Rule 404(b) evidence is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with evidence relevant to the crime charged, the admonitions limiting the admission of 404(b) evidence do not apply. <em>United States v. Torres, </em>685 F.2d 921, 924 (5th Cir.1982) <em>(per curiam). </em>Citing <em>Torres, </em>this court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">When the other crimes or wrongs occurred at different times and under different circumstances from the offense charged, the deeds are termed \u201cextrinsic.\u201d \u201cIntrinsic\u201d acts, on the other hand, are those that are part of a single criminal episode. <em>Rule 101(b) is not implicated when the other crimes or wrongs evidence is part of a continuing pattern of illegal activity. When that circumstance applies, the government has no duty to disclose the other crimes or wrongs evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">The 1991 Advisory Committee note to Rule 404(b) is in agreement: \u201cThe amendment does not extend to evidence of acts which are <em>\u2018intrinsic\u2019 </em>to the charged offense, <em>see United States v. Williams, </em>900 F.2d 823 (5th Cir. 1990)....\u201d For similar holdings, <em>see United States v. Dozie, </em>27 F.3d 95, 97 (4th Cir.1994) <em>(per curiam), United States v. Nicholson, </em>17 F.3d 1294, 1298 (10th Cir.1994), <em>United States v. Sparks, </em>2 F.3d 574, 581 (5th Cir.1993), and <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>995 F.2d 1006, 1007-08 (10th Cir.1993).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-10\"><em>United States v. Barnes, </em>49 F.3d 1144, 1149 (6th Cir.1995) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-14\">In our view, the commentary by the Hamilton police officers did not constitute <em>\u201cintrinsic\u201d </em>evidence. Connecting Hemp-hill to the gun used in the bank robbery did not require gratuitous commentary about burglary, the fact that Hemphill ran, the fact that Hemphill was apparently arrested and kept overnight, the fact that Officer Hensley knew Hemphill from before, or that Hemphill failed to give a written statement to Hensley concerning the events that caused the officers to be involved in the January 22, 2001 incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">We begin by recognizing that the district court committed no error in permitting the government to use ballistics evidence to attempt to link Hemphill to the handgun brandished in the bank robbery, the handgun allegedly furnished by the defendant to Depew. In the context of the ballistics evidence and Hemphill\u2019s apparent admission arising from the January 22, 2001 incident, the teachings of <em>United States v. Price, </em>329 F.3d 903 (6th Cir.2003) are relevant. The <em>Price </em>court declared that Rule 404(b) applies to evidence submitted to prove an extraneous \u201cother act,\u201d but is not applicable to \u201cevidence that itself is probative of the crime charged[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906 (citing <em>United States v. DeClue, </em>899 F.2d 1465, 1472 (6th Cir.1990)). Here, the district court cautioned the government to avoid testimony about other crimes. Despite that admonition, suggestive testimony about the defendant being engaged in other criminal conduct crept into both the questions of the government and the responses of the government witnesses. Ungerbuehler and Hensley. We observe, however, that counsel for the defendant made neither a motion to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the gratuitous commentary nor a motion for mistrial. Additionally, counsel did not object to failure by the court to engage in a 404(b) analysis or give a limiting instruction, either at the time the offending testimony was offered or in the final jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">So, the appellate issue that emerges is whether it was plain error under Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b), and therefore reversible error, for the court to fail to <em>sua sponte </em>give a limiting instruction as to the offending testimony, or to order it stricken from the record, in a situation where the offending testimony is <em>extrinsic </em>to the relevant testimony.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982), the Supreme Court recognized both that the power granted by the plain error review of Rule 52(b) was to be used sparingly and that the rule\u2019s use is limited to situations where the plain error would \u201cseriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, nn. 13, 14, 102 S.Ct. 1584.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">As a part of our plain error analysis, we have reviewed both the opening statement and the final argument presented by the government and we find no reference to the gratuitous and unsolicited commentary of Officers Ungerbuehler and Hensley.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In the context of a plain error review, we note that defendant\u2019s counsel may have decided to forego a motion for mistrial because, as a strategic decision, he preferred to test the government\u2019s case with the jury that was impaneled<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> or may not have wished to emphasize the gratuitous commentary by a motion to strike. Against that background, we find an absence of plain error and decline to order a new trial based on the gratuitous commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">The second claim regarding the misuse of Rule 404(b) evidence by the government relates to the use of marijuana by Depew on the day of the offense. On cross-examination by Hemphill\u2019s counsel, Depew testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">Q. You use marijuana often?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-14\">Q. How often do you use it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-15\">A. Daily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-16\">Q. You still \u2014 well, you were using it daily at the time this occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-18\">Q. Did you use it on the day it occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-19\">A. On May 9th I did, but on May 8th I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-20\">Q. Okay. How much did you use on a daily basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-21\">A. Probably half ounce, ounce, sometimes an ounce and a half.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-22\">Q. A day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-23\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-24\">Q. So, you were using this at the time the robbery took place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">R.83 at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">On redirect, the government\u2019s counsel elicited the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">Q. You also said you smoked some marijuana on May 9th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">Q. Where did you get that from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">A. It was divided between me, Stan-son, and Doug. It was a half pound. We divided it into three ounces apiece.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">No objection was entered to the redirect testimony of Depew. Hemphill\u2019s counsel was first to raise the question of Depew\u2019s use of marijuana on the day of the bank robbery and thereby opened the door to the testimony on redirect that suggested Hemphill received a portion of the marijuana on that day. Under those circumstances, in view of Depew\u2019s testimony incriminating Hemphill on the day of the bank robbery, and given Depew\u2019s position that Hemphill was the driving force behind the planning and execution of the bank robbery, there was no plain error in the district court\u2019s silence during questioning of Depew about the source of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">Counsel for Hemphill contends that the government\u2019s final argument misled the jury into believing that evidence of Hemphill\u2019s \u201cprior possession\u201d of the firearm displayed during the bank robbery was sufficient to establish proof of the \u00a7 924 violation on the day of the bank robbery. The first phase of the government\u2019s final argument about which Hemp-hill now complains stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-15\">What we know is that this Defendant had possession of that gun. And how do we know that? Well, Bobbi Jo told us that the gun was purchased at the Defendant\u2019s direction. Bobbi Jo told us that the gun was purchased with the Defendant\u2019s money. Bobbi Jo Depew told us that Defendant was present when the gun was purchased. And Bobbi Jo Depew told us that the Defendant took possession of that gun after it was purchased. And I told you in opening statement that you\u2019d see evidence that that Defendant used that gun. And you saw that evidence. Detective Hensley told you what happened on January 22nd at South \u2014 518 South Monument Street. Told you how he responded to the scene. Informed you that he had spoke [sic] to the Defendant. That the Defendant admitted to firing the shot. You know that that shell casing was recovered. And you\u2019ve seen exclusive proof that that shell casing was in fact fired through what has been marked for identification as Government Exhibit 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-17\">What the evidence has shown you is that this Defendant had possession of the gun, that he provided the gun to Richard Depew to commit to use during the commission of this offense. And you remember that videotape we showed you? Is there any doubt that that firearm was brandished during the commission of this offense? Is there any doubt that that gun was used to intimidate?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-18\">R.85 at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-19\">No objection to this argument was made nor does the government\u2019s argument actually contend that prior possession establishes the \u00a7 924 violation; rather, the argument was aimed at crediting Depew\u2019s testimony that Hemphill supplied him with the firearm brandished during the course of the bank robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-20\">Appellate counsel for Hemphill also objects to the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Now, with respect to the gun, when the Judge instructs you, we don\u2019t have to prove that it\u2019s the exact gun as identified in the indictment. Our burden is to show that a gun was brandished during the commission of the offense, and you\u2019ll have that video, and you\u2019ll see the pictures. There will be no doubt in your mind that the gun was brandished. And we\u2019ve showed you conclusive proof that the gun that was used during the commission of that robbery was also in the possession of the Defendant prior to the robbery. As such, we respectfully request that you return a verdict of guilty \u2014 guilty of all charges. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">In particular, Hemphill contends that the statement, \u201cwe don\u2019t have to prove it\u2019s the exact gun as identified in the indictment,\u201d constituted a misstatement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The government argues that both challenged statements were in response to the defendant\u2019s own final argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The claimed errors are limited to a plain error analysis. We find no such plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-11\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">Count Three of the indictment charged that both Depew and Hemphill \u201cknowingly used, carried, and brandished a firearm, to wit, a Ruger, Model P9, Stainless .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol, <em>se\u00f1al number 58105977, </em>during and in relation to a crime of violence for which they may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, that is, armed robbery of the First National Bank of Southwestern Ohio, 2299 Peck Boulevard. Hamilton, Ohio\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00a9 and 2. R.13 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-13\">According to Hemphill, and with no dispute from the government, on the second day of the trial, the government informed the court that the serial number on the firearm at issue was not 581-059787 but rather 661-059787. The government was then allowed to introduce new evidence, not provided during discovery, to correct the discrepancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">Hemphill labels this change as a constructive amendment to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">Our review of whether there was a constructive amendment is <em>de novo. United States v. Robison, </em>904 F.2d 365, 368 (6th Cir.1990). This court defines a constructive amendment as occurring</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>when \u201cthe terras of the indictment are in effect altered by the presentation of evidence and jury instructions which so modify essential elements of an offense charged that there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>United States v. Manning, </em>142 F.3d 336, 339 (6th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Hathaway, </em>798 F.2d 902, 910 (6th Cir. 1986)). A constructive amendment is <em>per se </em>prejudicial and warrants reversal. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>872 F.2d 1231, 1235 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The government argues that the serial number was mere descriptive surplusage and contends that the indictment was legally sufficient without the description of the firearm and the serial number. The government cites a similar situation with an indictment involving counterfeiting that described the counterfeit bill as bearing Face Plate No. 1245, whereas the number on the bill offered into evidence was 1-245. <em>See Simon v. United States, </em>78 F.2d 454, 455 (6th Cir.1935). In <em>Simon, </em>the court found no fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Hemphill\u2019s counsel asserts that he knew the serial number on the firearm displayed to him in discovery was different than the one described in the indictment and that he had prepared a defense aimed at showing that the firearm to be introduced in evidence by the government in support of Count Three was not the firearm described in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We conclude that, as in <em>Simon v. United States, supra, </em>there was no fatal variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">Hemphill\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions requires this court to determine whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any rational trier of fact could have found that the prosecution proved the essential elements of each crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Russell, </em>76 F.3d 808, 811 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 841, 117 S.Ct. 121, 136 L.Ed.2d 72 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-12\">The testimony of Depew, Brown, and Witt, if believed by the jury, unequivocally supports all three convictions. Their mutually corroborating testimony leads to the conclusion that Hemphill was the moving force in planning the robbery and that he supplied the mask, the weapon brandished by Depew, and the get-a-way car. Necessary to the planning of the robbery was the cooperation of the unindicted co-conspirator Jessica Witt, who collected the funds from her window and the other two tellers while making certain that no dye pack was inserted with the collected currency. Moreover, Witt\u2019s boyfriend Douglas Brown communicated with Hemphill to advise him when the coast was clear for Depew to enter the bank and carry out the robbery. Depew offered testimony that he lost his nerve to carry out the robbery on May 8 but, with urging from Hemphill, engaged in the robbery on the next day, May 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-13\">Hemphill points to the testimony of his two alibi witnesses to support his claim of insufficiency and describes the testimony of Depew, Brown, and Witt as compromised by their self-interest in receiving lower sentences or, in the case of the unindicted Witt, some other favorable treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">The claim of insufficient evidence is patently without merit. Clearly, the jury could find from the evidence that Hemphill participated in the conspiracy, and the testimony of the three witnesses supports the accusation that Hemphill aided and abet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>ted in the commission of the crimes charged in Counts Two and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">III. CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Hemphill\u2019s convictions and his sentence to a term of 171 months are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-9\">. Ordinarily, we would review a district court's determination regarding the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Mack, </em>258 F.3d 548, 553 (6th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Trepel v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 708, 716 (6th Cir. 1999) which explained that per the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>General Electric Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 142-43, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), all evidentiary rulings are to be reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b37-17\">. Count Three in the indictment charged Hemphill and Richard W. Depew with violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and 2. The firearm that was alleged to have been brandished during the bank robbery was described as a Ruger, Model P9, Stainless .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol, serial number 58105977.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b41-18\">. In <em>United States v. Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d 1070 (6th Cir. 1996), the court explained how Rule 404(b) should ordinarily be applied. First, \"upon objection by the defendant, the proponent of the evidence, usually the government, should be required to identify the <em>specific </em>purpose or purposes for which the government offers the evidence of 'other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\u2019 \" <em>Id. </em>at 1076 (emphasis in original). Second, \"the district court must determine whether the identified purpose ... is 'material'; that is, whether it is 'in issue\u2019 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1076-77. Third, if the court finds the purpose to be material, it \"must <em>then </em>determine, before admitting the other acts evidence, whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077. Finally, \"[i]f the evidence satisfies Rule 403, then, after receiving the evidence, the district court must 'clearly, simply, and correctly\u2019 instruct the jury as to the <em>specific </em>purpose for which they may consider the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1077 (emphasis in original) (citing <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>27 F.3d 1186, 1193 (6th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1115, 115 S.Ct. 910, 130 L.Ed.2d 792 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We note that, although <em>Merriweather </em>also held that our review of the district court\u2019s Rule 404(b) rulings is <em>de novo, </em>78 F.3d at 1074, subsequent rulings have established an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See </em>n. 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">. LaShandra Cavanaugh, 19 years of age, testified that she was the fiancee of the defendant, engaged in baby-sitting two children at Hemphill's residence at the time of the bank robbery and that Hemphill was home during the entire day. She identified one of the children as the daughter of Jessica Witt, the unindicted co-conspirator who was the head teller at the bank. Cavanaugh indicated that she remembered the day in question, May 9, as it was the birthday of Billy Garrison who visited the residence during the day. She also stated on cross-examination that Jessica Witt, Douglas Brown, and Richard Depew would be lying if they testified that they saw Hemp-hill on that date in the context of the bank robbery.
