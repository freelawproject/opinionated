This court reviews a \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) dismissal as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-21\">The district court determined that the suit was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. Carbin conclusionally argues that dismissal was error because a jury could find in his favor, because the defendants have not presented any evidence yet, and because he has been denied justice; he also asserts that he should have been given the opportunity to amend his pleadings. Carbin additionally cites cases for the proposition that res judicata should not apply when a plaintiff did not have a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>and fair opportunity to lit\u00edgate his claims in prior litigation, but he does not affirmatively assert that he was denied such an opportunity in his previous lawsuits. Moreover, even giving his pleadings liberal construction, Carbin makes no specific argument that the application of the doctrine of res judicata to his claims was error, and he has therefore waived the sole ground for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is therefore DISMISSED. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Carbin\u2019s complaint counts as a \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does this court\u2019s dismissal of the instant appeal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). This court has previously dismissed the appeal from the dismissal as frivolous of Carbin\u2019s prior civil rights action, giving him two more strikes. <em>See Carbin v. United States Navy, et al., </em>No. 95-60544, 1995 WL 696780 (5th Cir. Oct.19, 1995) (unpublished). Because Car-bin has now accumulated more than three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; THREE-STRIKES BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b550-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
