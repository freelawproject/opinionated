The order, entered on January 28, 2003, denied Nadew\u2019s motion to reconsider the Board\u2019s June 24, 2002 order, affirming without opinion, the immigration judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Because Nadew did not raise the denial of the motion for reconsideration in his brief, we deem this issue abandoned. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 (4th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
