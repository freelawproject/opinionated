Freeman (\u201cthe petitioner\u201d) petitions for review of the decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) that sustained his removal by the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d) from the position of Consumer Safety Inspector for the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). <em>Freeman v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. NY-0752-01-0309-1-2 (M.S.P.B. Mar.28, 2002) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d), <em>review denied, Freeman v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>No. NY-0752-01-0309-1-2 (M.S.P.B. Dec.13, 2002) (\u201cFinal Order\u201d). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b978-16\">The petitioner was a Consumer Safety Inspector at the FDA in New York City. For the most part, the events that gave rise to his removal are not in dispute. On May 24, 2000, the petitioner was using an agency vehicle for a non-governmental purpose when the vehicle was damaged by a person fleeing from the police. Initial Decision at 2-4. During the time that the vehicle was out of service, from May 24, 2000, until August 2, 2000, the petitioner retained the government credit card issued for the purpose of purchasing gas and emergency repairs for that vehicle, and used the credit card for personal expenditures. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-17\">On December 14, 2000, agents from the FDA\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs interviewed the petitioner regarding the incident. The petitioner gave the agents a sworn statement, in which he stated that he used the government credit card \u201cto purchase gas, motor oil, and window cleaner for another [government] vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5. On February 21, 2001, after obtaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>receipts from the service station for the petitioner\u2019s purchases, the agents interviewed the petitioner again, at which time the petitioner admitted in a sworn statement that he used the credit card to make personal expenditures as well. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">On April 13, 2001, the agency issued the petitioner a notice of removal, based on the following six charges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">(1) willful misuse of a government vehicle; (2) providing false and/or misleading information to special agents of the Office of Internal Affairs; (3) misuse of a government credit card; (4) providing false information on or for official documents; (5) failure to request and receive approval for outside employment; and (6) absence without leave (AWOL).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b979-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 2. On June 15, 2001, the agency sustained all six of the charges against the petitioner and determined that the charges warranted the petitioner\u2019s removal. (Gov\u2019t App. at 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">The petitioner appealed his removal to the Board on November 30, 2001. After conducting a hearing on February 6-7, 2002, at which the petitioner was represented by counsel, the administrative judge affirmed the removal. Initial Decision at 1. Based on evidence taken at the hearing, documentary evidence, and undisputed facts, the administrative judge determined that the agency had proven by a preponderance of the evidence: charge 1: willful misuse of a government vehicle; specification 3 of charge 2: providing false and/or misleading information to special agents of the Office of Internal Affairs;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and charge 3: misuse of a government credit card. Initial Decision at 2-8. The administrative judge did not sustain: charge 4: providing false information on or for official documents; charge 5: failure to request and receive approval for outside employment; or charge 6: AWOL; and these charges are, therefore, not relevant to this appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 8-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">The administrative judge rejected two affirmative defenses offered by the petitioner. The administrative judge found that the agents of the Office of Internal Affairs did not violate agency guidelines or commit any other harmful error in interviewing the petitioner. <em>Id. </em>at 12. The administrative judge also rejected the petitioner\u2019s defense under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9) that he was removed in retaliation for filing a grievance against his supervisor. <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Finally, the administrative judge determined that the removal of the petitioner promoted the efficiency of the service pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(a), and that the penalty of removal was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">The initial decision became final when the Board denied review on December 13, 2002. Final Order at 2. The petitioner timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b979-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b979-16\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The administrative judge sustained charge 1 against the petitioner, willful misuse of a government vehicle. The willful use of a government vehicle for other than an official purpose is prohibited by statute and regulation. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349(b) (2000); 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 102-34.240 (2003). We have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-5\">in order for the [employee\u2019s] action to constitute a willful use for a nonofficial purpose within the meaning of [41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349(b)], the employee must have had actual knowledge that the use would be characterized as \u201cnonofficial\u201d or have acted in reckless disregard as to whether the use was for nonofficial purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-6\"><em>Kimm v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, </em>61 F.3d 888, 891-92 (Fed.Cir.1995). The administrative judge relied on testimony by the petitioner\u2019s supervisor that the petitioner \u201ctook an agency vehicle (G10-01018) \u2014 without approval \u2014 to his residence, and the vehicle was damaged by a person who had committed a robbery and was attempting to flee from police officers.\u201d Initial Decision at 2-3. The petitioner testified that his supervisor gave him oral permission to drive the vehicle to his other place of employment at the Census Bureau. <em>Id. </em>at 3. The administrative judge concluded that even if the petitioner\u2019s testimony that he had been given permission to drive the vehicle to the Census Bureau were correct, the petitioner \u201cvoluntarily and consciously used the vehicle for an unofficial purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. This holding was based on substantial evidence, and the administrative judge properly sustained charge 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">The administrative judge sustained specification 3 of charge 2 against the petitioner \u2014 providing false and/or misleading information to special agents of the Office of Internal Affairs \u2014 based on the petitioner\u2019s failure to inform the Office of Internal Affairs agents in his first interview with the agents on December 14, 2000, that he used the government credit card for personal expenditures. <em>Id. </em>at 8. The administrative judge found that when the petitioner only told the special agents during the first interview that he had used the credit card to make purchases for the other government vehicle, \u201che deliberately failed to tell the agents the entire story ...; he did not acknowledge \u2014 until the February 21, 2001 interview \u2014 that he used the government credit card to purchase cartons of cigarettes for himself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The petitioner admitted in a sworn statement submitted to the agents on February 21, 2001, that he used the credit card to make personal expenditures, and the petitioner did not contest this fact before the Board. Therefore, the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner made false and/or misleading statements to the agents on December 14, 2000, was based on substantial evidence, and charge 2 was properly sustained. Based on the same evidence, the administrative judge properly sustained charge 3, misuse of a government credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">The administrative judge properly rejected the petitioner\u2019s first affirmative defense \u2014 that the special agents did not adhere to agency guidelines in their interviews of the petitioner \u2014 based on the petitioner\u2019s failure to cite a particular rule or regulation that the agents violated or offer any evidence to support this defense. <em>See </em>Initial Decision at 12. The administrative judge also properly held that the agents were not obligated to read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to the petitioner, because the petitioner did not demonstrate that the interviews constituted custodial interrogations. <em>See, e.g., Oregon v. Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 494-95, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (holding that the <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>warnings are not required absent custodial interrogation).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">On appeal, the petitioner focuses on several points. He urges that the administrative judge improperly rejected his second affirmative defense, that his removal was in reprisal for filing a grievance against his supervisor in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(9). In order to demonstrate reprisal, the petitioner was required to present evidence that \u201cthere was a genuine nexus between the retaliation and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Dep\u2019t of Def. Dependents Sch., </em>814 F.2d 1549, 1555 (Fed.Cir.1987). The administrative judge did not err in rejecting this defense, based on the petitioner\u2019s failure to present \u201cevidence demonstrating a causal connection between the grievance and the removal action.\u201d Initial Decision at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The petitioner contends that the penalty of removal is unwarranted in this case. \u201cOur review of penalties imposed by agencies \u2018is highly deferential, and requires a showing that the penalty is grossly disproportionate to the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Farrell v. Dep\u2019t of Interior, </em>314 F.3d 584, 594 (Fed.Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Bieber v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>287 F.3d 1358, 1365 (Fed.Cir.2002)) (citations omitted in original). We find that the administrative judge carefully considered the seriousness of the three offenses that were upheld on appeal, as well as mitigating factors in favor of the petitioner, <em>see </em>Initial Decision at 13-14, and hold that the administrative judge\u2019s conclusion that the penalty of removal was still reasonable was not an abuse of discretion or otherwise contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">In his petition for review in this court, the petitioner raises three additional arguments: inadequate representation before the administrative judge, sexual discrimination by his supervisor, and \u201cnon-support from union representatives.\u201d (Pet. Br. at 1.) These issues were not presented in the petitioner\u2019s \u201cStatement of Facts and Issues (Including Defenses)\u201d before the Board, and were not addressed by the administrative judge. (Gov\u2019t App. at 56-62.) The petitioner makes no showing that he raised these issues before the Board. \u201cOur precedent clearly establishes the impropriety of seeking a reversal of the board\u2019s decision on the basis of assertions never presented to the presiding official or to the board.\u201d <em>Sargent v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>229 F.3d 1088, 1091 (Fed. Cir.2000) (citations omitted). We therefore decline to consider these additional arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">The decision of the administrative judge was based on substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, procedurally defective, or otherwise contrary to law. The final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board is, therefore, <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-9\">. The agency based charge 2 on three specifications: (1) an allegation that the petitioner \"gave false information to the special agents in that he stated that he used the government credit card one or two times for purchases for an agency vehicle,\u201d Initial Decision at 6-7; (2) an allegation that the petitioner \"gave false information to the special agents in that he claimed the credit card was broken in two,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7; and (3) an allegation that the petitioner \"gave the special agents false information in that he claimed to have used the government credit card for purchases for another agency vehicle,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 7-8. The administrative judge sustained charge 2 based only on specification 3. <em>Id. </em>at 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
