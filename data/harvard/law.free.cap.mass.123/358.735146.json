Elsbree appeared as claimants of the funds in the hands of the trustee, and were adjudged to be entitled to the funds, and the trustee, who had filed no answer, was discharged. The plaintiff appealed to the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-10\">At the trial in that court, the claimants were permitted to show that at the time of service upon the trustee there was nothing due from him to the principal defendants.

Evidence that there were no goods, effects or credits of the defendants in the hands of the trustee at the time of the service of the writ upon him would in effect prove the claimant out of court.
