The case was submitted to the Superior Court upon an agreed statement of facts in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-9\">On September 19, 1876, the plaintiff attached the goods and estate of Ellen Dyer and John B. Dyer, on a writ returnable to the Second District Court of Bristol. For the purpose of dissolving such attachment, the bond in suit was given, and, on the execution and delivery of the bond, the goods and estate of both principals were so released from attachment. The original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>action was duly entered, the plaintiff discontinued as to Ellen Dyer, and judgment was entered against John B. Dyer. The plaintiff gave no notice to the sureties on the bond that he should or had discontinued the action as to Ellen Dyer; execution duly issued on the judgment against John B. Dyer, and was returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-4\">If, upon these facts, the sureties were discharged by the plaintiff\u2019s discontinuance as to Ellen Dyer, judgment was to be entered for them ; otherwise, judgment for the plaintiff. The Superior Court ordered judgment for the sureties; and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\">jffi <em>K. </em>Braley, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-6\"><em>\u2022J. W Cummings, </em>for the sureties.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b382-7\">Endicott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACjg\">In the original action brought by the plaintiff, the property of both defendants was attached. They thereupon gave a bond to dissolve the attachment, upon which this action is brought. The plaintiff in the original action discontinued against one, and judgment was entered against the other defendant. It is now contended that this discontinuance discharged the sureties, and they are no longer liable on the bond; but the court is not of that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">There is nothing in the language of the bond, or the circumstances under which it was given, to indicate that it was intended to be restricted to a judgment against both the original defendants. It dissolved an attachment made upon the property of each, and should therefore stand as security to the plaintiff for the default of either. If at the trial of the original action the plaintiff had recovered against one defendant only, the case would have fallen precisely within <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Speidel, </em>104 Mass. 356. The condition of the bond in that case was substantially the same as in this. See also <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>121 Mass. 516. The result, so far as the sureties are concerned, is the same whether the plaintiff discontinues against one defendant, or fails to recover against him upon trial. No change is made in the nature of the claim which is the subject of the suit, and nc greater or different liability is cast upon the sureties by the discontinuance. <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>116 Mass. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The case is clearly to be distinguished from <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>White, 5 </em>Allen, 322, and <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Storer, </em>114 Mass. 101, relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>by the defendants. In those cases the plaintiff not only discontinued against one defendant, but summoned in another, and there was judgment against a new party not mentioned in the bond. <em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
