That plan showed the location of a \u201c proposed street,\u201d where Atlantic Avenue now is, and all the proposed changes were east of this, except the following : \u201c If the project for laying out a new street across said dock, as laid down on the plan annexed, now under consideration by the city of Boston, shall be abandoned, then \u201d the defendant might make a certain extension westerly of this street as shown on that plan. \u201cIt being however mutually understood that neither of the parties to these presents does in any manner abandon or surrender any other rights in the docks or wharves held by them by virtue of any deeds, grants or otherwise, excepting as is herein expressly stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-4\">On December 18, 1868, Atlantic Avenue, as shown on the plan, was laid out as a public highway by the mayor and aider-men of the city of Boston, under the authority given by the St. of 1867, <em>c. </em>824, and was constructed in the following year in such a manner as to exclude the tide-water from the dock west of it; and, in 1870 and 1871, this portion of the dock (marked A and B on the plan) was filled in with earth by the city of Boston, under the St. of 1869, <em>c. </em>181, which authorized the city, in order to abate a nuisance, to fill up the docks inclosed by Atlantic Avenue, and gave the city \u201c a lien on the land made by said filling, for the cost of doing the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-5\">After such filling, and prior to the date of the writ, the defendant, without the permission of the plaintiff, erected permanent wooden buildings upon that portion of the filled dock marked B on the plan, covering a large part of such parcel, and of such a character as to prevent the plaintiff\u2019s passage across in certain directions, and interrupting the use of said parcel by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b587-6\">If, upon these facts, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, the case was to be sent to an assessor; otherwise, judgment was to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-7\"><em>M. </em>Williams, Jr., ((7. <em>A.

All the covenants, including that against erecting fixtures or buildings of any kind within the bounds of the dock, were incidental to the grant of this easement. The laying out of a street and filling up of the dock by the city, under authority conferred by statute, made the enjoyment of this easement impossible, and thereby extinguished it. <em>Hancock </em>v.
