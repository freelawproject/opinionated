Britton, Sarah A. Britton and Sarah M. Shattuck, for a jury to assess damages occasioned to the petitioners\u2019 real estate, owned by them in common, by relocating and changing the grade of Lincoln Street in Worcester.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-8\">At the trial, before Gardner, J., it appeared that on November 1, 1873, the county commissioners, upon the petition of Edwin Conant and others, adopted an order relocating and lowering the grade of Lincoln Street, through the petitioners\u2019 estate, and taking for that purpose 14,60.0 square feet of their land, and assessing their damages at $300.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>The petitioners claimed damages for the land taken, for the expense of moving a bam standing on the land, and for injury to the estate caused by the lowering of the grade of the street, and they introduced evidence to prove that the land was worth three cents a foot, and also as to the other damages claimed. The evidence introduced by the parties was conflicting as to whether the petitioners\u2019 estate derived benefit from the change in the street. Simeon A. Britton, one of the petitioners, testified that it cost $400 to move the barn, and this was not controverted by the respondent. Britton did not testify as to the damages to the estate, except as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-4\">The respondent called as a witness William O. Brown, one of the county commissioners, and offered to prove by him, that, at the hearing upon the petition of Conant and others, and before the order relocating the street was adopted, Britton appeared and verbally consented and agreed that the petitioners would accept $300 in full for the damages to their estate on account of the relocation and change of grade of the street. The respondent also called as a witness Charles W. Burbank, a surveyor, who testified that, acting under the direction of Simeon A. Britton and Sarah A. Britton, and while-Conant\u2019s petition was pending, he staked out a location of Lincoln Street, through the premises in question, varying somewhat from a location which had previously been staked out by the city engineer, and that his location was substantially adopted; which testimony was admitted without objection. The respondent \u201cthen offered to prove by Burbank that, while the petition was pending, by the same authority, he informed the county commissioners that if his location was adopted, instead of that of the city engineer, the petitioners would accept $300 in full for their damages ; but, as the respondent did not prove, or offer to prove, that either Simeon A. Brit-ton or Burbank was authorized to act for Sarah M. Shattuck, and, as the respondent\u2019s counsel, when inquired of by the court, stated that he did not propose to show such authority,\u201d the judge excluded the evidence of Brown and Burbank. The jury returned a verdict for the petitioners for $850.49 ; and the respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-5\">The case was argued in October, 1876, and reargued in October, 1877.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number><em>T. L. Nelson, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ad\">It was decided in 1331, that one tenant in common of land, over which a highway is laid out, could not apply for a jury without the joinder of the other co-tenants, and that the assessment of damages must be joint, and could not be severed by the jury. <em>Merrill </em>v. Berkshire, 11 Pick. 269, 274. But, since the Revised Statutes, parties having different interests in land are not obliged to join, but may apply separately; and, when they do join, their damages may be assessed separately. Rev. Sts. <em>e. </em>24, \u00a7\u00a7 48-53. Gen. Sts. <em>o. </em>43, \u00a7\u00a7 53-58. <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>County </em>Commissioners, 7 Cush. 533. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals </em>v. <em>Nashua &amp; Lowell Railroad, </em>10 Cush. 385, 387. <em>Ashby </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>5 Met. 368, 372. The testimony of Brown and Burbank was therefore admissible as affecting the damages to be awarded to the two Brit-tons. Had this testimony been admitted, separate verdicts could have been rendered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b329-4\"><em>F. T.
