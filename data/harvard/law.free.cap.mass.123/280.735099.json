J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXX\">The legal effect of the testator\u2019s dispositions of his real estate is as follows : He first gives his parents an estate for life. He also gives them <em>\u201c </em>so much of the estate itself as may be necessary for their comfortable support so long as either of them shall live,\u201d thereby giving them a power to dispose of so much of the fee as may be necessary for that purpose; and, whether their determination upon such question of necessity is or is not conclusive, no trust is created in them or in the executor. <em>Minot </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>14 Mass. 496. <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Winship, </em>1 Pick. 318. <em>Larned </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>17 Pick. 339. <em>Harris </em>v. Knapp, 21 Pick. 412. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>100 Mass. 335. <em>Whitcomb </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>122 Mass. 243. The devise over, \u201c at the death of my parents,\u201d to a sister and a friend, is made contingent bv the words \u201c should either of them be living; \u201d and the residuary devise to other persons, \u201c after the above bequests have been taken out of the estate,\u201d is necessarily likewise contingent. <em>Holm </em>v. <em>Low, </em>4 Met. 190, 201. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Ludington, </em>104 Mass. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">As the will created no trust estate, expressly or by implication, the Probate Court had no jurisdiction to order a sale under the St. of 1869, c. 331, whether the remainder was vested or contingent, and its opinion upon that question was extrajudicial and of no binding effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The estate being, in our opinion, incumbered by a contingent remainder, and the justice of this court, before whom the hearing was had, having found it to be necessary and expedient that a sale and conveyance should be made, it is so ordered. St, 1868, <em>c. </em>287. <em>Symmes </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>120 Mass. 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">\n<em>Petition granted.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
