D. Vietts testified, for the plaintiffs, that he was their agent in selling liquors; that a few days before October 10, 1873, he saw the defendant at Holyoke, and the defendant told him that he had bought out a billiard-room, and was going to put his brothers in to run the place; that they would want some liqnors, and he wished some might be sent; that he then ordered certain liquors, being the goods in question, and directed them to he sent to him; that the brothers did in fact run the place, and appeared to do all the business of the saloon; that on October 10, 1873, he saw one of the defendant\u2019s brothers at Hartford, who told him that the defendant had given his brothers author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>ity to act as his agents in purchasing stock in the business, and asked him to hurry up the goods ordered previously by the defendant; that the brother also said he wished the witness would write to his principals in New York at once, for the goods; that the witness wrote at the brother\u2019s request. The letter was produced, and it contained an order for liquors, (which the witness testified were the same ordered by the defendant,) and named the defendant as the person to whom the liquors were to be sent. There was no evidence that the defendant or either of his brothers read the letter, or heard it read before it was sent, nor was there any evidence to show that the defendant or either of his brothers saw the letter after it was written, ex . cept that it was in the presence of the brother requesting it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-4\">The defendant objected to the admission of the letter, and of the conversation with the defendant\u2019s brother, but the letter and the testimony in regard to the conversation were admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-5\">Vietts also testified that on November 29, 1873, he visited the saloon in Holyoke, and saw the defendant\u2019s brothers, and asked for a settlement of the bill; that one of the brothers wrote a promissory note, for part of the amount due, payable in ten days, signed it \u201c Crafts Brothers,\u201d and handed it to the witness. For the purpose of showing fraud in the giving of the note, and to show that this note and another subsequently given did not constitute payment of the bill, Vietts was asked to state what was said when the first note was given, and, against the defendant\u2019s objection, was allowed to state that, on receiving the note, he asked why it was signed in that way, and was told by one of the brothers that the defendant was one of the firm of Crafts Brothers. Vietts also testified that attempts had been made to collect the note; that it had been put in a bank for collection and had been protested; and that on December 26,1873, another note, signed \u201c Crafts Brothers,\u201d was given for the amount of the first note and the balance of the bill, payable on demand. The defendant gave the plaintiffs notice to produce the notes at the trial, and they were produced and put into the case without objection. There was no evidence that either note had been returned to Crafts Brothers or to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b499-6\">It appeared that the defendant lived a mile and a. half from the saloon, and did not personally attend to it; and it was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ceded that he was not in fact a member of the firm of Crafts Brothers. The defendant also put in evidence tending to show that he never ordered the goods, never directed that they should be charged to him, never had them, and did not agree to pay for them; and that one of his brothers was the owner of the stock in trade at the saloon. He also denied giving authority to his brothers to purchase goods on his credit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b500-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the full amount of their bill; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b500-5\"><em>H.

The letter was not used as a substitute for an original order, or as a copy of an original entry or memorandum. It was not secondary evidence in any proper sense of that term. It was not offered for the purpose of proving that a contract had been made between these parties at some previous time, and entered in the order-book, but as independent evidence that the defendant, by the terms of the letter, ordered certain liquors to be furnished to him by the plaintiffs, which, in pursuance of that order, they did afterwards furnish. That is to say, it was offered as an original communication from him, or with his sanction and authority. If so, the fact that the substance of the same order had previously been entered in a book was entirely immaterial. \u2022 '</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The question then arises, was it his letter ; or, in other words, was there any evidence in the case which would justify the jury in finding that it was written on his behalf, and with his authority and consent. There was evidence that the defendant made a declaration to Vietts to the effect that he, the defendant, had \u201cbought out\u201d a billiard-room and \u201cwas going to put his brothers in; \u201d that they were to \u201c run the place; \u201d that they would want some liquors, and that he wished some might be sent. His brothers afterwards occupied the place, and appeared to do all the business of the saloon. The jury might have found upon this evidence that the two brothers were his agents, and that, when he said that he intended to put them in the saloon which he had bought and to have them \u201c run the place,\u201d he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>meant to be understood that it was his saloon, under their management and superintendence. There was oral evidence tending to show that these liquors had been bespoken by the defendant for the supply of that place. If the jury were satisfied that these brothers were agents of the defendant to procure such supplies, then the act of one of them, requesting Yietts to write to the plaintiffs at once for the liquors, was an act within the scope of his agency. The witness having testified that in compliance with the request he wrote the letter, and that the order contained in the letter was in accordance with the order previously given by the defendant in person, it was immaterial whether the brother of the defendant read the letter and knew its contents or not. Upon proof of the agency, the letter and the conversation which Yietts had with the defendant\u2019s brother at Hartford were admissible. It does not appear from the bill of exceptions what the instructions of the presiding judge upon this point were, but the excepting party fails to point out any particular in which they were erroneous, upon the general question of agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">The evidence as to the conversation and declarations of the defendant\u2019s brother, to the effect that the defendant was a member of the firm of Crafts Brothers, was offered, not to prove that he was in fact a member of that firm, but merely to show he was so represented to the plaintiff. This evidence was admissible to account for their acceptance of the notes, and to rebut the presumption that they were to be considered as a payment of the account. It was competent evidence to show that the plaintiffs acted under the influence of a misrepresentation, and did not intend, by accepting the notes, to release the defendant and substitute other persons in his place. If such were the case, the production and surrender of the notes at the trial would entitle the plaintiffs to claim upon the original account for goods sold and delivered, as if no such notes had been given. <em>French </em>v.
