On cross-examination Harrington said that the check for $198.37 had not the hand stamp on it, but had the indorsement of Worster &amp; Babson, and that had some effect on him, but he relied on his own judgment as to the signature to the check; that he did not compare it with any other signatures ; that he understood that the object of the introduction by the plaintiff was to identify Hall as the proper person to pay the money to, on Seaman <em>&amp; </em>Co.\u2019s checks; and that he was very familiar with the signature of Seaman <em>&amp; </em>Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b412-5\">Boyal B. Conant, the cashier of the defendant bank, testifica that the plaintiff brought Hall into the bank and introduced him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>to him; that he said, \u201c This is Mr. Hall, who will hereafter do my banking business; what he does will be all in order, correct, or right, or something to that effect.\u201d On cross-examination he stated that he understood that it was an introduction, merely an identification of the party; and that he did not understand, from what the plaintiff said, that Hall was authorized to sign hia name as Seaman &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-4\">The plaintiff introduced in evidence the report of an auditor in his favor, by which it appeared that Hall filled checks very often and numbered the check book when he filled such checks, and that the check book was lying about in the plaintiff\u2019s office during the day, and the hand stamp of the firm was accessible to any one in the office, the hand stamp being very seldom used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">The plaintiff contended that, it being conceded that the signatures on the checks were forged, there was nothing in the evidence to exonerate the defendant from liability. The judge so ruled, directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and, by consent of parties, reported the case for the consideration of this court.- If the rulings were correct, judgment was to be entered upon the verdict. If the rulings, or either of them, were incorrect, the verdict was to be set aside, and the case to be returned for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b413-6\"><em>F.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Hh\">The defendant bank must bear the loss of the amounts which it paid upon the forged checks. There was no evidence tending to show that the plaintiff\u2019s clerk had, or was understood by the defendant\u2019s officers to have, any authority to sign his name.' The plaintiff cannot be held bound by hia clerk\u2019s unauthorized and criminal acts, upon any ground that would not make every merchant who keeps on his desk in his counting-room for his own. use a check book containing blank arms stamped or engraved with his name, and who sometimes directs his clerk to fill them up for himself to sign, responsible for any number and amount of such checks to which the clerk may forge the signature of his employer. The cases cited in argument have been so fully considered in the recent case of <em>Greenfield Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Stowell, ante, </em>196, that there is no occasion to discuss them again. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
