Rigby, having his warrant, entered that part of the building occupied by Conners, and was proceeding to enter a certain closet or apartment, which opened by a door into Conners\u2019s tenement, and also by another door into the defendant\u2019s tenement, when his entry was opposed by the defendant, and the alleged assault committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">The defendant offered evidence tending to show that the closet or apartment was in his exclusive occupation and control, and that Conners had no interest or rights therein, or access thereto, or intoxicating liquors or other property therein; but the judge refused to admit the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury that Rigby, under his warrant, had no authority to enter the premises of the defendant and remove any property of his, and that the defendant had a right to use all necessary and reasonable force, under the circumstances, to prevent him from so doing. The judge refused so to rule, and instructed the jury that the warrant, under which Rigby acted, was sufficient to authorize him to enter the closet for search, if he believed the closet was in the occupation of Conners ; that he was not bound under this warrant to decide correctly at his peril the actual fact of occupancy ; and that the defendant had no right to oppose him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty ; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-8\"><em>J. B. </em>Goodrich, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b439-9\"><em>C. B. </em>Train, Attorney General, for the Commonwealth, submitted the case without argument.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Morton, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOZZ\">The search-warrant in this case authorized the officer to enter and search the house occupied by Michael Con ners. It did not justify him in entering the tenement occupied by the defendant. If, therefore, the closet, which the officer insisted upon searching, was in fact a part of the defendant\u2019s tenement, and was not used by Conners as a place of keeping intoxicating liquors, the officer had no right to enter it, and the defendant had the right to resist his entry, using reasonable force. The fact that the officer believed that the closet was in the occupation of Conners cannot affect the rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The case differs from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Leddy, 105 Mass. 381, because in that case the apartment searched by the officer was occupied by Galligan, the person charged in the complaint and warrant, for the illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors, by the consent of the defendant. This apartment, therefore, was a part of the tenement occupied by Galligan, and the search-warrant included it. <em>Exceptions sustained</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
