In the Superior Court, on appeal, before the jury were empanelled, the defendant filed a plea in bar, alleging that the complaint was received, heard and tried before Alanson Borden, esquire, who at the time of said trial was then and there mayor of the city of New Bedford, and was then and there the judge of the Third District Court of Bristol; and that, by the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth and the ordinances of the city of New Bedford, Borden was not a proper person as judge to hear and determine the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-10\">l'he district attorney demurred to the plea, and the demurrer was sustained, and the plea adjudged.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxG\">The competency of the magistrate, before whom this prosecution was commenced, is not objected to on account of any disqualification by reason of personal interest in the pause, as in <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Welcome, </em>6 Cush. 331, but upon the ground that, holding the executive office of mayor of the city of New Bedford, he could not at the same time exercise judicial power as a judge within the same territory. As, upon the allegations of the plea, he was at least a judge <em>defacto, </em>his jurisdiction could not be controverted upon this ground, nor the question whether the two offices were incompatible be tried, in a proceeding to which he was not a party. <em>Milward </em>v. <em>Thatcher, 2 </em>T.
