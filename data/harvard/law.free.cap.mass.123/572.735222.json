Peirce <em>vs. </em>Cohasset Mutual Fire Insurance Company.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b590-5\">Suffolk.</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"ApI\">Nov. 13, 1877.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADS\">Jan. 31, 1878.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"ASC\">Colt &amp; Ames, JJ., absent.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b590-6\">A policy of insurance described the building insured as a \u201c frame dwelling-house,\u201d and provided that the policy should be void if the assured should appropriate the building tc other uses than those mentioned in the policy. In an action on the policy, the answer alleged that the plaintiff used and occupied the building at the time he procured the policy and afterward as a boarding-house and hotel. <em>Held, </em>that evidence of such change in occupation subsequent to the date of the policy was not admissible under the answer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-7\">Contract upon a policy of insurance against fire, issued by the defendant to the plaintiff \u201con his frame dwelling-house.\u201d The policy contained the following clause : \u201c When the assured shall alter or enlarge a building, or appropriate it to other purposes than those mentioned in the policy, so as to increase the risk, without first obtaining the consent of the directors, and paying such premium as they may require, the said policy shall thereupon be void.\u201d The pleadings appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-8\">At the tidal in the Superior Court, before <em>Crardner, </em>J., the plaintiff put in evidence the policy of insurance. The defendant, conceding the facts necessary to make a <em>primd facie </em>case, offered to show in defence that the building described in the policy as a \u201c dwelling-house \u201d was, after the date of the policy, occupied as a hotel without the defendant\u2019s consent; that the terms \u201c dwelling-house \u201d and \u201c hotel \u201d are well known terms of insurance, and that the risks and premiums on the latter are far greater than on the former. The plaintiff contended that this evidence was not admissible under the answer. The judge so ruled, directed a verdict for the plaintiff, and reported the case for the determination of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-9\">If the ruling was correct, judgment was to be entered on the verdict; otherwise, a new trial was to be ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-10\"><em>H. D. Hyde, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b590-11\"><em>A. A. Jdanney, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b590-12\">Endicott, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALs\">The policy insures the frame dwelling-house of the plaintiff, and contains no other description of the building. The declaration states that it was totally destroyed by fire while the policy was in force, and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum named in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The answer is not clear and precise in its terms, but it in substance alleges that the plaintiff agreed and warranted in the policy, that the building was and should be occupied as a dwelling-house, and for no other purpose, and that, disregarding the agreements and warranties of the policy, the plaintiff used and occupied the building, at the time he procured the policy and afterward, as a boarding-house and hotel, and the policy was thereby rendered void. No change in the occupation is alleged. The policy contains no express warranty or agreement in relation to the occupation of the building when the policy issued, and whether the defendant has a defence on this ground it is unnecessary to consider, as no evidence was offered in support of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">The evidence offered was that the building, after the date of the policy, was occupied as a hotel without the consent of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The only ground upon which the defendant contends that that evidence was competent, is under the fourth condition of the policy, which provides that \u201c when the insured shall alter or enlarge a building, or appropriate it to other uses than those mentioned in the policy, so as to increase the risk, without first obtaining the consent of the directors, and paying such premium as they may require, the policy shall be void.\u201d But evidence of a change in occupation subsequent to the policy is a different defence from that set up in the answer, and, if relied on, should have been pleaded. See <em>Hawes </em>v. Ryder, 100 Mass. 216. The answer gave no notice that a change in occupation under the fourth condition of the policy would be set up; on the contrary, it implies there had been no change, when it alleges that the occupation at the time the policy issued and after was of such a character as to render the policy void. The evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">It is therefore unnecessary to consider the other questions argued at the bar. <em>Judgment on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
