Bigelow died on December 24,1872, and notice and proof of his death were duly given to the defendant. No question is made but that the plaintiff is the proper party to sue. When the policy was delivered to Moses E. Bigelow, the defendant delivered to him the following receipt, signed by the secretary and countersigned by the agent: \u201c State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester, Worcester, Mass., March 1,1870. $539.70. Received of M. E. Bigelow five hundred and thirty-nine dollars, amount annual premium on his policy of life insurance, No. 7168, due March 1, 1870.\u201d And Bigelow then and there signed and gave to the defendant the following memorandum : \u201c State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester, Boston, Mass., March 1, 1870. $270.00. In consideration that the State Mutual Life Assurance Company of Worcester defer the payment of two hundred and seventy dollars, being one half the premium on policy No. 7168, for the term of six months, I hereby promise and agree to pay said sum, with interest at the rate of seven per cent., at the expiration of said term; and it is expressly understood and agreed that this arrangement is made upon the express condition that if the above named premium and interest shall not be paid at the time specified, then said assurance shall cease and the policy become void.\u201d At the same time Bigelow paid to the defendant in cash the remainder of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>first annual premium stated in the policy to have been paid at the delivery of the policy. Neither Bigelow, nor any person for him, ever made any further payment for or on account of the policy, either as first premium or otherwise. At the- maturity of the note, the defendant sent a notice by mail to Moses E. Bigelow, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, demanding payment thereof, and also carried the note to the last place of business of the assured within this Commonwealth for the purpose of presenting it tc him for <em>payment; </em>but he had before that time left the Commonwealth and gone to reside elsewhere in parts unknown, and had no agent in Massachusetts, and never returned or had any other place of business in this state.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-4\">If the policy became wholly forfeited, then, whether it was forfeited at the maturity of the note by reason of its non-payment, or at the date when the second annual premium became payable, its net value would not be sufficient to continue it in force under the St. of 1861, <em>c. </em>186, \u00a7 1, until the death of the assured, if the amount of the note is to be deducted from said net value. But if the amount of the note is not to be deducted, then the net value was sufficient to keep the policy in force under said statute until the date of the decease of said assured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">Nor would the net value be sufficient to keep the policy in force until the death of the assured, if the net value is to be computed upon the cash payment alone, neither including the amount of the note in the same, nor deducting it therefrom ; that is to say, the cash payment alone, if no note had been given, would have been insufficient to keep the policy in force until the death of the assured. But if the note is to be treated as equivalent to cash, and not to be deducted from said net value, then the entire amount of both cash and note would suffice to maintain the existence of the policy until after the death of the assured:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-6\">If on these facts the plaintiff could recover, judgment was to be entered for her, the amount to be determined by an assessor; otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-7\">The case was argued in March, 1876, and in May following judgment was ordered for the plaintiff. The defendant thereupon moved for a rehearing, which was granted, and the case reargued in writing in September, <em>1876.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>G. <em>A.

Co. </em>100 Mass. 500, and that that case must govern this. As it is not likely that another case will arise, presenting such a complicated, and in some respects inconsistent, series of contracts, it would serve no useful purpose to discuss it in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
