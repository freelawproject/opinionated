There was no evidence that the defendant\u2019s wall was dangerous or could have fallen while both buildings stood, or while both walls remained in the condition in which they were left by the fire, or that the defendant had notice, or was bound to know, that the wall on the adjoining estate had been or was about to he removed. <em>Held, </em>that the action could not be maintained.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">Tort for personal injuries sustained by the plaintiff by the falling of a wall upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\">At the trial in this court, before <em>Lord, </em>J., the plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that the estate upon which the wall All, and the estate upon which it had stood, were situate on Federal Street, adjoining each other; that the buildings on them had been burned in the great fire of November 9, 1872, which swept over both sides of Federal Street; that the fire left the walls between these estates, running from front to rear, about on a level with the street, being a few feet higher at the front and rear ends than in the middle, and being from eight to fourteen feet in height from the cellar floor of the estate on which the wall fell; that the cellars on both estates were filled with rubbish, coming up against the walls to the tops thereof; that in May, 1873, the estate adjoining the defendant\u2019s estate was purchased by James Tucker &amp; Co., and one McCarthy agreed to take down the remaining walls on the estate, clean the bricks, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and remove the useless rubbish within a given time, and the plaintiff testified that he and three others agreed with McCarthy to clean all the bricks, and, in doing so, occupied different places on the cellar floor, which was of plank, near the bricks to be cleaned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\">McCarthy testified that when he commenced work, under his contract, on the Tucker wall, both the cellars were full of rubbish up to the tops of both walls; that he supposed there was but one wall between the estates, as the upper courses of brick were loose and covered with rubbish, and there were large quantities of brick and rubbish on both estates \u00bf that upon removing all the loose brick, which consisted of one or two courses, he found two entirely separate and distinct walls, one or more inches apart, the wall standing on the defendant\u2019s estate being eight inches, and that on the Tucker estate twelve inches thick; that he then proceeded to take down the Tucker wall carefully by courses, in such a way as to prevent injury to the brick, which were to be used again, and that in doing this he applied no force whatever to the defendants\u2019 wall; that he was at work in taking down this wall parts of several days; that he worked on this wall the day preceding the accident; and that before or about noon of that day he had taken down all of it except a few courses in the rear, and that this was all the work done on the wall before the accident; that before the accident all the rubbish had been removed from the Tucker side of the defendants\u2019 wall, and no brick of any consequence remained on that side, and the Tucker wall had been taken down as low as the cellar floor; that on the morning of the accident he was standing near the defendants\u2019 wall, within twenty minutes of its fall, when he was called off, and went into the street, where he saw the wall as it fell; that it went over suddenly, like a board fene\u00e9, burying and causing the death of two of the men, and partially burying the plaintiff; that he shouted to the men when he first saw the wall start, but they had not time tp get clear; that while at work on the Tucker wall, and down to the time of the fall of the defendants\u2019 wall, he saw no indications that the latter wall was not safe, and saw no cracks in it; that it appeared straight, and although he knew that the rubbish in the cellar on the defendants\u2019 estate came up to a level with this wall, he supposed it had settled before that time to its bearings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The plaintiff testified, that he and the other men with him, engaged in cleaning the brick, commenced work about seven o\u2019clock on the morning of the accident, and that they were seated on the cellar floor of the Tucker estate, within a few feet of the wall on the defendants\u2019 estate, at work cleaning the brick which had been taken from the Tucker wall; that he saw nothing in the defendants\u2019 wall to indicate that it was not safe, and that he had no suspicions that it was not so; that he knew that there was rubbish back of this wall, reaching to the top; that he heard the shout and started, but that the wall caught him before he could get clear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that nothing had been done to either estate, but that they had remained as they were left by the fire, until and except what was done on the Tucker estate under the McCarthy contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">This was all the evidence offered by the plaintiff, except such as related to the nature and extent of his injuries. The judge was of opinion that this evidence was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to maintain his action, and directed a verdict for the defendants, and reported the case for the determination of the full court upon the question whether the plaintiff could maintain his action. If the plaintiff could maintain his action upon the foregoing evidence, the verdict was to be set aside and a new trial ordered; otherwise, judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b40-6\"><em>B.

Marsland, L. R. 10 Ex. 255, and 2 Ex. D. 1. <em>Gray </em>v.
