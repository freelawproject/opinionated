Writ dated April 28, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-8\">At the trial in this court, before <em>JEndioott, </em>J., there was evidence tending to show that the road in question was twenty-six or twenty-seven feet wide between its edge on the east side and a ditch on its west side, and about the same width for some distance to the north and south; that it was even, smooth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>hard, and worked for travel the whole width; that there was a narrow footpath about a foot wide on each side; that the easterly side of the road was more or less grassy; that the travel was on the westerly side of the road, and that this travelled part was from sixteen to seventeen feet in width only, although the entire road was safe for travel; that westerly of the roadway, and between it and the wall, was a ditch, ten and a half feet wide and two and a half feet deep, containing some six inches of mud and water; that there were two culverts under the road, the southerly one of which was filled up and disused, and that the accident happened a few feet north of this southerly culvert; that near the northerly culvert a grassy bank sloped down gradually to the ditch, and became somewhat more abrupt a little further south, but still preserved its slope until, at the place of the accident, it suddenly retreated, and became perpendicular ; that there was no railing along the bank at any point, and no posts, except two ancient posts that stood immediately against the northerly culvert.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-4\">There was also evidence tending to show that the plaintiff was a pedler, and had been accustomed to drive horses for many years, and that he was driving on the highway in a southerly direction, between four and five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, with two horses attached to a loaded pedler\u2019s wagon, which weighed, together with the plaintiff and his wife, who was with him, about three thousand pounds ; that about a mile from the place of the accident the plaintiff\u2019s nigh horse became frightened and ran about three quarters of a mile; that the plaintiff stopped the wagon, and kept it stationary for a minute, and then started at a gait not exceeding three miles an hour; that the nigh horse Was hopping up and down in a sort of short canter, and the plaintiff drove him so as to make him draw the load; that the off horse was walking, and that the horses continued to proceed in this manner, under the guidance and control of the plaintiff, until the accident occurred; that, after stopping as before stated and starting again, the plaintiff met two wagons at different points, and turned out to the right for each, and turned back again into the road; that he then met a market wagon a few rods from the place of the accident, and turned out to the right for that, and went near the edge of the travelled road, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>outside of it; that he then saw a large two-horse logging wagon coming towards him in the centre of the road, and behind it a one-horse buggy, with two ladies, and so he kept on in the same course, and did not turn back into the roiid again; that the logging wagon turned out so that there were about four feet between it and the plaintiff\u2019s wagon; that as the logging wagon passed, its driver threw up his hands; that the plaintiff\u2019s wife, who was sitting at his left, said, \u201cWe \u2019ll be off the bank; \u201d that the plaintiff looked and saw that it was not dangerous in his opinion, and said, \u201cMo, I guess not,\u201d and looked back to see what the man in the logging wagon was doing, but he had passed beyond the line of the front of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon, so that the plaintiff could not see him, although he could see the back part of the logging wagon; that the plaintiff\u2019s off horse then pressed into the road, and attracted the plaintiff\u2019s attention, but did not turn the wagon, which the nigh horse was drawing; that the plaintiff then looked and saw that there was a place in the bank right ahead of him, within three or four feet of his forward wheel, which was perpendicular ; that he immediately looked to see if there was a chance to turn into the road and pass along; that he then saw the buggy with the ladies in it coming up on the side of the road where the plaintiff was, about twelve or fourteen feet, or two thirds the length of the plaintiff\u2019s team, behind the logging wagon, with its off wheels about in line with the centre of the plaintiff\u2019s wagon; that the buggy had turned to the right, so as to be at an angle with the road, and had nearly stopped, the horse walking and being abreast of the plaintiff\u2019s horses, and the buggy was in such a position that, if the plaintiff had turned his horses to the left, he would have brought his nigh horse\u2019s head over the off forward wheel, and driven the pole of his wagon into the body of the buggy; and that, if he had stopped, the weight of his wagon would have sent its off wheels down the perpendicular bank, on the edge of which he now was, and caused the wagon to go over sideways.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\">The plaintiff testified as follows: \u201c There my team stood. I could not go ahead, because there was no room. I could not stop, because my team was on the bank; my wheels were on the edge of the bank. I could not turn into the road, because there was a team there right in the way. I saw the only chance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>escape from it for myself and my wife was to turn square off. J drew the reins to turn square off, and my horses went down that bank, and hardly stumbled, and did not go off their feet at all, went to the wall some ten feet and a half, and there was not room enough; so when they got to the wall, my load was pressing on to them, and I had to turn them down straight. When I turned their faces down the street, the bank was so abrupt, so deep, the wagon went over with a crash. I saw the wagon was going over, and I sung out \u2018 Whoa,\u2019 and drew in the reins, and my team stopped as suddenly as a team could stop, and they stood there.\u201d The plaintiff also testified that he received severe injuries from the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-4\">On the above evidence the judge directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant; and reported the case to the full court for the determination of the questions of law arising thereon. If the ruling was wrong, the case was to stand for trial; otherwise, judgment to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\">Annexed to the report, and made a part of it, was a plan of the locality of the accident, from which it appeared that the two culverts were fifty-six feet apart, that the slope of the bank, forty feet from the southerly culvert, was one foot and eleven inches from the top to the ditch, and that the perpendicular descent at the southerly culvert was two feet and eight inches.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-6\">.P. <em>E. </em>Tucker, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-7\"><em>Gr. 0.

The highway upon which he and his wife were travelling was without railing, but was constructed twenty-six or twenty-seven feet wide for the use of carriage travel, and was for this entire distance even, smooth and hard. The plaintiff having, as he testifies, the guidance and control of his horses, and having been warned by his wife that he was in danger of going off the bank, drove in the daylight so, near the edge of this road, that in order to prevent going over sideways, as he says, he turned his horses square off the bank, and received the injury complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">For this voluntary act of the plaintiff, the evidence discloses no sufficient excuse. There is nothing in the circumstances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the case which would justify a jury in finding that it was an act of ordinary care and prudence, which, without his fault, had become necessary to protect himself or his horses and wagon from greater danger. There is no reason shown for driving with horses, of which the plaintiff had control, so near the edge of the road. He claims that, being in that position, he found himself so near the bank that he could not stop without going off, and that two alternatives were presented to Mm, either to run into an approaching wagon, or to turn off as he did. But his position so near the bank was through his own want of due care, for which no excuse is shown, and being there he must choose either alternative at his own risk. A party cannot relieve himself from a dangerous position into which his own fault has brought him and hold the town responsible for the result. <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Maine </em>Railroad, 104 Mass. 137. <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Old Colony &amp; Newport </em>Railway, 100 Mass. 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">It is not necessary to consider whether the want of a railing constituted a defect, or whether this accident would have been prevented if a suitable railing had been erected at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
