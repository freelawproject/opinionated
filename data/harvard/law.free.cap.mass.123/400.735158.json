These proceedings on his part were competent evidence against him. In most criminal cases a portion of the evidence consists of the conduct and deportment of the accused party at and after the time of the charge. Thus flight, concealment, the use of falsehoods or evasions, are all matters which the jury have a right to look upon as unfavorable and suspicious. Roscoe Grim. Ev. (7th Am. ed.) 18. The evidence admitted was all of it competent and material. Its weight and effect were for the jury to estimate, and \u00b0we cannot say that it was not sufficient to justify their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
