The certificate of the judge upon the bill of exceptions was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b597-7\">\u201c The foregoing bill of exceptions has been examined and found conformable to the truth, and I allow the same, subject to the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court upon the question of law arising upon these facts: The verdict was rendered April 4, and the time for filing and presentment of these exceptions was extended by the court to April 12. Before the said time expired the exceptions were duly filed with the clerk. The last day of said extended time was the day of the annual Fast. The presentment to the court, that is, to the undersigned, the presiding justice thereof, was not made until the day thereafter, and on this ground the plaintiff objected to the allowance thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b597-8\"><em>S.

The plaintiff, having taken the objection before the allowance of the exceptions, has the right to insist that they were not presented to tne judge, as well as filed with the clerk, within the time limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>by the judge\u2019s order.
