The judge declined so to rule, but instructed the jury that, it being conceded that the defendants executed the lease, they were liable to pay the rent to the end of the term, and that the assignment and conveyance by Townsley to the plaintiffs would enable them to maintain the action ; and directed the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs.
