This the judge declined to do, and instructed the jury that it was a question for them, whether the conduct and silence of Malone was an admission of the truth of the answer of McDermott; and, if so, it was evidence for them to consider, giving it such weight as they thought it deserved ; otherwise, it was to be rejected in considering the case of Malone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-10\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty against both defendants and the defendant Malone alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-11\">&lt;7. <em>J.
