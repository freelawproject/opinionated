Be it known that Freeman &amp; Vinton, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk and State of Mass., are appointed, and by these presents duly constituted, local agents of the Home Insurance Company, of Columbus, Ohio, with full power to receive proposals for insurance against loss and damage by fire and lightning, to receive moneys for the same, and countersign, issue, renew and consent to .transfers of policies of insurance signed by the president and secretary of the said Home Insurance Company, and to make indorsements thereon, subject to the rules and regulations of said company and to such instructions as may from time to time be given by its officers.

D. 1873.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-6\">Win ward testified that he had been in the business nine years; that said local agents agreed to place at once $1000 in the defendant company and bind it, and that the agents forthwith entered in a book, which was called a binding-book, a memorandum of what was done; that the \u201c form \u201d of the policy was to be the same as in the Equitable Company, at the rate of five per cent.; that the agents had carried a policy on the same property in the Equitable Office for months; that no policy was to issue until one Balloch, the special agent having supervision of the defendant\u2019s business in New England, had seen the property and approved of the agents\u2019 writing a policy; that he talked with Freeman, who said that he would bind it in the de\u00ab <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>fendant company; and that such an agreement takes effect the moment it is made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-4\">The defendant\u2019s agents, called by the plaintiff, testified to the application in substantially the same terms <em>f </em>that the application was accepted, and they supposed the risk was bound in the defendant company; and that a policy was not to issue until approved by Balloch, upon his inspection of the property; and that there was a general usage among insurance companies and their agents to bind the companies by oral agreements until the policies could be conveniently issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-5\">Freeman testified that he had been the defendant\u2019s agent since 1869 or 1870; that he had previously insured this property in the Equitable Company, and was carrying a policy in that company at the time of the fire ; that he had examined the property and was acquainted with the risk; that he was not limited to any particular risks; that application was made to him by Winward for this insurance; that he accepted it and made the memorandum in the binding-book; that there was a usage among insurance men that when so entered it was binding ; and that he accepted it to hold till inspected by Balloch, the rate to be five per cent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-6\">It also appeared that Balloch returned the day before the property was destroyed by fire, but did not inspect the property or approve the policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-7\">The book was produced in evidence, and contained the following memorandum:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b344-8\">\u201c No. 447.

The judge declined so to rule, and submitted the case upon instructions, among others not excepted to, which allowed the jury to pass upon the authority of the agents to bind the defendant, and upon the execution of the contract, as questions of fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b345-7\"><em>A. </em>Muss, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKvM\">The plaintiff produced and relied upon a written authority given by the defendant, containing in printed terms the limit of authority granted by the company to the agents with whom the plaintiff alleges the oral contract was made. The familiar principle of law, that a plaintiff, in such case, may rely upon an apparent authority beyond the limits of that expressly granted, to be inferred from acts or usage, cannot apply in a case like this, where the plaintiff produces and relies upon an express authority in writing, the terms of which are in no sense ambiguous. <em>Murdock </em>v. Mills, 11 Met. 5. <em>Bryant </em>v. Moore, 26 Maine, 84, 87. <em>Towle </em>v. Leavitt, 3 Foster, 360. 374. <em>Delafield </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>26 Wend. 192. The authority granted is to receive proposals, sign, issue, renew and consent to transfers o\u00ed policies signed by the president and secretary, and to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>indorsements; and this authority was subject to rules and regu lotions of the company and to instructions of its officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-4\">An agent with a limited authority cannot exceed it, and, if he does, his principal will not be bound by his acts, unless he affirms them afterwards. <em>Fenn </em>v. Harrison, 3 T. R. 757. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>9 Pick. 539, 542. <em>Schimmelpennich </em>v. Bayard, 1 Pet. 264, 290. <em>Attwood </em>v. <em>Mannings, </em>7 B. &amp; C. 278.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence expressly shows that the authority upon which he relied could not be enlarged by any rule, regulation or instruction unknown to him beyond the subject matter of signing, issuing, renewing, transferring and indorsing actual policies signed by the president and secretary. The party dealing with an agent, whose authority is limited, is bound to inquire and ascertain the extent of that authority. <em>Snow </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>9 Pick. 539, 542. <em>Lobdell </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>1 Met. 193, 201. <em>Dresser Manuf. Co. </em>v. <em>Waterston, </em>3 Met. 9, 18. <em>Salem Bank </em>v. <em>Gloucester Bank, </em>17 Mass. 1, 29. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Mechanics' Ins. Co. </em>6 Gray, 169, 173. <em>Banorgee </em>v. <em>Hovey, </em>5 Mass. 11, 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-6\">That the agency was one of special and limited authority, and so known to the plaintiff, appears from the existence of a supervising intervening agent whose approval was to be obtained before the contemplated policy was to be issued. The case finds, that the risk was specially hazardous, and the authority which the agent undertook to exercise was anomalous and extraordinary, <em>a fortiori, </em>the plaintiff was bound to see that such authority existed. Wharton on Agency, \u00a7 139.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b346-7\">There is no fact found, and no evidence offered, from which the plaintiff had a right to infer the existence of an authority to make this contract. It was not within the enumerated powers of his agency. It was an anomalous, extrahazardous risk. The usual evidence of a contract; viz., a policy, was not to issue without the approval of a superior agent. These agents had never before undertaken to make such a contract as this.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b346-8\"><em>P. W. Hurd f H. P. Nettleton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b346-9\">Ames, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ABOo\">No attempt has been made, in the argument for the defendant, to maintain the position that its local agents did not make substantially the contract which the plaintiff alleges that they did make. The evidence reported certainly tends to show that there was an agreement to insure the building, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>was intended to be binding upon the company from the moment of the entry upon \u201c the binding-book; \u201d and to continue in force at all events until the premises should be inspected by the special agent, Balloch.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The only question remaining to be considered is whether there was any evidence of authority on the part of the local agents to make the contract. It was conceded that they had authority to receive applications for insurance, and that they were entrusted with blank policies signed by the president and secretary of the company which they were accustomed to fill out and deliver without consultation with the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">There was evidence to the effect that, with the knowledge and consent of the defendant\u2019s officers, they had frequently issued policies upon property of the same class as this risk, without submitting the same for the previous approval of any of those officers. The tendency of this evidence was to show that they acted, and made contracts of insurance, as general agents of the defendants, and were allowed so to do. The fact that the delivery of the policy was delayed until the special agent should have an opportunity to inspect the building is explained by the fact that the risk was considered specially <em>hazardous; </em>and that the local agents left to the corporation the right of terminating the risk if the special agent should decide not to accept it. It would not follow that in the meantime the plaintiff was \u2022 to stand uninsured. There is evidence that he considered himself, and was understood by the local agents, to be so <em>insured; </em>that the amount and the rate of premium were agreed upon; and that there was a usage among insurance companies and their agents to bind the company by preliminary oral agreements until policies could conveniently be issued. See <em>Baxter </em>v. <em>Massasoit Ins. Co. </em>13 Allen, 320. It is well settled that an oral v ontract of insurance is binding, and that there is no rule of law requiring it to be in writing. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Fireman's Ins. Co. </em>16 Gray, 448. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff might have a right to rely upon the oral agreement, and foi that reason might have failed to seek insurance elsewhere. The case finds that the instructions to the jury upon the general rules of law as to agency were not excepted to, and the jury may have found that the contract was within the apparent scope of the. agent\u2019s employment. <em>jExceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
