Bushnell, both of Worcester, in said county, of the second part, witnesseth, that the said John G. Avery and Ira R. Kent are the owners of certain machinery, tools and fixtures situate in the shop of J. S. Wheeler and Company, No. 25 Hermon Street in said Worcester, and upon the basement floor therein, which are specifically enumerated in the schedule hereto annexed marked \u2018A,\u2019 of the value of thirty-seven hundred dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201c Said Avery and Kent have an exclusive license to manufacture the 6 Kent and Bancroft Self Operator,\u2019 (a machine patented under the laws of the United States,) for the term of five years from July 26th, A. D. 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">\u201c The machinery and fixtures enumerated in said schedule are hereby sold and delivered to said William F.

Bushnell at said value, with permission to remove the same to the shop of the Water Meter Company, No. 31 on said Hermon Street, and said Bancroft and Bushnell are to pay for the same in the manner hereinafter provided; and in consideration hereof it is agreed that said Bancroft and Bushnell shall build all the machines that shall be made for said party of the first part, or for any other person under said letters patent, until July 25th, A. D. 1875, provided they will or can fill all orders given by the parties of the first part within sixty days from the date of receiving the order, or until the indebtedness of the party of the second part to the party of the first part is cancelled, said machines are to be completed in good and workmanlike manner, boxed for shipping, and delivered at depot within a reasonable time after receiving the order.

F. Soar $ T. L. </em>Nelson, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b370-7\"><em>W. S' B. Sopldns, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b370-8\">Colt, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arx\">The mortgage of personal property under which the plaintiff claims title, with the note secured thereby, and the contract therein referred to, between the parties to the mortgage, were executed at the same time and are to be construed together as constituting one transaction. So construed, we have no question that they created a debt to the plaintiff, secured by the mortgage, for the payment of which he is entitled to the possession of the property therein described.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">It appears that there was a sale of machinery for a price agreed, and a delivery of .the same to the purchasers, who gave an agreement for the payment of the price, in the form of a note secured by a mortgage back on the same property. The note refers to the contract, which is also made part of it. But the contract is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>simply an agreement as to the method in which the debt may be paid other than in cash, namely, by certain allowances to the promisors for work which might be done for the promisees upon orders furnished by them for the manufacture of certain patented machines. But there is no agreement that the latter shall furnish orders for machines, the demand for which must have been limited at least, and would entirely fail with the life of the patent. There was a possibility that those allowances would not be sufficient to pay the debt. And the right to anticipate payment in cash was expressly reserved. It is clear that the mortgagors, when they made the arrangement, took the risk of not being able to pay the whole, in the method which the mortgagees agreed to accept, and, failing in that, the balance, in the absence of anything in the agreement fixing -the time, becomes due, if not on demand, at least after lapse of a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
