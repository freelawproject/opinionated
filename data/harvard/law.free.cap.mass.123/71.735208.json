This evidence was objected to as immaterial; but by agreement of counsel it was admitted <em>de </em>lene, and the judge reserved the matters of law arising thereon for the determination of this court. It was not admitted as bearing upon any of the questions submitted to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-4\">It also appeared, and was uncontested, that a petition in bankruptcy was filed against Jackson on May 28, 1875, and that he was duly adjudicated a bankrupt thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\">The plaintiff proved that prior to February, 1875, and on March 18, 1873, Jackson made an assignment of the plaintiff\u2019s mortgage to the Franklin Insurance Company, and therewith a note, a copy of which is annexed to the declaration; that this assignment was not upon the original mortgage deed, but was a separate instrument, and that said assignment was not recorded until April 23, 1875; that, in the spring of 1875, hearing that Jackson had committed forgeries, the plaintiff desired to know what had become of his mortgage note ; that he thereupon went to the registry of deeds at Cambridge, and got the register to look at the records, and was told by him that the mortgage had been assigned to William H. Goodwin; and he testified that nothing was said to him by the register about the word \u201c trustee ; \u201d that he thereupon called upon the defendant at the bank, and had several interviews at the bank with him, which resulted on July 8,1875, which was more than seven months before his note became due,- in his paying to Goodwin the sum of $2053, being the amount of his mortgage note, and the interest due thereon and unpaid ; that the paper purporting to be his mortgage note, being the one received from Jackson by the bank, was thereupon surrendered up to him, and that thereupon a friend who was with him, and in his presence and in the presence of the president and cashier of the bank, scratched with pen and ink the name \u201c Thomas J. Welch \u201d signed to the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that he directly went with the defendant to the registry of deeds, where the defendant, by a deed as trustee, released to him the mortgage made to Jackson, and that the release was thereupon immediately recorded at the said registry; that he thereafter, and on the same day, in conversation with friends and at their suggestion, tore the name of \u201c Thomas J. Welch\u201d off from the note, and destroyed that portion of the paper upon which it was written; that about July 26, 1875, he was led to suspect that the Franklin Insurance Company held a note purporting to be his mortgage note, and an assignment of the mortgage ; that he called at the office of the company, and was there shown a note passed by Jackson to that company, which he then and there recognized to be the genuine mortgage note, and was also shown an assignment of the mortgage; that he never made but one note in his life; that he immediately consulted counsel, who, on July 28, 1875, gave to the defendant the notice, a copy of which is printed in the margin ; <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that, at the time he paid the $2058, he supposed and understood the note he then took up to be his genuine note, and always so supposed until he saw the note held by the Franklin Insurance Company; that the defendant never notified him that he was acting in the transaction other than personally, and that he did not know that it was a bank transaction ; and that, after his first call upon the defendant, he received two letters, which he had since lost, requesting him to call again ; that he could not swear certainly, but was very positive that these letters were signed in the defendant\u2019s name, and that there was .nothing contained therein indicative of the matter being an affair of the bank. A witness called by the plaintiff, who came with him to the bank when the money was paid, testified that it was paid into the defendant\u2019s hands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>The defendant introduced evidence that the $2053 was paid by the plaintiff into the hands of the cashier of the bank, and not into his hands; that the defendant never wrote to the plaintiff, but that the two letters received by the plaintiff were written upon paper upon the top of which was printed \u201c Eliot National Bank. W. H. Goodwin, president; B. B. Conant, cashier; \u201d and that both letters were written by the cashier, signed by him in his name, with the word \u201c cashier \u201d added, and that they referred to the matter as an affair of the bank, and stated that the bank held the assignment. The defendant proved that the money paid by the plaintiff was immediately credited to Jackson\u2019s account on the books of the bank, and was immediately placed with the other funds of the bank; that the note paid by the plaintiff was always kept by the bank together with its other securities, and was in charge of the cashier; that when the plaintiff paid the money, the defendant had no knowledge or suspicion of this note being a forgery, and no knowledge or suspicion of the existence of another note or of another assignment of the mortgage, and never had any knowledge or suspicion of either of these things. The defendant also testified that he did not recollect distinctly, but thought that at one of the interviews with the plaintiff, before the money was paid him, he exhibited to him the assignment from Jackson to himself as \u201c trustee,\u201d which, however, the plaintiff denied, and said that he did not suppose that he had personally anything to do with the matter, but considered it a bank transaction, and that in all that he did he was acting in his capacity as president of the bank; that neither of the two letters received by the plaintiff mentioned the fact that the bank held the assignment, and that his object in the beginning in having the plaintiff call was to pay the interest due on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-4\">The plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that the note paid by him, and purporting to be witnessed by a clerk of Jackson, was a forgery, and that it was forged by Jackson; and that the note held by the Franklin Insurance Company was a genuine note. There was no other evidence in the case which was material. At the conclusion of the evidence, the defendant asked the judge to rule that the plaintiff could not maintain this action. The defendant contended that the action, if maintain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>able against anybody, should have been brought against the Eliot National Bank; that the action, if otherwise maintainable against the defendant, could not be maintained merely on proof of the note paid by the plaintiff being a forgery, and on proof of the notice of July 28, 1875, and on proof that he gave that notice within a day after going to the Franklin Insurance Company\u2019s office; that, as it appeared that the transaction of the bank with Jackson was <em>bond </em>fide, Jackson had thus parted with a title good as to the Franklin Insurance Company and the plaintiff, and that thus the bank was damaged by the release to the plaintiff of this mortgage; and that the notice of July 28, 1875, was not seasonable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\">' The judge declined so to rule, but stated that all the questions of law arising in the case should be reported to this court, and fully instructed the jury that if the plaintiff proved the facts stated in his declaration, he was entitled to recover; that the first question was whether the note was a forged note; that if the jury found it to be a forged note, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, provided that he was not informed of the forgery of the note until the day or day before he went to counsel, and that in such case the notice of July 28, 1875, would be seasonable notice, and provided that the defendant did not disclose to him the fact that he was not acting as principal in the transaction, and the plaintiff did not know at the time of the payment of the money to the defendant that the defendant was acting for the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for $2053; and the judge reported the case for the determination of this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">If the court should find upon this report that the action was maintainable, if at all, only against the bank, or that the notice was not seasonable so as to entitle the plaintiff to recover, or that the plaintiff could not, under the circumstances herein stated, maintain his action on proof of the note being a forgery and the note held by the Franklin Insurance Company genuine, and proof that the defendant did not disclose to the plaintiff the fact that he was acting as principal in the transaction, judgment was to be entered for the defendant; and in case the court should not so find in either particular as matter of law, but should find that the instructions to the jury were not conformable to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>requirements of the case, the verdict was to be set aside and a new trial ordered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-3\"><em>R.

H. Goodwin, Esq.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u201c Dear Sir: We are instructed by Mr. Thomas J. Welch to inform you that he finds his signature on the note for $2000, dated March 12, 1873, and paid to you July 8, to have been forged, and that the genuine mortgage note is held by the Franklin Insurance Company. Accordingly he requests you to repay the amount of his payment, viz. $2053.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u201c Respectfully yours,</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u201cMorse, Stone &amp; Greenougt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b95-5\">Lord, J</author>\n<p id=\"ABO\">This case differs from that of <em>Carpenter </em>v. North<em>borough National Bank, ante, </em>66, in two particulars only. The payment was received by the defendant in this case as the agent of another party. The instructions of the presiding judge on that subject were correct. One who acts as the agent of an undisclosed principal may be treated as principal by the party with whom he deals.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">The other particular, in which the case differs from that of <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Northborough National Bank, </em>is that the forgery, by means of which Jackson accomplished the fraud, was that of the name of the plaintiff himself; and the only question is, whether that fact of itself is an absolute bar to the right of the plaintiff to recover. We do not understand that any other question than this was presented to the mind of the judge who presided at the trial. If any other questions were presented, it is to be presumed that proper instructions were given in reference thereto, and that the jury were required to make the proper distinction and discrimination between the payment upon a note, the forged signature to which was that of the payer, and not that of another party to the contract. '</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">It may well be held that a banking corporation, which issues notes as currency, upon such plates and with such securities as it deems sufficient, may be, from reasons of public policy, estopped to deny the genuineness of notes which it has redeemed as its own, while such considerations would have no bearing upon the question whether an individual should be permitted to show that a signature which he had treated as his own was, in fact, a forgery. Nor is it necessary in this case to go so far as to say, as was held by a majority of the court in <em>National Bank of North America </em>v. <em>Bangs, </em>106 Mass. 441, that a bank may recover money paid upon the forged check of one of its depositors. In both those classes of cases, entirely different considerations may properly enter.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The question which we are called upon to decide is, whether, under any circumstances, a party may recover back money paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>upon a security bearing a forged signature of himself, supposing it, at the time of payment, to be Ms own genuine signature. We can have no doubt that he may. This is entirely clear in case he was induced to make the payment by fraud or misrepresentation. Nor is it necessary that fraud or misrepresentation should exist. An innocent mistake, whether arising from natural or temporary infirmity or otherwise, made without fault upon his part, entitles him to the same relief. How far tMs right would be affected by neglect upon his part to give prompt notice of the mistake, or by any change affecting the situation or rights of the person to whom the payment is made, we are not called upon to consider. Here notice was given immediately upon discovering the forgery. Whatever securities were given up by the defendant, in consideration of the receipt of the forged note, had been given up before the payment was made. The discharge of the mortgage by Goodwin was the release of no substantial right. If Goodwin received any title to the mortgage or mortgaged premises by reason of the assignment to him, he received it in trust for another, and in no event for his own benefit. His discharge of it was therefore no injury in law to him. By the facts as they appear in the report, his discharge of the mortgage effected nothing except what by law or in equity he would be compelled to do. There is no reason, therefore, why the plaintiff should not recover; and there must be <em>Judgrrient on the verdict.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
