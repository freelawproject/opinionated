Dresser, a police officer of the city of Boston, without a warrant, on a charge of drunkenness; that he was tried for this offence before a court of competent jurisdiction, and was found not guilty and discharged; and that while under arrest on the charge of drunkenness, and when about to be locked up by the officer, he committed the assault complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">The defendant requested the judge to instruct the jury that the officer, having arrested the defendant without a warrant, on the charge of drunkenness, of which the defendant was found not guilty after due hearing and trial, was a trespasser, and guilty of an illegal arrest; that said trespass and illegal arrest continued, and that he could not therefore be considered as an officer in the discharge of his duty when assaulted. There was evidence tending to show that the defendant was drunk when arrested, and this was not denied by the defendant in his testimony on the stand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">The judge declined to rule as <em>requested; </em>but instructed the jury that the officer had a right to arrest for drunkenness without a warrant; that the discharge of the defendant in the lower court was not conclusive that he was not drunk; and that the jury might on this evidence convict the defendant of an -assault, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>as charged in the indictment, on an officer in the discharge o\u00ed his duty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-3\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions to the ruling and refusal to rule as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-4\"><em>W W. </em>Doherty, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b455-5\"><em>W.

Sts. <em>o. </em>165, \u00a7 25, is \u201c drunkenness by the voluntary use of intoxicating liquor.\u201d It is possible, therefore, that one may be drunk without being guilty of the offence described. Arrested in a public place, kept in custody till sober, and then brought before a court of justice, he may be able to show that the intoxication, which he admits existed, was produced by some other cause or means than the voluntary use of intoxicating liquor. If he does this, he is entitled to acquittal and discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The right of an officer to arrest without a warrant reaches, by the St. of 1876, <em>c. </em>17, the case of any person found in a public place in a state of intoxication, and does not depend on the intoxication having been produced by means which render the intoxicated person guilty of the crime of drunkenness. The mere fact therefore, that one arrested, by an officer without a warrant, for drunkenness, was acquitted at the trial of the complaint, is not conclusive evidence that he was .not drunk when arrested, nor that the officer was not in the discharge of his duty in making the arrest and keeping him in custody afterward, as a preliminary to making complaint against him. The in structions asked for by the defendant were therefore properly refused; and there is nothing in the exceptions to show that the instructions given were not warranted by the evidence in the case. <em>Exceptions overruhcL</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
