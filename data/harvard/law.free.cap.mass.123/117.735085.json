The general allegation that the account is of such a character is not sufficient to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the jurisdiction in chancery. The object of the present bill is to recover a fixed commission upon merchandise consigned to the defendants, either by the plaintiff or by other persons. The plaintiff must know the amounts of his own consignments, and he expressly waives the oath of the defendants. He therefore makes no case for invoking the equity jurisdiction of this court, either for relief or for discovery. <em>Frue </em>v. <em>Loring, </em>120 Mass. 507. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>110 Mass. 545. <em>Fowle </em>v. <em>Lawrason, </em>5 Pet. 495. <em>Dinwiddie </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>6 Ves. 136. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>2 H.
