Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Compel Responses by Class Plaintiffs to Defendants\u2019 Joint Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents and Memorandum in Support of Defendants\u2019 Motion and Defendants\u2019 Certificate of Counsel Pursuant to Local Rule 3.04 (Doe. No. 161, filed May 27, 1993); Response of Plaintiff Sehwan\u2019s Sales Enterprises, Inc. in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Compel Plaintiffs\u2019 Production of Documents and Response to Interrogatories (Doc. No. 168, filed June 9, 1993); and Class Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Compel Responses by Class Plaintiffs to Defendants\u2019 Joint Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents and Joint Motion to Set a Schedule for Discovery by All Parties (Doc. No. 172, filed June 14, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">Defendants seek to compel discovery responses from non-class representatives, contending that \u201cname\u201d Plaintiffs are always subject to discovery, even though they have not been designated as class representatives. Class Plaintiffs, on behalf of the non-representative class members, argue that absent class members are generally not subject to discovery and therefore the non-representative \u201cname\u201d Plaintiffs in this action should not be subject to discovery either.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-15\">In the instant case, Defendants seek discovery from Plaintiffs who initially filed actions in this multi-district litigation as named Plaintiffs, but who subsequently were not chosen as representative parties for class purposes. By virtue of not being chosen as class representatives, these Plaintiffs remain as passive class members, on equal footing with all other non-representative class mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>bers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The efficiencies of a class action would be thwarted if routine discovery of absent class members is permitted, particularly on the issue of liability. In certifying the class, this Court found that the claims of the class representatives were typical of the class as a whole. This issue was expressly discussed in the discovery context at the Court\u2019s initial hearing in this ease on October 28, 1992. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel stated that rather than having eleven or twelve class representatives, Plaintiffs would select three or four companies, and \u201cthose will be the cases if defendants want those will be the party plaintiffs if defendants want discovery, to whom they should address it.\u201d (Doc. No. 22, p. 85). The Court then inquired of Mr. Burke, representing the Defendants, by asking: \u201cMr. Burke, is there any response to that?\u201d to which Mr. Burke responded, \u201cNo, your Honor.\u201d (Doe. No. 22, pp. 85-86). As this dialogue shows, Defendants were on notice that discovery would be limited to the class representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Moreover, there is no indication that the information sought from the non-representative class members differs in any way from the information already provided by the class representatives. Defendants have not argued that they have a particularized need to obtain information not available from the class representatives. Absent a showing of such particularized need, the Court will not permit general discovery from passive class members. This determination is supported by the legal authority in this Circuit, <em>see, e.g., Cox v. American Cast Iron Pipe Co., </em>784 F.2d 1546, 1555-57 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 883, 107 S.Ct. 274, 93 L.Ed.2d 250 (1986), as well as decisions from other courts in other Circuits. <em>See, e.g., In re \u201cAgent Orange\u201d Product Liability Litigation, </em>104 F.R.D. 559, 562 n. 1 (E.D.N.Y.1985); <em>United States v. Trucking Employers, Inc., </em>72 F.R.D. 101,104-05 (D.D.C.1976). The Court, following Eleventh Circuit precedent, is not persuaded by the rationale of <em>Brennan v. Midwestern United Life Ins. Co., </em>450 F.2d 999 (7th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 921, 92 S.Ct. 957, 30 L.Ed.2d 792 (1972) and <em>In re Folding Carton Antitrust Litigation, </em>83 F.R.D. 260 (N.D.Ill.1979) upon which Defendants would rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Compel Responses by Class Plaintiffs to Defendants\u2019 Joint Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents (Doc. No. 161) is DENIED in accordance with this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">2. Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Set a Schedule for the Production of Documents by All Parties and for Answers to Defendants\u2019 Interrogatories by All Named Plaintiffs and Memorandum in Support of Defendants\u2019 Motion (Doe. No. 164, filed June 1,1993); Plaintiffs\u2019 Response to Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Set a Schedule for the Production of Documents by All Parties and for Answers to Defendants Interrogatories by All Named Plaintiffs (Doe. No. 169, filed June 9, 1993); and Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum in Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Set a Schedule for Discovery by All Parties (Doc. No. 172, filed June 4, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Defendants seek to require simultaneous production of all outstanding discovery and to include non-representative class members in its discovery requests. The Court has determined, above, that non-representative class members shall not be subject to discovery absent a showing of a particularized need for information that cannot be obtained from the class representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">In addition, all discovery requests that were previously subject to orders of this Court should have been completed. One party\u2019s compliance with a Court Order may not be conditioned upon another party\u2019s compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 Joint Motion to Set a Schedule for the Production of Documents by All Parties and for Answers to Defendants\u2019 Interrogatories by All Named Plaintiffs (Doc. No. 164) is DENIED in accordance with this Order. Any discovery ordered produced by this Court that is still outstanding shall be produced within five (5) days from the date of this Order. Failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>comply with this Order may result in the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">3. Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Computer Data in Response to Defendants\u2019 Second Joint Document Request and Memorandum of Law (Doc. No. 167, filed June 8, 1993); Notice of Withdrawal as to Plaintiff Seven-Up Bottling Company of Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Computer Data in Response to Defendants\u2019 Second Joint Document Request (Doc. No. 173, filed June 15, 1993); Reply of Class Action Plaintiffs to Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Computer Data in Response to Defendants\u2019 Second Joint Document Request (Doc. No. 175, filed June 16, 1993); and Individual Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Computer Data (Doe. No. 184, filed June 22, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In accordance with the rulings above, the only remaining issue in Defendants\u2019 Motion is the production of computer data from individual, non-class Plaintiffs. Upon consideration, <em>the Court will conduct a fifteen (15) minute telephonic hearing at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 13, 1993 </em>to consider Defendants\u2019 Motion as it pertains to the individual, non-class Plaintiffs in this case. Counsel for Defendants shall be responsible for arranging the conference call connections and contacting the Court at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 13, 1993, when all of the interested parties are connected. Therefore, Defendants\u2019 Motion to Compel Production of Computer Data in Response to Defendants\u2019 Second Joint Document Request (Doc. No. 167) is DENIED as to the class Plaintiffs and DEFERRED as to the individual Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">4. Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 37(b) Motion to Compel Liquid Air Corporation to Comply with the Court\u2019s Discovery Orders to Produce Documents Being Withheld as Confidential and Supporting Memorandum (Doc. No. 181, filed June 18,1993); Defendant Liquid Air Corporation\u2019s Rule 26(c) Motion to Condition Discovery of Confidential Commercial Information Upon an Agreement and/or Order to Use Such Information Only for the Purposes of this Case (Doc. No. 188, filed June 24, 1993); Defendant Liquid Air Corporation\u2019s Memorandum in Support of its Rule 26(c) Motion and in Opposition to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Compel (Doc. No. 189, filed June 24, 1993); and Plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant Liquid Air Corporation\u2019s Rule 26(c) Motion to Condition Discovery of Confidential Commercial Information upon an Agreement and/or Order to Use Such Information Only for the Purpose of this Case (Doc. No. 193, filed June 30, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In these Motions Plaintiffs seek to compel Defendant Liquid Carbonic Air Coiporation (\u201cLiquid Air\u201d) to produce documents and computerized data which the Court has previously ordered Liquid Air to produce. Liquid Air resists producing any documents without the benefit of a confidentiality agreement between the parties. Apparently, ongoing negotiations over a confidentiality agreement between Plaintiffs and Defendants in this case broke down prior to the production of documents by Plaintiffs, and Plaintiffs elected to produce their documents without such an agreement. Plaintiffs\u2019 now contend that Defendants must also produce their documents without the benefit of an agreement on confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Although this Court has consistently refused to enter a general protective order in the ease, the Court is aware of the legitimate needs of the litigants in protecting confidential business information, and the Court has suggested on several occasions that the parties enter private confidentiality agreements that would be enforceable by the Court. This issue was carefully considered by telephonic hearing on June 24,1993 in settling a similar disagreement between Defendants and non-party Carbonic Industries Corporation. At that time, the Court endorsed Defendants\u2019 proposed agreement (Doc. No. 146, Exh. A) with several important modifications (hereinafter the \u201cModified Agreement\u201d) as described in the Court\u2019s Order of June 24, 1993 (Doc. No. 192). The Court found that the Modified Agreement adequately protected the interests of all parties to that dispute. Similarly, the Court finds that the Modified Agreement is sufficient to protect the interests of Plaintiffs and Liquid Air in the instant dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Liquid Air has been ordered to produce documents by this Court, and the Court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>not countenance any further delay in such production. The parties are encouraged to settle this issue privately. However, the Court will enforce as its Order the provisions of the Modified Agreement to Liquid Air\u2019s production, even without an agreement by the parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Any party to Liquid Air\u2019s production may apply to this Court to enforce the terms of the Modified Agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 Rule 37(b) Motion to Compel Liquid Air Corporation to Comply with the Court\u2019s discovery Orders to Produce Documents Being Withheld as Confidential (Doc. No. 181) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART in accordance with this Order. Liquid Air shall comply with the discovery requests within five (5) days from the date of this Order. Liquid Air\u2019s Rule 26(c) Motion to Condition Discovery of Confidential Information Upon an Agreement and/or Order to Use Such Information Only for the Purposes of this Case (Doc. No. 188) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART in accordance with this Order. The Court shall constructively impose the terms of the Modified Agreement to ensure that confidential business information is not misused.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">5. Defendants\u2019 Motion for a Protective Order and for Entry of Deposition Procedures Order and Memorandum in Support (Doc. No. 195, filed July 2, 1993), and Plaintiffs\u2019 Opposition to Certain Defendants\u2019 Motion for a Protective Order and for Entry of Deposition Procedures Order (Doc. No. 196, filed July 7, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Plaintiffs have served Defendants with Amended Rule 30(b)(6) deposition notices of Defendants in order to identify the data that each Defendant maintains on computers and the hardware and software necessary to access the information. Defendants seek to quash the notices and to set schedules and procedures for taking depositions in this ease. Defendants correctly note that at the January 28,1993 hearing, the Court strongly encouraged all parties in the case to agree on deposition procedures to facilitate merits discovery in the case. The Court now reaffirms the desire to maintain orderly and efficient procedures for completing discovery in this case. Nevertheless, Plaintiffs\u2019 30(b)(6) depositions to identify how data is maintained and to determine what hardware and software is necessary to access the information are preliminary depositions necessary to proceed with merits discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">The Court finds no reason to require that the parties arrange to exchange this computer information simultaneously, nor any reason to impose deposition procedures at this time. Plaintiffs shall notice their 30(b)(6) depositions for three separate days during one week in sufficient time to proceed with discovery on the merits. Costs shall not be awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 Motion for a Protective Order and for Entry of Deposition Procedures Order (Doc. No. 195) is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-16\">DONE AND ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-17\">EXHIBIT A</p>\n<p id=\"b266-18\">\n<em>CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">WHEREAS, the parties to the above-captioned litigation recognize the legitimate interests of all parties and non-parties to limit access to certain information and documents that will be exchanged during discovery and to prevent unnecessary disclosure of such data, and</p>\n<p id=\"b266-20\">WHEREAS, the parties wish to avoid du-plicative and conflicting protective orders and confidentiality agreements to expedite the production of responsive discovery;</p>\n<p id=\"b266-21\">THEREFORE, the parties agree to abide by the following terms and conditions to protect the documents and other forms of information that are produced or discovered in the above-captioned cases:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>EXHIBIT A \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">1. The documents and information produced in this case shall be used only for the purpose of prosecution or defense of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">2.
