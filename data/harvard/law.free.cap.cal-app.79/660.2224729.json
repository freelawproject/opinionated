Spence on the theory that he was an employee of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">It was and is contended that Spence was not an employee of Kennedy, but that he was operating as an independent contractor. Briefly stated, the facts are as follows: P. T. Kennedy is a general contractor who at times subcontracts various portions of his work. He had a contract to erect certain buildings at -the Boy Scout Camp in East Oakland. The work of shingling the buildings was let to one W. A. Spence, who agreed to do this work for $1.50 per thousand shingles laid and three and one-half -cents a foot for the hips and valleys. While employed at his work, Spence fell from the roof of one of the buildings, sustaining a fracture of the pelvis. Thereafter, on July 30, 1925, he filed his application for adjustment of claim with respondent Commission against Kennedy and his insurance carrier, Royal Indemnity Company. A hearing was held on August 12, 1925-, and on September 15th following the Commission made and filed its findings of fact and award wherein it was determined that the applicant was employed as a shingler by Kennedy and that the injury complained of arose out of the employment, and compensation was awarded at the rate of $20.83 a week, beginning June 23, 1925, and until the further order of the Commission. A petition for a rehearing was filed and denied and the present proceeding in review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>No useful purpose would be subserved by an extended review or analysis of the facts.
