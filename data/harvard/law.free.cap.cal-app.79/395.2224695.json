Judgment was rendered in favor of defendant Hooper, and the plaintiff appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">It will thus be noted that more briefly stated the question to be determined is whether negligence may be predicated upon the fact that with full knowledge of the existing conditions, defendant had an escaping gas-pipe on his premises which was connected with a gas-main and \u201ccarried large_ quantities of illuminating gas, \u2019 \u2019 and which gas was ordinarily prevented from entering the premises of defendant by a valve which at all times was \u201cin the possession and under the control of the defendant,\u2019\u2019 but which was unguarded and unprotected from the acts of careless or mischievous persons \u2014and from which conditions portions of the accumulation of gas which escaped from such uncapped gas-pipe, filled the premises, and an explosion occurred which caused the injuries of which plaintiff complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">At the outset, it is perhaps well to bear in mind that assuming the truth of the facts pleaded, the question of whether negligence properly and lawfully may be inferred from such a state of facts in the first instance, is solely for the court to determine. In the existing status of the case, what view of supporting evidence might be taken by a jury is immaterial. In other words, the fact that a jury might arrive at a conclusion either that the defendant was guilty of negligence or that he was in the exercise of due care, cannot be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">The principle of law appears to be well established that one in lawful possession of premises who by his invitation induces others to go thereon is under the duty of using reasonable care to keep such premises in a safe and suitable condition to the end that such invitees will not be unnecessarily exposed to danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The general rule with reference to liability for damages caused by wrongful act is that the negligence which directly causes such damages must be considered as the responsible agency. It is apparent that in the case at bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>two different acts of negligence were present, first, the uncapped gas-pipe, and, secondly, the act of strangers turning the valve so as to permit the flow of gas into such uncapped pipe. The underlying legal proposition here submitted is whether the uncapped gas-pipe, together with the conditions present as hereinbefore set forth, can be considered as the proximate cause of the injuries. In other words, the inducing or immediate cause. Abstract statements of the law apparently applicable to the general facts herein might seem to indicate that if no direct negligent act of the defendant was the cause of the injuries to plaintiff, but that such injuries arose from the negligent act of a third person, no liability will attach to defendant. One of the exceptions to such rule is that where it appears that one has committed a negligent act, which is continuing in its nature, and from which it is or should be anticipated that in the ordinary or natural course of human conduct, a succeeding act of negligence directly connected with the first negligent act, is likely to be committed by any person and which will result in injury, the proximate cause of said injury will include the first negligent act. Aside from statements of learned authorities on the law of negligence, the adjudicated cases in this state are by no means silent on the principle to which reference has just been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>42 Cal. App. 55, 58 [183 Pac. 280], may be found the following language: \u201cThe rule, as we understand it, applicable to such cases, is that where the original negligence of a defendant is followed by an independent act of a third person which results in a direct injury to a plaintiff, the negligence of such defendant may, nevertheless, constitute the proximate cause thereof if, in the ordinary and natural course of events, the defendant should have known the intervening act was likely to happen; ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">So in the case of <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Co., </em>158 Cal. 499 [139 Am. St. Rep. 134, 31 L. R. A. (N. S.) 559, 111 Pac. 534], where it appears that an explosion of gas resulted from the negligence of the company in repairing a leak in the gas-pipes and from the act of the lessee of the premises in bringing a light in contact with the gas, thus causing the explosion, it was held that both acts were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>proximate cause of the resultant injury. A part of the preliminary law of the case as stated in the syllabus is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cAn independent wrongful act, to constitute the proximate cause of an injury, by displacing the original primary cause, must be so disconnected in time and nature as to make it-plain that the damage occasioned was in no way a natural or probable consequence of the original wrongful act or omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cThe original act of negligence, the primary causation, may b.e in its nature so continuous that the concurrent wrongful act precipitating the disaster will in law be regarded not as independent, but as conjoined with the original act to create the disastrous result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Another case in point is that of <em>Feeney </em>v. <em>Standard Oil Co., </em>58 Cal. App. 587 [209 Pac. 85], wherein it appears that an employee of defendant spilled a considerable quantity of gasoline on the floor of a garage where he was making a delivery, and that some ten or fifteen minutes later while waiting in the garage for an approval of his delivery tags by the owner of the garage, the employee of defendant carelessly and negligently dropped a lighted match into the spilled gasoline, which resulted in the destruction of the garage by fire. In the course of the opinion it is said: \u201cSince the court did not find that the gasoline was negligently spilled the judgment must have been grounded upon McDonald\u2019s (the employee) negligence in igniting the gasoline or his failure to promptly remove it from the cement floor of the garage.\u201d And after commenting upon the well-known dangerous character of the gasoline especially in the circumstances there presented, the court said that the danger to be apprehended from leaving two and one-half gallons of gasoline spilled on a cement floor of a garage was well within the range of reasonable foresight. Nor would McDonald\u2019s independent act of negligence in dropping the lighted match relieve the defendant from the consequences of his negligent failure, \u201cas its agent, to remove the gasoline. \u2018If I am guilty of negligence in leaving anything dangerous in a place where I know it to be extremely probable that some other person will unjustifiably set it in motion to the injury of a third, and if that injury should be so brought about, I presume that the sufferer might have redress by action against both or either of the two, but un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>questionably against the first.\u2019 <em>(Lynch </em>v. <em>Nurdin, </em>12 Q. B. [A. &amp; E., N. S.] 29.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In the case of <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Central Counties Gas Co., </em>74 Cal. App. 303 [240 Pac. 53], a gas company constructed a pipeline which in part was parallel to a bridge but located a distance of five feet therefrom. An automobile in 'which plaintiff was riding, without negligence on his part, was deflected from its course and struck and broke the pipe-line which caused gas to ignite and burn the plaintiff. With reference to the question of law here under consideration, after observing that the defendant was under obligation to exercise ordinary care to prevent the escape of gas from its pipe-line, which care included particular consideration of the danger to be avoided and the likelihood of injuries resultant therefrom, the court quoted with approval the following language: \u201cWhere death may be caused by an agency lawfully in use, ordinary care requires that every means known, or that with reasonable inquiry would be known, must be used to prevent it. (Citing several cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u201c \u2018If the negligent act or omission is one which the company ought, in the exercise of ordinary care, to have anticipated was likely to result in injury to others, then it is liable for any injury proximately resulting therefrom, although it might not have foreseen the particular injury which did happen. \u2019 (12 R. C. L. 913.) \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Continuing further, the court said: \u201cRespondent contends that, if it be conceded that it was guilty of negligence in the maintenance of its pipe line, such negligence was not the proximate cause of the alleged injury, but that \u2018the act of the automobilist who forced the car in which, plaintiff was riding off the road was the proximate cause of the injury.\u2019 The defendant\u2019s negligence, however, was continuous in its nature, existing at all times up to the moment of the injury. Under a state of facts not distinguished in legal effect from those here involved, it is said: \u2018The independent wrongful act, to constitute the proximate cause by displacing the original primary cause, must be so disconnected in time and nature as to make it plain that the damage occasioned was in no way a natural or probable consequence of the original wrongful act or omission. . . . The original act of negligence, the. primary causation, may be in its nature so continuous that the concurrent \u2019 wrongful act precipitating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the disaster will in law be regarded not as independent, but as conjoining with the original act to create the disastrous result.\u2019 \u201d (Citing cases.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Other cases might be cited which in principle uphold the rule in effect as heretofore announced that where a negligent act is succeeded by a disconnected act of negligence of another person, and which results in injury to a third person, if the original negligence was such that in the ordinary and natural course of events, the second negligent act should have been anticipated as reasonably likely to happen, the proximate cause of the injury may be laid in the first negligent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">In the instant case, as disclosed by the allegations of the amended complaint, defendant Hooper was guilty of negligence in having on his premises wherein plaintiff was invited an uncapped gas-pipe \u201cfilled with large quantities of illuminating gas,\u2019\u2019 which was prevented from flowing through and escaping from the uncapped gas-pipe only by a valve, and unprotected from the acts of careless or mischievous persons. Defendant knew, or at least should have known, of the danger likely to arise from such a situation. It was through his original negligence, aided by such other negligence of a third person and which he should have foreseen the probability of its occurrence, with the resultant injuries to innocent persons who might be on his premises through his invitation, that the accident occurred. The amended complaint tells a connected and concise story of defendant\u2019s duty toward plaintiff and of defendant\u2019s alleged negligent acts which in the light of the authorities were the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The demurrer to the amended complaint should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">For the reasons hereinbefore set forth, it is ordered that the judgment be and it is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
