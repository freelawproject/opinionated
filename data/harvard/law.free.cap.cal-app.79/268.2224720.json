From the judgment of conviction and the order of the trial court denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The record shows that this cause was regularly set for hearing and notice given. No appearance, however, was made on the part of the defendant and appellant and no brief has been filed by or on behalf of the appellant.  We have, however, examined the record and find that the testimony of the female and the testimony of two physicians called on the part of the People amply sufficient to support the judgment of conviction upon both counts.  The female was found to be of the age of eleven years, and under the ruling in the cases of <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayes, </em>66 Cal. 597 [56 Am. Rep. 126, 6 Pac. 691], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>19 Cal. App. 675 [127 Pac. 660], did not require corroboration. But, as we have stated, the testimony of the female was corroborated to the effect that her person had been violated by someone. We have gone through the record and found the same exceptionally free from any rulings of the trial court that could possibly be construed as prejudicial to the appellant. The testimony is of such a character that it should not be spread upon the records and we have therefore contented ourselves with saying that the verdict of the jury finds ample support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and the defendant appears to he properly and justly convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\">The order and judgment of the trial court are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahx3\">Hart, J., and Finch, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
