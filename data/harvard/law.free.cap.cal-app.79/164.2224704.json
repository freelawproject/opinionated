The plaintiff and appellant is a purchaser of the property, to whom the property was conveyed subject to two trust deeds, the first of which is the one under which the sale was proposed, which sale the plaintiff asked the court to enjoin. There are no questions of fact involved in this appeal, and there is but one question of law. That is, whether a letter hereinafter set forth in full was an offer and tender of unconditional payment of the obligation referred to therein, or whether it was conditioned that plaintiff should be subrogated to the rights of W. W. Taylor in and to the note and trust deed referred to therein, and all rights thereunder as secured by a deed of trust also referred to in said letter. In other words, whether the payment to the Title Guarantee and Trust Company was intended to be, and actually was, a complete extinguishment of the debt, or whether it was an attempt to place the plaintiff Haskell in such a position that he could urge in his own behalf the lien created by said trust deed as a prior lien to the second trust deed held by W. W. Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">There is no merit in respondents\u2019 contention that there was no assignment of errors. The parties stipulated that the question involved was one of law and clearly set forth what that question was. Under the circumstances, an assignment of error, or specification of insufficiency of evidence, would have been superfluous. The case depends entirely on the construction to be placed on the following correspondence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cOctober Seventeenth,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APV\">\u201cNineteen Twenty-two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-3\">\u201cTo the Mortgage Guarantee Company, Title Guarantee &amp; Trust Company, W: W.

Haskell, successor of the Mortgage Guarantee Company, W. W. Taylor and the General Petroleum Corporation, of that certain $5,000 note made and executed by Garry G. Layman and Willa N. Layman, dated October 10, 1918, secured by trust deed to yourself, dated of the same date, and recorded October 10, 1918, in book 138, page 130 of deeds, records of Imperial county California, and the undersigned, Garry G. Layman and Willa N. Layman, the parties owing said debt, do hereby, jointly, request of you and direct that on Saturday, the 21st day of October, 1922, the time for which the sale is now advertised of the property under said trust deed, you continue said sale for a period of sixty days, namely: to Wednesday, the 20th day of December, 1922, at the hour of ten o\u2019clock a. m. of that day, and at the same place as now noticed in your notice of sale, which you are now running, and we hereby request and direct you to properly advertise such continuance of said sale, and the undersigned, Herbert M. Haskell, hereby advises you that Messrs.

Those gentlemen are also provided with money with which to pay such additional charges and expenses as may be incurred or occasioned by the continuance of such sale.

Layman, \u201cMakers of said note and trust deed.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">Thereafter, the defendant Warren W. Taylor signed and sent to Meserve &amp; Meserve, said attorneys for plaintiff, the following letter:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201cLong Beach, California, \u201cOctober 31, 1922.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-11\">\u201cMessrs. Meserve &amp; Meserve,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-12\">\u201c417 Union Oil Bldg.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-13\">\u201cLos Angeles, Calif.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-14\">11 Gentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-15\">\u201cI have your offer in writing in reference to the tender of Mr. Haskell of certain sums of money due upon the Garry G. Layman note and trust deed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-16\">\u201cThe tender is hereby rejected upon the ground that the \u2022 same is not made directly in extinguishment of the debt evidenced by said note, but, on the contrary, is based on the condition that Mr. Haskell be subrogated to the rights of a creditor under said note and trust deed, and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>that the offer impliedly demands, as a condition, the assignment of said note and trust deed to Mr. Haskell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-3\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">\u201cWarren W. Taylor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The facts as alleged in the complaint were practically admitted by the answer, and were admitted in a stipulation of facts entered into on the trial which appears in the record herein. A short statement of the facts, as we view them, is as follows: That the defendant Taylor was the owner of the note and trust deed in controversy, and in addition thereto was the owner of an additional note secured by the second trust deed on the same property, and there was an apparent attempt on the part of the plaintiff Haskell to place the defendant Taylor in a position that would allow the plaintiff Haskell to enforce the lien, the right to do which he was claiming to have obtained by subrogation, as a prior lien to the lien of the defendant Taylor in his second trust deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The fact that plaintiff did not intend to make an unconditional payment is shown by the statement of plaintiff that he desired to pay the indebtedness secured by the trust deed, and \u201cbecome subrogated to the rights of the owner or owners of said indebtedness secured by said trust deed.\u201d And his demand on the same day that the sale advertised be continued for a period of sixty days is a statement wholly inconsistent with any theory that the debt was extinguished by payment. Again, the fact that defendant W. W. Taylor, the real owner of the notes secured by the trust deeds, within five days after receipt of plaintiff\u2019s letter accompanying his alleged payment, notified plaintiff in writing that he rejected the alleged tender on the ground that the offer of payment was conditional on subrogation, and the fact that plaintiff made no effort to relieve any uncertainty indicates that the alleged payment was conditional. It is therefore apparent that because of the condition attached to the payment or deposit of the money it was not a payment of the indebtedness unconditionally, and the lower court correctly held that under the circumstances there was no subrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The cases cited do not cover the facts and circumstances as they appear in this case, and the Civil Code sections 2903 and 2904 are also not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>If the contention of the appellant is correct, it would never be safe for the owner of a second trust deed to purchase 'a first trust deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Conrey, P. J., and Houser, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">A petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on October 11, 1926.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
