In view of the fact that there is direct and sufficient evidence of these facts, the finding must be sustained, notwithstanding that there was opposing testimony of the defendant and others relating to those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">It appearing that the appeal was made for delay, the judgment is affirmed, and it is ordered that respondent recover from appellant the sum of $50 damages in addition to the costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Houser, J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
