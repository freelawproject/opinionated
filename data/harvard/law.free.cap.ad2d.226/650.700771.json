The evidence presented, including the defendant\u2019s admission at trial, demonstrate that his acts constituted a single criminal endeavor with the same purpose, and were closely related and connected in time and circumstance of commission. Thus, these charges were properly tried together <em>(see, </em>CPL 40.10, 200.20; <em>People v Johnson, </em>48 NY2d 925; <em>People v Gallishaw, </em>143 AD2d 198; <em>People v Lawrence, </em>166 AD2d 164).</p><p id=\"b694-11\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are either unpreserved for appellate review or without merit. Santucci, J. P., Altman, Krausman and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
