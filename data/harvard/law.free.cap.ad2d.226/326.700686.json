The issues raised on the appeal from the order are brought up for review and have been considered on the appeal from the judgment <em>(see, </em>CPLR 5501 [a] [1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">On July 2, 1989, at approximately 12:00 p.m., the plaintiff Andrew Akerman, who was then 16 years old, dove into the ocean at Rockaway Beach between Beach 138th and Beach 139th Streets. The plaintiff hit something and, as a result, sustained a compression fracture of the sixth cervical vertebrae, which rendered him a quadriplegic. Shortly thereafter, the plaintiffs commenced this action against the City of New York, claiming that his head had struck a submerged jetty at Beach 138th Street that was concealed by sand and water at the time of the accident. At trial, however, there was no testimony linking the jetty with the cause of Andrew\u2019s injuries since no one saw him strike the jetty or dive in its direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and affording them the benefit of every favorable inference that may reasonably be drawn therefrom, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>with the trial court that they failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant (see, <em>Fleming v Kings Ridge Recreation Park, </em>138 AD2d 451). While the plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could conclude that the jetty was submerged in the water with no warning signs at the time of the accident, the record is devoid of any evidence from which a jury could conclude, based on the logical inferences to be drawn from the evidence and not speculation, that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a substantial cause of the events that produced Andrew\u2019s injuries <em>(see, Fleming v Kings Ridge Recreation Park, supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">We have reviewed the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions and find them to be without merit <em>(see, Nicastro v Park, </em>113 AD2d 129, 133; <em>Tucker v Elimelech, </em>184 AD2d 636; <em>LaMotta v City of New York, </em>130 AD2d 627; <em>Truran v Otis El. Co., </em>192 AD2d 598). Miller, J. P., Joy, Altman and Friedmann, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
