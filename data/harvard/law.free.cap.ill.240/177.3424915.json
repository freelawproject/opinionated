J. Keenan and L. C. Keenan, doing business under the name of J. Keenan\u2019s Bank, caused to be entered by confession, in the circuit court of McLean county, ag-ainst the appellants, William Blue and James Vance, and one D. L. Buck-worth, a judgment for $4573.44 upon a promissory note for $4000, bearing- date March 8, 1905, signed by D. L. Buclcworth, William Blue and James Vance, and payable two years after date to D. L. Buclcworth or order, with interest at seven per cent per annum from date until paid, which note had attached thereto a warrant of attorney authorizing Owen &amp; Owen, or any attorney at law, to confess judgment on the note in favor of the legal holder for the amount thereof and costs and $400 attorney\u2019s fees, which note bore on its back the following endorsement: \u201cFor value received I hereby assign all right, interest or title in the within note to I. N. Porter or bearer.\u2014March 14, 1905.\u2014D. L- Buclcworth.\u201d , After the entry of the judgment the appellants appeared and moved to vacate the judgment and to recall the execution which had been issued, which motion was overruled, and an appeal was prosecuted to the Appellate Court for the Third District, where the judgment was reversed and the cause was remanded to the circuit court. (130 Ill. App. 312.) Upon the case being re-docketed in the trial court 'an order was entered opening the judgment, staying execution and granting the appellants leave to plead. A demurrer was thereupon interposed to the declaration and sustained, and the appellees, by leave of court, amended their declaration and averred therein that D. L. Buclcworth, on March 14, 1905, assigned the said note for a valuable consideration, by his endorsement thereon, to one I. N. Porter or bearer, the said I. N. Porter being then and there a fictitious person, and that appellees were the bearers and legal holders of said note. The appellants again demurred to the declaration, and their demurrer being overruled they filed seven pleas to the declaration. The first, second and third pleas were sworn to. The first denied the assignment for value by endorsement and delivery. The second denied that the note was endorsed or delivered to appellees for value, and the third denied that I. N. Porter was a fictitious person and was known by Buckworth to be a fictitious person. The fourth, fifth and sixth pleas averred the said note was without consideration and was signed by the appellants as accommodation paper, and that they executed said note by reason of certain false and fraudulent representations made to them as to the financial standing of said D. L. Buckworth, and that to induce them to sign said note said D. L. Buckworth executed and delivered to them his note for $4000 of even date with said judgment note; that said Buckworth had been adjudged a bankrupt, and that they had filed said collateral note against his estate, upon which they had received a dividend of $906.34, which sum the}'- brought into court and offered to pay over to appellees if they should be adjudged to be the owners of the said judgment note. The seventh plea averred that the attorney\u2019s fees incorporated \u2022in said judgment note and warrant of attorney made the transaction between the appellants and appellees usurious. The appellees joined issue upon the first, second, third and seventh pleas and filed two replications to the fourth, fifth and sixth pleas, in the first of which they denied that J. Keenan had any notice of the facts averred in said pleas, and the second replication pleaded an estoppel upon the appellants growing out of the presentation of said collateral note by them against the estate of D. L. Buckworth. The court sustained a demurrer to the second replication, and upon the trial, at the close of all the evidence, instructed the jury to find the issues in favor of the appellees, and after overruling a motion for a new trial rendered judgment on the verdict, holding \u201cthe judgment entered herein on the 2ist day of October, 1905, in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, for $4573.44, stand in full force and effect as of the time of its rendition,\u201d which judgment included the sum of $400 for attorney\u2019s fees, as provided in said note and warrant of attorney, and said judgment having been affirmed on appeal to the Appellate Court for the Third District, a further appeal has been prosecuted to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AT5\" pgmap=\"180(266) 181(291)\">On the trial two witnesses, namely, Wesley M. Owen and A. J. Keenan, were called on behalf of appellees and testified upon the trial. Wesley M. Owen testified, in substance, as follows: That he was a member of the firm of Owen &amp; Owen, and that at the time of the note transaction his firm had for collection several claims against Buck-worth, amounting to $700 or $800, among which was one in favor of his half-brother, Thomas Owen, for $400; that Buckworth applied to his firm, as brokers, to negotiate a sale of the note; that he went to J. Keenan\u2019s Bank and talked with the appellee A. J. Keenan, cashier, and asked him if the bank would buy the note; that Keenan said they would if the bank\u2019s note ag-ainst Buckworth of $1750 was taken out and if it could be arranged so that Buckworth would not know the bank was getting the note; that Keenan suggested making- the assignment to I. N. Porter -01-bearer; that he told Keenan he would see what could be done about it, and went back and told Buckworth his firm could dispose of the note if Buckworth would pay them $80 commission and assign the note to I. N. Porter or bearer, and permit Owen &amp; Owen to deduct from the proceeds the amount of the claims held by them and an additional claim of $1750; that Buckworth said \u201cVery well,\u201d and he (witness) -wrote the assignment on the back of the note and read it to Buckworth, who asked, in substance, if Porter lived \u201cnear or around here,\u201d but that he did not answer the question; that Buckworth executed the assignment without knowing- that Porter was, in fact, a fictitious person; that he took the note to Keenan, the cashier, who deducted the amount of the note for $1750 held by the bank against Buckworth and credited the account of Owen &amp; Owen with the balance of the $4000; that he deducted $75 for his firm\u2019s services and the amount of the claims held by them against Buckworth, including the $400 claim of their half-brother, Thomas Owen, and paid over the balance, something like $1500, to Buckworth. A. J. Keenan testified, in substance, that at the time of the transfer of the note, his father, Joseph Keenan, owned and was operating the J. Keenan\u2019s Bank and that the transaction was had with him alone; that he was the only person connected with the bank who talked about it; that Joseph Keenan died testate qn the 19th day of September, 1905, and the note was an asset of the bank. The appellees also offered in evidence the last will and testament of Joseph Keenan, by the first clause of which all the assets of the bank were given to appellees in equal shares, to vest in them absolutely and in fee simple on the date of the testator\u2019s death, and by the last clause of which appellees were appointed executors of the will. The last codicil to the will directed that out of the other assets of the estate appellees should pay to themselves the amount of any loss or depreciation in the notes held by the bank at the testator\u2019s death. The note was also introduced in evidence.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-3\" pgmap=\"181(80) 182(48)\">After the appellees had closed their testimony the appellants offered themselves as witnesses to establish the facts set up in their fourth, fifth and sixth pleas, but upon objection they were held incompetent as witnesses, and on the cross-examination of Wesley M. Owen appellants sought to show that at the time of the transfer of the note Wesley M. Owen had knowledge of its accommodation character, and that at the time it was signed certain restrictions were placed upon its use by Buckworth, and that he knew that its execution had been obtained by false and fraudulent representations as to the financial standing of D. L. Buck-worth. An objection was sustained to the cross-examination on the ground that it was not proper cross-examination.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-5\" pgmap=\"182\">T.

L. Buclcworth there was no consideration for said note, it being accommodation paper, and that its execution was obtained by false representations as to the financial standing-of D. L. Buclcworth, and that as the father of appellees only paid $4000 for the note, conceding he purchased the note in good faith but for the face of the note, the recovery in favor of appellees should have been limited to the face of the note and interest, and that the judgment is excessive as to the attorney\u2019s fees included in the judgment. The note was accommodation paper, and there are no restrictions as to its use written on the note and no proof of notice of any restrictions as to its use or any proof of fraudulent representations made to appellants at the time the note was signed. In Naef v. Potter, 226 Ill. 628, it was said that accommodation paper is always necessarily issued without consideration, and no recovery can ever be had thereon by the original payee against the accommodation maker; that while the accommodation maker can impose any restrictions upon the use of such paper that he may see fit at the time it is issued, still, unless such restrictions are written upon the paper or otherwise brought to the knowledge of the transferee for value before he has purchased the paper, such restrictions constitute no defense to the paper, and the same rule with reference to fraudulent representations which do not go to the execution of the paper but apply only to the reasons which prompted the maker to lend his credit must apply to accommodation paper which applies to other commercial paper, and unless knowledge of such fraudulent representations is brought home to the transferee before he purchases the paper he will take it as an innocent purchaser, free from the defense of fraud. In Woodworth v. Huntoon, 40 Ill. 131, this court, on page 137, said: \u201cA note tainted with fraud or other infirmity, passing into the hands of an innocent purchaser not chargeable with notice and for a valuable consideration, he acquires it purged of the defense.\u201d In Wightman v. Hart, 37 Ill. 123, it was held when a promissory note has been assigned the presumption will be indulged that it was for value and bona tide. Persons questioning the fairness of the transaction, to defeat the assignment must prove that it was not for value or that it was made for fraudulent purposes.</p> <p id=\"b187-5\" pgmap=\"187\">In this case the evidence shows the father of the appellees, from whom they obtained the note, purchased this note in the due course of business and for its full face value. Clearly, therefore, appellees, as legatees under their father\u2019s will, have the right to recover the full face value of the note, and as the note was not paid and a judgment was rightfully confessed thereon in accordance with the warrant of attorney attached thereto, the attorney\u2019s fee specified in the note and warrant of attorney was rightfully included in the judgment. In Weigley v. Matson, 125 Ill. 64, it was held a stipulation in a warrant of attorney for the confession of a judgment by which a debtor agrees to pay the fees of his creditor\u2019s attorney in case the creditor is compelled to resort to legal proceedings to collect his debt is an agreement which is not only eminently just but which rests upon a good and valuable consideration. In Dorsey v. Wolff, 142 Ill. 589, it was held a provision in a note whereby the maker promises to pay an attorney\u2019s fee of ten per cent in case suit is brought thereon, either in such suit or by a separate action, passes by the assignment of the note as an incident to the main debt, and the assignee may recover such fee in an action on the note or in a separate action brought after suit on the note. The agreement to pay the attorney\u2019s fees in case judgment should be confessed upon the note in question gave the note currency as well as security, and rendered the note more valuable than though a provision for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees had not been incorporated in the note and power of attorney. Such agreement was supported by a good consideration, and by the transfer of the note passed to its legal holder.</p> <p id=\"b187-6\" pgmap=\"187\">The contention that the attorney\u2019s fees provided for in the note and warrant of attorney were unlawfully included in the judgment cannot be sustained.</p> <p id=\"b188-4\" pgmap=\"188\">It is next contended that the endorsement on the note was not sufficient, in law, to transfer the title of the note to the appellees. In Kistner v. Peters, 223 Ill. 607,- a note was made payable to the order of Rosa M. Rinehart, who wrote on the back of the note, \u201cI hereby acknowledge myself a principal maker of this note with E. N. Rinehart and my liability as such principal jointly with him.\u2014Rosa M. Rinehart,\u201d and delivered the same to Hettie J. Peters, who subsequently brought suit on the note. At the hearing, by leave of the court, she wrote the words, \u201cEor value received I assign the within note to. Plettie J. Peters,\u201d immediately preceding the words hereinbefore quoted, and it was held that the legal title to the note, by virtue of the original endorsement, passed to Hettie J. Peters, and that it was not error to permit her to write on the back of the note the words which she did, preceding the original endorsement thereon. On page 611 of the opinion in that case this court said: \u201cThe name of the payee upon the back of.a negotiable instrument will transfer the legal title to the same, and it makes no difference that there is written above it language enlarging the liability of the endorser, such as a guaranty of the payment of the note.\u2014Heaton v. Hulbert, 3 Scam. 489; Herring v. Woodhull, 29 Ill. 92; Judson v. Goodzvin, 37 id. 268.\u201d We are of the opinion the name of D. L. Buclcworth upon the back of the note was sufficient to transfer the title to said note.</p> <p id=\"b188-6\" pgmap=\"188(113) 189(44)\">\u25a0 It is further contended that the note was transferred to I. N. Porter or bearer and that the legal title to the note did not pass to the legal holder of the note as bearer. The evidence shows that the name I. N. Porter was that of a fictitious person, and the law seems to be, where there is no statute on the subject, that the transfer of a negotiable instrument to a fictitious person or bearer will be treated as payable to bearer, and that the holder of such paper may bring a suit thereon in his own name. (Randolph on Commercial Paper, par. 161; 2 Parsons on Notes and Bills, p. 591, and note.) In Grant v. Vaughan, 3 Burr. 1516, it was held a bill payable to \u00e1 fictitious name or bearer, as, e. g./to \u201cShip Fortune or bearer,\u201d is payable to bearer. See, also, Piets v. Johnson, 3 Hill, 112.</p> <p id=\"b189-5\" pgmap=\"189\">It is said, however, that this rule does not apply where the maker of the instrument does not know that the note is payable to a fictitious person. If the rule is subject to the claimed exception this note was made payable to D. L. Buclcworth and by him endorsed to a fictitious person or bearer. The endorsement to the fictitious person was an endorsement to no person at all, and we think that part of the endorsement may be stricken out and the endorsement would then stand to \u201cbearer,\u201d which would pennit the appellees to maintain this suit. The case at bar in that particular differs from an endorseihent to a fictitious person or to a fictitious person or order, which seem to be the kind of cases relied upon by appellants to sustain their contention. We do not think, therefore, the cases in this State which hold that when a negotiable instrument is payable to a particular person or bearer the same must be endorsed by the particular person named as payee in order to pass title to the note apply here, as no specific person is named in this endorsement, I. N. Porter being a fictitious person.</p> <p id=\"b189-6\" pgmap=\"189\">It is also claimed it was error to refuse appellants the right to cross-examine Wesley M. Owen as to his knowledge of the facts surrounding the execution of said note. In the first place, the interrogatories propounded to Wesley M. Owen were not proper cross-examination; and secondly, there was no evidence tending to show that Wesley M. Owen was the agent of J. Keenan at the time Keenan purchased the note. At that time Wesley M. Owen was representing D. L. Buclcworth and received from Buck-worth $75 for his services.</p> <p id=\"b189-7\" pgmap=\"189(29) 190(51)\">It is finally contended that the court erred in declining to permit the appellants to testify to the facts,,surrounding the execution of the note and warrant of attorney. There was no evidence that J. Keenan had any knowledge of the facts surrounding the execution of the note at the time he purchased said note, and the appellees were suing as legatees, and the court properly declined to permit appellants to testify against them. McAyeal v. Gullett, 202 Ill. 214.</p> <p id=\"b190-5\" pgmap=\"190\">Finding no reversible error in this record the judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b190-6\" pgmap=\"190\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b190-7\" pgmap=\"190\">Mr. Justice Dunn,</author> <p id=\"AoG\" pgmap=\"190\">dissenting:</p> <p id=\"ATfF\" pgmap=\"190\">The appellees\u2019 title to the note and their right to maintain the suit are derived through the endorsement to I. N. Porter or bearer. Because I. N. Porter \"was not a real person the opinion of the majority holds this endorsement equivalent to ah endorsement to bearer, and that the title therefore passed by delivery to appellees. From this I dissent. In this State the words \u201cor order\u201d and \u201cor bearer,\u201d in an instrument payable to a person named or order, or to a person named or bearer, are surplusage. The legal effect of the instrument, whether payable to a person named or order, or to a person named or bearer, or to a person named, only, is the same, and in either case the instrument is payable only to the person named or to his order. (Hilborn v. Artus, 3 Scam. 344; Sappington v. Pulliam, id. 385; Roosa v. Crist, 17 Ill. 450; Turner v. Peoria and Springfield Railroad Co. 95 id. 134.) The doctrine that treats negotiable paper made payable to a fictitious person as if made payable to bearer, and so negotiable without endorsement, applies only to paper put in circulation by the maker with knowledge that the name of the payee does not represent a real person. (Shipman v. Bank, 126 N. Y. 318; Armstrong v. National Bank, 46 Ohio St. 512; Chism, Churchill &amp; Co. v. Bank, 96 Tenn. 641.) Since Buck-worth, in making the endorsement, did not know that I. N. Porter was a fictitious person that doctrine cannot be applied in this case, and there was no evidence that appellees were the legal owners of the note.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
