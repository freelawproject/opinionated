Harris <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>sued Augmentation in the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court in April 2013, seeking, workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Augmentation sought an independent medical examination, but the trial court denied Augmentation\u2019s motion. On April 3, 2014, the trial court entered a judgment incorporating the parties\u2019 settlement of the workers\u2019 compensation claim (\u201cthe April 2\u00d314 judgment\u201d). The judgment stated that \u201cfuture medical benefits shall remain open.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">On March 6, 2015, Harris filed a motion to hold Augmentation in contempt for its failure to authorize, approve, and pay for medical treatment prescribed by Dr. James P. Bailey, Harris\u2019s authorized treating physician. Specifically, Harris complained that Augmentation had failed to approve an epidural steroid injunction and medications prescribed to treat her lumbar back injury. In addition, Harris alleged that Augmentation and its workers\u2019 compensation carrier had failed to reimburse her for mileage costs for her travel to and from appointments with Dr. Bailey on April 16, 2014, and July 31, 2014, as required by Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 25-5-77(f). Harris sought a finding of contempt, appropriate sanctions, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Augmentation filed a response to Harris\u2019s contempt motion on July 13, 2015.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the conclusion of that response. Augmentation requested leave to take the depositions of Dr. Gordon Hardy and Dr. J. Todd Smith, two physicians employed by Augmentation to review Harris\u2019s medical records to determine whether Dr. Bailey\u2019s continued treatment of Harris was related to .her April 2Q11 accident. Harris replied to Augmentation\u2019s response on July 17, 2015, and Augmentation filed a \u201csecond response\u201d on July 20, 2016. The trial court set the matter for hearing on August 18, 2015. Augmentation filed a motion seeking clarification of the trial court\u2019s orders setting the August 18, 2015, hearing, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amu-dedup-0\">\u201cDefense counsel is not sure specifically which issues will be heard at the August 18, -2015, hearing. Defense counsel is also unclear whether the Defendant\u2019s request for leave to take the depositions of Dr. Smith and Dr. Hardy will be decided at that hearing, or whether that request was denied by virtue of the denial of the Defendant\u2019s Motion to Continue. Furthermore, Defense counsel is unclear whether it should have its witnesses in attendance and prepared to testify at the August 18 hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The trial court apparently held a hearing on or about August 18, 2015,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and then reset the case for November 17, 2015, and, finally, for November 24, 2015. The record on appeal contains the transcripts of only the November hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">After the November 2015- hearings, at which the trial court took evidence, both parties presented written briefs outlining their respective positions, and the trial court entered a judgment on December 4, 2015. In its. judgment, the trial court determined that Augmentation was .in contempt of the April 2014 judgment, concluding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-11\">\u201cThe undisputed evidence established-that the authorized treating physician, Dr. Bailey, had prescribed certain medical treatment for [Harris], Despite knowing of the prescribed medical treatment and having no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ordered medical treatment was not reasonable and necessary, [Augmentation] willfully and contumaciously refused to provide the medical treatment ordered by Dr. Bailey for a period of more than one year. Dr. Bailey testified that he has ordered the same medical treatment to treat [Harris\u2019s] April 3, 2011 injuries for over four years. The evidence showed [Augmentation] failed to respond to communications on behalf of [Harris] before the filing of [Harris\u2019s] Motion to find [Augmentation] in Contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-4\">\u201cThe Court hereby finds [Augmentation] in contempt for its willful, continuing failure or refusal to comply with this Court\u2019s Settlement Order dated April 3, 2014, wherein the Court ordered that future medical benefits shall remain open. The Court further finds that [Augmentation] failed to present good and valid reasons for its refusal to authorize medical treatment ordered by Dr. Bailey or to question its liability for the medical treatment ordered by Dr. Bailey. The evidence established [that Augmentation] failed to follow the utilization review process or petition the Court for judicial review before denying authorization of the medical treatment ordered by Dr. Bailey. The Court concludes the written opinions from Dr. Hardy and Dr. Smith do not constitute good and valid reasons for [Augmentation] to willfully and contumaciously refuse to provide medical treatment since [Augmentation] requested those written opinions months after [Harris] filed her Motion to find [Augmentation] in Contempt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The judgment ordered Augmentation to immediately provide and pay for the medical treatment ordered by Dr. Bailey. The judgment awarded Harris a total of $10,975, which included $300 in reimbursement for medical expenses, $10,425 in attorney fees, and $250 in deposition costs. Augmentation timely appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201cOur standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation cases was prescribed by the Legislature in Ala.

Donald, who testified regarding attorney fees incurred by Harris.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The September 2013 and September 2015 depositions of Dr. Bailey were admitted into evidence. At the November 24, 2015, evidentiary hearing, Augmentation presented no witnesses and merely presented documentary evidence in support of its position, including the \u201cIndependent Medical Record Review\u201d performed by Dr. Hardy and the \u201cPeer Review\u201d performed by Dr. Smith on Harris\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Harris testified that she had been injured at work on April 3, 2011, and that she had begun treatment with Dr. Bailey on April 12, 2011. She explained that her treatment had included therapy, a prescription muscle relaxer, anti-inflammatory patches, and epidural steroid injections for the pain related to the injury to her back and neck. According to Harris, after August 2014, Augmentation had declined to approve her prescription muscle relaxer and her anti-inflammatory patches or to preapprove her epidural steroid injection, which Dr. Bailey had prescribed in July 2014. Harris testified that she had attempted to contact the workers\u2019 compensation' adjuster, Tina Bonner Zinn, by telephone six or more times but that she had never received a return telephone call despite having left Zinn messages. She said that she had not- been able to receive her prescriptions or an epidural steroid injection for a year and a half at the time of the November 17, 2015, hearing. Harris said that her pain made her uncomfortable and that she could not sleep lying flat; instead, she said, she slept in a recliner.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In his September 2015 deposition,. Dr. Bailey testified that he had initially diagnosed Harris with a cervical strain and a lumbar strain. However, Dr. Bailey said, by September 2013, Harris\u2019s cervical strain had resolved and she was no longer being treated for it. According to Dr. Bailey, Harris\u2019s lumbar back symptoms waxed and waned but never completely resolved after the April 2011 injury. He said he had diagnosed Harris\u2019s strain as a chronic one based on his continued treatment of her; her reports of continued pain, including, at times, radiation of pain into her right leg; and his clinical impressions, which included repeated findings of tenderness in the lower back region and a limited range of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Dr. Bailey testified that he had prescribed an epidural steroid injection for Harris during a July 31, 2014, office visit because she had complained again of pain radiating into her right leg. He said that such treatment had resolved much of Harris\u2019s discomfort in the past. Dr. Bailey said that he next saw Harris on January 9, 2015, and that he had prescribed only the muscle relaxer and the anti-inflammatory patches at that time because Harris had recently been diagnosed as a diabetic and, he explained, epidural steroid injections are considered more risky for diabetic patients. He said, however, that he would not rule out prescribing such treatment in the future if circumstances warranted. As of the date of his September 2015 deposition, Dr. Bailey had last seen Harris on July 10, 2015. At that office visit, he said, he had again prescribed the muscle relaxer and the anti-inflammatory patches.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Dr. Bailey testified that he had received a letter from Zinn dated August 14, 2014. In that letter, Zinn questioned the medical necessity of the epidural steroid injection prescribed by Dr. Bailey on July 31, 2014. The letter reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atf\">\u201cI have received a request from your office for a lumbar [epidural steroid] injection and your office notes dated July 31, 2014.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cYour office notes dated July 31, 2014, under title Lumbar Examination\u2019there are no notes typed. I need to know what your examination of Ms. Harris\u2019 lumbar spine showed. Also, your July 31, 2014, notes state that you ordered\u2019 an x-ray of the lumbosacral spine; however, the title Imaging Findings is left blank. I need to know what the x-ray of the lumbosacral spine showed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">\u201cAlso, please provide the medical necessity of the [epidural steroid] injection based on a diagnosis of lumbar strain/ sprain from an April [3], 2011, work injury three years earlier. Also with an MRI done on June 17, 2011, that showed only mild foraminal stenosis at the lower three lumbar levels then a follow up lumbar- MRI that provided an impression of normal. For your review, copies of the MRI reports are attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cPlease be advised that I will need this information to review for approval of the [epidural steroid] injection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">According to Dr. Bailey, his staff had sent Zinn an office note that had been \u201cdictated, not read,\u201d in support of the request that Harris be approved to receive the epidural steroid injection. He explained that he had not reviewed or finalized -the \u2019digital note before it was-sent and that It had not contained certain information regarding his examination of Harris. Dr. Bailey testified that, after he received Zinn\u2019s letter, he reviewed the note and added the missing information; he then forwarded the note, which indicated that it had been digitally signed by him, to Zinn. The completed note read, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">\u201cHistory of Present Illness</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\">\u201c[Harris] is a 39 year old female.who is seen today for [lower back pain]. Low back pain is moderate with a rating of -5/10. Patient states pain is radiating into her right leg, that is a recent change, but was present previously. [Epidural steroid injection] eliminated this before. She states the pain is ongoing\u2014however it has increased over the last three (3) weeks to current levels. She states the pain is affecting her sleep and daily activity. There have been no significant changes in the current symptoms. She describes the symptoms as aching and sharp. Additional symptoms include difficulty walking and radiation of pain on the involved side. She wakes at night with pain, 5 nights during the week. Symptoms are made worse with activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">\u201cThere has been no new injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\">\u201cNo cauda equina or radicular type symptoms are present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\">\u201cThis initially-was an \u00a1on the job accident while..working as a nurse at a mental health facility.- Injury date was 4/ [3] /2011,.That continues to be what we\u00a1 are treating her for and that continuing problem since 4/ [3] /2011 is what we are seeing. her for today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-15\">\u201cShe has had [physical therapy], bracing, meds, [epidural steroid injection], which were very effective\u2018and for a time were replaced by [anti-inflammatory] -patches.- However now pain has intensified and she wanted to talk about [epidural steroid .injection] again. MRI scan lumbar was done last on 2/22/13. Last [epidural steroid injection] was on 12/11/2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>\u201cShe was given work restrictions, permanent, on 12/8/2011, consisting of modified nursing duties, with a 25# limit for any activity. This has not been accommodated so far, and she remains out of work. She' has not been, and continues not to be able to do regular nursing duty from the first time I saw her. Main complaint last several visits has been lumbar spine. That is the current situation as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAiv\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u201cLumbar Examination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmY\">\u201cBack pain 100%, No obvious Curvature of the spine.

X-rays of the lumbo-sacral spine were ordered, obtained and interpreted from an orthopedic standpoint,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"age-dedup-0\">\u201cImaging Findings: No acute changes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">Dr. Bailey testified-that he believed that the completed note adequately addressed Zinn\u2019s questions. Dr. Bailey stated that he did not recall responding to Zinn\u2019s letter in any way other than by sending the completed note. The sole inquiry to Dr. Bailey contained in the record is the August 14, 2014, letter, which, we note, questioned the necessity of only the epidural steroid injection.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">As noted above,, the written opinions of Dr. Hardy and Dr. Smith were admitted into evidence. Dr. Hardy stated that, in his opinion, Harris\u2019s \u201crecords reflect an injury consistent with an acute lumbar strain\u201d as opposed to a chronic strain. He further opined that Harris\u2019s continued complaints of pain were not related to her work-related injury and that Dr. Bailey\u2019s treatment recommendations, including the anti-inflammatory patches, were not appropriate treatments beyond 6 to 12 months after the injury. Dr. Hardy concluded with the following statement: .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3up\">\u201c[Harris\u2019s] cervical and lumbar injuries were acute in nature' from a single incident. MRI scans of the cervical- and lumbar spine along with nerve conduction studies were unremarkable. There are no objective findings in [Harris\u2019s] medical records to support ongoing treatment from an acute injury. Symptoms from the acute injury are resolved within 6 months from the date of injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-15\">Similarly, Dr. Smith stated in his report that, in his opinion, Harris\u2019s lower back pain was \u201cunrelated to her work-related accident from [four] years ago.\u201d He explained that, although Harris had suffered a lumbar strain at the time of the accident, he did not think that she continued to suffer from a chronic lumbar strain. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-16\">\u201cI do believe [Harris] had a lumbar strain that occurred at . the time of the original injury. MRI studies of the lumbar spine did not show any evidence of disc injury, fractures, instability, liga-mentous injury, edema in the musculature. These all point to the fact it is very unlikely the patient would have. any long-term sequelae from the -lumbar strain; therefore, I do not believe the patient is having back pain associated with a chronic lumbar strain and I do not agree with the diagnosis of chronic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>lumbar strain as the cause of her current low back pain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Dr. Smith further stated that, based on his review of Harris\u2019s medical records, Harris \u201chad normal range of motion by May 2011 in the ... lumbar spine,\u201d indicating, he said, that \u201cthe sprain portion of this had resolved by that point.\u201d Based on his conclusion that Harris did not suffer from a chronic lumbar strain, Dr. Smith opined that \u201cany treatments provided for the lumbar spine[, including anti-inflammatory patches, a lumbar brace, physical therapy, or epidural steroid injections,] would not be related to chronic strain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">In his September 2015 deposition, Dr. Bailey was questioned regarding the written opinions of Dr. Hardy and Dr. Smith. Regarding Dr. Smith\u2019s explanation for his conclusion that Harris did not suffer from a chronic lumbar strain, Dr. Bailey testified that he disagreed with Dr. Smith\u2019s opinion because, Dr. Bailey said, a strain cannot be diagnosed on an MRI or other scans. Instead, Dr. Bailey explained, a strain is diagnosed based on the patient\u2019s history and a physical examination of the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">When asked about Dr. Hardy\u2019s comment that Dr. Bailey had not documented objective physical findings supporting a conclusion that Harris suffered from a chronic strain, Dr. Bailey explained that he had documented tenderness to palpation and limitation of motion. Dr. Bailey also testified that he disagreed with Dr. Hardy\u2019s statement that a lumbar strain like the one Harris suffered would resolve within six months from the date of injury. According to Dr. Bailey, most strains do resolve, but, he said, in less than five percent of patients the strain does not resolve and becomes chronic.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">On appeal, Augmentation first argues that the trial court erred by concluding that it had violated the April 2014 judgment or that it had done so willfully and contumaciously. Secondly, Augmentation argues that the trial court erred by \u201cfinding it liable for Harris\u2019s ongoing and future medical treatment.\u201d In the corresponding section of its brief, Augmentation complains that the trial court erred by failing to allow \u201cmeaningful discovery\u201d and by failing to conduct a trial on the merits to determine whether Augmentation is required by the April 2014 judgment to pay for Harris\u2019s ongoing and future medical treatment. Augmentation further argues that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Augmentation is liable for all of Harris\u2019s future medical treatment is not supported by substantial evidence. We will address these arguments in a different order than the order in which they appear in Augmentation\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">Augmentation argues that the trial court failed to permit meaningful discovery and failed to conduct a trial on the merits of the dispute. As noted above, the trial court held a total of four hearings, two of which were evidentiary hearings. In fact, the trial court specially set the November 24, 2015, hearing to accommodate Augmentation\u2019s witness, who had suffered a migraine headache on November 17, 2015, and could not attend the hearing on that date. Despite the accommodation, Augmentation\u2019s witness did not attend the November 24, 2015, hearing, and Augmentation did not present a witness at either evidentiary hearing. We cannot agree that the trial court failed to conduct a trial on the merits of the dispute; instead, it appears that Augmentation failed to take advantage of the opportunity to present its witnesses at the evidentiary hearings conducted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Insofar as Augmentation complains that the trial court prevented it from conducting meaningful discovery, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>note that, in contravention of Rule 28(a)(10), Ala. R. App. P., Augmentation does not support the argument that such is reversible error with any authority regarding the right to discovery. See White Sands Grp., L.L.C. v. PRS II, LLC, 998 So.2d 1042, 1058 (Ala.2008) (\u201cRule 28(a)(10) requires that arguments in briefs contain discussions of facts and relevant legal authorities that support the party\u2019s position. If .they do not, the arguments are waived.\u201d). Furthermore, the record does not support reversal. Although the record reflects that Harris sought permission to conduct \u201cpostjudgment\u201d discovery, which was granted, see note 1, supra, the record does not reflect that Augmentation sought similar permission. However, Augmentation requested leave of court to take the depositions of Dr. Hardy and Dr. Smith. We presume that Augmentation sought such leave because parties to a workers\u2019 compensation case are generally permitted to take only two depositions, in addition to those of each party; additional depositions may be taken only \u201cwith leave of court for good cause shown .... \u201d Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 25-5-81(f)(1). Although Augmentation requested leave to depose Dr. Hardy and Dr. Smith, the record does not indicate whether the trial court granted or denied Augmentation the requested leave. Thus, insofar as Augmentation complains about not being permitted to conduct discovery, the record does not support a conclusion that the trial court committed any error by refusing to permit Augmentation the right to conduct discovery. Chadwick Timber Co. v. Philon, 10 So.3d 1014, 1019 (Ala.Civ.App.2007) (quoting Leeth v. Jim Walter Homes, Inc., 789 So.2d 243, 247 (Ala.Civ.App.2000), quoting in turn Newman v. State, 623 So.2d 1171, 1172 (Ala.Civ.App. 1993)) (\u201c \u2018 \u201cThis court cannot assume error, nor can it presume the existence of facts to which the record is silent. The appellant has the burden of ensuring that the record contains sufficient evidence to warrant reversal.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (internal citations omitted)). Thus, we decline to reverse the judgment on the ground that the trial court prevented meaningful discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Augmentation also argues that the trial court erred in determining that Augmentation violated the April 2014 judgment. Specifically, Augmentation contends that the trial court improperly construed the April 2014 judgment to mean that \u201cAugmentation accepted liability for Harris\u2019s alleged injuries and agreed to authorize and pay for Harris\u2019s medical treatment.\u201d Augmentation stresses that the settlement agreement incorporated into the April 2014 judgment indicated that Harris\u2019s claim was contested by Augmentation and contemplated that the issue of Augmentation\u2019s responsibility for Harris\u2019s future medical treatment would remain open \u201csubject to all medical -necessity, causation, and pre-authorization requirements as provided in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Thus, Augmentation contends, the trial court could not have concluded that, pursuant to the April 2014 judgment, Augmentation had \u201caccepted liability\u201d for Harris\u2019s future medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">The trial .court\u2019s judgment specifically states that the April 2014 judgment \u201crequired [Augmentation] to provide reasonable and necessary medical treatment related to [Harris\u2019s] compensable injury.\u201d That statement does not indicate that the trial court concluded that Augmentation had accepted liability for Harris\u2019s future medical treatment without limitation. The trial court\u2019s judgment, when read as a whole, indicates that the trial court considered whether the evidence supported a conclusion that Dr. Bailey\u2019s prescribed treatment was reasonably related to Harris\u2019s April 2011 injury and specifically references Augmentation\u2019s right to properly contest the reasonable necessity of Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ris\u2019s prescribed medical treatment. Thus, we cannot agree that the trial court erred in construing the April 2014 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We how turn to Augmentation\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by declaring that Augmentation was required to pay for any and all future treatment prescribed by Dr, Bailey. We do not understand the trial court\u2019s judgment to make such a blanket determination. Instead, the judgment indicates that the trial court understood that the issue regarding Augmentation\u2019s responsibility for Harris\u2019s future medical treatment was to remain open under the April 2014 judgment and that Augmentation could seek to challenge the reasonable necessity of any treatment prescribed for Harris. We note that in its judgment the trial court cautions Augmentation that the trial court will not look favorably upon any future failure to pay for treatment prescribed by Dr. Bailey. We understand that admonition to refer to continued medical treatment of the chronic lumbar strain by use of the muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory patches at issue in the present action in the near future, especially in light of the trial court\u2019s clear recognition of Augmentation\u2019s right to contest the reasonable. necessity of medical treatment. Furthermore, Harris concedes that the judgment does not require \u201cAugmentation to authorize and pay for any and all treatment which Dr. Bailey may prescribe in the future.\u201d Thus, we cannot, hold the trial court in error for determining that Augmentation was required to pay for any and all of Harris\u2019s medical treatment when the judgment does not so provide.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\"> We turn now to Augmentation\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by concluding that its decision to refuse to pay for Harris\u2019s prescribed medical treatment was willful 'and contumacious.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cRule 70A, Ala.

In addition, the trial court noted that Augmentation failed to resort to a utilization-review process, see Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 25-5-293(g) (permitting employers, at their option, to institute a utilization-review program to review claimed medicar expenses for reasonable necessity), or to seek judicial review of the dispute before refusing to pay for Harris\u2019s treatment. See Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 25-5-77(a) and \u00a7 25-5-88; Fluor Enters., Inc. v. Lawshe, 16 So.3d 96, 99 n. 1 (Ala.Civ.App. 2009) (\u201cPursuant to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Ala.

However, the Act specifically provides the manner in which the circuit court can decide such a controversy.

The trial court commented that Augmentation had \u201cno evidence that the ordered medical treatment was not reasonable and necessary\u201d at the time it decided to decline to pay for that treatment beginning in August 2014 and that the medical opinions upon which Augmentation relied to attempt to prove that the prescribed treatment was not reasonably necessary had been secured in late May and June 2015, well after' Harris was required to seek enforcement of the April 2014 judgment. Therefore, the trial court concluded, Augmentation did not have \u00e1 good and valid reason for its refusal to pay for Harris\u2019s prescribed medical treatment at the time of its refusal to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">Certainly, \u201csanctions for contempt \u2018should not be' imposed if the employer has a valid reason to question its liability for the- medical expense in dispute.\u2019\u201d Travelers Indem. Co. of Illinois v. Griner, 809 So.2d 808, 814 (Ala.2001). However, if the evidence supports a conclusion that \u201cthe employer willfully and contumaciously refused to provide the expenses for the medical care,\u201d Ex parte Cowgill, 587 So.2d 1002, 1004 (Ala.1991), a trial court may hold an employer in contempt for its failure to pay for an employee\u2019s medical treatment. As noted above, \u201c\u2018[t]he issue whether to hold a party in contempt is solely within the discretion of the trial court, and-a trial court\u2019s contempt determination will not be reversed on appeal absent a showing that the trial court acted outside its discretion or that its judgment is not supported by the evidence.\u2019\u201d Good Hope Contracting Co. v. McCall, 187 So.3d 1128, 1142 (Ala.Civ.App.2015) (quoting Poh v. Poh, 64 So.3d 49, 61 (Ala.Civ.App.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>In the present case, the evidence demonstrated that Augmentation immediately-questioned Dr. Bailey about the necessity of the epidural steroid injection, for which preapproval was required, by letter in August 2014. Dr. Bailey responded with a completed note, and, based on the evidence contained in the record, Augmentation made no further attempts to contact Dr. Bailey for further information, and yet did not approve the injection. In fact, Augmentation also refused to pay for Harris\u2019s prescription muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory patches for more than one year, despite not having requested information regarding the necessity of those prescribed treatments. Although Augmentation argues in its brief on appeal that Zinn, via \u201cnumerous\u201d telephone calls, \u201cmade repeated requests to Dr. Bailey for a written opinion as to whether the [epidural steroid] injection[ ] and [anti-inflammatory] patches were related to Harris\u2019s injuries sustained in the accident, and, if so, how they are related,\u201d the record contains no evidence supporting Augmentation\u2019s contention. The August 14, 2014, letter refers solely to the epidural steroid injection, and, because Zinn did not testify, Augmentation presented no evidence indicating that Zinn had made \u201cnumerous\u201d attempts to contact Dr. Bailey regarding the necessity of the injection after the initial August 2014 letter or of the anti-inflammatory patches through any other means or at any other time. Instead, from all that appears of record, Augmentation questioned the necessity of the epidural steroid injection once and never questioned the muscle relaxer or the anti-inflammatory patches as unnecessary or unrelated to Harris\u2019s work-related injury. Furthermore, as the trial court noted, Augmentation did not participate in utilization review or seek judicial review of its duty to pay for Harris\u2019s medical treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Thus, this case is unlike Jesse Stutts, Inc. v. Hughey, 154 So.3d 155 (Ala.Civ.App.2014), in which this court reversed a finding that the employer was in contempt for failing to pay for certain medical treatment after the entry of a judgment incorporating a settlement agreement that left the issue regarding responsibility for future medical treatment open. The employer in Hughey had filed a motion in the trial court seeking \u201ca determination of whether it was obligated to pay for further medical benefits for [the employee],\u201d and the employee filed a motion seeking to have the employer held in contempt for declining to pay for his medical treatment. Hughey, 154 So.3d at 159. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the trial court in Hughey entered a judgment ordering the employer to provide the requested medical treatment and finding the employer in contempt. Id. at 160. We reversed the determination that the requested medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>treatment was causally related to the employee\u2019s work-related accident, and we also reversed the finding of contempt. Id. at 164-65. We explained that the employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">\u201cclearly had the right to dispute whether the [requested medical treatment] was reasonably necessary as part of its obligations pursuant to the [earlier] settlement agreement. Given the facts of this case, [the employer] had a reasonable basis for bringing the dispute before the trial court for a resolution, as provided for in the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Id. at 164 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Based on the state of the record in this ease, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that Augmentation\u2019s failure to pay for Harris\u2019s medical treatment was willful and contumacious. The record reflects that Augmentation did not seek information from Dr. Bailey regarding the necessity of the muscle relaxers or anti-inflammatory patches he prescribed. Unlike the employer in Hughey, Augmentation did not seek judicial review of the dispute over its duty to pay for Harris\u2019s medical treatment. Instead, Augmentation refused to pay for Harris\u2019s medical treatment for over a year and waited to raise its challenge to its duty to pay for that treatment until Harris filed a contempt motion. In addition, although the record reflects that Zinn indicated that Dr. Bailey\u2019s records did not, in her opinion, support the need for an epidural steroid injection, the record does not contain Zinn\u2019s qualifications to make such a determination, and, as the trial court pointed out, Augmentation did not seek expert opinions to support its challenge to the reasonable necessity of the prescribed medical treatment until May and June 2015, well after the denial of that treatment and after Harris had filed her contempt motion. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment holding Augmentation in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b187-10\">Thompson, P.J., and Pittman, Moore, and Donaldson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\">.

Because we have concluded that the judgment does not require Augmentation to pay for any and all of Harris's future medical treatment, we pretermit consideration of Augmentation\u2019s argument that substantial evidence does not support the conclusion that Augmentation should be liable for all future treatment prescribed by Dr, Bailey. Augmentation does not specifically challenge the trial court\u2019s determination that. Dr. Bailey\u2019s testimony supports a conclusion that the medical treatment at issue in the present case was reasonably necessary and related to Harris's April 2011 injury. Thus, we deem that argument to have been waived. Tucker v. Cullman-Jefferson Counties Gas Dist., 864 So.2d 317, 319 (Ala.2003) (stating general principle that- the failure to present and argue an issue in,ati appellant\u2019s brief amounts to a waiver of that issue on appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b186-4\">. We note that in Ex parte Southeast Alabama Medical Center, 835 So.2d 1042, 1050 (Ala.Civ.App.2002), this court indicated that an employer may refuse to pay for medical treatment based on a \u201cdecision that a treatment recommended by an authorized physician is not reasonably necessary ... only if the employer has first followed, and has made that decision based upon,\u201d the utilization-review procedure set out in Ala. Admin. Code (Workers\u2019 Compensation), Rule 480-5-5-, 01 et seq. However, this court further recognized in Ex parte Southeast Alabama Medical Center that Ala. Code 1975, \u00a7 25-5-293(g), makes implementation of a utilization-review procedure voluntary. Id. at 1061. Because the trial court in the present case indicated that it was basing its contempt finding, in part, on Augmentation\u2019s failure to use either a utilization-review process or to petition for judicial review before declining to pay for Harris\u2019s medical treatment, we need not determine whether Augmentation was precluded from challenging the reasonable necessity of the prescribed treatments because it has apparently not \"implement[ed] utilization review and bill screening\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 25-5-293(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
