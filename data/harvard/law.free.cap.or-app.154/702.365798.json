J.</author>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">These consolidated appeals are from circuit court judgments on review of a series of Public Utility Commission (PUC) orders that allowed Portland General Electric (PGE) to include a \u201crate of return\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>profit) component, as well as the principal amount of its \u201cundepreciated investment\u201d in the retired Trojan generating facility, in its rates for the years 1995 to 2011. Two different circuit court judges, respectively, affirmed PUC\u2019s \u201cdeclaratory orders,\u201d and reversed and remanded its ratemaking order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, we review PUC\u2019s orders directly, rather than reviewing the circuit court judgments <em>per se. Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. v. </em>Katz, 121 Or App 48, 51, 853 P2d 1346, <em>rev den </em>318 Or 25 (1993). We conclude that PUC erred in each of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">With the exception of Utility Reform Project and the individuals who appear with it (collectively URP), the parties agree that the principal if not only issue before us in each of the appeals is whether PGE\u2019s rates may include the rate of return component, or are instead limited to the recovery of the declining principal amount of the undepreciated Trojan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>investment. As the parties summarize the issue, the opponents of PUC\u2019s orders take the view that PGE is entitled to recover through its rates only the return <em>of its </em>Trojan investment, while PUC and PGE assert that PGE may <em>also </em>recover a return <em>on </em>the investment. The parties also agree that a resolution of that issue turns on the applicability or interrelationship of two statutes. ORS 757.355 was enacted through an initiative measure in 1978 (Measure 9), and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">\u201cNo public utility shall, directly or indirectly, by any device, charge, demand, collect or receive from any customer rates which are derived from a rate base which includes within it any construction, building, installation or real or personal property not presently used for providing utility service to the customer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">ORS 757.140(2) was enacted by the legislature through Oregon Laws 1989, chapter 956, section 2, and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">\u201cIn the following cases the commission may allow in rates, directly or indirectly, amounts on the utility\u2019s books of account which the commission finds represent undepreciated investment in a utility plant, including that which has been retired from service:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201c(a) When the retirement is due to ordinary wear and tear, casualties, acts of God, acts of governmental authority; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\u201c(b) When the commission finds that the retirement is in the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">The parties make numerous arguments regarding the meaning and relationship of the two statutes. Generally speaking, the parties opposing PUC\u2019s orders rely mainly on ORS 757.355 and those supporting the orders place their main reliance on ORS 757.140(2). The first specific area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>disagreement arises from PUC\u2019s and PGE\u2019s contention that ORS 757.355 has <em>no </em>application to retired facilities, but pertains instead only to plant and facilities that are in developmental stages or that are not yet being used for the provision of utility services. CUB, PPC and URP take the opposite view. PUC and PGE agree that the language of the statute and the history of measure 9 demonstrate that the target of the measure and the concern of the statutes are with rates for \u201cconstruction work in progress\u201d (CWIP), <em>i.e., </em>uncompleted facilities or those planned for prospective use that are not yet in use. PUC and PGE assert, <em>inter alia, </em>that the word \u201cpresently,\u201d in the statutory phrase \u201cnot presently used for providing utility service,\u201d is used in the sense that <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>1793 (1993) defines as \u201cafter a little while,\u201d \u201cby and by,\u201d \u201csoon,\u201d and the like. Relying on an alternative definition in the same dictionary, CUB argues that \u201cpresently\u201d is used in the statutes to mean \u201cnow\u201d or other formulations synonymous with \u201ccurrently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">We do not think that the word \u201cpresently\u201d specifically or the language of ORS 757.355 generally can plausibly be read as pertaining only to utility property that is not yet in use, and we conclude that the limitations of the statute apply to property that has ceased being used for the provision of services as well as property that has never been so used. As we noted in <em>Steele v. Employment Department, </em>143 Or App 105, 113, 923 P2d 1252, <em>rev allowed </em>324 Or 487 (1996), the fact that a particular word has various meanings, all of which are reflected in the dictionary, does not mean that all of the definitional variations</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201care pertinent whenever the word is used, or that each variation is an arguably plausible description of what the word means as it is used in a particular statute. The subject and purpose of the statute, together with the statutory language that surrounds the word in question, narrow the array of definitional choices that dictionaries alone afford!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">In the present case, there are at least two aspects of the surrounding statutory language that are at odds with PUC\u2019s and PGE\u2019s understanding that the word \u201cpresently\u201d and the statute relate only to CWIP and do not also apply to facilities and plant that are no longer in use. First, ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>757.355 specifically describes the items that are \u201cnot presently used\u201d as including \u201cconstruction, building, installation or real or personal property.\u201d Under PGE\u2019s and PUC\u2019s reading, only the first word in that enumeration would have been necessary. Moreover, unlike \u201cconstruction,\u201d the words that follow it in the quoted language of the statute encompass completed structures and facilities and real and personal property of all kinds. On their face, the referents of those words can and facially do include property that has ceased to be used for the provision of utility services as well as property that never was.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">The second significant aspect of the statutory language is that what it proscribes, <em>inter alia, </em>is the inclusion in the \u201crate base\u201d of the property and facilities that are not presently used. \u201cRate base\u201d is a term of art in the field of public utility regulation. <em>In Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Wallace, </em>158 Or 210, 231, 75 P2d 942 (1938), the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201cWe are well satisfied that the company cannot include within its valuations property which it neither used nor was useful to the public service. Property which was not reasonably necessary to the adequate furnishing of telephone service must be excluded from the rate base[.]\u201d (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The principal consequence of inclusion or exclusion is that \u201c[t]he rate base represents the invested capital upon which the utility is entitled to earn a return.\u201d <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Hill, </em>229 Or 437, 444, 365 P2d 1021, 367 P2d 790 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">More recently, in <em>PP&amp;L v. Dept. of Rev., </em>308 Or 49, 775 P2d 303 (1989), the Supreme Court restated those two concepts in conjunction, and cited ORS 757.355 as the sole authority for either or both of them. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u201c <em>\u2018Property not in service.\u2019 A* </em>* * basic premise of utility regulation is that a utility should be permitted to earn a return only on property that is reasonably necessary to and actually providing utility service. <em>See </em>ORS 757.355. The largest type of property in the property-not-in-service category is construction work in progress (CWIP). When a utility constructs new property, such as a generating facility, that property is not included in the utility\u2019s rate base until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>it actually is placed in service and, even then, the regulators may not allow it in the rate base until the utility establishes that the property is reasonably necessary to provision of electrical service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">\u201cAnother significant type of property in this category is property held for future use (PHFU). This is property \u2014 usually unimproved realty \u2014 which the utility anticipates it will need in the future but which it is not presently using to provide electric service. As long as such property is not used, the regulators will not allow the utility to earn a return on it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53-54 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Thus, ORS 757.355 would appear to be less an innovative new form of restraint on utility rates than the embodiment of an old one: property that is not \u201creasonably necessary to and actually providing utility service\u201d is ineligible for either inclusion in the rate base or for a rate of return payable by utility customers. There is no logical basis for applying that principle only to property that is not <em>yet </em>reasonably necessary and actually used, but not to property that has <em>ceased </em>to be reasonably necessary and actually used. In either instance, the utility provider\u2019s profit on its property investment would be derived from ratepayers whom the utility is not using the property to serve. It is, of course, true that the voters of Oregon were not obliged to embody that principle in its entirety in the statute they enacted, and were free to confine its limitations to CWIP. However, the fact that ORS 757.355 refers to completed facilities as well as \u201cconstruction,\u201d and does so in an enumeration of kinds of property that may not be included in a public utility\u2019s \u201crate base,\u201d demonstrate both that the statute was meant to apply to property in addition to CWIP and that it used the conventional term \u201crate base\u201d without in any way suggesting that the term did not carry its conventional meaning. As relevant here, that meaning is one that pertains to and excludes all utility property that is not used for providing utility service, without regard for whether the property was so used in the past or might be so used in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">PUC argues further, however, that the \u201clegislative history\u201d of Measure 9 demonstrates that its concern, as communicated to the electorate, was exclusively with CWIP. PUC relies on <em>Lipscomb v. State Bd. of Higher Ed., </em>305 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>472, 753 P2d 939 (1988), for the proposition that ballot titles, voters\u2019 pamphlet explanations and statements and other artifacts of the electoral process may be consulted in determining the meaning of legislation enacted by the voters, even when the legislation that they have enacted is not ambiguous or susceptible to more than one plausible meaning. Assuming that that proposition in <em>Lipscomb </em>survives later Supreme Court decisions in the aftermath of <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), we do not find the history to be helpful to PUC. To whatever extent the materials that were presented to the voters tended to focus more on CWIP than other matters, the reason may have been similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s in <em>PP&amp;L </em>for using CWIP as its principal example: It was the \u201clargest type of property in the property-not-in-service category.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 53. In any event, the materials that the parties cite to us from the voters\u2019 pamphlet and other sources are not uniform in emphasizing CWIP to the exclusion of all else. It is also worthy of note that the explanation of the message in the voters\u2019 pamphlet, as described in PUC\u2019s brief, \u201cmerely parrots\u201d the wording of the measure itself. <em>See </em>1978 General Election Voters\u2019 Pamphlet 52. PUC draws the conclusion that the explanation therefore \u201cdoes not shed any light on the meaning of the phrase \u2018not presently used.\u2019 \u201d While that is certainly correct, the conclusion seems also to follow that the committee appointed to draft the explanation was of the view, as are we, that the meaning of that phrase and of the measure as a whole needed no illumination that the language of the measure itself did not provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">The \u201clegislative history\u201d is neither contrary to nor as clear as the language of the statute. We conclude that ORS 757.355 is applicable to retired utility facilities and plant, as it is to other utility property that is not currently used in connection with the provision of services. The remaining question is how that statute and ORS 757.140(2) apply in combination to the issues at hand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">PUC and PGE take the position that ORS 757.140(2) allows the agency to establish rates that include a return on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>a utility\u2019s undepreciated investment in retired assets, in addition to the recoupment of the undepreciated principal amount of the investment. They contend that, if ORS 757.355 applies at all and is to the contrary, ORS 757.140(2) prevails, because it is the later enacted statute and the one that applies more specifically to the reflection in a utility\u2019s rates of its investment in retired facilities. The opposing parties\u2019 arguments are essentially the mirror image of PUC\u2019s and PGE\u2019s. As exemplified by CUB\u2019s argument, their view is that ORS 757.140(2) does not by its own terms expressly allow a return on investment in retired plant and facilities, and that the two statutes can be harmonized by giving effect to both the specific prohibition in ORS 757.355 against a return <em>on </em>investment in unused property and the permissibility under ORS 757.140(2) of a return o/investment in facilities that are unused because of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">ORS 757.140(2) deals with rates for \u201cundepreciated investment\u201d in \u201ca utility plant, including\u201d retired facilities.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> PUC and PGE maintain that, by its own terms, that statute does not expressly preclude, and can and should be construed as authorizing, a return on as well as a return of the investment. They bolster that basic argument in a number of ways. For example, PUC points out that, under its standard practice and under \u201cstandard ratemaking theory,\u201d a utility may recover rates that include a rate of return on undepreciated investments \u201cfor active generating facilities.\u201d PUC and PGE also contend that, under the statutes, PGE could have been allowed to charge rates enabling it to recover the entire undepreciated investment in Trojan immediately or quickly, rather than rates that spread the recovery over the period from the present through 2011; hence, PGE is <em>ipso facto </em>entitled to \u201cinterest\u201d on what amounts to a deferred balance, as a matter of basic financial practice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> PUC and PGE conclude that, insofar as ORS 757.355 says anything to the contrary, the interpretive principles of \u201clater enactment\u201d and of specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>provisions prevailing over general ones require that the provisions of ORS 757.140(2) prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">CUB responds that, before resort to those principles is permissible, \u201cthe two statutes should be read together and harmonized, if possible, while giving effect to a consistent legislative policy.\u201d <em>Fairbanks v. Bureau of Labor and </em>Industries, 323 Or 88, 94, 913 P2d 703 (1996). We have already concluded that ORS 757.355 is applicable to retired facilities such as Trojan and so, of course, is ORS 757.140(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have also concluded that ORS 757.355 precludes public utilities from charging and PUC from approving exactly what PUC and PGE urge us to interpret ORS 757.140(2) as allowing\u2014 rates that include a return on a utility\u2019s investments in assets that are not being used for utility services to the ratepayers. ORS 757.140(2) contains no <em>express </em>language that contemplates a return or profit on undepreciated investment. Even assuming that the statute <em>could </em>be read in the way PUC and PGE do, it can at least as plausibly be read, by its own terms, as allowing only the rates necessary to compensate utilities for the principal amount of their undepreciated investment in their unused or retired property. To read it in the first way would be to construe it as conflicting with ORS 757.355. To read it in the second way would be to construe the two statutes harmoniously and consistently. We read it in the second way.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">PUC\u2019s and PGE\u2019s secondary arguments add no strength to their basic one. Assuming the correctness of PUC\u2019s practice of allowing a rate of return on undepreciated investment in active facilities, there is no analogy between that and the rate treatment for retired or otherwise unused facilities. ORS 757.355 does not preclude a return on a utility\u2019s investment in active facilities; it applies only to unused property.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Correspondingly, PUC\u2019s and PGE\u2019s arguments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>that turn on the word \u201cinterest\u201d instead of the term \u201crate of return\u201d also lose sight of ORS 757.355. That statute, as we interpret it, does not allow public utilities to obtain a profit from ratepayers on their investments in facilities that are not used to serve ratepayers. It makes no difference whether the profit is called \u201cinterest\u201d instead of a \u201creturn.\u201d We conclude that, read together, ORS 757.140(2) and ORS 757.355 allow only the principal amount of the undepreciated investment to be recovered through rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">PUC and PGE also argue that, whether or not we might read the statutes in the same way, we should defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of ORS 757.355 and ORS 757.140(2). PUC points to our statement in <em>Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. v. Katz, </em>116 Or App 302, 309 n 5, 841 P2d 652 (1929), <em>rev den </em>316 Or 528 (1993), that ORS 756.040 and other general empowering statutes have given PUC \u201cthe broadest authority \u2014 commensurate with that of the legislature itself \u2014 for the exercise of [its] regulatory function\u201d (quoting <em>Pacific N .W. Bell v. Sabin, </em>21 Or App 200, 214, 534 P2d 984, <em>rev den </em>(1975)). However, we added in <em>Katz </em>that, \u201c[o]f course, PUC\u2019s exercise of its authority is limited by the boundaries of the legislature\u2019s delegation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309 n 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\"> CUB contends, and we agree, that ORS 757.355 and ORS 757.140(2) are not \u201cdelegative\u201d statutes \u2014 the kind which carry with them the highest level of judicial deference in reviewing agency interpretations. <em>Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 621 P2d 547 (1980). Rather, the statutes reflect a \u201ccompleted legislative policy judgment,\u201d albeit one expressed in \u201cinexact terms,\u201d and we review the agency\u2019s statutory interpretation to ascertain whether it \u201ccoincides with the legislative policy which inheres in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Springfield, </em>290 Or at 224-25, 228. Ultimately, the meaning of the statutes under that standard of review is a question of law for the court to decide, after giving appropriate consideration and weight to the agency\u2019s interpretation. <em>See 1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC (Lane Co.), </em>305 Or 384, 388-92, 752 P2d 271(1988); see <em>also Springfield, </em>290 Or at 224. For the reasons we have given, we interpret ORS 757.355 and ORS 757.140(2) differently from the way the agency did, and the applicable standard of review does not require us to defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">However, in addition to the \u201cdeference\u201d facet of PUC\u2019s argument, there appears also to be a second point\u2014 that the scope of its authority to regulate rates, under ORS 756.040<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and other statutes that confer and define its general powers, give it the latitude to apply the specific statutory provisions here in the way that it did. CUB and the other parties opposing the orders take the opposite view, <em>i.e., </em>that where statutes containing specific provisions relating to rates are applicable, they control and narrow PUC\u2019s general authority in the specific circumstances to which they apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Somewhat ironically, the case that CUB cites that best supports its argument here is one where CUB made an argument similar to PUC\u2019s in this case and we agreed with the opposite view that PUC took there. In <em>Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Co. v. Eachus, </em>135 Or App 41, 898 P2d 774, <em>rev den </em>322 Or 193 (1995), PUC conducted an \u201cown motion\u201d proceeding, in which it concluded that the utility\u2019s existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>rates were generating excessive revenue and ordered it to reduce its rates effective at the beginning of 1990. CUB sought to have the existing rates declared \u201cinterim\u201d and, therefore, subject to customer refunds from the time the proceeding was initiated approximately one year before the order requiring the rate reduction was entered. PUC concluded that it lacked the authority to do what CUB sought. The circuit court affirmed and, on appeal, we affirmed in turn. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201cORS 756.040(1) authorizes PUC to protect ratepayers and the public \u2018from unjust exactions and practices and to obtain for them adequate service at fair and reasonable rates.\u2019 ORS 756.040(2) vests powers in the commission \u2018to do all things necessary and convenient\u2019 in the exercise of its jurisdiction. CUB contends that within those broad grants of authority to oversee ratemaking, the legislature has given to PUC the power to issue an order declaring existing rates to be interim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-5\">\u201cWe agree that the text of those statutes [is] broad enough to permit the type of order that CUB seeks. However, other provisions of the public utility statutes show that PUC\u2019s authority to declare rates to be interim and subject to refund is <em>circumscribed.\u201dId. </em>at 48-49.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">After discussing the other statutory provisions, we concluded that, notwithstanding the broad and general grant of rate-making authority under ORS 756.040, the specific statutes dealing with the process for establishing and changing rates, <em>e.g., </em>ORS 759.205, precluded PUC from taking the action that CUB desired. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Similarly, in this case, ORS 757.355 precludes PUC from allowing rates, of the kind its orders here would allow, that include a rate of return on capital assets that are not currently used for the provision of utility services; ORS 757.140(2) authorizes rates that would reimburse the utility for its principal investment in retired capital assets, but it does not authorize the return on the investment that ORS 757.355 proscribes. Like the specific statutes that \u201ccircumscribed\u201d PUC\u2019s authority in <em>Eachus, </em>ORS 757.355 and ORS 757.140(2) as we have interpreted them disallow the return component that the PUC orders allowed for PGE\u2019s investment in Trojan. The general grants of authority in ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>756.040 and other general statutes do not empower PGE to charge or PUC to approve rates of a kind that are specifically contrary to the limitations in ORS 757.355 and ORS 757.140(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">We have considered the parties\u2019 other assignments and arguments and either need not reach them or find them not to warrant further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Judgments in case numbers A86940 and A86973 reversed and remanded with instructions to remand orders to PUC for reconsideration; judgments in case numbers A92935 and A93400 affirmed on appeals and cross-appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\"> As PUC explains in its brief to us, the \u201clegal issue presented in these cases is less complicated than the [procedural] posture of the various cases would make it appear.\u201d PUC also offers the following helpful summary of the procedural posture:</p>\n<p id=\"Auo\">\u201cIn A86940, Citizens Utility Board (CUB) appeals from the judgment entered by Judge Barber in Marion Circuit Court No. 94C 10372. In A86973, the Utility Reform Project (URP) and Public Power Council (PPC) appeal from the judgment entered by Judge Barber in Marion County Circuit No. 94C 10417. Those two circuit court proceedings were reviews of PUC Orders No. 93-1117 and 93-1763 issued in the declaratory order (DP 10) proceeding. Both circuit court cases were consolidated at the trial level.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">\u201cIn A92.935, Portland General Electric (PGE) and the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (PUC) appeal from the judgment in Marion County No. 95C-11300, a circuit court review proceeding initiated by CUB. In A93400, PGE and PUC appeal from the judgment in Marion County No. 95C-12542, a circuit court review proceeding initiated by URP. Those two circuit court cases were reviews of PUC Order 95-322, which was rendered in the ratemaking proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">We add that, in our case number A93400, PUC has been designated a cross-appellant, and PGE a cross-respondent as well as an appellant, apparently because PGE\u2019s appeal from the judgment in question was filed before PUC\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">It would be more confusing than helpful to refer to the parties by their designations as parties rather than by their names or acronyms. In general terms, PUC, PGE and the <em>amicus </em>PacifiCorp agree with PUC\u2019s orders; the other parties do not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b741-10\"> The preexisting part of the statute, now codified as ORS 757.140(1), provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">\u201cEvery public utility shall carry a proper and adequate depreciation account. The commission shall ascertain and determine the proper and adequate rates of depreciation of the several classes of property of each public utility. The rates shall be such as will provide the amounts required over and above the expenses of maintenance, to keep such property in a state of efficiency corresponding to the progress of the industry. Each public utility shall conform its depreciation accounts to the rates so ascertained and determined by the commission. The commission may make changes in such rates of depreciation from time to time as the commission may find to be necessary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b745-6\"> As best we understand, the only party to suggest that OR 757.140(2) is not applicable at all is URP. We reject its arguments to that effect without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b746-5\"> Depreciation is treated as an operating expense for ratemaking purposes. However, ORS 757.140(2) is not concerned with depreciation, but with the undepreciated portion of a utility\u2019s investment in physical property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> The trial judge in the ratemaking case did not agree with the premise that the \u201cimmediate recovery\u201d of the entire amount was permissible, because \u201crate shock\u201d would have resulted. <em>See </em>ORS 756.040(1). That question is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\"> The parties apprise us that 1989 Senate Bill 78, which was ultimately enacted as ORS 757.140(2), at one point contained the introductory clause, \u2018Tnlotwithstanding the provisions of ORS 757.355.\u201d Although legislative history plays no role in our decision, we do note that the clause demonstrates that the legislature was actually \u2014 as well as presumptively \u2014 aware of ORS 757.355 at the time it adopted ORS 757.140(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b747-12\"> CUB also bases its argument on the phrase in ORS 757.140(2) that allows the inclusion in rates of \u201camounts on the utility\u2019s books of account which TPUC] finds represent undepreciated investment in a utility plantf.1\u201d CUB asserts that \u201cftlhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>are no amounts on a utility\u2019s books of account representing a \u2018rate of return,\u2019 \u201d as distinct from the \u201cundepreciated investment itself.\u201d <em>See </em>OAR 806-27-045(1); 18 CFR Part 101. Hence, CUB concludes that a return component cannot qualify for inclusion in rates under ORS 757.140(2) because such a component cannot be reflected in the books of account.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">We need not reach that argument to decide this case. It is sufficient here to hold that, reading ORS 757.355 and ORS 757.140(2) together, the rates may not include a return component on undepreciated investment in retired or otherwise unused property. The argument discussed in this footnote, if correct, might bear on whether a return component may be included under ORS 757.140(2) for a utility\u2019s actively used facilities to which ORS 757.355 does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b749-6\"> That statute provides, as material:</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\u201c(1) In addition to the powers and duties now or hereafter transferred to or vested in the Public Utility Commission, the commission shall represent the customers of any public utility or telecommunications utility and the public generally in all controversies respecting rates, valuations, service and all matters of which the commission has jurisdiction.
