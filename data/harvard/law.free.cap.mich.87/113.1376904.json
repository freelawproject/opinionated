Under the charter, the cost of street improvements is paid by special or i local assessments levied upon the property benefited, and the validity of these assessments depends upon the strict conformity to law with which all the preliminary steps are taken. Among these preliminary steps, none is more important than those required to be taken by the board of public works; and surely the determination of the kind and quantity of material to be used in improving a street is as essential to a valid assessment as any act required of the board. If, then, this act of determination by the board is essential to the validity of a tax, it is a duty the performance of which is imperative. It cannot be avoided by the board, nor can it be delegated to or assumed by any other body or \u25a0 individual; citing <em>Baisch v. City of Grand Rapids, </em>84 Mich. 666.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-11\">2. In the case at bar the council declared the grading and graveling of the designated portion of Grandville avenue, with vertical stone curb and paved gutters, a necessary public improvement. Here the kind of material to be used is determined by the council, and nothing is left to the board but to adopt and record that determination as its own. This is a usurpation of the functions of the board, and a violation of the clear intent of the law.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b166-13\">McGrath, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvQ\">Relator asks for writs of <em>mandamus </em>to compel respondent to proceed with the work of certain pavements in the city of Grand Rapids.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Under the charter of the city of Grand Rapids, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>abutting owner pays tbe cost and expense of all paving.

The paving, grading, graveling, planking, or covering with other materials, of all streets, highways, .alleys, lanes, sidewalks, and other public places, the building and construction of all sewers, drains, culverts, .arches, and bridges, wells, and reservoirs, and the erection of public buildings and works, which the common \u25a0council shall by resolution declare to be necessary improvements, shall be done under the direction and supervision of the board of public works, and upon contracts and under plans and specifications to be prepared by the city surveyor, and approved by such board; and all moneys raised or appropriated by the common council for \u25a0such purposes shall be expended by said board of public works for the purposes designed, so far as shall be necessary, and to be drawn from time to time from the appropriate fund, by order of the council, upon \u25a0estimates of amounts earned or payable, to be made by the board and reported to the council in accordance with such contract, and no money shall be drawn from the city treasury under this act except upon the order of the common council.

These petitions were referred to the proper \u25a0committee, who reported thereon. The board of public works furnished to the common council the required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>estimates, and the common council adopted the following-resolutions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">\u201cResolved, by the common council of the city of Grand Eapids, that the grading and graveling of Grandville avenue, a public street in the city of Grand Eapids, from the center line of Bartlett street, a public street in said-city, to the north line of Hall street, a public street in-said city, including the construction of a vertical stone-curb in said described portion of said Grandville avenue, and also including the construction of the necessary bridges, culverts, paved gutters, cross-walks, man-holes, catch-basins, approaches, and cess-pools in said described portion of said Grandville avenue, is a necessary public-improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\"><em>\u201cResolved, </em>by the common council of the city of Grand Eapids, that the grading and paving with cobble-stones of Brie street, a public street in the city of Grand Eapids, from Canal street, a public street in said city, to-Bank street, a public street in said city, including the-construction of a vertical Medina stone curb in said described portion of said Erie street, and also including the construction of the necessary bridges, culverts, gutters, cross-walks, man-holes, catch-basins, approaches, and cess-pools in said described portion of said Erie street, is a necessary improvement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The board of public works declined to proceed with the work, saying in the Grandville avenue case that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">\u201cGrandville avenue is one of the most important, thoroughfares in the city of Grand Eapids, the travel upon which is continuous and heavy. The material prescribed in the resolution for the improvement of this street (especially from Bartlett street to Fifth avenue, the portion of said avenue in which the water-mains are laid, and is sewered) is not, in the judgment of the board of public works, such as the importance of the work demands; and, as the board is the judge of material to be used in the improvement of streets, we respectfully decline to proceed with the work under the resolution above mentioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">In the Erie street case it was said that\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u201cThe determination of the kind and quality of material to be used in paving streets belongs to the board of public works. At a meeting of said board held Saturday, May 16, 1891, it was decided not to proceed further with said improvement under the resolution above referred to, as the materials prescribed are not, in the judgment of the board, such as the improvement requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">It was the evident intention of the Legislature to provide a way in which resident owners of property could procure the pavement of streets, to afford the best measure of protection to such owners against unwarranted burdens, and to provide a way in which streets could be improved without the concurrence of the resident owners if the necessities of any particular case demanded such improvement. Clearly, the intention was to prevent the common council from imposing a burden upon the owners without the consent of such owners, unless by a five-sixth vote of the aldermen elect. It will not be seriously urged, if the protection of the owners against, burdens which they did not care to assume was the purpose of the restriction upon the powers of the council, that, in case the owners petitioned for a certain kind of pavement, the council could impose a different and more-expensive pavement upon them, without the necessary five-sixths vote. Inasmuch as the council has the right, in its discretion, to refuse to grant the - prayer of the-petition, the public is protected. It was clearly not the intention of the Legislature to afford a way in which owners could procure the improvement of the streets in front of their property, through the common council, and then to empower the board of public works to block the improvement, and force the common council ta declare some other kind of pavement a public necessity.. Nor was it the intention of the Legislature to empower-the board of public works arbitrarily to determine the .general character of public improvements. It is difficult <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>to imagine how the common council could intelligently declare a work to be a necessary improve\u2019ment without any reference to the general character of such work. The same provisions apply to all public improvements. A resolution declaring that a city hall, an engine-house, a police station, or a sewer was a necessary improvement, without referring to cost, size, capacity, or general character, would not satisfy even the letter of the charter. These considerations must enter into the determination \u25a0of the question of the necessity. A building of given dimensions might be inadequate for one locality, and be too large for another; and to allow the board of. public works to determine either question would practically empower that body to determine the question of \u25a0 the .necessity of the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">It is unquestionably the duty of the council to avail itself of whatever information or knowledge the board of public works possesses, but the authority for these expenditures must originate with the common council, and that authority includes the.right to determine the question of cost, dimensions, and general character. If the board has the power to defeat the expressed will of the property-owners, and the determination of a majority of the council, because it does not consider the pavement adequate, then it may defeat the determination arrived at by a live-sixths vote. The Legislature did not intend to vest this power in the board of public works, even though it <em>The </em>conceded that the Legislature could divest the council of such power. The authority to determine the \u201cparticular kind and quantity of materials\u201d has reference to .detail, and not to the general character of the work. The \u25a0use of the word \u201cparticular\u201d in that connection is sig'nificant, and the evident intention of the Legislature was to empower the board of public works to provide detail where the same was necessary. If the owners should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>petition for a cedar block paveruent, and the common council-should grant their prayer, the specifications therefor would necessarily involve \u2022 detail as to soundness, diameter, and length of blocks. It will not be insisted that the board might substitute oak or pine for cedar. If a sand foundation was suggested, they could not substitute concrete, although they might name the particular kind of sand. It does not follow that, because they .are empowered to determine the particular kind of material, they may change the character of the work, or any substantial element of it. The size of the cobble-stone in the Brie-street case affected materially the character of the pavement, and the selection of Medina stone was as much a matter of discretion as the selection of Ionia or Lake Superior stone for a public building would have been, and the selection of either would involve detail as to size, facing, setting, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">The writs must issue as prayed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
