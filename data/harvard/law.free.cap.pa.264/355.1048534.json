Before Gtjmmey, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-5\">Prom the record it appeared that John M. Schwehm died leaving a will by which he gave his residuary estate to his two sons, Harry J. Schwehm and Ernest Schwehm, and his daughter, Anna E. Schadewald, in equal shares, but directed that the share Of the daughter should be held on a separate use trust. The two sons and Julius C. Levi were appointed executors. The daughter contested the will. After a large amount of testimony had been taken in the contest over the will, an agreement was made between the parties that, in consideration of the contestant withdrawing the caveat and stopping the proceedings, she should receive a certain portion of the residuary estate absolutely. Julius C. Levi as an executor signed an approval of the settlement. The auditing judge held that the settlement was void and directed distribution in accordance with the will. Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed by the court. Anna E. Schadewald appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b388-6\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to the adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-7\"><em>Francis G.
