In her lifetime she executed a deed to Frances Stark Hungerford of all her interest and estate that she had received by virtue of her father\u2019s will. The court dismissed the petition, holding that Georgianna took a fee in the estate, which by her deed passed to Frances Stark Hungerford.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-6\"><em>diaries E.

His provision that if she should die \u201cleaving no issue of her body living at her death,\u201d then over to certain named persons, was not a limitation or curtailment of the devise, but simply alternative or substitutionary and to take effect only on the death of the daughter in his lifetime: Mickley\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 514; Morrison v. Truby, 145 Pa. 540; McAlpin\u2019s Est., 211 Pa. 26.
