Rep. 1110.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b561-5\">Even were it necessary for the plaintiffs to aver that the larger part, in value, of the decedent\u2019s real estate is situated in Philadelphia County, such averment in the amendment is to be regarded as a part of the bill in equity, and relates back to the filing of the said bill: Hanbest\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. Dist. Rep. 681; Rochester Borough v. Kennedy, 229 Pa. 251; Joynes v. Penna. R. R. Co., 234 Pa. 321; Dick\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 589.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AFv\">April 28,1919:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A4L\">Mr. Justice Moschzisker,</author>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Adam A. Catanach had his homestead in Chester County, where he died, and where his will was probated; May 28, 1918, plaintiffs filed a bill in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia praying partition of decedent\u2019s lands, situate in both counties. The bill contained no averment that \u201cthe larger part of the estate in value\u201d is located within the ordinary geographic jurisdictional limits of the court below, although such condition of fact is required by Section 1 of the Act of February 20, 1854, P. L. 89, in order to vest \u201cpower\u201d in that tribunal \u201cto entertain suits and proceedings......at law or in equity...... for the partition of real estate\u201d lying in \u201cone or more counties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>A general unrestricted appearance was entered for some of the defendants on June 20, 1918, and, on August 8, 1918, for the others. August 12, 1918, defendants demurred, alleging a lack of jurisdiction in the court below, because of the absence of the beforementioned averment. August 23, 1918, plaintiffs, by leave, amended their bill, inserting the words \u201cthe larger part in value of the estate of the said Adam A. Catanach, deceased, is, and was at the time of the death of said Adam A. Catanach, situate in the County of Philadelphia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Subsequently, defendants answered, averring, inter alia, that, between the filing of the bill and the date of the amendment, they had presented their petition to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Chester County, praying partition of the same lands described by plaintiffs; that, since the bill in the court below lacked an essential jurisdictional averment at the date of the commencement of defendants\u2019 proceedings, July 29, 1918, there was, at that time, no valid prior action pending for the partition of such lands, and, therefore, their petition took precedence of plaintiffs\u2019 bill, in effect ousting the latter\u2019s suit. The court below overruled this contention by granting \u201cjudgment for plaintiffs with leave to proceed\u201d; and, when the case came to hearing, ordered partition. Defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">All parties in interest agreed upon findings of fact, but each side submitted requests for conclusions of law, plaintiffs\u2019 being affirmed and defendants\u2019 refused. The latter requests, however, raised only the question of jurisdiction already indicated; and that is the sole point pressed on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The description of the properties contained in plaintiffs\u2019 bill plainly indicates the fact, subsequently inserted by amendment and found by the chancellor, that the larger part in value of decedent\u2019s real estate is situated in Philadelphia County; which was at no time denied by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The court below had jurisdiction in partition (Act of July 7, 1885, P. L. 257, 3 Purd. 3414, par. 28; Doyle v. Brundred, 189 Pa. 113, 119; Brown\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 457, 458; Sheridan v. Sheridan et al., 136 Pa. 14,20), and the amendment neither changed the cause of action (Wilhelm\u2019s App., 79 Pa. 120, 134-6; Aultman\u2019s App., 98 Pa. 505, 514; Rochester Boro. v. Kennedy, 229 Pa. 251, 273; Joynes v. Penna. R. R., 234 Pa. 321, 327), nor in any substantial sense prejudiced defendants (Dick\u2019s App., 106 Pa. 589, 596; Horwitz v. Wohlmuth, 66 Pa. Superior Ct, 321, 324; Shlifer v. Bergdoll, 69 Pa. Superior Ct. 86, 89) ; hence, when made, it became part of the bill, to all intents and purposes, as if originally inserted therein (Wilhelm\u2019s App. and Dick\u2019s App., supra; B. &amp; O. R. R. y. McLaughlin, 73 Fed. 519, 521, and 43 U. S. App., 181, 187, opinion by Taft, J.; 1 Ency. Pl. &amp; Pr. 491-2); and the fact that, after the date of the institution of plaintiffs\u2019 proceedings, defendants went into the Orphans\u2019 Court of Chester County for partition of the same lands, can in no way oust or affect the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas of Philadelphia, which had previously attached : Sprigg v. Com., T. T. &amp; T. Co., 206 Pa. 548, 555; Jones v. Lincoln S. &amp; T. Co., 222 Pa. 325, 326; opinion of Penrose, J., in Hanbest\u2019s Est., 6 Pa. Dist. R. 681; Finch v. Smith, 146 Ala. 644, 651-2; see also numerous cases cited in 15 Corpus Juris 1134, sec. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-3\">Aside from defendants\u2019 attack on the pleadings, it must be admitted that, from every aspect, the court below had jurisdiction both of the subject-matter, and, by general unrestricted appearance, of the several defendants (McCullough v. Ry. Mail Assn., 225 Pa. 118, 123-4; Swecker v. Reynolds, 246 Pa. 197, 201-2) ; with this in mind, the correctness of the rulings hereinbefore made becomes apparent; especially if, for a moment we look at the present proceeding as though it were a common law action, commenced by summons, and consider that, under such circumstances, the absence from the declaration of the averment in question would not constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>reason for quashing the writ, or ousting the suit, but, at most, is a mere matter of amendment. Neither the fact nor the law is changed because the action was commenced in equity. Defendants\u2019 objection, in substance, simply goes to the manner in which plaintiffs\u2019 declaration is drawn, not to the validity of their suit, and, as just said, this may be amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">In 21 R. C. L. 579, it is stated, \u201cAmendments...... may relate to the correction of mistakes in pleadings; [including the] insertion of jurisdictional averments where these are necessary.\u201d Had the court below, either in fact or law, lacked jurisdiction of the subject-matter, a general appearance for defendants could have had no effect (Com. v. Barnett, 199 Pa. 161, 177; Lewisburg B. Co. v. Union County, 232 Pa. 255, 262; Simpson\u2019s Est., 253 Pa. 217, 225), and, of course, the amendment in question would have been of no avail; but, under the circumstances in this case, while, perhaps, defendants might insist upon the insertion in plaintiffs\u2019 bill of the present, so called, jurisdictional averment, and subsequent proof thereof, yet, after a general appearance, they were not in a position to enter pleas in bar to the suit upon the ground of a lack of such averment, which is practically what was attempted. Schenley v. Allegheny, 36 Pa. 29, 54, and Com. v. Barnett, supra, 178, touch upon the last point.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We conclude that, even if the averment under discussion be classed as necessary (which plaintiffs deny), it was one which, on the facts before us, could be inserted by amendment, notwithstanding the protest of defendants, and the court below did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The assignments are all overruled and the decree is affirmed at the cost of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
