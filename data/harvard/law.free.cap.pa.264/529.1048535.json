Under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2,1915, P. L. 736, an injury resulting in death, need not arise out of or be due to, the workmen\u2019s employment; it is sufficient if it happens in course thereof.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-5\">2. Where a workman dies in the course of his employment from a rupture of the aorta caused by \u201can extra effort in vomiting,\u201d the rupture itself would constitute an accidental violence to the physical structure of the body within the broad meaning of that term as defined by the courts.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-6\">3. If death comes during the course of employment, in an ordinary way natural to the progress of a disease with which one is afflicted, and with which he was stricken before the accident, there can be no recovery; but if the death is brought about by an injury due to some mishap, or accident, happening during the course of his employment, the fact that deceased had a chronic .ailment which rendered him more susceptible to such an injury than an ordinary person would be, will not defeat the right to compensation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-7\">4. Where a referee finds that a miner died in the course of his employment, from a rupture of the aorta \u201ccaused by an extra effort in vomiting,\u201d such finding will support an award in favor of the claimant, and it cannot be set aside by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Hoard, without a hearing de novo.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b565-8\">5. In such a case the question is not as to the existence of evidence, which in the opinion of the board would justify it in connecting the vomiting with the death, but was there any evidence which, within the bounds of reason, possibly could be held to sustain the referee\u2019s findings connecting the vomiting with the death ? If such evidence appeared, then, albeit the board, on a hearing de novo, might draw other inferences therefrom, and reach conclusions differing from those upon the record before it, yet, in the absence of such a hearing, it was beyond the power of that body so to do; and on the pending appeal, it was likewise beyond its power to reverse the referee on the theory that he had erred, as a matter of law, in drawing deductions from the testimony differing from those which could have been made by the board.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b565-9\">Argued April 14,1919.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Al_\">Appeal, No. 296, Jan.

The board decided there was no such evidence; and, therefore, set aside the referee\u2019s compensation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">We say the appeal was classed as involving a question of law, and not of fact, because the referee was reversed without a hearing de novo, such a hearing being essential whenever the intention is to disturb findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>(McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312, 318-19); but, notwithstanding this classification, when considering the report of the referee, instead of merely searching to see if there was any evidence capable of sustaining that official\u2019s findings of fact, the board substituted its own inferences and deductions for those already upon the record; which, on such a review, it lacked power to do: McCauley v. Imperial Co., supra, page 319; Dainty v. Jones &amp; L. S. Co., 263 Pa. 109, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">As some explanation of the erroneous course thus pursued, the report of the board indicates a fundamentally wrong idea of its powers and duties. For instance, it is there stated: \u201c[1] We have no evidence that will justify us in connecting the vomiting with the death, nor [2] the burnt clothing with the vomiting\u201d; whereas, on the appeal then pending, neither was a proper test to be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We shall consider the second test first. Under the Pennsylvania statute (Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736) the injury need not arise out of, or be due to, the person\u2019s employment, it is sufficient if it happens in the course thereof: Lane v. Horn &amp; Hardart Baking Co., 261 Pa. 329, 335. Here, concededly, Clark died in the course of his employment, but the question is, did he meet death as a result of accidental \u201cviolence to the physical structure of the body\u201d? McCauley v. Imperial Co., supra, p. 327. Irrespective of anterior causes, if the vomiting took place and this \u201cextra effort\u201d caused the rupture of the aorta, these facts were sufficient to entitle the claimant to compensation, and it was not essential that the \u201cburnt clothing\u201d should be connected with the vomiting. In other words, the rupture itself, occurring from \u201cextra effort in vomiting,\u201d would, under the circumstances, constitute accidental violence to the physical structure of the body, within the broad meaning of that term as heretofore defined by us: McCauley v. Imperial Co., supra, p. 326-7; Lane v. Horn &amp; Hardart Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>In addition to the error just discussed, which is typical of others of a like character, the report of the board strongly suggests a mistaken view of the law relative to the bearing upon the case of Clark\u2019s diseased condition, prior to and at the time of the vomiting which brought on the rupture resulting in his death; while the fact that he suffered from a malady which, in time, might have terminated fatally, called for consideration, it was in no sense controlling. If death comes, during the course of employment, in an ordinary way, natural to the progress of a disease with which one is afflicted, and with which he was smitten before the accident, there can be no recovery (McCauley v. Imperial Co., supra, 327; Lane v. Horn &amp; Hardart Co., supra, 333); but, if the demise is brought about by an injury due to some mishap, or accident, happening during the course of his employment, the fact that deceased had a chronic ailment which rendered him more susceptible to such injury than an ordinary person would be, will not defeat the right to compensation. Upon this subject see Bradbury\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (3d ed.), 326 to 340, where a general discussion will be found citing many cases illustrative of the trend of judicial opinion, which supports the law as we have stated it, \u2014 among others, Madden\u2019s Case, 222 Mass. 487, 494. Certain of the cases cited are governed by statutes which differ somewhat in legislative language from the Pennsylvania act; but in no instance is this difference of a character to affect the relevancy of the decision, so far as it involves the point now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\">All of which brings us to a consideration of the first test (supra) applied in examining the referee\u2019s findings and the testimony relating to the cause of Clark\u2019s death. At this point the board mistook its powers and duties as an appellate tribunal, and thereby fell into material error. The question was not as to the existence of evidence which, in the opinion of the reviewing body, would \u201cjustify\u201d it \u201cin connecting the vomiting with the death,\u201d but, was there any evidence which, within the bounds of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>reason, possibly could be held to sustain tbe referee\u2019s findings connecting tbe vomiting and death? If such evidence appeared (and the referee\u2019s findings indicate it did), then, albeit the board, on a hearing de novo, might draw other inferences therefrom and reach conclusions differing from those upon the record before it, yet, in the absence of such a hearing, it was beyond the power of that body so to do; and, on the then pending appeal, it was likewise beyond its power to reverse the referee on the theory that he had erred, as a matter of law, in drawing deductions from the testimony different from those which would have been made by the board; this, nevertheless, is, in effect, what the latter undertook to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Therefore, the conclusions of law, pretending to assert a lack of evidence to sustain the findings of the referee, having been arrived at through an examination that ignored the controlling rules which should have guided the board, cannot stand; and the only findings of fact properly before us are those of the referee. In the absence of correctly derived conclusions of law to overcome these findings, they are decisive (McCauley v. Imperial Co., supra, p. 329); thereon claimant is entitled to compensation, and the board erred in deciding otherwise, as did the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The judgment of the common pleas and the order of the compensation board are both reversed; the award of the referee is reinstated and affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
