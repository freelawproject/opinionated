R. 933].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-12\">A perusal of the codicil fails to disclose any condition; on the contrary, it appears that there is an absolute reduction of the amount of the legacy. It was the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tatrix\u2019s right to give what she pleased and the fact that she may have been mistaken in her figures cannot affect the fact that she did reduce the legacy- without qualification.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-4\">For these reasons and for the reasons given by the auditing judge in his adjudication, the exceptions are dismissed and the adjudication confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-6\"><em>Ulysses S.
