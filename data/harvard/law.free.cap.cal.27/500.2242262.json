H. Chandler and J. Saunders, of the value of more than fifty dollars; said property consisting of * *\u2022 * ,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b501-6\">The defendant was convicted, and appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-7\"><em>A. S. Higgins, </em>for Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-8\">The indictment does not charge that the defendant took the horse, alleged to have been stolen, with a felonious intent. The offense consists in the intent. Is the intent to be presumed from the mere taking, or must it be distinctly charged ?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b501-9\"><em>J. G. McCullough, Attorney-General, </em>for the People.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b501-10\">The indictment is sufficient. \u201c Feloniously \u201d implies the intent. (Wharton\u2019s Precedents of Indictments, 190 ; Wood\u2019s Dig. 337, Sec. 60; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>25 Cal. 531.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b501-11\">By the Court, Sanderson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b501-12\">The demurrer to the indictment was properly overruled. The charging part is in the following words: \u201cDid feloniously, wilfully and unlawfully, and with force and arms, steal, take, carry, lead and drive away,\u201d etc., which is not only a sufficient statement of the intent with which the taking was done, under our statute, but also at common law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>21 Cal. 403 ; Wharton\u2019s Precedents, 190.)</p>\n<p id=\"b501-13\">We cannot reverse the judgment on the ground that the verdict is contrary to the evidence. Disregarding the testimony offered by the defendant for the purpose of proving an <em>alibi </em>(which the jury manifestly did not believe), we are not prepared to say that the evidence does not sustain the verdict. In <em>The People </em>v. <em>Ah Loy, </em>10 Cal. 301, the Court said: \u201c It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>requires a clear case\u2014one in which there is an absence of evidence against the prisoner, or a decided preponderance of evidence in his favor\u2014to justify an interference with the verdict of the jury.\u201d We think this is one of those cases in which <em>the </em>verdict, whether guilty or <em>not </em>guilty, ought not <em>to he </em>disturbed by this Court. The Court below refused a new trial, and that Court could better judge of the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
