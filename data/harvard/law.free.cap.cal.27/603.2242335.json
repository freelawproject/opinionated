We are unable to see a reason for a different rule in actions at law. Possession and the Statute of Limitations were made issues by defendant in this case, and we had a right to bring ourselves within the statute, and to show our possession by showing that Hawkins held as mortgagee. If in doing this it becomes necessary to prove for what purpose a writing was given, we have unquestionably the right to make the proof. True, the written instrument best proves its contents; nor do we seek to change or disturb the wording of the instrument, or its meaning\u2014but we asked' to show for what purpose it was given.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b605-10\"><em>Creed Ilaymond, </em>for Respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b605-11\">By the Court, Sawyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Plaintiff introduced in evidence an instrument in writing executed by James H. Bartlett, dated May 13, 1856, purporting to transfer to George Raskt &amp; Co. \u201call my (his) right, title and interest in the claims\u201d in dispute, \u201cin consideration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>the sum of two hundred and two dollars and sixty-five cents, with interest from date till paid by me.\u201d Also, a note given by said Bartlett to said Raskt &amp; Co., bearing the same date, for the sum of two hundred and two dollars and sixty-five cents, payable on demand with interest until paid, at three per cent per month. He then offered-to prove by Bartlett, that, the said instrument transferring said claims was intended by the parties to be a mortgage to secure the payment of said note. Upon objection of defendant the testimony was excluded by the Court, and exception taken to the ruling by plaintiff. The ground of the objection, is, that the evidence is irrelevant, and that it is inadmissible to show by parol that the instrument was intended as a mortgage. The testimony is relevant; and it is now settled in this State that parol evidence is admissible to show that a deed absolute on its face was intended to be a mortgage. <em>{Pierce </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>13 Cal. 116 ; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>15 Cal. 291.) Nor can the rule be confined to cases that formerly were cognizable in equity alone. There is but one form of action in this State, and the same rules of evidence must be applied alike to all cases. It may be that formerly the rule prevailed only in cases in equity. But, however that may be, there is no distinction in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Section two </em>hundred <em>and sixty </em>of the Practice Act provides, that, \u201ca mortgage of real property shall not be deemed a conveyance, whatever its terms, so as to enable the owner of the mortgage to recover possession of the real property without foreclosure and sale.\u201d If the rule contended for by the respondent prevailed, this provision of the statute would be nugatory, for the reason that when the mortgage is in its terms an absolute conveyance, the mortgagor would be prohibited from showing the real character of the transaction. The position contended for by the respondent would resolve the question into one of pleading, rather than a question as to the competency of evidence. But there is no equitable title to be set up. The plaintiff, if he has any title at all, has a legal title. A mortgage under our system, as between the parties, does not pass the legal title to the grantee. The title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>remains in the mortgagor until it is divested by a foreclosure and sale, whatever the terms of the mortgage may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">There was error in excluding the testimony, and as we cannot know but that the Court might have come to a different conclusion and decision, had the testimony been admitted, there must be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The order denying a new trial is reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
