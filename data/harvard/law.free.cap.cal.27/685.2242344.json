October 19th, plaintiff\u2019s attorney filed and served on defendant Pestner\u2019s attorney, the following notice :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-14\">\u201c Please take notice, that the plaintiff intends to move the Court to set aside the judgment of nonsuit herein, and for a judgment against both of the defendants, and that the proposed statement of the case, upon which said motion will be made, is herewith served upon you.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b686-15\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorney, on the same day, filed and served a statement embodying the evidence and rulings of the Court, with his exceptions thereto.

Plaintiff then moved the Court to be allowed to amend his statement by inserting the specification of grounds upon which he would rely, but the Court denied the same May 2, 1864. June 29, 1864, on motion of the attorney for defendant Pestner, an order was made striking the statement from the files of the Court. July 2d plaintiff\u2019s attorney moved the Court to sign the statement as the settled statement of the case, which was denied July 11th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b687-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b687-7\"><em>Wm.

Hone are contemplated nor provided for in the statute. A motion to set aside a nonsuit, and for judgment <em>non obstante veredicto, </em>may, I conceive, be made without asking for a new trial, and such a motion may be granted without a new trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b687-9\">The Court ought to have allowed an amendment of the statement, if an amendment be deemed necessary; and the order denying the motion is not discretionary merely. It is a matter of right, and is appealable. It is an order subsequent to judgment, and authorized by statute to be reviewed by appellate Court. Transcripts have been sent back to lower Court to allow statements to be amended, restated, and reformed. <em>(Powell </em>v. <em>Waters, </em>8 Cow. 55 ; <em>Codwise </em>v. <em>Hecker, </em>1 Cain, 74; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>7 How.

That method is simple and straightforward, and, in our judgment, was intended to exclude all others. If the plaintiff desired to have the nonsuit entered against him investigated upon its merits in the District Court, he should have moved for a new tidal upon a statement; or if he preferred to bring the case to this Court directly, he could have done so by an appeal from the judgment aided by a statement annexed to the roll. There is a statement in the transcript but it does not purport to be a statement on appeal from the judgment. The result is that the Court did not err in refusing its- sanction to a method of reviewing decisions made in the course of a trial, altogether unknown to our system.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">The jdaintiff has not only appealed from the judgment in favor of Pestner, but also from an order overruling a motion to retax the costs. The memorandum of costs was duly filed October 17, 1863 ; the notice of motion to retax was served June 20, 1864, and the order denying the motion was made on the twenty-seventh of that month. The judgment was entered July 18, 1864. The order appealed from is not in itself appealable, inasmuch as it was not made after final judgment. The proper course would have been to appeal from the judgment\u2014raising the question of the correctness of the taxation by a statement annexed to the judgment roll. (Practice Act, Sec. 344.) We cannot approach the alleged error through an appeal from a non-appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
