Doc. 197 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 8. Up to sixty members of the public can register to speak at any given meeting, with registration conducted on a first-come, first-served basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Each speaker has two minutes to address the Board.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The \"vast majority\" of speakers express disapproval of the Board and its decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Board's Public Participation Guidelines govern the conduct of those who attend Board meetings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11. At all relevant times, the Guidelines provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Courteous, respectful and civil behavior is expected from all speakers and all persons attending a Board meeting. Unsolicited comments and disruptive behavior are prohibited. Individuals who are disruptive may be given a warning and also, may, if necessary be removed from the meeting. If any individual is removed from a meeting as a result of disruptive behavior, then the individual may forfeit their right of reentry to future Chicago Board of Education meetings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   \"Disruptive behavior\" includes an attendee's walking up to, shaking a fist at, or yelling at Board members; it also includes a speaker's refusal to stop speaking after her allotted two minutes have elapsed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Board does not always bar individuals who engage in disruptive behavior from attending future meetings. For example, a woman named Queen Sister spoke for more than two minutes at a Board meeting and continued shouting her opinions after she left the podium, but was not removed or banned from attending future meetings. Doc. 196 at \u00b6\u00b6 50-51. Still, the Board has barred at least three individuals (other than Vega) from attending meetings due to their disruptive behavior: (1) Ramos, Vega's co-plaintiff, who was banned \"until future notice\" after the July 2014 meeting; (2) Ronald Jackson, who was banned for nine meetings following a verbal and physical altercation at the November 2013 meeting; and (3) Ellyson Carter, who was banned for fourteen meetings after verbally threatening a Board employee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Vega has attended twelve to fifteen Board meetings. Doc. 197 at \u00b6 9. The Board was aware of this fact, and Board employees sent emails or texts noting her presence during meetings. Doc. 196 at \u00b6 53. Vega violated the Guidelines at several meetings. At the March 2014 meeting, she continued to speak after her allotted time had expired and was ushered away from the podium.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23; Doc. 197 at \u00b6 22. Two months later, at the May 2014 meeting, Vega told the Board while at the podium that she would \"get kicked out of the Board meeting every month for two minutes for the next how many years you got of life.\" Doc. 197 at \u00b6 23. She then exceeded her speaking time, continued to speak after being asked to stop, and was escorted out of the meeting.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the July 2014 meeting, while Vega was waiting to speak, one speaker likened the Board to a plantation master, and Queen Sister then referred to the Board as \"deceivers,\" \"great pretenders,\" \"the devil incarnate,\" \"Mr. Moneybags,\" \"snakes,\" \"liars,\" \"thieves,\" and \"blood thirsty.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. While Queen Sister was speaking, one Board member, Jesse\n   Ruiz, stood and began to exit because he needed to use the restroom.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. Vega rose from her chair, rushed toward the dais where the Board members were sitting, shook her fist, and yelled \"BOOOOO! COWARD! COWARD!,\" interrupting Queen Sister.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18; Doc. 196 at \u00b6 27. (Plaintiffs assert in their Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) statement that Vega \"walked toward the front of the room,\" Doc. 196 at \u00b6 27, but they admit Defendants' assertion that she \"rushed toward the dais,\" Doc. 197 at \u00b6 18, and they will be held to that admission. Plaintiffs also assert that Vega \"shook her fist,\" Doc. 196 at \u00b6 27, and they will be held to that assertion as well.) Reggie Williams, the Board's Deputy Director of Safety and Security, believed that Vega posed an immediate threat to Queen Sister and the Board, Doc. 197 at \u00b6 19, and several security officers moved towards her immediately after she began approaching the dais, Doc. 198 at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When Vega returned to her seat, Williams and other security officers asked her to leave. Doc. 197 at \u00b6 20. Vega responded, \"no, I have a right to speak,\" and repeatedly refused to leave.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   Vega was informed that she would be escorted out if she did not leave voluntarily. Doc. 198 at \u00b6 32. Ramos, who was seated nearby, stated that the pair would not leave. Doc. 197 at \u00b6 20; Doc. 198 at \u00b6\u00b6 35-36. Everyone began \"shouting and talking,\" and Ramos engaged in a physical struggle with security officers, after which he and Vega were physically removed by several officers. Doc. 197 at \u00b6 20; Doc. 198 at \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 1, 2014, the Board sent Vega a letter stating that she had forfeited her right to attend future Board meetings until further notice. Doc. 196 at \u00b6 33; Doc. 197 at \u00b6 26. Although barred from attending Board meetings, Vega still could submit written testimony to the Board and make appointments to meet with Board members during their office hours. Doc. 197 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. (Vega asserts that she intended to direct her speech \"to the wider audience of the public and residents of Chicago who either attended the board meetings or viewed the Board Meetings online,\" and that the ban on her attending meetings impacted her ability to do so. Doc. 207 at \u00b6 60. That assertion is disregarded. The sole evidence Plaintiffs cite is a letter from another individual expressing her appreciation for Vega's comments during Board meetings, Doc. 197-7, which does not bear on the question whether\n   <em>\n    Vega\n   </em>\n   intended to direct her speech to other attendees at, or online viewers of, Board meetings.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 7, 2017-more than 2\u00bd years after the Board barred her from attending Board meetings-the Board lifted the ban. Doc. 196 at \u00b6 36; Doc. 197 at \u00b6 28. Under the measures imposed at that time, which remain in effect, Vega may register to speak at Board meetings just like anybody else, but a security officer will meet her when she signs in and escort her to an overflow room until her speaking time, at which point she will be escorted to the podium in the meeting room and escorted out when finished speaking. Doc. 197 at \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants violated Vega's rights under the First Amendment and Vega's and Ramos's rights under Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Vega's First Amendment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Defendants violated Vega's First Amendment rights by: (1) removing her from the July 2014 Board meeting before her speaking time; (2) banning her from attending Board meetings from August 2014 through March 2017; and (3) imposing the rules governing her attendance at Board meetings from March 2017 to the present. Plaintiffs' summary\n   judgment motion gestures to a possible facial challenge to the Guidelines, Doc. 176 at 5-8, but their Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) response admits that their \"First Amendment claim is limited to what occurred on July 23, 2014 and the restrictions that followed,\" Doc. 197 at \u00b6 37, and the operative complaint does not mention any facial challenge, Doc. 46. Any facial challenge would have failed on the merits in any event.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milestone v.

Thus, when a restriction, \"[r]ather than focusing on\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   [an individual] say[s,] ... focuses on\n   <em>\n    the manner\n   </em>\n   in which [she] say[s] it,\" it is content-neutral.\n   <em>\n    Milestone\n   </em>\n   , 665 F.3d at 783.

Rather, those measures indisputably were motivated by how Vega chose to express her views. Vega was ejected from the July 2014 meeting after she rushed to the dais to shake her fist and yell \"COWARD! COWARD!\" at a Board member. Rushing up to the dais, yelling at a Board member, shaking her fist, and interrupting another speaker violated the Guidelines and were perceived by security officers as threatening. Making matters worse, Vega had recently violated the Guidelines at the March 2014 and May 2014 meetings-and making matters even worse, she warned at the May 2014 meeting that she was willing to be \"kicked out of the Board meeting every month for two minutes for the next how many years you got of life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Given this, the Board's enforcement of the Guidelines and imposition of restrictions\n   on Vega's attendance at Board meetings were content-neutral, not speaker- or content-based. True enough, no other individual has been subject to more stringent restrictions. But Plaintiffs adduce no evidence that anybody other than Vega repeatedly flouted the Guidelines and promised to do so at every future Board meeting. Nor do Plaintiffs suggest that any other speaker was permitted to remain in a Board meeting after engaging in conduct as severely disruptive as Vega's. Likewise, while Defendants were alert to Vega's presence at Board meetings, nothing in the record indicates that the monitoring arose from the content of Vega's speech or any desire to stifle her criticism of the Board. Finally, the fact that no attendance restrictions were placed on Queen Sister, whose criticisms of the Board (calling its members \"snakes\" and \"the devil incarnate\") could not have been more pungent, confirms that Defendants did not act towards Vega in a content-based manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, because the record indisputably shows that Defendants' actions were motivated not by the content of Vega's speech, but by her persistently disruptive conduct and threat to continue such conduct, her removal from the July 2014 meeting and subsequent restrictions placed on her attendance were content-neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Surita\n   </em>\n   , 665 F.3d at 871 (noting that, although banning the plaintiff from speaking during the city council's \"audience time\" unless he apologized to a government official he had criticized at a rally two days earlier was content-based, if his \"manner [had been] disruptive, [the defendant] could have barred his speech completely\");\n   <em>\n    Eichenlaub v.

Ill. 2012) (\"It is well-settled that a local government has a significant interest in maintaining order at\n   its meetings.\") (collecting cases). Rather, Plaintiffs argue that the 2\u00bd-year ban on Vega attending Board meetings, and the restrictions imposed on her attendance when the ban was lifted in March 2017, were and are not narrowly tailored to accomplish the Board's legitimate goals. Plaintiffs are incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Board's August 2014 letter informed Vega that she would be banned from attending meetings until further notice. As Plaintiffs recognize, the pertinent time frame for determining whether the ban was narrowly tailored is 2\u00bd years. Doc. 176 at 9; Doc. 194 at 4. That ban did not burden more of Vega's speech than necessary to maintain order during Board meetings or to ensure that members of the public who wished to address the Board in accordance with the Guidelines had that opportunity. Over a four-month span in 2014, Vega demonstrated a persistent and escalating willingness to cause disturbances during Board meetings. In March 2014, she exceeded her allotted two minutes and had to be ushered from the podium. In May 2014, she told the Board that she would \"get kicked out of the Board meeting every month for two minutes for the next how many years you got of life,\" and then was removed when she refused to stop talking after exceeding her allotted speaking time. Finally, in July 2014, she rushed the dais while yelling at Board member and shaking her fist, prompting the concern of security personnel, and then refused to leave when security personnel asked her to do so. Vega's repeated violation of the Guidelines, along with her promise of continued noncompliance, provided ample justification for the Board to take her at her word and ban her from attending meetings for 2\u00bd years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Accordingly, the ban was sufficiently tailored to advance the Board's interest in conducting its meetings in a safe and orderly fashion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    491 U.S. 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219515\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/781/#p791\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"[s]o long as the means chosen are not substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government's interest,\" a regulation will not fail narrow tailoring \"simply because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately served by a less-speech-restrictive alternative\");\n   <em>\n    New Albany DVD, LLC v.

The fact that Jackson and Carter, who also engaged in disruptive behavior, were subjected to shorter bans does not win the day for Vega, as the record does not indicate that either individual repeatedly violated and threatened to continue violating the Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The post-March 2017 restrictions, which permit Vega to speak at Board meetings but require that she wait in an overflow room until her time at the podium, likewise are narrowly tailored. Given Vega's disruptive conduct and promise to continue violating the Guidelines, when the Board lifted the ban on her attendance at Board meetings, it was justified in imposing limited restrictions on her access to the meeting room. This is not to say that those restrictions might at some point cease to be narrowly tailored, but the Board cannot be faulted for giving Vega a somewhat extended test-run, and seeing whether she can conduct herself appropriately, before lifting those restrictions entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
