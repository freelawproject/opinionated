Specifically, Plaintiff Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. (\"Employer\" or \"JLL\") contends that the Court should rule that the labor dispute in question is not substantively arbitrable under the relevant section of the CBA, because the Defendant Union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local Union 313 (\"Union\" or \"Local 313\"), failed to comply with the required grievance process. The Union contends that an arbitrator should decide both the underlying labor dispute and whether the Union complied with the grievance procedure that is a threshold requirement for arbitration. The Parties' Cross-Motions are granted in part and denied in part. I hold that the dispute is substantively arbitrable and further\n   hold that issues of procedural arbitrability, including whether the Union complied with the grievance process, must therefore be decided by an arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pertinent Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The essential and controlling facts are undisputed. Plaintiff JLL operates two facilities in Delaware, and Defendant Local 313 is the exclusive bargaining agent for certain employees at those facilities. JLL and Local 313 are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) that took effect on December 1, 2014. Def. Ex. A, ECF No. 49-1. The CBA includes an Agency Shop Clause that addresses employees' payment obligations to the Union as well as a provision regarding dispute resolution.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section 26, entitled \"Settlement of Disputes\" specifies that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (A) Should a difference or dispute arise between the parties hereto as to the interpretation or application of this contract, it shall be resolved in accordance with the following procedure:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Step 1: In the first instance, the grievance shall be submitted in writing by the employee, with the shop steward of the Union, to the Company's Account Manager or other manager designated by the Company (\"Designee\"). The grievance must be submitted within 0 [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] working days of the action giving rise to the grievance. A meeting with the employee, shop steward, the Critical Sites Operation Manager and/or Designee or other individuals as determined by the Company will be held to resolve the grievance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Step 2: If the grievance is not resolved within 5 business days after the above meeting, the business representative may present the grievance to the Company's Account Manager.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Step 3: If the grievance is not settled within 10 business days following Step 2, either party may submit the grievance to the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules. The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding on both parties and the cost of the arbitrator will be borne equally by both parties. Each party shall be responsible for its, his or her counsel fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (B) Any grievance that has not referred to arbitration within 30 days after the aggrieved party knew of the existence of the facts or circumstances giving rise to the grievance shall be deemed to have been waived, unless the parties have agreed that the grievance is a continuing grievance. In this case only the claims for damages or relief for events occurring more than 30 days prior to the presentation to the written grievance shall be deemed to have been waived. The time frame of 30 days may be extended upon mutual consent of the Union and the Company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (C) If the grievance concerns a decision by the Company that directly affects the entire bargaining unit, the parties agree to attempt to select an acceptable arbitrator through the American Arbitration Association who will be able to hold an arbitration hearing between 30 days of the arbitrator's selection from the panel, and shall notify the American Arbitration Association of this request at the time of the filing of the demand for arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Def. Ex. A, ECF No. 49-1 at A000017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2011, a dispute arose between Local 313 and another union regarding dues deducted\n   from employees' wages pursuant to the Agency Shop Clause in the CBA. On April 7, 2015, following the conclusion of litigation pertaining to that dispute, Local 313 sent a letter to JLL requesting enforcement of the Agency Shop Clause. Pl. Ex. 2, ECF No. 47 at A100. The letter also noted that, should the employees fail to comply with their obligations, Local 313 \"may seek separation of their employment by JLL.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The parties continued to communicate about the matter, and JLL suggested and agreed to pay for mediation between the two involved unions in an effort to resolve the matter. The first mediation session occurred in August 2015 but did not result in an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 15, 2015, Local 313 sent a second letter to JLL. Pl. Ex. 2, ECF No. 47 at A101. The letter referenced the Agency Shop Clause and expressed Local 313's belief that \"JLL has a continuing obligation to terminate all employees that have not paid such fees and are in violation of said article.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It enclosed a list of the employees in question and requested their termination. On September 22, 2015, JLL replied with a letter expressing an understanding that Local 313 would attend the next mediation session in October 2015 and stating that JLL representatives would also be present. Pl. Ex. A, ECF No. 47 at A104. JLL did not terminate the employees as requested by the letter, and Local 313 did not file a formal grievance after the September 15 letter. The second mediation session occurred in October 2015, but the competing unions failed to reach an agreement. JLL and Local 313 then engaged in direct discussions to no avail and, on January 27, 2016, the Union sent the American Arbitration Association (AAA) a letter, indicating that the parties had an \"unresolved dispute relating to Agency Fees.\" Pl. Ex. A, ECF No. 47 at A106. JLL then took the position that no grievance had been properly submitted because it characterized the September 15 letter as merely a request \"that Jones Lang LaSalle take action which Local 313 believes is required by Section 10 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.\" Pl. Ex. A, ECF No. 47 at A107. Local 313 contends that its September 15 letter constituted a grievance under Section 26 of the CBA. JLL subsequently filed this action, seeking to forestall arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Controlling Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   These Motions for Summary Judgment are governed by the well-established standard in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), as amplified by\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

When addressing cross-motions for summary judgment, the standard remains the same.\n   <em>\n    Appelmans v. City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1741243\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/214/#p216\">\n    826 F.2d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (3d Cir. 1987). The parties disagree about the arbitrability of a dispute under their CBA, but neither party debates the validity or contents of the CBA. Because no material fact is in dispute, the issues are purely questions of law for the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both parties return to an issue previously litigated: whether this Court or the arbitrator has jurisdiction to determine whether the dispute is arbitrable. The Employer urges the Court to hold that it has the jurisdiction to determine whether the dispute is substantively arbitrable, a conclusion consistent with previous rulings in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Union contends\n   that the Court should revisit this issue yet again. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the law of the case doctrine cautions against revisiting previously decided issues at later stages of a case.\n   <em>\n    In re Pharm. Benefit Managers Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061593\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/432/#p439\">\n    582 F.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 439-40 (3d Cir. 2009) ;\n   <em>\n    Pub. Interest Research Grp. of New Jersey, Inc. v. Magnesium Elektron, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11998878\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/123/111/#p116\">\n    123 F.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116-17 (3d Cir. 1997). The Third Circuit has recognized various \"extraordinary circumstances\" that would warrant reconsideration,\n   <em>\n    In re Pharm. Benefit Managers Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061593\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/432/#p439\">\n    582 F.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but no such circumstances are present here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Union has not raised new facts or asserted a change in the law that would persuade me that the earlier decisions on this issue\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were incorrect or unjust. Therefore, to the extent the Employer asks me to reaffirm the Court's prior decision that it is the Court that has jurisdiction to determine whether the dispute is substantively arbitrable, its motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I turn now to the issue of substantive arbitrability. The parties disagree about the precise question at issue. The Employer contends that whether a grievance was submitted, as required for arbitration, is itself a question of substantive arbitrability for the court to address. It cites to the provision of the CBA that requires the submission of a grievance before invoking arbitration and argues that it cannot be deemed to have consented to arbitration if the Union has failed to grieve. The Union responds that the only question for the court is whether the underlying dispute regarding the interpretation and application of the CBA's Agency Shop Clause is substantively arbitrable, with all other matters reserved for the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cases raising arbitrability require the application of principles that can seem circular in their logic. The lead case addressing substantive versus procedural arbitrability is\n   <em>\n    John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Livingston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/\">\n    376 U.S. 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/\">\n    11 L.Ed.2d 898\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1964). There, the Supreme Court held that \"[o]nce it is determined, as we have, that the parties are obligated to submit the subject matter of a dispute to arbitration, 'procedural' questions which\n   grow out of the dispute and bear on its final disposition should be left to the arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/\">\n    at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 909\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reliance on\n   <em>\n    Wiley\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit has specifically held that once a court determines that the substance of a dispute falls within an arbitration clause, the court may not determine matters of procedural arbitrability.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.-Pa. v.

Workers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381242\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/197/#p200\">\n    164 F.3d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200-01 (3d Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Employer here relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Phila.

The Court of Appeals held that the requirement that the grievance be reduced to writing was not a \"mere procedural formality,\" and the union could not \"skip the entire grievance machinery\" specified in the CBA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229914\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/648/900/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229914\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/648/900/\">\n    at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . JLL argues that Local 313 likewise skipped the entire grievance process. In\n   <em>\n    Phila. Printing Pressmen's Union No. 16\n   </em>\n   , however, the only written communication submitted was a request to reconsider the termination at issue, which the union did not contend was a written grievance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229914\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/648/900/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, Local 313's September 15 letter refers to the Employer's \"continuing obligation\" under the CBA, and unlike the union in\n   <em>\n    Phila. Printing Pressmen's Union No. 16\n   </em>\n   , Local 313 specifically characterizes the September 15 letter as raising a grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Local 313 in turn relies on\n   <em>\n    Becton Dickinson &amp; Co. v. Dist. 65, United Auto., Aerospace, &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am., AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   , where the union had attempted to comply with the CBA by sending a letter to inform the company it may be in violation and requested a meeting to address the violations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605637\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/799/57/#p59\">\n    799 F.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 (3d Cir. 1986). The Third Circuit held that the arbitrator should decide whether the union's actions were sufficient to invoke the arbitration process.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605637\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/799/57/#p59\">\n    799 F.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61 (3d Cir. 1986). The Court in\n   <em>\n    Becton\n   </em>\n   distinguished\n   <em>\n    Phila. Printing Pressmen's Union No. 16\n   </em>\n   because in\n   <em>\n    Becton\n   </em>\n   \"the Union did not totally fail to follow the grievance procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605637\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/799/57/#p59\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1605637\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/799/57/#p59\">\n    at 60-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Local 313's September 15 letter is not a model of clarity and does not allege violations of the CBA as explicitly as the letter in\n   <em>\n    Becton\n   </em>\n   , its reference to the Agency Shop Clause more closely resembles the letter in\n   <em>\n    Becton\n   </em>\n   than the total failure to comply with the required process in\n   <em>\n    Phila.

The union in\n   <em>\n    Troy\n   </em>\n   had failed to submit any written grievance before initiating arbitration, and the employer, like JLL here, sought a declaratory judgment that the case was not arbitrable due to failure to comply with the process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848713\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/123/#p125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848713\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/123/#p125\">\n    at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ex. A, ECF No. 49-1 at A000017. The dispute in question concerns the interpretation and application of the CBA's Agency Shop Clause and JLL's obligations under that clause. The parties do not disagree about the nature of that dispute, nor do they dispute the content of the CBA. The Agency Shop Clause is a provision of the contract, and thus the dispute about its interpretation and application falls within the scope of the arbitration clause.

Defendant is correct that the Court retains the\n    <em>\n     power\n    </em>\n    to reopen the issue, but that does not obligate the Court to do so. To the contrary, the Supreme Court has stated that, while \"[a] court has the power to revisit prior decisions of its own or a coordinate court in any circumstance ... courts should be loathe to do so in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.\"\n    <em>\n     Christianson v.
