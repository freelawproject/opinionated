Doc. 156. After Calabrese twice amended his complaint, Docs. 5, 37, the court stayed the suit under the\n   <em>\n    Younger\n   </em>\n   doctrine pending resolution of his state criminal trial. Doc. 62. While the suit was stayed, Calabrese sought and was granted leave to file a third amended complaint. Docs. 81, 83. The court lifted the stay after Calabrese was convicted, and granted him leave to file a fourth amended complaint. Docs. 147, 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The State's Attorney Defendants move under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss all claims against them, the Des Plaines Defendants move under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss some of the claims against them and also under Rule 12(f) to strike Calabrese's request for punitive damages against the City, and the Director moves under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) to dismiss the claim against him. Docs. 152, 154, 179. The State's Attorney Defendants' motion is granted, though in part on standing grounds, the Director's motion is denied, and the Des Plaines Defendants' motion is granted in part and denied in part. The case will go forward on Count IV (brought under the Second Amendment) against the Director, and on Counts V and VII (brought under the Fourth Amendment) against the Des Plaines Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In resolving a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court assumes the truth of the operative complaint's well-pleaded factual allegations, though not its legal conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zahn v.

The parties do not present any historical evidence relevant to this issue, and they cite no Seventh Circuit precedent (nor is the court aware of any) explaining what sorts of crimes are so serious that a conviction automatically strips an individual of his or her Second Amendment right to\n   possess a firearm.

Calabrese's offense was likewise a misdemeanor that resulted in probation, and he alleges that he never behaved violently towards Paul or anyone else.

In short, he alleges that the officers performed the search out of personal bias against him, not in an effort to further the interests of the City of Des Plaines. Because the alleged conspiracy and resulting search comprised \"an independent course of conduct not intended by the employee to serve any purpose of the employer,\" Restatement (Third) of Agency, \u00a7 7.07, the intra-corporate conspiracy doctrine does not defeat Calabrese's Fourth Amendment conspiracy claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Des Plaines Defendants also argue that, insofar as Calabrese's conspiracy claim is predicated on his false arrest claim, it is barred by\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   .
