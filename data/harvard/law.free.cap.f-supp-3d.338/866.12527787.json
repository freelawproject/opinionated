Doc. 55 at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 90. Wells Fargo transferred the mortgage to Bank of America, but continued to service it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Kane sought a loan modification in 2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 92-93. Thus began a long back-and-forth between Kane and the Banks over whether and how they\n   might modify his repayment terms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76. In the end, the Banks denied all of Kane's requests and proceeded with foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Litigation commenced in March 2011, when Bank of America filed a foreclosure case against Kane in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.\n   <em>\n    Bank of Am., N.A. v. Kane\n   </em>\n   , No. 2011 CH 11338 (Cir. Ct. Cook Cnty., Ill.) (complaint reproduced at Doc. 124-1 at 6-40). Well over two years later, in November 2013, Kane brought this suit against the Banks in federal court, alleging common law fraud and violations of the ICFA, the Racketeer and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\"), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"). Doc. 1. The gist of Kane's suit was and remains that the Banks strung him along without intending to modify his loans in order to milk extra late fees and interest from him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This suit was initially assigned to Judge Marovich, who granted in part and denied in part the Banks' motion to dismiss. Doc. 23 (reported at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204198295\">\n    2014 WL 4198295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. Aug. 25, 2014) ). Kane then sought and obtained permission to file an amended complaint that did not include the RICO claims, the FDCPA claims, and some of the originally pleaded fraud claims. Doc. 40 (reported at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203798142\">\n    2015 WL 3798142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. June 17, 2015) ). The following day, the case was reassigned to the undersigned judge. Doc. 41. Kane then moved for reconsideration of Judge Marovich's rulings insofar as they precluded him from re-pleading his RICO claims. Doc. 44. The court denied that motion, Doc. 54, and Kane filed a second amended complaint, Doc. 55, which the Banks answered, Doc. 60. The court then urged the parties to get moving on discovery, which had only recently begun. Docs. 46, 61, 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Meanwhile, Kane in the state foreclosure case asserted as affirmative defenses the same fraud-based theories underlying his claims in federal court. Doc. 124-1 at 57-122. Bank of America twice moved to strike those defenses, prompting Kane to amend twice more.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124; Doc. 124-2 at 2-113, 115, 117-183. Kane's third and final amended affirmative defenses sounded in common law promissory fraud and violations of the ICFA, closely tracking the allegations of his federal complaint. Doc. 124-2 at 117-183. The state court struck those defenses with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 185, 187; Doc. 150-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bank of America moved for summary judgment in the foreclosure case, Doc. 124-2 at 189, and the state court granted the motion, Doc. 133-1 at 5. The state court also issued a judgment for foreclosure and sale, and appointed a sale officer to auction the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-13, 15; Doc. 150-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following the entry of judgment, but before the judicial sale, Kane sold the mortgaged property and used the sale proceeds to pay off his loan. Doc. 153 at 7. On Bank of America's motion, the state court dismissed the suit with prejudice given that \"all amounts due under the subject loan have been paid off in full.\" Doc. 150-4. No appeal was filed within the time permitted by Illinois law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 303(a)(1) (appeals from final civil judgments must be filed \"within 30 days after the entry of the final judgment appealed from\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Banks contend that the state court's judgment in the foreclosure case precludes Kane's claims in this federal suit. The state court judgment's preclusive effect is governed by Illinois law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co., Ltd. v.

After all, the Seventh Circuit explained, \"[a]llegations of fraud\" relating to the \"manner in which [the federal defendant] presented its monthly bills and disconnection notices\" would \"go to the heart of what was decided in the state court-that [the federal plaintiff] legitimately owes [the federal defendant] a sum of money.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11899454\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/952/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11899454\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/952/\">\n    at 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Henry\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Whitaker\n   </em>\n   , if Kane were to prevail in federal court on his claims-which, as the Banks rightly note, are \"premised on allegations that [their] actions ... caused him to be charged 'unnecessary interest charges and fees' and resulted in a foreclosure action that he contends was wrongful,\" Doc. 155 at 10-this court's decision would nullify the state court's ruling that, \"by virtue of the mortgage and the affidavits presented as evidence of indebtedness, ... [Bank of America established that it] ha[d] a valid and subsisting lien on [Kane's] property\"\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   was owed particular sums for the loan's \"[p]rincipal, [a]ccrued interest, [a]dvances and other amounts,\" Doc. 150-3 at 1. It follows that the Banks would satisfy res judicata's identity of causes of action requirement even if they had to show that a victory for Kane here would nullify the state court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As all of the requirements of res judicata have been satisfied, the state court's judgment of foreclosure precludes Kane's claims in this case. While unnecessary to the court's holding, it bears mention that the opposite result would have unjustly rewarded Kane by allowing him to essentially buy his way out of the preclusive effect of the state foreclosure judgment by paying off his long-overdue mortgage only after he had definitively lost the state case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings is granted.
