LAND, CHIEF U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs are shareholders of Defendant Aflac Incorporated (\"AFLAC\"). Concerned about several corporate transactions and potential mismanagement, they urged AFLAC to bring claims against certain officers and members of the board of directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and violations of sections 10(b), 14(a), and 20A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b), 78n(a), 78t-1(a). After AFLAC notified Plaintiffs that a committee of outside directors investigated the claims and determined, with the advice of independent counsel, that pursuing them was not in AFLAC's best interests, Plaintiffs filed this derivative action on behalf of AFLAC against Defendants, who are current and former officers and/or directors. Defendants respond that the outside directors were independent and made their determination in good faith after conducting a reasonable investigation. Accordingly, they move to dismiss this action pursuant to Georgia's derivative-action dismissal statute, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-744. Plaintiffs oppose dismissal, arguing that the outside directors were not independent, that they did not conduct a reasonable investigation, and that they did not act in good faith. For the reasons explained in the remainder of this Order, Defendants' motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 42 &amp; 43) are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FISH &amp; FAMILY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the pending motion to dismiss, the Court must respond to Plaintiffs' counsel's invitation for the undersigned to evaluate whether he should recuse himself from these proceedings.

Plaintiffs argue that the SLC members were personally interested in rejecting their breach of fiduciary duty claims and their claims arising from alleged federal securities and proxy violations because they each would face personal liability if AFLAC pursued these claims. The parties agree that \"[d]irectorial interest ... exists where a corporate decision will have a materially detrimental impact on a director, but not on the corporation and the stockholders.\"\n   <em>\n    Rales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371190\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/634/927/#p936\">\n    634 A.2d at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the mere naming of a director as a defendant in a lawsuit does not render the director interested. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-744(c)(2). Moreover, a board member's mere approval of a challenged corporate action does not strip that board member of independence, so long as the board member did not receive a personal benefit as a result.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7371190\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/634/927/#p936\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 14-2-744(c)(3). Otherwise, board members would always be disqualified from serving\n   on a litigation committee charged with the responsibility of evaluating whether a derivative action is in the best interest of the corporation. And that is simply not the law in Georgia. Only if the director faces \"a 'substantial likelihood' of personal liability\" if the corporation pursues the demand will the director be deemed incapable of independently considering the demand.\n   <em>\n    Guttman v. Huang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123518\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/823/492/#p501\">\n    823 A.2d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501 (Del.

Similarly, Plaintiffs do not allege that any SLC member benefitted in some unique way that was different than other members of the board or that any member received a unique personal benefit as a result of the challenged conduct. Plaintiffs allege that all members of the board violated duties owed to the corporation, and thus they share responsibility with the other members of the board. These types of allegations standing alone are not sufficient to taint the independence of the SLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   But the Court does not rest its conclusions solely on this reason. The Court is also persuaded that the SLC and its independent counsel thoroughly analyzed the substance of the claims asserted by Plaintiffs and rationally concluded that those claims do not subject the SLC members to a substantial likelihood of personal liability. Therefore, the SLC members were not conflicted from independently evaluating whether the maintenance of the derivative action is in the best interest of the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In support of this conclusion, the Court notes that Georgia law generally allows corporations to exculpate directors from liability to the corporation for acts or omissions taken as directors. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-202(b)(4). Pursuant to that provision, AFLAC's charter exculpates its directors from liability to AFLAC for their conduct as directors, except for acts or omissions committed in bad faith, appropriating corporate opportunities, intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law, unlawful distributions, and conflicting interest transactions. Articles of Amendment, ECF No. 42-7. The SLC members cannot be deemed interested based on their potential personal liability for a claim that falls within the exculpatory provision of AFLAC's charter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Guttman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9123518\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/823/492/#p501\">\n    823 A.2d at 501-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that a director can only face a substantial threat of personal liability for a certain claim if the corporate charter does not exculpate the director from liability for the claim). Therefore, only a substantial threat of liability arising out of a claim falling within the specific exceptions to AFLAC's exculpatory provision will render an SLC member interested. It appears that the claims alleged by Plaintiffs would fall within the exculpatory clause of the AFLAC charter. But even if they did not, the Court finds that the theoretical possibility of the SLC members facing personal liability is not sufficiently substantial to render the SLC members interested and require their disqualification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As noted previously, the SLC and its independent counsel investigated the claims to determine the SLC members' personal liability. Their report concluded that the fiduciary duty claims arising from a duty of care and good faith were meritless, and to the extent that any claim survived dismissal, the SLC members would be entitled to exculpation by AFLAC for any liability. Thus, the claims did not render the SLC members interested. 2d SLC Report 23, 95-96 (duty of loyalty),\n   99, 100-102 (good faith exercise of oversight duties).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The SLC and its counsel also investigated Plaintiffs' federal securities and proxy violation claims and determined that the Fraud Allegations were unsubstantiated and, thus, AFLAC had no duty to disclose them in the FY2016 Annual Report or 2017 proxy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71, 87. The Court finds that the SLC's findings and analysis support these conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Because the SLC members did not face a substantial threat of personal liability if AFLAC pursued the claims asserted by Plaintiffs in the derivative action, the SLC members were disinterested in the subject of the demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Based on the Court's review of the SLC reports, and contrary to Plaintiffs' contention, the SLC investigated each of Plaintiffs' allegations, even those that were only tangential to Plaintiffs' derivative claims.

And if counsel for the alleged wrongdoers also conducts the company's investigation, the investigation may not be impartial and the board may never truly learn where the company's interest lies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507010\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That risk is not present in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The original dispute notice did not ask AFLAC to sue the Amoses, the board members, or any other agent or employee of AFLAC. Instead, it alleged that AFLAC retaliated against certain sales associates, including Plaintiffs, and asked AFLAC to waive their arbitration agreements so they could pursue claims\n   <em>\n    against AFLAC.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, it was apparent upon receipt of the dispute notice that the interests of all the parties that could reasonably be expected to be sued by the sales associates were aligned. AFLAC obviously would have wanted to defend any such claims, and, to the extent the dispute notice implicated AFLAC employees or agents, AFLAC would have wanted to defend those individuals to avoid any claims for vicarious liability. It was not until Plaintiffs formally demanded that AFLAC's board take action against Defendants that AFLAC's interests began to diverge from the interests of Alston &amp; Bird's other clients. When that occurred, AFLAC established the SLC to evaluate how to best serve AFLAC's interests in responding to the demand and gave it authority to retain independent counsel, which the SLC did. The SLC's independent counsel, not Alston &amp; Bird, then actually investigated the derivative demands. There was thus no risk that Alston &amp;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Bird's allegiance to its individual clients would have tainted the SLC's investigation of Plaintiffs' demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   One concern in\n   <em>\n    Stepak\n   </em>\n   was that Troutman Sanders both controlled the flow of information to the directors evaluating the demand and simultaneously owed a duty of confidentiality to the alleged wrongdoers.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507010\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/398/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507010\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/398/\">\n    at 407, 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The SLC reports do note that Alston &amp; Bird cooperated with the SLC by providing the SLC's independent counsel with electronic documents Alston &amp; Bird compiled and that it filtered the documents using search terms created by Alston &amp; Bird. 2d SLC Report 33-34. But Alston &amp; Bird did not\n   <em>\n    control\n   </em>\n   the flow of information to the SLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For example, the board provided the SLC with \"access to all information of [AFLAC] or its subsidiaries which the [SLC] believes would assist it in its work\" and directed the \"directors, officers, employees, public accountants, and advisors\" to \"assist the SLC and to provide it with any and all documents and other information that the SLC deems necessary[.]\" AFLAC Board Resolution (July 12, 2017) at 2, ECF No. 42-3. Further, the SLC's independent counsel reviewed and approved the list of search terms Alston &amp; Bird used to filter the electronic documents, and Alston &amp; Bird ran additional search terms as requested by the independent counsel. 2d SLC Report 33-34. AFLAC also provided the independent counsel with all of Amos II's available emails and an imaged copy of his computer so that the independent counsel could run search terms as it deemed appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. When the SLC was unable to acquire certain emails it deemed important, it contacted Plaintiffs' counsel who then provided the emails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36 n.19. Alston &amp; Bird's cooperation with the SLC and its independent counsel does not render the SLC's investigation unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs also attack the SLC's investigations because, according to Plaintiffs, the SLC members failed to interview certain witnesses and did not thoroughly investigate the SLC members' independence. Pls.' Supp. Resp. to Defs.' Mot. Dismiss at 2, ECF No. 60. Plaintiffs point to the fact that the SLC members did not disclose their prior professional relationships with Amos until they filed supplemental declarations in support of the pending motions to dismiss. Their first declarations stated that they had no social or professional relationships with the Amoses that would impair their impartiality. Plaintiffs in response to Defendants' motions to dismiss asserted that the SLC members had such relationships with the Amoses. The SLC members then submitted supplemental declarations explaining their prior professional relationships with Amos, which consisted of Amos serving on boards of other organizations in which an SLC member also served as a director or officer. Notably, the first declarations were not false; they simply failed to mention that the SLC members had served with Amos in leadership capacities in other organizations. Importantly, these mutual associations preceded 2012, well before the SLC was appointed here. It is reasonable to conclude that the most likely explanation for the late disclosure is that the SLC members determined that their prior relationships with Amos had no effect on their ability to act independently in evaluating demands that post-dated those prior relationships. And the Court has previously found that those prior relationships do not taint the independence of the SLC members under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that the SLC investigation was unreasonable because the SLC did not interview certain witnesses that Plaintiffs think they should have interviewed. Specifically, Plaintiffs complain\n   that the SLC never interviewed any of the sales associates who sent the dispute notice and who allegedly had personal knowledge of the conduct underlying Plaintiffs' Fraud Allegations. But the SLC already possessed the dispute notice that laid out the factual basis for the sales associates' allegations. The SLC knew what they alleged. It was not unreasonable for the SLC to decline to interview them when it is likely that they would have added no new material information for the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The SLC conducted a thorough, reasonable and good faith investigation with the assistance of non-conflicted, independent counsel. The belief of Plaintiffs' counsel that the SLC could have done more does not change that fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The SLC investigated all of Plaintiffs' claims and decided that pursuing those claims was not in AFLAC's best interest. Based upon a thorough review of the substantial record, the Court finds that the SLC was composed of independent members who conducted a reasonable investigation into Plaintiffs' claims and that the SLC acted in good faith when it determined that pursuing Plaintiffs' demands was not in the best interest of AFLAC. Accordingly, pursuant to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 14-2-744, this action is dismissed in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED, this 31st day of August, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Bonner v.
