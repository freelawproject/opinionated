BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs bring this putative class action on behalf of all participants, former participants, and beneficiaries of the Dignity Health Pension Plan (\"the Dignity Plan\" or \"the Plan\"). ECF No. 243, First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") \u00b6 3. Defendant Dignity Health \"operates a health care conglomerate in California, Arizona and Nevada and ancillary care facilities in nineteen states.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. Plaintiffs allege that the Plan violates many provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' claim that the Plan is exempt from ERISA because it is a church plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs bring claims alleging violations of ERISA and, alternatively, state law claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of common law fiduciary duty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 277-321. Plaintiffs also bring a claim for declaratory relief that the church plan exemption violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 266-276.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case was filed on April 1, 2013 and assigned to Judge Thelton. E Henderson. ECF Nos. 1, 16. Judge Henderson granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on July 22, 2014. ECF No. 175. Judge Henderson found that the Dignity Plan is not a church plan as defined by ERISA because the plan was not established by a church.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Judge Henderson then granted Defendants' motion to stay the case and to certify the district court's partial summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal. ECF No. 205.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 26, 2016 the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court. ECF No. 220. The Supreme Court granted Defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari and subsequently issued an opinion\n   reversing the Ninth Circuit. ECF Nos. 223, 224. The case was reassigned to the undersigned on August 14, 2017. ECF No. 225. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on November 3, 2017. ECF No. 243. Defendants now move to dismiss the complaint. ECF No. 249.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. REQUEST FOR JUDICAL NOTICE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b), \"[t]he court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court's territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" On a motion to dismiss, the court may also \"consider materials incorporated into the complaint\" when \"the complaint necessarily relies upon a document or the contents of the document are alleged in a complaint, the document's authenticity is not in question and there are no disputed issues as to the document's relevance.\"\n   <em>\n    Coto Settlement v. Eisenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518120\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/593/1031/#p1038\">\n    593 F.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038 (9th Cir. 2010). This is true even if \"the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Knievel v. ESPN\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9174169\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/1068/#p1076\">\n    393 F.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1076 (9th Cir. 2005). The court \"must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(c)(2). However, courts \"cannot take judicial notice of the contents of documents for the truth of the matters asserted therein when the facts are disputed.\"\n   <em>\n    Cal. Sportfishing Prot. All. v. Shiloh Grp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266540\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/268/1029/#p1038\">\n    268 F.Supp.3d 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038 (N.D. Cal. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before turning to Defendants' specific requests, the Court makes a general observation about the appropriate use of judicial notice. As the Ninth Circuit recently noted, \"[t]he overuse and improper application of judicial notice and the incorporation-by-reference doctrine ... can lead to unintended and harmful results. Defendants face an alluring temptation to pile on numerous documents to their motions to dismiss to undermine the complaint, and hopefully dismiss the case at an early stage. Yet the unscrupulous use of extrinsic documents to resolve competing theories against the complaint risks premature dismissals of plausible claims that may turn out to be valid after discovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Khoja v. Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518146\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/988/#p998\">\n    899 F.3d 988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 998-99 (9th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, Defendants repeatedly do what\n   <em>\n    Khoja\n   </em>\n   forbids - ask the Court to take judicial notice of documents that they then use as a basis to challenge the factual averments in the complaint. Exhibit 3, for example, is a copy of Dignity Health's \"Mission.\" Dignity offers this document for the purpose of contradicting the assertion in Plaintiffs' complaint that the Dignity Plan is not sufficiently associated with the Catholic Church to qualify for the church plan exemption under ERISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 249 at 15 (\"Dignity Health holds itself out as a religiously affiliated health system. Dignity Health's website describes its 'Mission' as a commitment to 'furthering the healing ministry of Jesus.' \"); 29 (\"Dignity Health's website describes its 'Mission' as a commitment to 'furthering the healing ministry of Jesus,' and its Mission Integration process ensures that the healing ministry of Jesus is folded into all aspects of the organization.\"). Dignity is not explaining or arguing the allegations in Plaintiffs' FAC - it is trying to factually rebut them. As\n   <em>\n    Khoja\n   </em>\n   makes clear, to grant the request for judicial notice would improperly convert this Rule 12(b)(6) motion into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    Khoja\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518146\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/988/#p998\">\n    899 F.3d at 998-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Many of Dignity's other requests are similarly problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Many of Defendants' requests also seek notice of material taken from websites, including their own website. These materials are not proper subjects of judicial notice. Dignity is correct that there are cases suggesting that courts may take judicial notice of \"publicly available\" websites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perkins v. LinkedIn Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060804\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/53/1190/#p1204\">\n    53 F.Supp.3d 1190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1204 (N.D.

Cal. 2005). But a close examination of those cases show little to no basis in sound authority for their conclusion. And having considered the issue more fully, this Court rejects the notion that a document is judicially noticeable simply because it appears on a publicly available website, regardless of who maintains the website or the purpose of the document.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The purpose of the judicial notice rules is to allow the court or jury to consider a matter as to which there can be no reasonable dispute. \" Rule 201(b) limits judicial notice to 'indisputable' facts, thus limiting the use of judicial notice to clear cases.\" 21B Charles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Jr.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice and Procedure (Evidence)\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5102.2 (2d ed. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Consistent with this rationale, and because of their perceived reliability, courts have often admitted records taken from websites maintained by government agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    L'Garde, Inc. v.

Cal. 2011). These cases represent the logical extension of the judicial notice rules. A government agency's records will often be judicially noticeable because they are public records.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pet Quarters, Inc. v. Depository Tr. &amp; Clearing Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3802942\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/545/845/#p847\">\n    545 F.Supp.2d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (E.D.

Courts simply recognize that the same records should be equally admissible when they are maintained on websites rather than in hard copy files.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v.

Mich. 2003) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By contrast, the records of private parties have no such imprimatur of reliability, and neither do their websites. There are at least a trillion web pages on the Internet, and many of the documents within those pages are unsupported, poorly supported, or even false. Of course, that does not make all of those documents inadmissible\n   for all purposes. But they are not inherently reliable, and courts should be cautious before taking judicial notice of documents simply because they were published on a website. That is particularly so when a party seeks to introduce documents it created and posted on its own website, as Dignity does here. When a non-governmental entity to seek judicial notice of its paper records, the request is properly rejected because such documents are subject to reasonable dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ladore v.

Cal. 2014) (rejecting request to judicially notice corporate terms of service because moving party \"cannot establish that these documents' 'accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.' \"). That the same entity posts them on a \"publicly available\" website does not change that essential fact and does not make them \"public records\" for purposes of the judicial notice rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Turning to Defendants' specific requests, Defendants request that the Court take judicial notice of Exhibit 1, a copy of the Amended and Restated Bylaws of Dignity Health; Exhibit 2, a copy of the Restated Articles of Incorporation of Catholic Healthcare West; Exhibit 8, a copy of the Catholic Healthcare West Retirement Plan Amended &amp; Restated January 1, 20005; Exhibit 11, a copy of the Memorandum regarding the Requested\n   <em>\n    Nhil Obstat\n   </em>\n   in Directive 68 Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services; and Exhibit 13, a copy of the Dignity Health Pension Plan Amended and Restated January 1, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 249-2. Plaintiffs do not oppose these requests, but contend that the Court should not consider these exhibits for the truth of the matters asserted therein. ECF No. 257-1. These requests are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants also request judicial notice of Exhibit 3, a copy of Dignity Health's Mission; Exhibit 4, a copy of Dignity Health's Standards for Mission Integration; Exhibit 6, a copy of the Statement of Common Values\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 249-2. Dignity's sole justification for these requests is that the materials were printed from its website. These requests are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants request judicial notice of Exhibit 5, a copy of the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care. Although this document is posted on Dignity's website, that is not the only justification for judicial notice. The Court may take judicial notice of the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Services because it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   is a publication promulgated by the United States Council Conference of Bishops. The Ethical and Religious Directives are widely disseminated and must be followed by all Catholic Health Organizations. As the Ethical and Religious Directives are from a source whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, the Court may take judicial notice of this document.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Overall v.

The only justification offered for this document is that it resides on a publicly-available website. ECF No. 249-2 at 4. Because this is an insufficient basis for judicial notice, the request is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants request judicial notice of Exhibit 9, a copy of the Dignity Health Retirement Plans Sub-Committee Charter. Plaintiffs oppose the request. ECF No. 257-1. Defendants argue that judicial notice is proper when \"the complaint incorporates ... [the] documents by reference,\n   the complaint necessarily relies on those documents, and neither party questions their authenticity or relevance,\" and \"[c]ourts routinely take judicial notice of ERISA plan documents like those at issue here.\" ECF No. 249-2 at 5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lorenz\n   </em>\n   , 241 F.Supp.3d at 1012 ).

ECF No. 249-2 at 5. Plaintiffs oppose this request. ECF No. 257-1. Defendants' purpose in attempting to introduce this document is to argue a fact that is in dispute, i.e., the degree of association or affiliation between Dignity Health and the Catholic Church.

These contentions do not undermine Plaintiffs' standing, but merely demonstrate that there is a dispute of fact about the financial health of the Plan. Dignity Health might have significant assets and operating revenues, but without knowing more about Dignity Health's liabilities and expenses, these facts say nothing about Dignity's ability to fund the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   At this early stage, Plaintiffs have adequately alleged standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Defendants acknowledge Plaintiffs' contention that the Plan is underfunded, but argue that Plaintiffs' breach of contract claim \"fails to allege that the Plan is insufficiently funded\n   <em>\n    on an actuarial basis\n   </em>\n   to provide for the benefits provided under the Plan.\" ECF No. 249 at 46 (emphasis in original). Defendants contend that a failure to fully fund the plan is not equivalent \"with the contractual obligation to fund in an amount 'sufficient on an actuarial basis' to provide for the benefits under the Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants' argument relies on a cramped reading of the amended complaint. Plaintiffs allege more than once that \"Dignity has an obligation to make contributions to the Dignity Plan trust in an amount which is sufficient,\n   <em>\n    on an actuarial basis\n   </em>\n   , to fund all accrued benefits under the Dignity Plan.\" FAC \u00b6 75 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93D, 280.
