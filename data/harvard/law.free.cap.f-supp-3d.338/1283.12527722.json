(DE 17). Plaintiff David M. Rodriguez, filed a response in opposition (DE 22) and Defendant filed a reply (DE 29). For the reasons set forth below, the motion (DE 17) is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, asserting a claim of alienage discrimination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff is a Venezuelan national residing in Miami, Florida, who is authorized to work in the U.S. under the government's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). On or around December 5, 2012, Plaintiff obtained an Employment Authorization Document (\"EAD\") pursuant to DACA. (DE 1 \u00b6 13). In September 2013, Plaintiff submitted his resume to Eduardo Moreno (\"Moreno\"), a PG recruiter who was recruiting college students to obtain internships with PG. (DE 1 \u00b6 19). A few days later, Moreno emailed Plaintiff with pointers on how to improve his resume and, on that same date, Plaintiff submitted his application through PG's website. (DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19, 20, 21). The application required Plaintiff to answer a pre-screening questionnaire that asked the following questions: 1) Are you currently a U.S. citizen or national, or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residency, or a refugee, or an individual granted asylum, or admitted for residence as an applicant under the 1986 immigration amnesty law? 2) Are you an individual admitted exclusively on a nonimmigrant visa, such as B, H, O, E, TN or L or an individual on the F-1 visa completing CPT (Curricular Practical Training) or OPT (Optional Practical Training)? 3) Are you an individual who is now completing the permanent residency process but has not yet been granted permanent residency? 4) Will you now, or in the future, require sponsorship for U.S. employment visa status (e.g., H-1B or permanent residency status)? (DE 1 \u00b6 22). Plaintiff responded \"No\" to each question. (DE 1 \u00b6 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a week of waiting to receive PG's assessment tests, Plaintiff emailed Moreno to check on the status of his application. (DE 1 \u00b6 22). After corresponding with Moreno, Plaintiff revised his application and emailed PG's recruitment team to inform them that he had a valid work permit and did not need sponsorship. (DE 1 \u00b6 26). One or two days later, Plaintiff received a rejection letter from PG. (DE 1 \u00b6 26). Afterward, Moreno told Plaintiff that he was not eligible to be hired because \"per P &amp; G policy, applicants in the U.S. should be legally authorized to work with no restraints on the type, duration, or location of employment.\" (DE 1 \u00b6 28). Additionally, Plaintiff learned that some PG job postings specifically state under the \"Qualifications\" section that \"[c]andidates must be a U.S. citizens or national, refugee, asylee or lawful permanent resident.\" (DE 1 \u00b6 29). On these facts, Plaintiff advances a cause of action for alienage discrimination against PG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The only disputed issue, in the instant motion, is whether Plaintiff has stated a claim for alienage discrimination by sufficiently pleading that PG refused to hire him, and others similarly situated because of their non-citizen status. The Court finds that Plaintiff has sufficiently stated a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 1981 provides in relevant part, \"All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts ... as is enjoyed by white citizens...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The statute prohibits discrimination based on race or alienage in the making and enforcement of contracts, including employment contracts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Conboy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1567090\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/167/#p170\">\n    156 F.3d 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170, 180 (2d Cir. 1998). To state a claim under section 1981, a plaintiff must allege that (1) he or she is a member of a protected class, (2) the defendant intentionally discriminated against him or her on the basis of membership in that protected class; and (3) the discrimination concerned one of \u00a7 1981's enumerated activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

However, PG argues that Plaintiff fails to state a claim, because Plaintiff admits in his complaint that PG's decision not to hire him was based on his immigration status and not his citizenship. (DE 17 at 5). Because the complaint admits that both citizens and non-citizens were invited to apply for contracts with PG, PG argues that \"[a]t best, then, the Complaint alleges that P &amp; G discriminated against individuals with temporary immigration statuses, a claim that is not cognizable under Section 1981.\" (DE 17 at 6). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff alleges in the complaint that PG discriminated against him based on his status as a non-citizen. (DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 10-13). In support of this allegation, Plaintiff states that a PG recruiter told him that PG only hires applicants that are \"legally authorized to work with no restraints on the type, duration, or location of employment\" and that in its job postings PG states that \"[c]andidates must be a U.S. citizen or national, refugee, asylee or lawful permanent resident.\" (DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). The issue is whether Plaintiff has properly pled \"purposeful discrimination\" as required by section 1981.\n   <em>\n    Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass'n, Inc. v. Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636511\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/375/#p389\">\n    458 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636511\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/375/#p389\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636511\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/375/#p389\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982).

There, on strikingly similar facts, the court found that Northwestern Mutual's policy impermissibly discriminated against a subclass of lawfully present aliens.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197801\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court reached this conclusion because \"(1) \u00a7 1981's protection against discrimination extends to all lawfully present aliens; (2) a plaintiff need not allege discrimination against all members of a protected class to state a claim under \u00a7 1981 ; and (3) a plaintiff can plead intentional discrimination by alleging that the defendant acted pursuant to a facially discriminatory policy requiring adverse treatment based on a protected trait.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197801\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197801\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/364/#p367\">\n    at 368-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As is the case here, the critical issue in\n   <em>\n    Juarez\n   </em>\n   was whether the plaintiff had properly pled that Northwestern Mutual purposefully discriminated against him based on alienage. The court explained that one way to plead intentional discrimination \"is to point to a law or policy that expressly classifies people on the basis of a protected characteristic.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197801\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197801\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/364/#p367\">\n    at 370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the court concluded that \"allegations that [plaintiff's] application was rejected pursuant to a policy that expressly denies employment to lawfully present aliens without green cards-a protected subclass-suffice to state a claim under \u00a7 1981.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197801\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/69/364/#p367\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court finds this reasoning persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, PG's policy, as alleged in the complaint, could be construed to discriminate against a subset of legal aliens, which are a protected class under section 1981. And it is well established that plaintiff need not allege discrimination against the whole class to establish a section 1981 claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Connecticut v.
