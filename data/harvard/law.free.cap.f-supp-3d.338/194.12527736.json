FAC \u00b6\u00b6 7-10. TriPoint Global and TriPoint Capital sell and provide various financial services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   TriPoint Global is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12, while TriPoint Capital is not authorized to conduct business in the State of New York and is not a registered broker-dealer,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Both entities operate out of the same office in New York and use the same contact information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13, 21-26. Plaintiffs allege that TriPoint Global and TriPoint Capital operate together.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Elenowitz serves as the senior principal and Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of TriPoint Global and TriPoint Capital as well as their unincorporated affiliate BANQ.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Boswell is the co-founder, President, Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\"), and Chief Compliance Officer (\"CCO\") of TriPoint Global, as well as a Managing Director of TriPoint Capital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Together with Louis Taubman, Elenowitz and Boswell make up the TriPoint Entities' \"Executive Team.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants were part of a Ponzi scheme. According to the complaint, Defendants-along with Joseph Meli, Steven Simmons, Matthew Harriton, and their corporate entities-raised approximately $81 million from at least 125 investors for purported investments in ticket reselling enterprises in order to enrich themselves. FAC \u00b6 1. Meli, Simmons, Hamilton and their corporate entities are currently facing a range of criminal and SEC charges related to this conduct.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   &amp; n.1. Essentially, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants convinced Plaintiffs to invest in the ticket resale business without conducting the necessary due diligence, and without disclosing that they were earning commissions from the Ponzi operators for soliciting investments in that business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. January 11, 2016 Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 11, 2016, Blank and Elenowitz met at a restaurant to discuss the possibility of developing a business relationship. FAC \u00b6 30. Through this relationship, Defendants would provide financial advisory services and assist Plaintiffs in finding investment opportunities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the meeting, Blank informed Elenowitz that he \"had no appetite for high risk investments\" and that \"due diligence and safe investments would be the primary considerations in determining whether [Plaintiffs] would authorize the trusts he directed to make investments with [TriPoint].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Elenowitz made a series of material misstatements to Blank in response. First, Elenowitz represented himself as a trusted advisor that focused on protecting his clients and investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Second, Elenowitz stated that the ticket resale business was secure. Elenowitz represented that the ticket resale business was a \"no-brainer,\" Blank \"can't lose,\" any investments would \"fully meet [Plaintiff's] stated requirements,\" and such investments were the \"the safest and\n   most conservative investments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38, 42. Specifically, Elenowitz conveyed that the investment was safe because the \"tickets had intrinsic value,\" and thus \"could always be sold at 'face value' \" and, further, the operators of the investment scheme \"had purchased solid insurance in case of event cancellations,\" meaning \"all investors were fully covered should there even be one cancellation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Third, Elenowitz did not reveal that TriPoint Global was a licensed broker-dealer that was acting as a promoter for the operators of the alleged Ponzi scheme and was receiving commissions for recommending investments in the ticket resale business.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51; 67. To the contrary, Elenowitz told Blank that Defendants would forgo commissions on Plaintiffs' investments to establish a long term business and investment relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Finally, Elenowitz represented that he and TriPoint conducted investigations into, and due diligence of, the ticket resale business. Elenowitz emphasized to Blank that the TriPoint Entities \"conducted complete due diligence on every proposed investment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Indeed, he \"personally reviewed and analyzed the ticket resale companies' financial statements and business records to ensure that all corporate governance was handled appropriately including ensuring that the operators were handling financial and related issues in a customary and prudent manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43 (\"the TriPoint team reviewed the business records and documents to support the purchase and sale of the millions of dollars of event tickets\"). Elenowitz further represented that, in addition to conducting due diligence, he \"personally knew the owners of the ticket resale business\" and met with them regularly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. He also stated that two of his partners and many TriPoint clients have been invested in the ticket resale business, \"always receiving the promised returns.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Also at this meeting, Elenowitz invited Blank to \"take a look at the three TriPoint websites, including TriPoint Advisory, TriPoint Global and BANQ.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. At various points during 2016, Blank reviewed TriPoint's websites and relied upon the information, especially TriPoint's pronouncement that they provide \"Trusted Advice\" and have \"specialized practices in capital markets, advisory, corporate consulting ... corporate governance and compliance services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. January to December 2016 Conversations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Elenowitz made similar representations at various times between January and December 2016. For instance, Elenowitz represented that he would \"have [Blank's] back and make sure that every investment was fully and completely vetted, reviewed and investigated before [Elenowitz] and TriPoint would make a recommendation to [Plaintiffs]\" to make an investment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Indeed, Elenowitz represented that he and TriPoint were \"uniquely positioned to assist\" Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. The \"TriPoint Business Model\" of the three experienced professionals would work together \"to ensure that all investments were fully vetted and investigated\" and there \"would be regular evaluations concerning the issuer's representations about them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Defendants continually represented to Plaintiffs that their various companies would act together to provide Plaintiffs with \"continued review, oversight, and investigation\" of Plaintiffs' investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. They specified that they \"appl[ied] financial and accounting tests to verify receipts and the subject ticket business activities,\" \"examin[ed] the Ponzi Operators' books and records,\" and \"attend[ed] regular meetings to 'check in' with the Ponzi Operators and to monitor business activity and performance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that, in reality, this due diligence was either not performed or not reasonably undertaken, and as such Defendants \"had no reasonable basis whatsoever to recommend\" these investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Investments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Blank made his first investment in ticket resales around March 14, 2016. Elenowitz had told Blank that he was able to get him two of the \"best and most sought after ticket funds\"-\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   and Adele-but \"only if [Blank] also invested in the 'Main Fund.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Accordingly, Blank invested $300,000 that would be split evenly between the '\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   Fund,' 'Main Fund,' and 'Desert Trip Fund.'\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   From March through December 2016, Blank regularly checked in and spoke with Elenowitz, who continued to assure Blank that \"the ticket business was in great shape,\" Plaintiffs' investments were sound, and Defendants were conducting \"regular review of the ticket business\" which \"revealed absolutely no concern or red flags.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-55. After continually receiving assurances from Elenowitz, around August 10, 2016 Plaintiffs invested an additional $1,200,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that they relied on the Defendants' misrepresentations and omissions in deciding to invest in the ticket resale scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Those misrepresentations, in conjunction with Defendants' \"known failure to conduct a reasonable review and investigation\" of the \"Ponzi Operators\" and their business, resulted in \"the misappropriation of millions of dollars\" raised from investors, including Plaintiffs' $1,500,000 investment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action on February 6, 2017. ECF No. 1. On March 21, 2017, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. ECF No. 22 (\"FAC\"). On October 6, 2017, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. ECF Nos. 43 (\"Boswell Mem\"), 45 (\"Elenowitz Mem\"), 47 (\"TriPoint Capital Mem\"), 49 (\"TriPoint Global Mem\"). Plaintiffs filed their opposition brief on November 6, 2017. ECF No. 54 (\"Pl.

However, some of Elenowitz' statements are materially false or misleading, while others fail to meet the pleading standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, statements regarding the extent of Defendants' investigations into the ticket business and due diligence are actionable. As Plaintiffs allege, such statements are false or misleading because Elenowitz either (1) misrepresented that he conducted due diligence, as any reasonable investigation would have revealed the nature of the Ponzi scheme, or (2) conducted an investigation and affirmatively misrepresented that the investment was sound. Such misrepresentations are material because they would have misled a reasonable investor. Indeed, when considering similar claims against Elenowitz, Boswell, and TriPoint Global, The Honorable Judge Koetl concluded that representations that \"TriPoint\n   had vetted and completed full due diligence related to the ticket investment and the companies offering the investment\" were materially misleading.\n   <em>\n    I.B.Trading\n   </em>\n   , 280 F.Supp.3d at 537.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, Elenowitz' assertions that the ticket resale business was a \"no-brainer,\" \"recession proof,\" and a \"can't lose\" investment are not materially misleading.

Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the group pleading doctrine survives\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , it would not apply here because \"it is far from obvious that senior corporate officers would be involved in drafting text for a corporate website.\"\n   <em>\n    DeAngelis v.

They contend that such reliance was reasonable because Blank developed a relationship of trust with Defendants, and because Defendants, both in person and via their website that they promoted, touted their expertise. Further, they argue that reliance is presumed here because Defendants omitted material facts that they had a duty to disclose-namely, that they did not conduct adequate due diligence and were receiving commissions for encouraging their investments. Defendants respond that (1) since Plaintiffs have not alleged a material misstatement, they cannot allege reliance, (2), in any event, as sophisticated investors Plaintiffs' reliance was unreasonable, and (3) since the complaint only alleges conversations with Blank, other Plaintiffs cannot allege reasonable reliance. For the first time in their reply papers, Defendants additionally argue that the 875 Holdings, LLC Executive Summary, incorporated into the subscription Agreement, stated that \"the investments entailed a 'high degree of risk.' \" Elenowitz Reply at 5 (citing Ex.

Indeed, since Elenowitz failed to disclose material facts, reasonable reliance is presumed. In any event, and even assuming Plaintiffs are sophisticated investors, this Court determines that Plaintiffs' reliance on an ostensibly trustworthy financial advisor was reasonable. Further, even though Elenowitz only met with Blank, \"[i]ndirect reliance is established if (1) the plaintiff received the information\n   from someone who had received it from the defendant, and (2) the defendant intended the misrepresentation to be conveyed to the plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    I.B.Trading\n   </em>\n   , 280 F.Supp.3d at 539 (citation omitted). During conversations with Elenowitz, Blank represented that he was the trustee of the Gift Trust Plaintiffs. FAC \u00b6 35.

Indeed, Defendants accepted money from all Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.
