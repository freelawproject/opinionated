Plaintiffs Bashas' Inc., Marc Glassman, Inc., and 99 Cents Only Stores LLC are businesses that have purchased packaged seafood from the three largest domestic producers of packaged seafood products. (\"Bashas Compl.,\" No. 17-CV-2487, ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff the Cherokee Nation is a federally recognized sovereign Indian nation and brings this action in its proprietary capacity and under its\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   authority. (First Am. Compl. (\"Nation FAC\"), ECF No. 823, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining Plaintiffs have been divided into four tracks: (1) Direct Action Plaintiffs, who are direct purchasers proceeding against Defendants individually; (2) Direct Purchaser Plaintiffs, who are direct purchasers proceeding on behalf of a putative class; (3) Indirect Purchaser Commercial Food Preparer Plaintiffs (\"CFPs\"), who are indirect purchasers proceeding on behalf of a putative class; and (4) Indirect Purchaser End Payer Plaintiffs (\"EPPs\"), who are indirect purchasers proceeding on behalf of a putative class. The various civil actions relating to this conspiracy were consolidated in a multi-district litigation (\"MDL\") and centralized pretrial proceedings to this Court on December 9, 2015, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Transfer Order, ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This particular aspect of the MDL deals with three Defendants, who are specially appearing: Lion Capital LLP, Lion Capital (Americas), Inc., and Big Catch Cayman LP. Defendant Lion Capital LLP (\"Lion Capital\") is a British private equity firm organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"). (Bashas Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 270; MTD 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lion Capital contends it does not have any offices, employees, or operations in the United States and its only U.S.-based asset is Lion Capital (Americas), Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Declaration of Simon Brown (\"Brown Decl.\"), ECF No. 997-2, \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant Lion Capital (Americas), Inc. (\"Lion Americas\") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Santa Monica, California. (MTD 11.) Lion Americas moved its office from New York to Santa Monica in October 2012. Lion Americas provides investment advice regarding investments in North America to Lion Capital, which Lion Capital considers on behalf of the investment funds that it manages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant Big Catch Cayman LP (\"Big Catch\") is a holding company organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and has no offices or employees. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 272; MTD 11.) Big Catch's only assets are its interest in Bumble Bee Holdco SCA, a subsidiary and owner of Bumble Bee's equity, and its interest in an unrelated technology company. (MTD 11.) Plaintiffs allege that Lion Capital owns a majority share of Big Catch. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 272.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Pre-Purchase Activities and Lion's Purchase of Bumble Bee\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Bashas Plaintiffs allege that Lion Capital purchased Bumble Bee in December 2010 from a private equity firm. Centre Partners Management LLC, for $980 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 270.) Plaintiffs further allege on information and belief that Lion Capital had access to Bumble Bee's financial and other records in the course of due diligence that it conducted for the acquisition. This, along with access to Bumble Bee senior executives, allegedly caused Lion Capital to learn of the ongoing conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 277.) In November 2010, Lion Americas executive Eric Lindberg\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   told Bumble Bee CEO Christopher Lischewski that he was going to Asia to meet with representatives of both Dongwon and Thai Union, who are also defendants in this MDL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 38, 278.) Lischewski responded to Lindberg saying a [Redacted] (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lion Capital's purchase of Bumble Bee was through a leveraged buyout (\"LBO\") by taking out debt secured only by Bumble Bee's assets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 300.) Lion Capital structured the LBO by creating an acquisition company to borrow money to acquire the subsidiary. Bumble Bee, and then placed the debt on Bumble Bee's books. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, when Lion Capital completed the transaction, Bumble Bee had total liabilities of [Redacted] and total assets of [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 301.) Plaintiffs allege that Lion Capital was aware of the conspiracy and therefore undercapitalized Bumble Bee so that Bumble Bee would be unable to satisfy any judgment against it in the event the conspiracy was ever detected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 300.) Plaintiffs allege that before the Lion acquisition. Bumble Bee had a debt to total capital ratio of approximately sixty percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 304.) According to Plaintiffs, Lion intentionally undercapitalized Bumble Bee as evidenced by the fact that Bumble Bee has a debt to total capital ratio of nearly ninety percent after acquisition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs contend that but for the supra-competitive profits earned by Bumble Bee, it would not have been able to satisfy its debt obligations and would have instead defaulted by the end of 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 305.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Post-Purchase Activities by Lion Entities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that after purchasing Bumble Bee, Lion Capital team members became \"intimately familiar with Bumble Bee's business\" and demonstrated that knowledge by regularly reporting facts concerning Bumble Bee to investors as part of periodic portfolio reviews. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 280.) And, according to Plaintiffs, Lion Capital's acquisition of Bumble Bee, while Bumble Bee was earning \"supra-competitive profits,\" positioned Lion to realize an increase in Bumble Bee's market value and eventual sale price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 279.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to receiving information, Plaintiffs allege Lion Capital took an active role in the ongoing conspiracy after [Redacted] (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 283-84.) Lindberg also met with Thai Union's chief executive in January 2011, where Plaintiffs allege \"they discussed the conspiracy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 284.) In the months following Lion's purchase of Bumble Bee and Lindberg's meetings, defendants Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee, and Del Monte/StarKist agreed to increase their prices in May 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 285.) By the fall 2011, Chicken of the Sea, Bumble Bee, and StarKist increased their efforts to police each other's promotional pricing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lion allegedly took an active role in enforcement as evidenced by Lindberg deciding to meet again with senior at Dongwon. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 286.) [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Bumble Bee continued to keep the Lion entities informed of anticompetitive behavior; for example, [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 287.) However, [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 287 n.10.) [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Bumble Bee increased its prices on January 17, 2018. [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 288.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On February 3, 2012, Lindberg sent an email response to an executive at Thai Union, who had asked Lindberg if he had suggestions how they could \"[Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 289.) Lindberg's email stated: [Redacted].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On [Redacted] as well as an agreement between the defendants not to label their packaged tuna as \"FAD-free.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 290.) [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 291.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Next, in March 2012, [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 293.) According to Plaintiffs, [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Nonetheless, Lindberg encouraged Lischewski to make a statement and said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Redacted].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).) [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 294.) In addition to Mr. Lindberg's meetings and communications, [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 296.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In December 2014, Lion was able to report Bumble Bee's earnings (i.e., its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization or \"EBITDA\") were a \"record-breaking $150 Million,\" based on revenue of $1 billion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 297.) Plaintiffs allege the \"record-breaking\" financial performance was due to the ongoing conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On or about December 18, 2014, Thai Union announced that it intended to acquire Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 279.) As part of the acquisition process, Thai Union and Bumble Bee submitted their proposal to the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"). The merger review apparently led to a criminal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Department of Justice Investigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Since at least 2015, various defendants have been under criminal investigation for antitrust violations as evidenced by Thai Union Group's confirmation it received a subpoena and was fully cooperating with a DOJ investigation. (Nation FAC \u00b6 214.) On July 23, 2015, Bumble Bee publicly acknowledged receipt of a grand jury subpoena. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 217.) On December 3, 2015, Thai Union Group announced it was terminating its acquisition of Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) And, the DOJ issued a press release stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Consumers are better off without this deal,\" said Assistant Attorney General Bill Baer [ (\"Baer\") ] of the department's Antitrust Division. \"Our investigation convinced us-and the parties knew or should have known from the get go-that the market is not functioning competitively today, and further consolidation would only make things worse.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 7, 2016, the DOJ filed a criminal information against Scott Cameron, Bumble Bee Senior Vice President, who pled guilty on January 25, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 221.) On December 21, 2016, the DOJ filed a criminal information against Ken Worsham, also a Bumble Bee Senior Vice President, who pled guilty on March 15, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 222.) The plea agreements for these two defendants, as well as a third executive at StarKist, stated that they participated in a conspiracy within the packaged seafood industry to fix, raise and maintain the price of package seafood in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 224.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On May 8, 2017, DOJ filed criminal information against Bumble Bee and the entity pled guilty to its role in a conspiracy to fix the price of packaged seafood products in the United States on August 2, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 227-28.) Bumble Bee agreed to pay a criminal fine of $25 million, but that amount will increase to a maximum fine of $81.5 million payable by Big Catch, in the event of a sale of Bumble Bee, subject to certain terms and conditions that are sealed in the criminal case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 228.)

In late 2017 and early 2018, plaintiffs filed four motions to amend the scheduling order to add the Lion Defendants, (ECF Nos. 530, 724, 769, 811), which the Court granted in relevant part, (ECF No. 884). The Court's order resulted in amended complaints from a variety of parties. Defendants bring three motions to dismiss based on lack of personal jurisdiction, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), and failure to state a claim, under Rule 12(b)(6), against the Bashas Plaintiffs, the Cherokee Nation, and the EPPs, CFP, DPPs, and DAPs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Plaintiff points to several facts purporting to show Lion Capital's presence in the United States. These include: Lion Capital repeatedly held itself out as having a presence in New York, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (citing LION_6955, at 2; and LION_4213) ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lion Capital availed itself of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by registering two trademarks and using the United States judicial system to defend those trademarks, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); Lion Capital members reside in the United States, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28); and Lion Capital members attended Bumble Bee and industry-related meetings, as well as regular board meetings in California, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The DPP Plaintiffs also argue general jurisdiction is appropriate. They contend that the vast majority of Lion Capital's business focuses on the United States. (DPP Opp'n 24.) For example, Lion Capital previously testified in another lawsuit that two-thirds of its capital comes from U.S. investors and many of the companies owned by Lion Capital's funds are U.S. companies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202998855\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Lion Capital LLP v.

The DPP Plaintiffs also point out that Lion Capital advertises a \"hands on\" approach with respect to its portfolio companies, including Bumble Bee; thus, Defendants are involved in U.S. businesses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)

Paradigmatic Locations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The paradigmatic location for general jurisdiction depends, in part, on the type of entity; for an individual it is her domicile, or for a corporation it is where the corporation is fairly regarded as \"at home.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Goodyear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    564 U.S. at 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"With respect to a corporation, the place of incorporation and principal place of business are 'paradig[m] ... bases for general jurisdiction.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450505,4332867\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/915/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Considering the evidence submitted by the parties, the overwhelming conclusion is that Lion Capital can fairly be regarded at home in the United Kingdom. Lion Capital's principal place of business is the United Kingdom because its primary office is located in London, its employees are located in the U.K., and the majority of Lion Capital's designated members and members are domiciled in the U.K. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 8-11; LION_14427, at 27-39.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lion Capital was organized under the laws of the U.K. (Brown Decl. \u00b6 3.) The clear import is that Lion Capital is at home in the United Kingdom, not the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Big Catch is a holding company with no employees and no offices and was organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. (Brown Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 21.) Its partnership agreement recites that Big Catch's principal place of business was the former Lion Americas' office in New York or wherever the general partner designates. (LION_14788, at 794.) Defendants maintain that the New York address is simply a mailing address and is insufficient for general jurisdiction. (MTD 18 n.5 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Hydroxycut Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202998855\">\n    2010 WL 2998855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 ).) Plaintiff's only counterargument is that the partnership agreement says \"principal place of business,\" thus Big Catch must have a principal place of business in New York. (Nation Opp'n 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court agrees with Defendants as to Big Catch. Big Catch has no office of its own; it listed Lion Americas' New York office as its principal place of business in the general partnership agreement. But, the New York office is simply a mailing address for Big Catch. This is evident because the partnership agreement says \"c/o\" or care of the New York address and there is no indication whether or not Big Catch conducts independent activities there. Big Catch is merely a holding company and designating an already existing office to act as a mailing address does not confer general personal jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court finds neither Lion Capital nor Big Catch is at home in the United States under the two paradigmatic locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   b. Exceptional Case Requirement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, the Court turns to the exceptional case requirement; two cases illustrate the requirements to apply general jurisdiction. In\n   <em>\n    Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n    466 U.S. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a Texas state court did not have general personal jurisdiction over a Colombian corporation. There, the corporation did not have a place of business in Texas and was never licensed to do business in Texas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n    at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the contacts amounted to the chief executive traveling to Houston for negotiations, accepting checks drawn from a Houston bank, purchasing helicopters from a Texas corporation, and sending personnel to Texas for training.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court held that these contacts were insufficient to satisfy the due process requirements of personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n    at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200640\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/408/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, in\n   <em>\n    Ranza v. Nike, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that no general personal jurisdiction existed in Oregon where a subsidiary sent employees and products to Oregon and engaged in some business there.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n    793 F.3d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (9th Cir. 2015). Instead, the relevant inquiry \"examines a corporation's activities worldwide-not just the extent of its contacts in the forum state-to determine where it can be rightly considered at home.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 n.20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   court applied\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   and recognized that Nike's Dutch-based subsidiary's activities in Oregon were limited compared to its extensive European contacts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, the subsidiary could not be considered at home in Oregon.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1069-70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, Lion Capital's designated member allegedly traveled to the United States to attend board of directors' meetings. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LION_4334.) Lion Capital availed itself of the PTO by registering two trademarks and later defended those trademarks in the U.S. judicial system. Lion members attending board meetings are similar to the facts of\n   <em>\n    Helicopteros\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   because, like those cases, Lion's executive(s) traveled to the relevant forum. And, using the PTO and the courts to defend a trademark is similar to conducting limited business in\n   <em>\n    Helicopteros\n   </em>\n   (purchasing helicopters) and\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   (sending products to Oregon). Neither is sufficient to meet the exceptional case requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The presence and holding out to the public of the office in New York and, later, Los Angeles, presents a more viable contact to assess the exceptional case requirement. It is clear that Lion Capital held out Lion Americas' North American office as belonging to Lion Capital generally or Lion Capital specifically. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LION_6955, at 2; LION_4213.) Yet, post-\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , the presence of offices in the forum state does not, by itself, render a defendant subject to general jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Sotomayor, J., concurring in the judgment) (\"[T]he majority holds today that Daimler is not subject to general jurisdiction in California despite its multiple offices, continuous operations, and billions of dollars' worth of sales there.\"). Lion Capital held out the North America office as one of its own, but the North American office was not Lion Capital's primary office. Its London office was and is home to the majority of Lion Capital employees and was where the Lion members ultimately directed operations. (Brown Decl. \u00b6 4.) Lion Capital manages its four investment funds from the London office because, as Plaintiffs recognize, Lion Americas is a \"non-discretionary investment advisor\" to Lion Capital.

The DPP Plaintiffs elucidate evidence demonstrating that two-thirds of Lion Capital's capital is from U.S. investors and Lion Capital's portfolio companies include U.S. and California-based companies. (DPP Opp'n 24-25.)

Unity of Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   a. Plaintiffs' Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiffs elucidate three broad categories of control by Lion Capital over Lion Americas. First, Plaintiffs rely on the method by which Lion Capital does business and holds itself out to the public. For example, Lion Capital held itself out as\n   having offices in both London and New York, and later California. (Nation Opp'n 11 (citing LION_6955, at 2; LION_4213; LION_28076);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 28 (citing LION_6955, at 2); DPP Opp'n 27-28.) At least eight of Lion Capital's members\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   lived, worked, and were domiciled in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing LION_14427);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 29 (citing, e.g., LION_12617).) And, one of Lion Capital's designated members allegedly attended at least nine board meetings in California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (citing, e.g., LION_4334).) The Cherokee Nation points to Lion Capital's own admission that Lion Americas lacks any authority to make any investment decisions because Lion Americas is a \"non-discretionary investment advisor\" to Lion Capital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (quoting MTD 10-11).) The DPP Plaintiffs contend that Lion Capital entered into a \"management agreement\" with Bumble Bee to provide \"advisory services,\" but Lion Americas employees were the ones providing the advisory services. (DPP Opp'n 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, several employees had roles in both Lion Capital and Lion Americas. For example, Mr. Richard Lewis was the director of Lion Capital Management Services Limited, which is a Lion Capital member; Mr. Lewis was also the Chief Compliance Officer of Lion Americas. (Nation Opp'n 14 (citing LION_14076, at 90).) And, Mr. Rory O'Connor was designated as Lion Americas' agent for service of process, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 (citing LION_14062) ), while also a Lion Capital member, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (citing LION_14360, at 377) ). Lion's websites of these gentlemen do not distinguish between Lion Capital and Lion Americas. (DPP Opp'n 28-29.) And, Lion Capital has disclosed that it was paying wages to select Lion Americas' employees at the same time Lion Americas was paying those individuals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (citing Brown Decl., Ex. E).) Finally, Lion Capital's annual return identified Lion Americas' executives (Chang and Capps) as members of Lion Capital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Declaration of Samantha Stein (\"Stein Decl.\"), Ex. 34, ECF No. 1292-13).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Third, Lion Capital submitted a Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Form ADV. That form identified Lion Americas as a \"related person\" controlled by Lion Capital, states the two entities are under common control, and states the two entities share supervised persons. (Nation Opp'n 29 (citing LION_14557, at 563; and LION_14667, at 673-74).) Further, the same filing disclosed that Lion Americas kept its \"books and records\" with Lion Capital (DPP Opp'n 27.) Based on this evidence, Plaintiffs conclude that Lion Capital controls Lion Americas such that personal jurisdiction would be appropriate over Lion Capital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   b. Defendants' Reply\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs fail to establish unity of interest. (Four Track Reply 17.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Brown declared that Lion Americas and Lion Capital maintain strict divisions between their management structures. (Brown Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30.) Defendants contend that none of Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary rebut this testimony. First, there is an SEC filing that purports to\n   show \"control\" of Lion Americas by Lion Capital Defendants state that \"ownership of securities\" is sufficient to satisfy the SEC's definition of control and, here, Lion America's is a wholly-owned subsidiary, i.e., an asset. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Second, Defendants aver that the existence of common officers and directors between a parent and subsidiary do not demonstrate unity of interest and Plaintiffs fail to rebut the fact that each common officer or director wore the appropriate \"hat\" when making corporate and operational decisions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Sonora Diamond\n   </em>\n   , 83 Cal.

For example, documents produced by Defendants show that Lion Capital and Lion Americas separately compensated their personnel. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Decl., Ex. E.) Thus, the two entities maintained corporate formalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Third, Defendants contend that Lion Americas' oversight of Bumble Bee supports their jurisdictional arguments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20824\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) It was Lion Americas, not Lion Capital that monitored Bumble Bee. Fourth, Defendants argue that a website and email signatures that listed Lion Americas' personnel as working for Lion Capital do not demonstrate control. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Corcoran v.

To ignore the corporate distinction between these two entities, Plaintiffs must demonstrate more than direct involvement in financing and macro-management of the subsidiary; Lion Capital must \"dictate [e]very facet [of Lion Americas'] business.\"\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106203\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/915/#p923\">\n    248 F.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (first alteration in original) (internal quotation and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs point to shared offices between Lion Americas and Lion Capital. It is clear that Lion Americas had an office in New York, which later moved to Los Angeles. It is also certain that both Lion Americas and Lion Capital held out these North America offices as generally belonging to the Lion entities. It is not evident from the record which entity actually owned the offices. Other district courts have found that simply because a parent holds out its subsidiary's office without the parent mentioning that the latter is a separate entity is not definitive evidence that the parent controls day-to-day operations over the subsidiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pokemon Co.

For example, Messrs. Lindberg, Lewis, O'Connor all had roles in both Lion Americas and Lion Capital And, those individuals held themselves out to the public, both on websites and email as working for Lion Capital Yet,\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   both make clear that shared members is not sufficient to establish alter ego liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n    793 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1074\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106203\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/915/#p923\">\n    248 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   927 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kramer Motors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1292642\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/628/1175/#p1177\">\n    628 F.2d at 1177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no alter ego relationship where parent company guaranteed loans for subsidiary, approved major decisions, placed several directors on the subsidiary's board, and was closely involved in pricing decisions);\n   <em>\n    In re Conseco Ins.

Cal. Sept. 30, 2008) (finding insufficient unity of interest where officers shared positions and share the same headquarters). The overlap of board members or executive officers here does not demonstrate that Lion Capital exercised day to day control over the operations of Lion Americas. This conclusion is buttressed by Lion Capital's compensation structure, which demonstrates that the two entities maintained different pay structures. Lion Americas paid Lion Americas' employees; Lion Capital generally did not compensate\n   Lion Americas' employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court is not persuaded by Lion entities sharing a website or email signature. Separate corporate entities that hold themselves out to the public via websites as a singular entity does not demonstrate unity of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corcoran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343638\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/970/#p984\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The remaining evidence submitted by Plaintiffs is likewise unpersuasive. Lion Capital's Form ADV demonstrates that Lion Americas was a \"related person\" and that the two entities are under common control. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LION_14557, at 563; LION_14667, at 673-74.) As the DPP Plaintiffs explain, the SEC defines control as \"[t]he power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of [Lion Americas] whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise.\" (DPP Opp'n 27 (alterations in original).) Directing the management or policies of a wholly owned subsidiary is entirely in line with\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   's admonition that a parent may be involved in managing its subsidiary as long as they maintain corporate formalities necessary for corporate separateness. Moreover, the fact that Lion Capital complied with the SEC's disclosure requirements in the first instance buttresses the conclusion that it observes corporate formalities. Finally, Lion Americas' status as a \"non-discretionary investment advisor\" to Lion Capital does not explain how such a status deviates from the normal parent-subsidiary relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   To summarize the Ninth Circuit's guidance concerning unity of interest: \"A parent corporation may be directly involved in financing and macro-management of its subsidiaries ... without exposing itself to a charge that each subsidiary is merely its alter ego.\"\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n    793 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106203\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/915/#p923\">\n    248 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   927 ). The evidence demonstrates that Lion Capital exercised some level of control over Lion Americas and shared some personnel with it. However, Plaintiffs have not carried their burden to demonstrate that Lion Capital crossed from macro-management to day-to-day control over its subsidiary. The Court finds there was no unity of interest between Lion Americas and Lion Capital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    2. Alter Ego Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The DPP Plaintiffs argue that an inequitable result would follow because Lion Capital would not be held accountable for its acts and involvement in Bumble Bee. (DPP Opp'n 29.) Because Plaintiffs fail to carry their burden to demonstrate unity of interest, the Court does not reach the inequitable result argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Deviating from the rule of corporate separateness is an extreme remedy, sparingly used.\n   <em>\n    Sonora Diamond Corp. v.

Cal. 1995) ). The facts here do not rise to such an extreme level. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate Lion Americas' contact impute general personal jurisdiction to Lion Capital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, even if the Court were to assume that Lion Americas' contacts impute to Lion Capital, there is no still no basis to subject Lion Capital to general jurisdiction because the combined Lion Americas and Lion Capital contacts with the United States are not sufficient to render Lion Capital at home in the United States when considering the entirety of Lion Capital's contacts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/117/\">\n    571 U.S. at 136-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The majority of Lion Capital's partners are domiciled in the U.K. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.) And, Lion Capital manages their investment funds from London; the United States office operates in an advisory capacity. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 12.)

Lion Capital may not have owned the fund that ultimately owned Bumble Bee, but it exercised control over the fund and where the fund directed its investments. Further, Lion Americas executives seemed to think that the Lion entities owned Bumble Bee. In November 2012, Mr. Capps of Lion Americas received an email asking to confirm the Bumble Bee ownership structure including a statement to the effect \"Lion's share is more than 70%.\" (LION_4712.) Capps forwarded the email internally, asking \"Chang, [please] confirm that we all have ownership at the [Bumble Bee] Holdco level.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Chang responded, \"Our ownership ... is at a Cayman LP which sits above Bumble Bee HoldCo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This suggests that Lion Americas believed that they, i.e., the Lion entities, \"owned\" Bumble Bee in some respect. At oral argument, the Bashas Plaintiffs directed the Court to Bumble Bee's criminal plea agreement where the parties to that agreement defined Bumble Bee's \"parent companies\" to include Lion Capital LLP, Lion Americas,\n   and Big Catch. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 55, ECF No. 1247-25, \u00b6 13.) It does not appear that the plea agreement defined \"parent companies,\" but presumably Lion Capital and Lion Americas would not be parties to the plea agreement without some modicum of control over Bumble Bee. In light of the foregoing facts, the Court follows\n   <em>\n    Schwarzkopf\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Tatung\n   </em>\n   and finds that Lion Capital's equitable ownership over Big Catch and Bumble Bee is appropriate in this case.

Defendants' Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants advance three broad arguments why Plaintiffs have not established unity of interest between Bumble Bee and Lion Capital. First, Defendants take issue with Plaintiffs' allegation that Bumble Bee was purposefully undercapitalized by the Lion entities as evidenced by the fact that Bumble Bee maintained a high debt to total capital ratio. (MTD 26 (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6 304).) Defendants cite the proposition that \"[d]ifficulty in enforcing a judgment or collecting a debt does not satisfy th[e] [alter ego] standard.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sonora Diamond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525235\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/83/523/#p539\">\n    83 Cal.

Further, Defendants distinguish this case from cases involving inadequate capitalization because the latter occur \"where the organizers failed to invest any money at all or put up only token amounts; or where the principals reduce an operating corporation to a mere shell by stripping it of its assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Aliya Medcare Fin., LLC v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Second, Defendants assert there is no alter ego liability through the four Lion members who sat on Bumble Bee's board of directors.

Defendants parry Plaintiffs' allegations that Bumble Bee executives received shares in Big Catch, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Bashas' Compl. \u00b6 309) ), by arguing that \"a parent corporation may be directly involved in financing and macro-management of its subsidiaries ... without exposing itself to a charge that each subsidiary is merely its alter ego,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Wady v.

Court's Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As before, the Court examines unity of interest to determine whether \"the parent controls the subsidiary to such a degree as to render the latter the mere instrumentality of the former.\"\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106203\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/915/#p923\">\n    248 F.3d at 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The parties draw different conclusions from generally three categories of facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   First, Plaintiffs argue that the Lion entities' involvement went beyond oversight typical of a portfolio company. This is evident to Plaintiffs because Lion executives received daily, monthly, and other periodic reports regarding Bumble Bee's operations and had direct input into Bumble Bee's business. (Nation Opp'n 38.) Receiving information and providing input on business decisions are exactly the sort of evidence that both the\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   courts examined and held to be insufficient to demonstrate unity of interest. In\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   , the court was presented with evidence demonstrating the parent was involved in \"its subsidiaries' acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditures\" as well as \"formulation of general business policies and strategies applicable to its subsidiaries.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11106203\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/248/915/#p923\">\n    248 F.3d at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   , the parent was \"heavily involved\" in its subsidiary's operations, including but not limited to control over the subsidiary's overall budget, approval authority of large purchases, and operating information tracking systems.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n    793 F.3d at 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In both cases, such a level of active involvement was insufficient to overcome the observance of corporate formalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have not demonstrated that a Lion entity was involved in, for example, hiring and firing decisions, negotiating contracts, making routine purchase decisions, and other routine day-to-day management operations for Bumble Bee.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs cite a single unreported district court opinion for the proposition that receiving reports supports finding alter ego liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1992%20WL%20501273\">\n    1992 WL 501273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. That case has limited applicability; receiving reports was one factor among others the court considered and the reasoning supporting the court's conclusion was not extensive. This Court focuses on the guiding principles from\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   -requiring evidence that the parent dictated every facet of the subsidiary from broad policy to day-to-day decisions. The oversight of Bumble Bee did not rise above the permissible level of oversight outlined in\n   <em>\n    Unocal\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs contend that a Lion entity dominated Bumble Bee's board of directors. As all the parties recognize, several leading cases hold that shared directors, by itself, does not expose the parent corporation to liability for the subsidiary's acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    524 U.S. at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p61\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Am.

Here, Plaintiffs only demonstrate that Lion placed directors on Bumble Bee's board, but does not take the next step to explain how shared directors amounted to unity of\n   interest. Therefore, the Court takes note of the directors Lion placed on Bumble Bee's board, but such a recognition is not dispositive in the analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris Rutsky &amp; Co.

(Nation FAC \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.) Plaintiff alleged that at one point in time Bumble Bee carried over $843 million in debt despite having annual revenues of over $900 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The Cherokee Nation further alleges that Bumble Bee's debt to total capital ratio before Lion's acquisition of Bumble Bee was around sixty percent and after acquisition the debt to capital ratio was around ninety percent from 2010 to 2015, which was well above the food processing industry's average. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44 (including table alleging food processing industry debt to total capital ratios ranging from fifty to forty percent).) The Bashas Plaintiffs allege that but for the \"[Redacted]. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 305.) To wit, [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   These allegations are insufficient to demonstrate the type of undercapitalization necessary to pierce the corporate veil. There is no doubt that Bumble Bee carried a higher debt load post-acquisition than it did pre-acquisition. But, whether Bumble\n   Bee had a high debt leverage does not paint the full picture. \"Adequate capitalization means 'capital reasonably regarded as adequate to enable [the corporation] to operate its business and pay its debts as they mature.' \"\n   <em>\n    Laborers Clean-Up Contract Admin.

Bumble Bee's roughly ninety percent debt to capital ratio does not demonstrate it had insufficient capital to operate its normal business and pay its debts as they matured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Moreover, the level of debt here does not rise to the same level of undercapitalization in the cases Plaintiffs cite. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Slottow\n   </em>\n   , the entity's initial capitalization was $500,000 and its liabilities were $10 million. 10 F.3d at 1360. Thus, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Slottow\n   </em>\n   could not pay its debts. In\n   <em>\n    VIA Technologies\n   </em>\n   , the entity had at most $500,000 in capital compared to anywhere from $400 million to $2 billion in annual sales.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203809382\">\n    2015 WL 3809382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

Here, Plaintiffs generally allege that Bumble Bee carried a high debt to total capital ratio; they do not allege that Bumble Bee could not meet its operating expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The exception to this is an allegation Bumble Bee would have defaulted in 2011 but for the price fixing conspiracy. The basis for Plaintiffs' for the allegation is that the United States Sentencing Guidelines presumes a ten percent surcharge in price fixing cases and if one were to assume Bumble Bee's profits were reduced by ten percent then Bumble Bee would have defaulted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bashas Compl. \u00b6 305 &amp; n.13.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   If a corporation is organized and carries on business without substantial capital in such a way that the corporation is likely to have no sufficient assets available to meet its debts, it is inequitable that shareholders should set up such a flimsy organization to escape personal liability....

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants state that there are no allegation that the meetings were aimed at the United States or resulted in harm to persons in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   b. Plaintiffs' Arguments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that Lion Capital undertook two broad categories of actions: first, managing and oversight of Bumble Bee; second, meeting and communicating in furtherance of the conspiracy. With regard to managing and oversight, Plaintiffs contend Lion Capital placed three executives on Bumble Bee's board of directors, which met in California on a regular basis. (Nation Opp'n 20; Bashas Opp'n 37.) Next, Lindberg, Capps, Chang, and Bondy received regular sales and financial reports from Bumble Bee; Lion executives were also involved in day-to-day operations including implementing new projects. (Nation Opp'n 20-21; Bashas Opp'n 37.) Plaintiffs further allege that after board meetings, Lion and Bumble Bee executives would meet in private sessions and did not record minutes. (Nation Opp'n 21 (citing Nation FAC \u00b6 50).) Lion executives also approved bonuses and were involved in Bumble Bee's 2011 restructuring request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   As to meeting and communications, Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Lindberg and others at the Lion entities communicated with Bumble Bee CEO Lischewski about the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22; Bashas Opp'n 36.) For example, Mr. Lischewski wrote to Messrs. Lindberg and Capps about an April 1, 2012 price increase and forwarded to them emails from other Bumble Bee executives with competitive pricing information, (Nation Opp'n 22 (citing LION_3445-58; LION-3484; LION_12605) ), including an email chain complaining about [Redacted] by competitors, (Bashas Opp'n 36 (quoting Ex. 69) ). Lion Americas executive Chang communicated to Lion Capital general manager Lea that [Redacted]\" (Nation Opp'n 22 (quoting LION_3926).) And, a slide deck prepared for the August 2012 Bumble Bee board of stated \"[Redacted],\" and there was an \"[Redacted].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting LION_4334, at 369, 374).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Next, Mr. Lischewski had longstanding relationships with industry competitors and reported information from those meetings to the Lion entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (citing, e.g., LION_4307).) Mssrs. Lindberg, Smialek, and others from Lion attended industry conferences and corresponded with competitors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing, e.g., LION_6953).) The Bashas Plaintiffs argue that the conspiracy was U.S.-centric; for example, in 2008 Lischewski told Dongwon's CEO that ninety percent of Bumble Bee's sales came from the United States. (Bashas Opp'n 35 (citing Ex. 62; Ex 63, at 875-76).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   c. Court's Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Here, the uncontroverted factual allegations and the record supports Plaintiffs' contention that Lion Capital expressly aimed anticompetitive behavior at the relevant forum, the United States. Before Lion\n   Capital acquired Bumble Bee, Lion Capital executives and partners communicated internally about the packaged seafood market, including the U.S., in the context of purchasing Bumble Bee. (LION_6953.) Lion Capital executives apparently met with market competitors, before acquisition, in London. (LION_7074.) Importantly, Lion Capital's designated member, Mr. Lyndon Lea, and limited members Lindberg, Capps, and Chang, were members of Bumble Bee's board of directors. It is unclear whether Mr. Lea actually attended any board meetings in California;\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, at the very least he received the presentations before the board meetings, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LION_4569; LION_7406), and email summaries after the meetings, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LION_3926; LION_12614). This information included alleged anticompetitive behavior. In March 2012, Mr. Chang, both a Lion Americas employee and Lion Capital limited member, reported to Mr. Lea that \"[a]fter April 1, all three brands will be closely aligned on tuna list pricing\" and offered to call to discuss further. (Nation FAC \u00b6 51; LION_3926.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Mr. Lea continued to communicate with Lion Americas executives concerning Bumble Bee. (LION_1575 (merger and acquisition information); LION_2529 (receiving information on Lindberg's meetings in Bangkok); LION_4714, at 22 (discussing meeting with Lyndon).) On July 30, 2012, Mr. Lindberg sent an email to Mr. Lea in which the former stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   [Redacted]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   (LION_547.) The reference to StarKist being in \"[Redacted]\" with Bumble Bee and \"[Redacted]\" suggests an agreement by Lion Capital to set prices in coordination with Dongwon. Mr. Lea also received information concerning Bumble Bee's 2012 financial results including an increase in net sales following \"the price increases implemented through [2012].\" (LION_12617.) At oral argument, Defendants argued that the express aiming needs to be tortious and suggested none of the conduct business-related conduct elucidated by Plaintiffs was tortious. (ECF No. 1321, at 55) This reasoning depends, in part, on the Court's determinations with regard to liability, i.e., whether Plaintiffs state a federal antitrust claim. If the Court finds the allegations sufficient to state a claim, then the same business activities support an express aiming. Plaintiffs have the burden of establishing express aiming. As will be seen below, the Court has determined that Plaintiffs state a claim for which relief can be granted as to the same conduct at issue here for express aiming.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   section V. Accordingly, the same acts involving Lion Capital partners, discussed below, which support an antitrust violation likewise support a finding of express aiming of anticompetitive behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Western States,\n   </em>\n   Lion Capital executives and partners were involved in the direction and control of Bumble Bee during the relevant period of the conspiracy. They received information from their Lion Americas counterparts and communicated with Lion Americas about the alleged conspiracy. Some members\n   of Lion Americas were also Lion Capital partners. Bumble Bee is a U.S.-based company and Defendant Lion Capital's activities concerning Bumble Bee were expressly aimed at the United States. Accordingly, the Court finds Lion Capital meets the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Calder\n   </em>\n   effects test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <em>\n    3.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) Plaintiffs conclude that personal jurisdiction is reasonable based on California's interest in enforcing antitrust laws, the interest of Plaintiffs in adjudicating the dispute where they were harmed, the importance of Bumble Bee to the local economy, and that any alternative forum would not provide effective relief for Plaintiffs.

Lion Capital manages the investment funds that purchased and continues to own Bumble Bee. Lion Americas oversees Bumble Bee. Both entities had employees on Bumble Bee's board of directors. By undertaking these actions, Defendants have interjected themselves into the forum. The Court is mindful of the burden that would be imposed on Lion Capital to appear in California. Plaintiffs' assurances that the majority of relevant witnesses and documents reside with Bumble Bee would, at most, support finding personal jurisdiction over Bumble Bee and Lion Americas.

Further, the MDL has progressed before this Court for several years, which supports Plaintiffs' interests in convenient and effective relief-judicial economy would not be served if Plaintiffs litigated against Lion Capital in the United Kingdom. Finally, Defendants do not put forward arguments concerning any conflict with the United Kingdom or the existence of an alternative forum, though the Court assumes that the U.K. likely could provide effective relief. In sum, the Court finds that finding personal jurisdiction over Lion Capital would comport with fair play and substantial justice. The Court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over Lion Capital.

In addressing this issue, Plaintiffs maintain Big Catch is subject to personal jurisdiction because Big Catch is the alter ego of Bumble Bee. (Bashas Opp'n 33; DPP Opp'n 20.) The DPP Plaintiffs also submit that Big Catch is the alter ego of Lion Capital\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   (DPP Opp'n 20.) And, the Cherokee Nation advances a theory where \"Big Catch can only act through its shareholders\" and therefore should be subject to general personal jurisdiction.

Whether Bumble Bee or Lion Capital's Contacts Impute to Big Catch\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   This Court has general personal jurisdiction over Bumble Bee because its principal place of business is in the United States, specifically San Diego, California, and is incorporated in Delaware. (Nation FAC \u00b6 34; Bashas Compl. \u00b6 19.) Additionally, the Court has determined that it has specific personal jurisdiction over Lion Capital. Plaintiffs advance several arguments why those respective contacts should impute to Big Catch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <em>\n    1. Plaintiffs' Argument\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The Cherokee Nation contends that Big Catch has systematic and continuous contacts\n   with California based on its ownership of Bumble Bee. (Nation Opp'n 30.) It further argues that Big Catch can only act through its shareholders or its subsidiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"956550\" index=\"323\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/556/406/#p419\">\n    556 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   419 ).) Fifty-four of Big Catch's sixty-seven owners are U.S. citizens. Ten of those owners are Bumble Bee executives. And, one hundred percent of Big Catch's revenue comes from Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing LION_14788, at 848-915, 937-42).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Bashas Plaintiffs assert that Big Catch is a shell company and because shell companies are disregarded for purposes of personal jurisdiction\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   then the acts taken by Bumble Bee and its executives in furtherance of the conspiracy imputes to Big Catch. (Bashas Opp'n 38.) They also argue Big Catch is an alter ego of Bumble Bee and Lion Capital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.) Plaintiffs assert that a \"complex corporate structure\" used to establish Big Catch and purchase Bumble Bee translates into Lion Capital dominating Big Catch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   The DPP Plaintiffs maintain that both Big Catch and Lion Capital are the alter egos of Bumble Bee. The DPP Plaintiffs advance three general arguments to demonstrate unity of interest between Bumble Bee and Big Catch. First, Big Catch was established by Lion Capital for the purpose of purchasing Bumble Bee and has no presence outside of Lion and Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (citing Third Am. Consolidated Compl. (\"TACC\"), ECF No. 911, \u00b6 45).) To that end, Big Catch does not have any employees of its own and does not engage in any business operations separate from Lion Capital and Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing TACC \u00b6 37).) Second, Plaintiffs maintain that Bumble Bee and Lion executives make decisions for Big Catch and the only business Big Catch conducts is during Bumble Bee board meetings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"956550\" index=\"324\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/556/406/#p419\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) As a subset of the decisions made by Bumble Bee and Lion Capital, executives from those entities awarded shares in Big Catch as part of a \"management incentive plan,\" which created an equity interest in Big Catch for Bumble Bee employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.) Plaintiffs allege that the equity interests were a conduit to transfer Bumble Bee profits to those persons holding Big Catch stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Third, the DPP Plaintiffs state that Big Catch is liable to pay a portion of Bumble Bee's criminal fine and argue Bumble Bee could not obligate Big Catch to guarantee the criminal fine unless Bumble Bee had control over Big Catch. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"956550\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/556/406/#p419\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs conclude that it would be inequitable to allow Big Catch to escape potential judgment while at the same time receiving allegedly illicit profits from the price fixing conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"956550\" index=\"326\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/556/406/#p419\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Defendants refute the unity of interest argument by citing the proposition that a holding company is not presumed to be an alter ego of its subsidiary because it does not conduct independent business. (Four Track Reply 20 (citing\n   <em>\n    Corcoran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343638\" index=\"327\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/970/#p984\">\n    169 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   984 ; and\n   <em>\n    China Basin Props., Ltd. v.

Bumble Bee and Big Catch are separate legal entities. Therefore, Plaintiffs must demonstrate that Bumble Bee's contacts impute to Big Catch. The law is clear that the general personal jurisdiction of a subsidiary entity cannot be imputed to a parent entity under an agency theory.\n   <em>\n    Daimler\n   </em>\n   , 571 U.S. at 135-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12700978,12585500\" index=\"331\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/746/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ranza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278887\" index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1059/#p1070\">\n    793 F.3d at 1071\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only way to impute Bumble Bee's general personal jurisdiction to Big Catch is if Bumble Bee is an alter ego of Big Catch. The cases cited by the Bashas Plaintiffs at oral argument and in their brief, for example, stand for the same proposition: courts will disregard a holding company's status for jurisdiction only when an alter ego relationship exists. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bashas Opp'n 33 n.25 (citing, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Howard v.

Generally, the presence or citizenship of a limited partner, without more, is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction over the limited partnership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goforit Entm't LLC v.

The\n   <em>\n    Goforit\n   </em>\n   court went on to state, \"[t]he argument with respect to a limited partner is even weaker than as to a general partner, especially where, as here, there is record evidence regarding the lack of power of the limited partners in the partnership.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869179\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/513/1325/#p1331\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869179\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/513/1325/#p1331\">\n    at 1332-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The Court agrees with this approach and examines Big Catch's partnership agreement vis-\u00e0-vis its limited partners. According to Big Catch's organizing document, it has several classes of partners; general partners have voting interests in the partnership. Limited partners (who appear to be shareholders) have non-voting interests and are further divided into Classes A, B, and C. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 42, at 795.) Furthermore, the general partner has the \"exclusive right to manage and control the business and affairs of the Partnership.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 804.)

The complaint goes on to allege that Big Catch was set up to transfer Bumble Bee's operating profits out of Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45:\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bashas Compl. \u00b6 272 (\"[Redacted]....\").) The Bashas Plaintiffs allege that [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bashas Compl. \u00b6 316.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The DPP Plaintiffs also argue that further inequity is evidenced by the criminal guilty plea entered by Bumble Bee in the Northern District. The DOJ Sentencing Memorandum imposes an additional fine\n   on Bumble Bee, to be paid by Big Catch, in the event of a qualifying sale of Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., Ex. 10, at 18.) The DPP Plaintiffs contend Big Catch would receive the proceeds of any sale of Bumble Bee and that if the DOJ expressed an interest in preventing a windfall to investors, then this Court should find an inequitable result. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DPP Opp'n 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Defendants maintain that Plaintiffs do not allege facts to support the conclusory allegations. (MTD 29.) Thus, according to Defendants, Plaintiffs do not allege that Lion Capital ever collected the annual payment and admit that the payment was waived for some periods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6 297 n.12).) Defendants respond to the criminal guilty plea argument by stating that Bumble Bee's sale is hypothetical and Big Catch is not a defendant in any criminal proceedings. (Reply 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The Court begins by noting that establishing a tax efficient structure to acquire a company is a routine business practice and does not establish inequity. Furthermore, Plaintiffs have not connected the annual EBITDA monitoring fees to Big Catch; instead, it appears that Lion Capital received the fees from Bumble Bee and there are no allegations connecting the fees to Big Catch. More persuasive, however, are the allegations concerning Bumble Bee's criminal fine. Plaintiffs allege the Sentencing Guidelines range was between $136.2 million and $272.4 million. (TACC \u00b6 40.) Because Bumble Bee was unable to pay the full Guidelines penalty, the parties agreed that Bumble Bee would pay a $25 million fine and Big Catch guaranteed a fine of up to $81.5 million if Bumble Bee is sold, subject to undisclosed terms and conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Stein Decl., Ex. 10, at 14-17.) While Defendants are correct that such a sale has not occurred to date, the motivating concern behind the fine guarantee was \"to prevent an unjust outcome whereby Bumble Bee receives a reduction in its criminal fine due to its inability to pay and then shortly thereafter is sold, thereby eliminating the inability to pay.\" (Stein Decl., Ex. 10, at 18.) The DOJ Sentencing Memorandum went on to elaborate, \"[b]y having Big Catch pay any additional fine, the government is essentially making a claim to a portion of the proceeds of a qualifying sale of Bumble Bee and ensuring that such a payment would be made before any distribution of the proceeds of the sale to investors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The government's claim to the proceeds of the sale ultimately depends on Bumble Bee's admission to participation in a criminal price fixing conspiracy. The investors, who would ostensibly reap the windfall of a sale, are Lion Capital's fund investors. Thus, there is a direct connection between preventing Lion Capital's investors from profiting from the price fixing conspiracy. And, Big Catch is the vehicle by which the government is preventing an injustice from occurring. This is sufficient for alleging an unjust result because as this Court has previously held, \"at this early stage of litigation Plaintiffs need not\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   that [Big Catch] was in fact [Lion Capital's] alter ego; instead, Plaintiffs here only need to plausibly allege that an inequitable result will follow if the corporate form is not discarded.\" (ECF No. 492, at 29.) The Court finds that Big Catch is the alter ego of Lion Capital and because Lion Capital is subject to Court's specific jurisdiction then the Lion Capital's contacts impute to Big Catch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Fair Play and Substantial Justice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The Court's finding that Lion Capital's contacts impute to Big Catch must still comport with fair play and substantial justice, i.e., that it would be reasonable to assert jurisdiction. Big Catch has no independent status outside of Lion Capital; it\n   has no offices and no employees. If it is reasonable to subject Lion Capital to personal jurisdiction, then it would also be reasonable to subject Big Catch to the same jurisdiction under the same analysis.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   section II.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that Big Catch is subject to the Court's personal jurisdiction through Lion Capital's specific jurisdiction contacts. Therefore, the Court does not reach various arguments advanced by Plaintiffs, including Big Catch consented to personal jurisdiction and Big Catch purposefully availed itself of the forum.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.)

The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to Dismiss to the extent they seek to dismiss the Indirect Plaintiffs' state law claims. The Court now turns to Defendants' second argument: that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim for which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Whether Plaintiffs State a Claim Against the Lion Entities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Plaintiffs bring a cause of action under section one of the Sherman Act. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bashas Compl. \u00b6 322; Nation FAC \u00b6 248.) Defendants advance two broad theses why Plaintiffs fail to state a claim. First, they contend that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim against the Lion entities under an alter ego theory. (MTD 24.) Second, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim that Defendants are direct participants in the alleged conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The parties' arguments with regard to alter ego liability are coextensive with the personal jurisdiction alter ego arguments. Therefore, the Court's prior findings apply with equal weight here. The Court finds no alter ego liability between Bumble Bee and any Lion entity. The Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Big Catch is the alter ego of Lion Capital. With that in mind, the Court turns to the alleged direct participation in the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Defendants' Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Defendants posit three broad arguments why Plaintiffs fail to state a claim. First, Plaintiffs' theory is implausible and makes no economic sense. (MTD 30.) Second, the allegations concerning actions taken by non-Lion defendants do not support direct participation by Lion Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) Third, the allegations concerning actions taken by Lion Defendants themselves do not show direct and independent participation in the alleged conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   <em>\n    1. Economic Sense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Plaintiffs' assert that Defendants uncovered the alleged price fixing conspiracy during due diligence for the Bumble Bee acquisition and then proceeded to direct a Lion investment fund to purchase Bumble Bee for the purposes of realizing supra-competitive profits from Bumble Bee's business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30 (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6 279).) Defendants argue this theory is implausible; specifically, it would make no economic sense for a private equity firm to risk its reputation so that one of its portfolio companies could earn profits from an illegal conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Defendants, Plaintiffs fail to allege the Lion entities have \"any rational motive to join the alleged conspiracy\" or that \"the conduct alleged 'was consistent with the [Lion Entities'] independent interest.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Cascades Comput. Innovation LLC v.

Cal. Jan. 24, 2013) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <em>\n    2. Actions Concerning Non-Lion Actors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege actions taken by non-Lion, i.e., Bumble Bee, actors. As an initial matter, Defendants take issue with Plaintiffs' group pleading, i.e., Plaintiffs' allegations are directed towards \"Lion\" rather than discrete entities. Defendants argue Plaintiffs fail to provide any Lion entity with fair notice of the discrete acts by which each one participated in the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Turning to the substance of Plaintiffs' arguments, Defendants contend that most of Plaintiffs' factual allegations do not involve Lion entities or only involve communications that Lion executives passively received from Bumble Bee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For example, several phone calls and meetings that Plaintiffs allege showing a conspiracy involving Bumble Bee executives and StarKist and Chicken of the Sea executives do not include Lion executives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32 (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 292, 294-95).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Many allegations center on actions taken by a non-Lion actor, Mr. Lischewski, towards Lion employees. For example, on a January 16, 2012 phone call Lischewski conveyed to Chang what Lischewski believed to be a non-public price change by\n   StarKist. But, Defendants point out that Plaintiffs concede that StarKist's price change was publicly announced three days earlier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6 287).) And, Plaintiffs do not allege that Chang was unaware of the announcement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6 287).) Further, Defendants discuss a January 26, 2012 email from Lischewski to Lindberg and Capps in which Lischewski raised concerns about \"cheating\" by StarKist in first quarter of 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Bashas Compl. \u00b6 288).) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs provide no support for the claim that \"cheating\" refers to a conspiracy or that Lindberg or Capps understood the term to be referring to a conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And, Plaintiffs do not allege any Lion entity were involved in underlying decision to increase prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <em>\n    3. Actions Concerning Lion Actors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Finally, Defendants assert that Plaintiffs fail to allege sufficient facts that Lion directly and independently participated in the conspiracy. They characterize the facts presented by Plaintiffs in support of their theory as four meetings and two emails-Defendants contend these four meetings\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two emails support an inference of \"economically legitimate activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <em>\n    4. Arguments Specific to the Cherokee Nation's First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   The Cherokee Nation generally covers the same ground as the Bashas Plaintiffs except as to a few different facts demonstrating direct involvement. The Nation describes an email exchange between Lindberg and Chansiri where Lindberg sent Chansiri Bumble Bee's \"strategic plan forecast and recent historical results\" without \"a formal [non-disclosure agreement]\"; yet, despite the lack of a non-disclosure agreement, Lindberg made clear that the information was \"very confidential.\" (ECF No. 1006-1, at 36 (quoting Nation FAC \u00b6 53).) Defendants characterize this exchange as consistent with Lion's desire to sell Bumble Bee to the highest bidder and the exchange does not plausibly suggest direct participation in the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Next, the Cherokee Nation alleges Lischewski shared information with the Lion entities he gleaned from his \"relationships throughout the industry\" including an instance where he told employees of the Lion entities that \"[i]nternally no one at [Chicken of the Sea] knows what [Thai Union Group's statement] means.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34 (quoting Nation FAC \u00b6 52).) Defendants argue that Plaintiff does not allege what the \"statement\" was or meant, what Lion employees thought about the statement, what Lischewski's report about the statement meant, or how any of this was connected to the alleged conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"408\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20316023\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   In sum, Defendants recognize that this Court has previously held that the MDL plaintiffs have plausibly alleged the existence of a conspiracy in the packaged tuna industry, but the allegations here do not establish direct and independent participation. (MTD 35.) Instead, the allegations describe rational, legitimate business activity typical of a private equity firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. Plaintiffs' Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <em>\n    1. Economic Sense\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   With regard to Defendants argument that it would make no economic sense for\n   Lion to join the conspiracy. Plaintiffs contend that to accept Defendants' argument the Court would have to ignore the well-plead allegations in the Complaint and accept Defendants' inferences instead of Plaintiffs' inferences. (Bashas Opp'n 22.) Plaintiffs' inference is that Lion joined the conspiracy to boost Bumble Bee's market value and eventual sale price, which other courts have found to support conspiratorial conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23 (citing\n   <em>\n    Alaska Elec. Pension Fund v. Bank of Am. Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346906\" index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/44/#p55\">\n    175 F.Supp.3d 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   <em>\n    2. Direct Involvement by Lion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Next, as to Lion entities' direct involvement. Plaintiffs argue that their allegations go beyond four meetings and two emails, but even those events would be sufficient to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) For example, before Lion Capital purchased Bumble Bee, Lischewski told Lindberg that a \"[Redacted]\" was that Lion Capital would \"[Redacted].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Bashas Compl. \u00b6 278).) Plaintiffs argue that they have already pled that Bumble Bee and Dongwon were conspiracy participants, making it more likely that Lischewski was referring to the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And, Lischewski's recent criminal indictment charged that he \"us[ed] code\" to conceal the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24 (quoting Ex. 45, at 4).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   With regard to the meetings. Plaintiffs contend they follow a similar pattern as previously alleged, whereby the conspiracy participants exchanged assurances and then their respective subsidiaries would adhere to the pricing agreements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346906\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/44/#p55\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs posit that had Lion told Dongwon and Thai Union that Lion Capital would not abide by their conspiratorial price increases, then Dongwon and Thai Union would not have continued to meet with Lion executives. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege this did not happen; instead, several further meetings occurred between October 2011 and 2014, thus Lion Capital agreed to the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25 (citing Bashas Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 284, 286, 289-91).) Plaintiffs take issue with Defendants' argument that Lindberg's meetings are entirely consistent with the Lion entities' efforts to oversee its investment in Bumble Bee. Plaintiffs maintain they allege concrete facts such as emails from Chansiri to Lindberg asking [Redacted]. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Plaintiffs return to Defendants' allegation that Lischewski thought he was relaying non-public information about StarKist's price increase to Lion Americas executives. They contend that, even though the information was public, Lischewski thought the information was private. He discussed Bumble Bee's agreed intention to implement a similar price increase and Lion accepted the information on those terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Finally, Plaintiffs reference the email that Lischewski sent to Lindberg and Capps about [Redacted] Plaintiff states that Defendants offer no alternative argument as to what \"[Redacted]\" refers to beyond an agreement to fix prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, StarKist and Bumble Bee are already members of an adequately-pled conspiracy. According to Plaintiff, the most logical inference is that \"[Redacted]\" referred to the conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C. Defendants' Reply\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   First, Defendants argue, again, that Plaintiffs' theory lacks economic sense. Defendants state that Plaintiffs agree that Lion Capital's business model is to strengthen and re-sell brands so that investors can achieve superior returns. (Reply 14.) Defendants distinguish the cases Plaintiffs cite because the defendants in those cases all stood to reap the profits from their conspiracies, but here, the Lion entities are not themselves in the packaged tuna business and do not directly\n   profit from tuna sales. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346906\" index=\"411\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/175/44/#p55\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 14-15 &amp; n.9.) Defendants assert that Plaintiffs' theory would require the Court to believe that the Lion entities would risk their clients' funds and their own good name by knowingly buying a company engaged in criminal misconduct on the charge that the supra-competitive profits resulting from an illegal price fixing conspiracy improved Defendants own position, all without being exposed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Second, Defendants reiterate that Plaintiffs' allegations concerning Lindberg's meetings and communications do not support a conclusion he or any Lion entity participated in the alleged conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) Thus, for example, Defendants contend Plaintiffs' allegation that Lindberg telling Chansiri that [Redacted]\" was code for a conspiracy is implausible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Third, Defendants address Plaintiffs' allegations that certain meetings and communications were for the purpose of facilitating a sale of Bumble Bee. Defendants argue that facts concerning a potential sale cannot support a price-fixing claim because they are \"entirely consistent with [the Lion Entities] pursuing [their] own economic interests,\" and have nothing to do with packaged-tuna pricing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Pressure Sensitive Labelstock Antitrust Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4139137\" index=\"412\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/566/363/#p377\">\n    566 F.Supp.2d 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (M.D. Pa. 2008) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Fourth, Defendants dispute Plaintiffs' arguments concerning Mr. Lischewski's indictment and that he used \"code to conceal the conspiracy.\" Defendants argue that the motivations Plaintiffs attribute to Dongwon, Thai Union Group, or Lischewski do not support a plausible inference that any Lion entity evinced a \"conscious commitment\" to a price fixing conspiracy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Greencycle Paint, Inc. v.

(Bashas Compl. \u00b6 74.) The U.S. demand for tuna has decreased from an average of 3.5 pounds of canned tuna per person in 2000 to under 2.5 pounds per person in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77, fig. 2.) At the same time as the decline in consumption from 2004 to 2014, Plaintiffs allege that there was an oversupply of raw tuna. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.) Plaintiffs conclude that an increase in supply and a decline in demand would result in a corresponding decrease in prices. Instead, prices remained constant or increased from 2004 to at least 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Lion Capital purchased Bumble Bee, on behalf of its investment fund, in late 2010. The parties agree that Lion Capital's business model, as a private equity investment firm, was to strengthen and resell Bumble Bee for a profit. This profit would benefit Lion's investors through an increase in value to Lion Capital's funds, which hold a portfolio of different consumer brands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brown Decl. \u00b6 14.) And, Plaintiffs have alleged that Lion Capital would receive \" '[Redacted].\" (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 312.) Thus, Lion's economic imperative was to sell Bumble Bee for a profit, not a loss. Plaintiffs have alleged an economic theory that Bumble Bee, and thus Lion, needed the artificially inflated prices to maintain its market value and eventual resale value. Otherwise, as Plaintiffs allege, the natural market forces would drive prices down, drive Bumble Bee's value down, and thus drive Lion investors' profits down. This is a plausible economic theory. If the entire point of purchasing Bumble Bee was to eventually sell it for a profit, decreasing prices do not serve Lion's goal of reselling Bumble Bee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Defendants raise valid counterarguments; most persuasive of which is their contention that the Lion entities would not risk their clients' investments\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   and their own reputation on the chance that the conspiracy would eventually bear fruit and, at the same time, never be discovered. Defendants would have a massive potential liability if they knowingly entered into a conspiracy. However, the opposite observation is also true; Defendants would have a large upside if they could sell Bumble Bee at a profit and not a loss. Further, Defendants' argument about risk to client investments and personal reputation could also be made for Bumble Bee and its executives, but guilty pleas in the Northern District gives pause to that reasoning. The Court is not persuaded that simply because Lion Capital and Lion Americas are not in the packaged tuna business, that they did not stand to reap the benefits from participation in the conspiracy. If Defendants sold Bumble Bee for a profit, then their investors benefit. If Lion's investors benefit, then Lion benefits, either through fees, its own investments in its fund, or continued investment in the fund for future purchases. In sum, Defendants had some rational motive to join the conspiracy and the conduct alleged was consistent with Lion Capital's interest in selling Bumble Bee for a profit.

For example, Plaintiffs' allegation that Lischewski told Lindberg that a \"[Redacted],\" (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 278), does not plausibly lead to an inference of conspiracy. The Court has previously found that references to rational behavior, without more, do not plausibly state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 295, at 9 (\"[P]erhaps [Thai Union Group] meant what it said when it praised more rational competition in the United States.\").) Plaintiffs allege that \"[Redacted].\" (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 284.) This is not surprising given Lindberg's role as a board member and Lion Americas' oversight role in Bumble Bee and does not infer a conspiracy. These allegations are insufficient to plausibly state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   If that were the extent of the allegations, this would be an easy call. However, Plaintiffs provide additional factual matter that plausibly demonstrates Lion Americas directly participated in the ongoing conspiracy. At the macro-level, the following considerations are notable. First, the ongoing DOJ inquiry: in its first order discussing direct participation in a price-fixing conspiracy, this Court noted that the ongoing DOJ inquiry \"may bolster additional allegations.\" (ECF No. 283, at 13-14.) The Court noted the problems in \"relying solely or too heavily on pending government investigations in analyzing the sufficiency of a conspiracy complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) As a district court in the Northern District stated, \"[i]t is unknown whether the investigation will result in indictments or nothing at all.... the scope of the investigation is pure speculation. It may be broader or narrower than the allegations at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Graphics Processing Units Antitrust Litig.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062238\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/527/1011/#p1024\">\n    527 F.Supp.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1024 (N.D. Cal. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   In this instance, the outcome of the investigation is not \"pure speculation.\" Bumble Bee has pled guilty to a conspiracy to fix prices in the packaged seafood market in the United States. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 268.) Two executives at Bumble Bee have also pled guilty and Mr. Lischewski has been indicted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; Ex. 45, ECF No. 1247-17.) The DOJ's investigation has moved beyond the nascent stages outlined in the Court's prior order, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 283, at 14-15), and the Court considers those facts as part of its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Also meriting discussion, Plaintiffs describe the market dynamics and Lion's knowledge of those realities. Plaintiffs have alleged that from 2004 through 2014 domestic U.S. consumption of tuna has declined. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 76.) And, the global supply of raw tuna increased over that same time period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) In a normal market this would decrease prices. However, as Plaintiffs point out, the dollar sales of packaged tuna increased while the volume of sales has decreased, which supports a conclusion that prices increased. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76 fig. 1.) Defendants had access to sales and production data from Bumble Bee and, as they admit, Lion Capital is a \"sophisticated investment firm.\" (Reply 15.) One might expect a sophisticated investment firm to diagnose why prices remained elevated despite decreasing demand and increasing\n   supply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The foregoing allegations are a backdrop. Yet, those macro-level observations remain unconnected to specific factual allegations, to which the Court now turns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   The period from January to March 2012 is particularly salient. Plaintiffs discuss a specific telephone conversation on January 16, 2012, where Lischewski thought he was giving Mr. Chang StarKist's non-public price list information. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 287.) The information was already public. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that Lischewski was unaware of that fact because the day after the call, Lischewski emailed Cameron \"[Redacted],\" i.e., the day after the call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 287 n.10.) Plaintiffs do not allege what Chang knew or how he responded to Lischewski's information, but it is reasonable to infer that Chang had at least some context concerning the price increases. Two days later. Plaintiffs allege Lischewski forwarded to Lindberg and Capps an email exchange between Cameron and Worsham \"[Redacted] (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 288.) Lischewski commented that Chicken of the Sea and StarKist were \"[Redacted]\" on first quarter pricing, but \"[Redacted].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants dismiss these allegations as concerning public information in a highly competitive marketplace. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   The word [Redacted] is of particular interest; it carries negative connotations and likely would put the reader of an email on notice that some mischief is afoot. Combining this negative word with Lischewski's corollary hope that the price increase would correct \"[Redacted],\" yields a reasonable inference that the price increases were not legitimate business practice. Put differently, the allegations plausibly describe an instance where StarKist was undertaking some mischief that would be corrected by a price increase. And, Worsham and Cameron allegedly complained about a discrepancy between StarKist personnel and leadership over pricing tactics, which gives further context to the cheating or mischief. Defendants are correct that Plaintiffs do not plead that Lindberg or Capps knew what the email referred to; however,\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   does not require certitude. It only requires enough factual matter to nudge allegations from mere possibility to plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   A few weeks later, Lindberg and Chansiri corresponded via email. Plaintiffs allege asked [Redacted]. (Bashas Compl. \u00b6 289.) Lindberg replied, \"[Redacted].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties focus on the phrase \"[Redacted].\" The Court is not convinced that a reference to \"[Redacted]\" demonstrates a guilty mind. More persuasive is the statement by Chansiri that [Redacted] and Lindberg was receptive to the offer because he also understood there to be a \"[Redacted].\" Taken in conjunction with the previous month's email concerning cheating by StarKist, this also raises an\n   inference of \"negative\" practices that needed correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Finally, on March 30, 2012, Lischewski and Lindberg corresponded via email concerning an article featuring StarKist's president and CEO, who had voiced support to increase package tuna prices. Lindberg allegedly wanted Lischewski to publicly echo those comments, which Lischewski thought unnecessary because [Redacted] (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \u00b6 29 encouraged Lischewki, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   [Redacted]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-304\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted).) This exchange suggests that there was a discrepancy between StarKist's and Bumble Bee's understanding of or interpretation of market prices and Lindberg wanted to align both sides' understanding, i.e., StarKist was crazy, Bumble Bee was rational, and Lindberg wanted both to be rational.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-305\">\n   Defendants raise the possibility that the preceding events depict rational, legitimate business activity typical of a private equity firm. (MTD 35.) They raised similar arguments at the hearing; specifically, the discussions and emails concerned legitimate \"marketing intelligence\" by the Lion entities about their market competitors. (ECF No. 1321, at 52.) In its prior order, the Court noted that the \"the similarity, and corresponding equipoise between innocuous and conspiratorial inferences, is partially removed by the alleged agreement and tighter timeline during which the relevant communications occurred.\" (ECF No. 283, at 18.) The concern between plausibility and possibility, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , is \"largely grounded in ensuring the burdens of often costly and time-consuming discovery are taken into account when a court considers a motion to dismiss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (citing\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).) Viewing the events of January to March 2012 as a whole, the DOJ investigation, and\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   's guidance, leads the Court to the conclusion that Plaintiffs have produced sufficient factual matter that nudges their conspiracy allegations from possible to plausible.

Direct Participation by Lion Capital and Big Catch\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Finally, the Court turns to direct participation by Lion Capital and Big Catch. The Court agrees with Defendants\n   that Plaintiffs impermissibly attempt to engage in group pleading without differentiating between who was employed by what entity, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Bashas Opp'n 10 n.1 (\" 'Lion' refers to Lion Capital, Lion Americas, and Big Catch.\") ). Plaintiffs allege that Lindberg was a Lion Capital partner, (TACC \u00b6\u00b6 36, 50), but do not advance any arguments why the actions of limited partners of Lion Capital who participated in the alleged price fixing should be imputed to Lion Capital\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs do address limited allegations to the actions of Mr. Lea; for example, he attended numerous meetings where Bumble Bee executives reported on key issues impacting Bumble Bee's business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) To carry their burden, Plaintiffs must \"allege facts such as a 'specific time, place, or person involved in the alleged conspiracies' to give a defendant seeking to respond to allegations of a conspiracy an idea of where to begin.\"\n   <em>\n    Kendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3555609\" index=\"484\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/518/1042/#p1047\">\n    518 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not alleged with any specificity the incidents involving Mr. Lea and his alleged connection to the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   Further, the Complaint contains no factual matter concerning Big Catch's participation in the conspiracy, which is not surprising given its role as a holding company. Further, because Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficient facts to state a claim against Lion Capital, it does not matter that the Court has found that Big Catch is the alter ego of Lion Capital for personal jurisdiction purposes. Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim with regard to Big Catch. Therefore, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motions and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' claims as to Lion Capital, LLP and Big Catch Cayman LP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   In sum, the Court finds Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to plausibly state a claim for a violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act by Lion Americas. The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) Motions to Dismiss with respect to Lion Americas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
