Cooper filed suit in early March 2016; as permitted by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a), he sought statutory and actual damages and attorney fees. Doc. 1. Some five months later, at a July 28, 2016 settlement conference before Magistrate Judge Finnegan, RMCB offered to settle for $500 in damages plus the reasonable attorney fees and costs that Cooper had incurred to date. Doc. 112 at 8; Doc. 129 at 15-16; Doc. 129-1 at 18. Cooper rejected the offer. Doc. 129 at 16. As noted, the jury ultimately awarded Cooper $500 in statutory damages-half the $1,000 maximum authorized by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(A) -and zero actual damages.

Of equal if not greater importance, Cooper and his attorneys knew-as his trial testimony ultimately demonstrated-that at the time he received the letter from RMCB that violated the FDCPA, he was experiencing numerous personal difficulties. Cooper's mother, sister, and brother-in-law had recently passed away, and he had recently lost the job he had held for 28 years and could no longer afford the apartment where he had lived for 23 years. From the point of view of a reasonable juror, the distress Cooper experienced in the aftermath of receiving RMCB's letter was almost certainly attributable solely to those tragic and unfortunate family- and employment-related circumstances, not to the letter's single FDCPA-violative sentence.
