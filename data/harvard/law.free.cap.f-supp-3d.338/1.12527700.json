For starters, the plain text of the statute reveals no such limitation.

When an individual meets these conditions-that is, when an individual is \"a minor described in subparagraph (A)\" who, upon turning 18, was transferred to DHS custody-the statute imposes on the Secretary of DHS a nondiscretionary duty to \"consider\" the least restrictive placement available for that individual. Thus, per the plain language of the provision, all who meet those conditions-regardless of the agency's flight risk or dangerousness determinations and irrespective of the provision under which the individual has been detained-are entitled to consideration.

Mot. To Dismiss at 9-13. None of these arguments warrant more than brief discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   First, Defendants note that before providing the mandated consideration, the Secretary of DHS must take into account the alien's danger to self, danger to the community, and risk of flight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Defendants suggest that the existence of this requirement means that those deemed by the Secretary\n   to pose a risk of flight or those deemed dangerous are not entitled to any further consideration under the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679559\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/113/#p118\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But Congress's stipulation that the Secretary must \"tak[e] into account\" certain factors before evaluating placements for each former unaccompanied minor in no way limits\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   is entitled to consideration. Second, Defendants posit that \"[s]uch aliens\" refers to some subset of former unaccompanied minors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 10. This interpretation, though, runs counter to basic rules of English grammar. It is plain that \"[s]uch aliens\" is shorthand for the \"alien[s]\" previously specified-that is, again,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   former unaccompanied minors who have been transferred to the custody of DHS-and not to some never-mentioned subset of that group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2283 (indicating that \"such\" is \"used to avoid repetition\" and that it means \"of the sort or degree previously indicated\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Third, Defendants contend that an interpretation of Section 1232(c)(2)(B) as affording consideration to all former unaccompanied minors now in DHS custody might \"undermine the broad discretionary authority conferred on the Attorney General in \u00a7 1226(a)\" or might conflict with \u00a7 1225(b), which subjects certain arriving aliens to mandatory detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. To Dismiss at 11. This Court is not convinced that any such conflicts exist. An interpretation of Section 1232(c)(2)(B) as extending to all former unaccompanied minors \"consider[ation]\" of less restrictive placements-which is, as explained above, the plain meaning of the provision-in no way restricts the agency's authority to ultimately decide to detain or to release any immigrant facing removal proceedings. Furthermore, that an agency has broad authority in a realm does not give it license to ignore Congress's specific directions or restrictions on its authority.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Venture Capital Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523490\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/5/\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that though \"[a]gencies obviously have broad discretion to reconsider a regulation at any time ...

Relatedly, Defendants' contention that this Court's Opinion at the preliminary injunction stage \"highlights the standing issues posed by Plaintiffs' complaint,\" Defs.'

The reason that the Court did not \"order that ICE change its decision on whether to detain under \u00a7 1226(a)\" and did not seek to review ICE's flight risk determinations is simple-neither determination is at issue in this case.

Opp'n to Class Cert. at 17-24. The Court disagrees on all fronts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   First, Defendants' argument that classwide relief is not appropriate because Defendants' compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"523\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B) entails making individualized determinations about each former unaccompanied minor is unpersuasive. While it is true that the statute demands such individualized determinations, in this suit Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' practice of failing to comply with the statutory provision at all. They seek injunctive relief requiring only such compliance. They do not seek a court order mandating any particular outcome with respect to any particular former unaccompanied minor. That individualized determinations must be made under the statute does not preclude class certification. Indeed, the D.C. Circuit implicitly rejected this same argument in\n   <em>\n    DL v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , finding that a subclass of special education students-who each required individualized assessments and specially designed educational programming tailored to their respective needs-was properly certified under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"524\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DL\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276282\" index=\"525\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/713/#p723\">\n    860 F.3d at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The D.C.

Defendants' administrative infeasibility argument centers on the notion that \"there exists an 'implied requirement' that a class be 'adequately defined' and 'clearly ascertainable' before it can be certified.\" Defs.' Opp'n to Class Cert. at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332409\" index=\"528\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/303/120/#p145\">\n    303 F.R.D. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   139 ). According to Defendants, one aspect of ascertainability is that the class definition cannot depend on the merits of the underlying claim-that is, a plaintiff cannot permissibly define a class by reference to success or failure in proving their claims. This is so, Defendants argue, because permitting what is known as a \"fail-safe class\" \"is unfair to defendants, it prevents an adverse judgment being entered against plaintiffs, and it is unmanageable because the members of the class could only be known after a determination of liability.\" Defs.' Opp'n to Class Cert. at 19-20. The Court disagrees that Plaintiffs' class definition fails on the basis of a lack of ascertainability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court observes that it is far from clear that there exists in this district a requirement that a class certified under Rule 23(b)(2) must demonstrate ascertainability to merit certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Circuit has not opined on the requirement\"). To the extent that a showing of ascertainably is required, the Court is not convinced that Plaintiffs' class definition fails to meet the requirement solely because it is defined-superficially, at least-by reference to success on the merits of Plaintiffs' claims. Contrary to Defendants' arguments, Plaintiffs have identified clear and objective criteria on which to show membership in the proposed class-namely, status as a former unaccompanied minor who has been transferred from ORR custody to DHS custody. Plaintiffs' argument-that, as a matter of course, Defendants fail to afford\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   members of this group with the consideration due under the statutory provision-reveals entirely the bounds of this group. And those bounds are neither vague nor subjective. Moreover, it is not clear why Defendants might be harmed or at all disadvantaged by Plaintiffs' reliance on a fail-safe class definition in the context of this particular case. As Plaintiffs explain, DHS has an obligation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"530\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(B) independent of the status of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

As the Supreme Court explained in\n    <em>\n     Lujan v.

After this Court ordered DHS to provide Plaintiffs Garcia Ramirez and Hernandez Alfaro with the consideration required by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"550\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201232\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2)(B), the agency contacted potential sponsors, explored alternative-to-detention options, and, based on its analysis, released Mr. Garcia Ramirez on his own recognizance subject to reporting and ankle monitoring.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Decl. of Andrew Swierski \u00b6\u00b6 10-14, Ex.

Nowhere in the agency's submissions to this Court is there any hint that the information used to make that determination would not have been available to or used by the agency at the time that it first placed Mr. Garcia Ramirez in a detention facility or at the time that it refused his requests for consideration.

And, to the extent that Plaintiffs continue to press for such a relief, the Court concludes that they lack standing to do so.
