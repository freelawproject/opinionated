Code \u00a7 20-24-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , permits private and public universities (among other entities) to \"authorize\" public charter schools. Grace College, a religious institution, is among the private schools designated by the Act as an authorizer. The Indiana Coalition for Public Education (\"\n   <em>\n    Coalition\n   </em>\n   \") is an organization that advocates for traditional public schooling and opposes the diversion of funds to charter schools. The Coalition brought suit not against Grace College, but against Seven Oaks Classical School, Inc. (\"\n   <em>\n    Seven Oaks\n   </em>\n   \"), a school authorized by Grace College, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, alleging that the Act violates the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution by permitting Grace College to act as an authorizer. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. [Filing No. 79; Filing No. 81; Filing No. 82.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court does not have the authority to reach the merits of the Coalition's claims. The Coalition ultimately fails to establish that its injuries are fairly traceable to the Act's authorizing provision or that they are redressable by the relief available in this Court, and therefore fails to establish the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). Defendants' standing arguments, which reach the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, fall \"under Rule 12(b)(1), not Rule 56.\"\n   <em>\n    Chicago Joe's Tea Room, LLC v.

However, because \"a defendant challenging jurisdiction need not accept as true the allegations in the complaint and may ask the court to decide the jurisdictional issue by considering additional documents and affidavits,\" a jurisdictional challenge under Rule 12(b)(1) at the summary judgment stage \"makes the motion look a lot like a summary judgment motion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517527\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/894/807/#p814\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Supreme Court has explained,\n   \"[E]ach element [of standing] must be supported in the same way as any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that, at the summary judgment stage, the plaintiff \"can no longer rest on ...

R. Civ. P. 56(e) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   explains, Defendants' jurisdictional challenge at this stage borrows the evidentiary requirements and procedures from summary judgment procedure under Rule 56. Thus, Defendants assert that there is no genuine issue of material fact as to the Coalition's standing to bring this lawsuit, such that the Court should dismiss this matter for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Whether a party asserts that a fact is undisputed or genuinely disputed, the party must support the asserted fact by citing to particular parts of the record, including depositions, documents, or affidavits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A). A party can also support a fact by showing that the materials cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute or that the adverse party cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(B). Affidavits or declarations must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant is competent to testify on matters stated.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4). Failure to properly support a fact in opposition to a movant's factual assertion can result in the movant's fact being considered undisputed, and potentially in the grant of the motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court need only consider disputed facts that are material to the decision. A disputed fact is material if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.\n   <em>\n    Hampton v.

In other words, while there may be facts that are in dispute, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) is appropriate if those facts are not outcome determinative.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harper v.

Seven Oaks' Approval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Seven Oaks is an Indiana charter school formed under the Charter School Act. [Filing No. 81-2 at 6.] Seven Oaks' approved application with Grace College was its third attempt at obtaining a charter. First, in 2014, Seven Oaks applied to the Indiana Charter School Board for authorization, which was opposed by the community and the local school corporations, and was ultimately denied. [Filing No. 79-30 at 3-5; Filing No. 79-32 at 3.] The Charter School Board assessed Seven Oaks' education plan its lowest rating. [Filing No. 79-30 at 3.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In spring 2015, Seven Oaks again applied to the Charter School Board. The Charter School Board's preliminary staff evaluation noted improvement in Seven Oaks' business plan but concluded that the application still failed to meet state standards for educational plan and capacity to operate a school. [Filing No. 79-31 at 3-5.] After receiving the staff evaluation, Seven Oaks withdrew its application before the Board was scheduled to vote. [Filing No. 79-33 at 5-6.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, in fall 2015, Seven Oaks submitted its application (without significant substantive changes) to Grace College. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 79-33 at 7-9.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 79-36\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 79-35.] On January 13, 2016, after internal review, consideration of public comments following a public hearing, and external review by two independent experts, [Filing No. 81-2 at 4-6], Grace College's board of trustees approved\n   Seven Oaks' application at a nonpublic meeting, [Filing No. 79-32 at 3].

This means that the public school corporations in Monroe County lost approximately $307,800 in funding for the 2016-17 school year after approximately 54 students left to enroll at Seven Oaks, and lost an additional $45,600 in funding for the 2017-18 school year after that number increased to 62. [Filing No. 81-3 at 1-2].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Should Seven Oaks continue to increase its enrollment as it plans to do, [Filing No. 70 at 4 (admitting allegation that it intends to increase enrollment to between \"400-700 in future years,\" Filing No. 1 at 6) ], the Coalition believes that the school corporations would continue to lose funding. The school corporations must account for budgeting shortfalls by cutting teaching positions, supply budgets, extracurricular activities, and, in certain circumstances, entire schools. [\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 79-3; Filing No. 79-5; Filing No. 79-13.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, relying on several experts to whom Defendants strenuously object, the Coalition maintains that the presence of Seven Oaks decreases the diversity of the public school corporations. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Filing No. 79-6 at 5; Filing No. 79-16 at 2; Filing No. 79-17 at 9-10.] As explained below, the Court ultimately concludes that this dispute is immaterial, and assumes for the purposes of the parties' Motions that the presence of Seven Oaks in fact has the effect of decreasing diversity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 25, 2017, the Coalition brought suit against Seven Oaks; Ms. McCormick, in her official capacity as Superintendent of Public Instruction and chair of the Board of Education; and James Betley, in his official capacity as executive director of the Charter School Board, alleging claims under the Indiana Constitution and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. [Filing No. 1.] On June 28, 2018, the Coalition voluntarily dismissed Seven Oaks. [Filing No. 35.] On August 2, 2018, the Court granted Seven Oaks' Motion to Intervene. [Filing No. 56.] On November 29, 2017, the Court granted Seven Oaks' Motion to Dismiss in part, dismissing the Coalition's claim under the Indiana Constitution and its First Amendment challenge to the authorizers' administrative fee collection. [Filing No. 66.] The Court held that the Coalition had plausibly alleged standing and a First Amendment claim regarding the provisions of the Charter School Act permitting religious institutions to serve as authorizers. [Filing No. 66.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 5, 2018, the Coalition moved for summary judgment, [Filing No. 79], and on May 22, 2018, Defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment, [Filing 81; Filing No. 82]. On August 2, 2018, based\n   upon the agreement of the parties in their summary judgment briefing that Mr. Betley could not redress the Coalition's alleged injuries, the Court dismissed the Coalition's claims against Mr. Betley. [Filing No. 91.] The parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on the Coalition's remaining First Amendment claims against Ms. McCormick and Seven Oaks are fully briefed and ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Coalition, cognizant of its burden to establish standing at each stage of the proceedings, argues that it meets each of the three elements: injury, both as an organization and on behalf of its members; causation; and redressability. First, as for organization injury, the Coalition argues that it spends money and resources advocating for funding of public school corporations which is undermined when students are able instead to take their state funding to Seven Oaks. [Filing No. 80 at 14-15.] As for the injuries of its members, the Coalition alleges that its members (including parents, students, teachers, and other officials) are harmed by the loss of tuition support and by the loss of diversity caused by demographically-concentrated transfers. [Filing No. 80 at 16.] Second, the Coalition argues that the causal chain for its injuries is unbroken from the Charter School Act's provision permitting Grace College to authorize charter schools. [Filing No. 80 at 17.] According to the Coalition, students have left the public school corporations solely because of Grace College's decision to charter Seven Oaks (which could not have happened without the Act), and which in turn has caused the public school corporations to lose the per-student funding which they would otherwise have received had the students not left. [Filing No. 80 at 17-18.] Finally, as for redressability, the Coalition argues that should the Court enjoin the funding to Seven Oaks, \"many of its students would re-enroll in [the community school corporation] where they had previously attended.\" [Filing No. 80 at 18.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants, for their part, assert that the Coalition has failed to establish any of the three elements of standing. They argue that neither the Coalition as an organization nor its members have suffered a cognizable injury; that their injuries even if cognizable are not caused by the Charter School Act; and that the Coalition has not shown their injuries even if caused by the Act to be redressable, either in terms of the proper relief or as against the particular defendants. [Filing No. 83 at 10-19; Filing No. 84 at 12-25.] Key to the latter two arguments is the argument that the Coalition's injuries are caused not by the Act, but by an intervening cause-the independent decision of schoolparents to place their children in schools other than the community school corporations. [Filing No. 83 at 14-16; Filing No. 84 at 20-22.] Defendants further advance the related argument that redressability is uncertain because those same schoolparents may just as well choose to place their children in schools other than the school corporations' should Seven Oaks close. [Filing No. 83 at 16-19; Filing No. 84 at 22-23.] Even closure, according to Defendants, would not be proper as a redressability matter because the Coalition all but concedes that Seven Oaks has engaged in no Establishment Clause wrongdoing. [Filing No. 83 at 19; Filing No. 84 at 36-39.] Defendants argue that the wrongdoer, to the extent one exists, is Grace College, which is not and has never been party to this lawsuit. [Filing No. 83 at 19.] Altogether, Defendants argue that the Coalition's showing of standing is built on speculation and an injury (loss of funding and, potentially,\n   diversity) unmoored from the alleged constitutional violations. [Filing No. 83 at 10-19; Filing No. 84 at 12-25.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As alluded to above, the \"irreducible constitutional minimum of standing\" consists of three essential elements:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   First, the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact-an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical. Second, there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of-the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court. Third, it must be \"likely,\" as opposed to merely \"speculative,\" that the injury will be \"redressed by a favorable decision.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560-61,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Defendants challenge all three. But the failure to establish any one element means that a party lacks standing, and therefore that the Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons described below, the Court concludes that causation and redressability present insurmountable hurdles for the Coalition, obviating the need to dredge through many of the parties' myriad evidentiary disputes regarding injury. The Court therefore assumes for present purposes that the Coalition's claimed associational injuries of reduced funding and diversity suffice to establish a concrete, particularized, and actual injury and focuses below on the Coalition's showing of causation and redressability.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LimitNone, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750875\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/572/#p576\">\n    551 F.3d 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576 (7th Cir. 2008) (\"...

However, the FEC's regulation is an intervening cause-were it not for the regulation, the CPD's tax status would be relevant to its sponsorship of the debates only insofar as it facilitated the CPD's funding through tax-exempt funds. Thus, Fulani's claim would be addressed more appropriately under the FEC's regulation than through the Internal Revenue Code.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1820902\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/882/621/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the court held that indeterminate future actions of the CPD itself \"remain[ ] an intervening causal agent\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Were we to order revocation of the CPD's tax-exempt status, the CPD might decline to sponsor presidential debates altogether. This would remove the allegedly unfair advantage to Fulani's competitors, but would prevent Fulani from receiving the same benefit. Or the CPD could choose to include Fulani within the debates in order to retain its tax-exempt status, in which case the two major-party candidates might decline to participate in debates that do not present them as the two salient candidates, thus depriving the debates of the media appeal that Fulani seeks. Thus, while the IRS's decision to provide the CPD with tax-exempt status is a cause of Fulani's claimed injury, it is merely one in a chain of independent causal factors necessary to achieve this injury. Moreover, given the number of causal factors significant to Fulani's alleged injury, we find that the claim lacks sufficient redressability to warrant standing under the Supreme Court's test in\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

If anything, the Coalition's causal chain is even more attenuated than that held insufficient in\n   <em>\n    Fulani\n   </em>\n   . For one, there are several significant intervening causes. First, there is Grace College. Grace College is the actor whose authorization of Seven Oaks allegedly violates the Establishment Clause. The Coalition's complaint is not merely that the Act allocates funds a certain way, but that Grace College in particular has granted the charter which has caused funds and students to be diverted to Seven\n   Oaks which the Coalition believes should instead be allocated to the public school corporations. Grace College is a critical, \"independent actor[ ] not before the court,\" and it is Grace College's decision to authorize Seven Oaks about which the Coalition complains.\n   <em>\n    Clapper v.

The complained-of diversion of funding and diversity is tied directly to the loss of students. And unlike in\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   , the Charter School Act has no coercive or determinate effect on these independent decisions. Not a single parent was compelled, either as a practical matter or officially, to leave the school corporations. Rather, Indiana law gave the parents nearly \"unfettered choices\" in selecting where to bring their per-student educational funding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Among these: remain at a school corporation, transfer to another school corporation, transfer to another charter school, and, if certain conditions are met, use Indiana's voucher program to transfer to a private school-which may be religious.

This remedy could conceivably redress the Coalition's injuries only if it could show that Seven Oaks' students would return to the public school corporations should Seven Oaks be closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   This is far from a foregone conclusion because Indiana law allows students to take their per-student tuition support to any number of non-corporation schooling options, up to and including religious private schools, should certain conditions be met. The Coalition does not, however, point to any evidence suggesting that the public school corporation's current students wish to leave. And though they assert that the students who have left would return to the school corporations were Seven Oaks to close, they offer no evidence (for example, in the form of affidavits from parents of Seven Oaks students) that this is in fact the case. The\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   evidence to even suggest that students might return to the school corporations comes from an expert report opining that Seven Oaks students are unlikely to be home schooled or attend private schools. [Filing No. 79-16 at 5-6.] But the factual issue of whether students would return to the school corporations if Seven Oaks were closed is not a subject on which expert testimony would be helpful to a factfinder.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Even if it were the case that Seven Oaks students would generally not prefer homeschooling or private schools as the expert suggests, that still leaves unanswered the issue of whether they would elect to return to public school corporations over the other options. In the end, the Coalition asks the Court to speculate that this would be the case, with nothing to support this speculation except the fact that certain students left the school corporations to attend Seven Oaks. As\n   <em>\n    Cabral\n   </em>\n   explains, past conduct alone fails to demonstrate the likely future conduct of the independent parents, all of whom have multiple options for future schooling.

There is no likelihood that this Court could grant the Coalition's request without running afoul of the principles enunciated above-particularly in light of the fact that the Coalition has failed to produce any evidence suggesting that Seven Oaks has provided anything other than constitutionally proper secular education, or that Grace College has allowed its religious beliefs to impact its authorization procedures. At bottom, the Coalition does not have standing to seek such overbroad relief because its injury cannot be traced to the mere fact of Seven Oaks' continued funding. Rather, the appropriate remedy under\n   <em>\n    Lemon II\n   </em>\n   were the Coalition to succeed on the merits of its claim would be to maintain the status quo for a reasonable time while Seven Oaks located another authorizer. This would also be consistent with Indiana law, which allows for the \"state board ... to take all steps necessary\" to \"decommission\" an authorizer relinquishing its authorizer status, \"including overseeing the orderly winding up of authorization activities.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020-24-2.2\">\n    Ind.

And Indiana's private school voucher program, which the Coalition has not challenged, would also persist, where funds go directly to religious schools instead of public school corporations. Indeed, it is difficult if not impossible to distinguish Indiana's voucher program, which is constitutional under the principles announced in\n   <em>\n    Zelman v. Simmons-Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254908\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/639/\">\n    536 U.S. 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254908\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/639/\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254908\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/639/\">\n    153 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002), from the system challenged by the Coalition in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both permit parents to divert resources from public school corporations to schools with some connection to religious organizations, be it an overtly religious private school, or a secular charter school authorized in a secular fashion by a religious institution. If anything, Grace College may have a complaint under the Free Exercise Clause were private secular colleges able to authorize charter schools but religious colleges excluded solely because of their religious character.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 2012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12605129\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/2012/\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (noting stringent scrutiny applied to programs which exclude only religious organizations). The Coalition's Complaint is really a challenge to Indiana's policies of school choice and of school funding following the student, draped in the clothing of an Establishment Clause challenge. But the Coalition challenges just one recipient of that funding, and it all but admits that its alleged injuries are in no meaningful way caused by the religious character of Seven Oaks' authorizer. Rather, it is a mere coincidence that Seven Oaks, with which the public school corporations must compete for students, happens to be authorized\n   by a religious institution. The school corporations would face exactly the same funding difficulties (and thus the Coalition would face the same alleged injury) had Seven Oaks been authorized by a secular private college, as permitted by the Charter School Act, instead of Grace College. These observations confirm the gross misfit between the alleged constitutional injury and the Coalition's requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Finally, the Coalition has not shown that the Court may order the requested relief from Seven Oaks. To reiterate, the Coalition wants the Court to declare the Act's authorizing provision unconstitutional and enjoin the state from providing further funding. In order to receive this relief, the Coalition must show that its injuries are \" 'fairly traceable' to a defendant's actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

But Seven Oaks is not responsible for distributing state funding, nor is it responsible for the allegedly unconstitutional authorizing that allows them to receive state funding. The Coalition fails to demonstrate that the Court could order Seven Oaks to provide the relief it seeks, and therefore lacks standing to pursue its claim against Seven Oaks for this additional reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Coalition has set forth several policy concerns with respect to the operation of the Charter School Act and its impact on public school corporations. But it has not met its burden of demonstrating that its alleged injuries are fairly traceable to the Charter School Act's authorizing provision or that its injuries are likely redressable by the relief available in this Court. The Court therefore lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the Coalition's claims, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   the Coalition's Motion for Summary Judgment [79],\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment [81; 82] insofar as they challenge the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES\n   </strong>\n   the Coalition's Complaint\n   <strong>\n    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   . Final judgment will issue accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Defendants emphatically challenge the Coalition's evidentiary showing on this and many other points.

But in its reply brief, the Coalition explains that it is \"willing for the purposes of summary judgment to accept the lower figures.\" [Filing No. 87.] Accepting the Coalition's concession, the Court utilizes the numbers provided by Seven Oaks, ultimately agreeing with the Coalition that it is an immaterial dispute of fact for the purposes of the parties' motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court remains cognizant of its obligation to ensure that it has subject-matter jurisdiction before it may address the merits of a plaintiff's case. But the Court observes that the complete paucity of evidence suggesting that religion plays any role in either the authorizing process or Seven Oaks' education would present insurmountable hurdles for the Coalition were it permitted to litigate the merits of its claims. Rather, as with a voucher program, the Act permits all eligible institutions, public and private, to participate in the authorization scheme, and apportions funding to the charter schools on a choice-driven, per-student basis.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
