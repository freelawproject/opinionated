(ECF No. 50.) Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   oppose the motion (ECF No. 53) and Plaintiffs have replied (ECF No. 55).

Each Plaintiff was taken into custody by various immigration enforcement agencies and detained pursuant to Defendants' alleged policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.) Plaintiffs alleged that \"many individuals\" who have claims to relief from removal \"routinely languish in detention for two months or longer before they see a judge\" because of Defendants' alleged policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Complaint challenged Defendants' conduct as violating (1) detained individuals' Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights by causing detention without prompt presentment, (2) their Fourth Amendment rights to a\n   prompt judicial determination of whether probable cause justifies their detention, and (3) the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), 706(2)(A)-(D).

Plaintiffs requested declaratory relief, an injunction, and the issuance of a writ of habeas \"commanding the release of Plaintiff-Petitioners and class members from detention to the extent necessary for Defendants-Respondents to comply\" with Plaintiffs' view of the law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.) Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). (ECF No. 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 8, 2018, the Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. (ECF No. 49.) The Court determined that it lacks jurisdiction over Gonzalez's Fourth Amendment probable cause claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) because he was initially placed into mandatory detention as a result of expedited removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) The Court further determined that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) and 1252(b)(9) deprive it of jurisdiction over Cancino's and Hernandez's Fourth Amendment claims and all Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claims because those claims arise from removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-27.) The Court concluded that the statutory provisions require the Plaintiffs to raise these claims in a petition for review (\"PFR\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, the Court determined that Plaintiffs' request for habeas relief did not prevent the channeling of their claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-41.) The Court dismissed the Complaint, but granted Plaintiffs leave to amend \"to assert claims over which th[e] Court may properly exercise jurisdiction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 27, 2018, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Because the decision provides new analysis on Section 1252(b)(9), Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the Order's Section 1252(b)(9) conclusions. (ECF No. 50.) Plaintiffs' deadline to file an amended complaint is vacated pending resolution of the motion.

(ECF Nos. 50, 53, 55.) To resolve this dispute, the Court first considers (1) the statutory text and its pre-\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   interpretation, (2) the Supreme Court's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , and (3)\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ' departures from prior Ninth Circuit precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The former establishes that \"a petition for review filed with the appropriate court of appeals ... shall be the sole and exclusive means for review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). Section 1252(b)(9) in turn provides that \"[j]udicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under this subchapter [including \u00a7\u00a7 1225 and 1226] shall be available only in judicial review of a final order[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(9). Thus, Section 1252(b)(9) consolidates judicial review into a PFR of a final order. The provisions also expressly preclude habeas jurisdiction as a means of review, outside of a PFR, of a final order of removal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), (b)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court discussed Section 1252(b)(9) twice. In its first pass, the Court characterized Section 1252(b)(9) as an \"unmistakable zipper clause,\" which consolidates judicial review of \"all decisions and actions\" in the removal process.\n   <em>\n    Reno v.

In its second pass, the Court reaffirmed that the provision's \"purpose is to consolidate 'judicial review' of immigration proceedings into one action in the court of appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    INS v.

But, based on its text at the time, the Court also determined that Section 1252(b)(9)\"by its own terms, d[id] not bar habeas jurisdiction over removal orders not subject to judicial review under \u00a7 1252(a)(1)\" and emphasized that the term \"judicial review ... is a term historically distinct from habeas.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p313\">\n    at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p313\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, the Court expressly relied on prior Ninth Circuit precedent which contemplated a broad scope for Section 1252(b)(9). The Ninth Circuit expressly characterized Section 1252(b)(9) as \" 'breathtaking' in scope and 'vise-like' in grip,\" which \"swallows up virtually all claims that are tied to removal proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    J.E.F.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137377\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1026/#p1031\">\n    837 F.3d at 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Aguilar v.

This precedent may treat Section 1252(b)(9) too broadly in light of the\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   plurality's rejection of an \"expansive\" interpretation of \"arising from\" that would sweep a claim into Section 1252(b)(9) simply because an alien is in removal proceedings or a removal action was taken. Pre-\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   Ninth Circuit precedent also instructed that claims \"independent of or collateral to the removal process do not fall within the scope of Section 1252(b)(9),\" but unlike\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , it did not identify what such claims would be for aliens with pending removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Contrast\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 840\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.E.F.M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137377\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1026/#p1031\">\n    837 F.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Justice Alito's identification of aspects of the immigration removal process over which a court ostensibly lacks jurisdiction and claims that fall outside Section 1252(b)(9)'s scope provides important guidance on the statute's scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, the Court relied on pre-\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   Ninth Circuit precedent which rejected the argument that Section 1252(b)(9) could not bar district court jurisdiction over a claim that cannot be meaningfully reviewed in the PFR process.

Justice Alito's analysis counsels that courts should consider whether an \"extreme\" interpretation of \"arising from\" in Section 1252(b)(9) would make a claim \"effectively unreviewable.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Justice Alito expressly identified \"claims of prolonged detention\" as effectively unreviewable, but his analysis did not end there. Rather, he explained further that the\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs did not otherwise challenge the initial decision to detain or remove them or the removal process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    at 840-841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This elaboration provides context which shows that there is no freestanding exception to Section 1252(b)(9) based on whether claims are effectively unreviewable, as Plaintiffs appear to suggest. (ECF No. 50-1 at 3 (\"The issue whether claims are effectively unreviewable is a much easier question to answer than whether they are 'inextricably linked' with removal proceedings.\").) Rather, a court must ask whether the claims otherwise challenge issues that are cognizable in the PFR process. With these points in mind, the Court reconsiders whether it has jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Jurisdiction Over the Complaint Post-\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiffs characterize\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   as concerning \"prolonged detention without\n   certain procedural safeguards.\" (ECF No. 50-1 at 1.) Based on this characterization, they contend that their claims are \"indistinguishable\" from those in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   \"for jurisdictional purposes\" and thus\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   \"controls\" jurisdiction. (ECF No. 50-1 at 1, 7-14; ECF No. 55 at 2-6.) Plaintiffs' characterization of\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , however, extends it beyond its narrower legal question and elides the case-specific inquiry reflected in Justice Alito's analysis of whether Section 1252(b)(9) bars jurisdiction. Pursuant to that inquiry, a court should first identify what legal (or factual) question the plaintiff raises and then determine whether that question \"arises from\" an action taken to remove an alien or removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With the benefit of Justice Alito's analysis, the Court considers whether Section 1252(b)(9) bars jurisdiction over the particular legal questions raised by Plaintiffs' Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Fourth Amendment Probable Cause Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim raises the legal question of whether the Amendment \"permit[s] the government to detain individuals without prompt judicial determination of whether probable cause justifies their detention.\" (Comp. \u00b6 82.) Plaintiffs refine this question to be whether such a probable cause determination must occur within 48 hours of an individual being taken into immigration custody by an immigration officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) As Defendants recognize (ECF No. 53 at 3), the legal question raised by Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim arises from aspects of the removal process over which Justice Alito indicated Section 1252(b)(9) would bar jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For one, the claim plainly \"challeng[es] the decision to detain them in the first place[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The claim expressly challenges \"\n   <em>\n    decisions\n   </em>\n   to keep persons in custody beyond 48 hours and before their initial Master Calendar Hearing [that]\n   <em>\n    are made by DHS officers\n   </em>\n   alone without prompt judicial review.\" (Compl. \u00b6 46 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 22.) The question of whether the Fourth Amendment requires \"judicial review\" of that decision within 48 hours is far from a claim of prolonged detention \"remote\" from the initial decision to detain. Second, and relatedly, the claim \"challeng[es] the decision ... to seek removal\" in the first place.\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The \"probable cause\" procedure Plaintiffs seek is one in which an immigration officer's determination that an individual is removable from the United States is \"promptly reviewable.\" Plaintiffs recognize that \"[n]ot all persons facing removal proceedings are detained\" and \"the government routinely pursues removal ... against non-detained individuals[.]\" (ECF No. 50-1 at 9; ECF No. 55 at 5.) These points, however, mean little in Plaintiffs' circumstances. The Complaint recognizes that individuals like the Plaintiffs are taken into ICE custody because immigration officers suspect them of being aliens removable from the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though custody and removability are distinct, Plaintiffs' \"probable cause\" claim concededly does not involve the former. Plaintiffs aver that none of the purely custodial questions in a bond hearing, such as whether an alien is a flight risk or a danger to the community, is \"at issue here.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 50-1 at 17.) It is\n   clear to the Court that this claim concerns the mere fact that an immigration officer has taken any action at all against the Plaintiffs and the putative class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For this reason, the Court must reject Plaintiffs' contention that the Court may exercise jurisdiction over their Fourth Amendment claim on the ground that it is effectively unreviewable because it also involves detention. The detention-framing of the Complaint makes addressing the impact of Section 1252(b)(9) on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim challenging. But, as the Court has explained, Justice Alito's analysis should not be read to fashion a free-standing exception to Section 1252(b)(9) based on the mere assertion that a claim is effectively unreviewable or challenges \"prolonged detention.\" As Justice Alito himself confirmed, a court must decide whether the legal or factual\n   <em>\n    question\n   </em>\n   a plaintiff raises arises from an action taken to remove or the removal process.\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At its core, Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment probable cause claim does so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs cannot tenably argue that the Court may grant a remedy for this claim \"without impeding removal proceedings.\" (ECF No. 50-1 at 1.) Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim does not seek a \"procedural safeguard\" to justify continued detention\n   <em>\n    pending removal proceedings.\n   </em>\n   Instead, Plaintiffs seek a \"procedural safeguard\" by which a detained individual's removability from the United States is immediately reviewable by an IJ. Although the Court is not insensitive to the notion that the absence of such a procedure unreasonably \"extends\" detention for individuals detained after being taken into immigration custody, the relief Plaintiffs request is the premise of removal proceedings-assessing whether an individual is removable from the United States and the government's evidence on that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delgado v. Quarantillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645393\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/52/#p55\">\n    643 F.3d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (2d Cir. 2011) (\"[W]hether the district court has jurisdiction will turn on the substance of the relief that a plaintiff is seeking.\"). This issue is clearly cognizable in the PFR process. Accordingly, the Court affirms that it lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment probable cause claim pursuant to Section 1252(b)(9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Fifth Amendment Prompt Presentment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim raises the legal question of whether the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause \"permit[s] the government to detain Plaintiff-Petitioners or other members of the class without promptly presenting them before a judge.\" (Compl. \u00b6 77.) The claim is premised on the notion that procedural and substantive due process require \"prompt presentment\" to justify the deprivation of physical liberty that detention represents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-39, 41-43.) Based on Justice Alito's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that Section 1252(b)(9) does not bar jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At the heart of Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim is the notion that unreasonable delays in the presentment of detained aliens seeing an immigration judge (\"IJ\") unconstitutionally extends their detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40, 44.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Court observed in its Order (ECF No. 49 at 5-6, 23-25), the Complaint identifies the initial Master Calendar Hearing (\"MCH\") as the first appearance before an IJ and a \"crucial stage\" of removal proceedings. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3, 24-34, 44.) The MCH permits an alien to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , learn the charges against him, assess the sufficiency of a Notice to Appear, request a bond hearing, and learn of possible relief from removability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.) The Court previously understood a claim premised on delays in presentment to an IJ, particularly at the MCH, as swept up by Section 1252(b)(9). (ECF No. 49 at 24-25, 28.) Justice Alito's analysis in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   alters the Court's conclusion by circumscribing Section 1252(b)(9)'s scope. It is clear to the Court that by challenging Defendants' alleged unreasonable\n   <em>\n    delays\n   </em>\n   in presenting detained aliens to an IJ, Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim does not \"ask[ ] for review of an order of removal,\" or \"challeng[e] the decision to detain them in the first place or to seek removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, they do not \"challeng[e] any part of the process by which their removability will be determined,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , but rather the separate conduct of immigration authorities delaying that process and, consequently, the Plaintiffs' detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In their motion, Plaintiffs also aver that first presentment need not be an initial MCH. The Complaint expressly alleges that Defendants \"confine[ ] individuals for removal proceedings without ... [an] automatic custody review hearing before an immigration judge,\" \"commonly called a bond hearing.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 63.) When Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim is reconsidered in light of this allegation, the claim is more analogous to the bond hearing claim at issue in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , with the key difference being whether a bond hearing should be \"automatic\" or more promptly held than it is currently alleged to be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , treating Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim regarding alleged prolonged detention resulting from delays in presentment as \"arising from\" an action taken to remove an alien would make Plaintiffs' claim \"effectively unreviewable.\"\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , 138. S.Ct. at 840. Allegedly excessive detention caused by delays in presentment cannot be remedied in a PFR because \"by the time a final order was eventually entered, the allegedly excessive detention would have already taken place.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12616906\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/830/\">\n    at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , the Court's analysis shows that Plaintiffs do not challenge aspects of the removal process over which Justice Alito indicated Section 1252(b)(9) would bar jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court concludes that reconsideration of its dismissal of Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim is warranted, grants Plaintiffs' motion as to that claim, and reinstates the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION &amp; ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART AND DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. (ECF No. 50.) The Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   that it lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment claim. However, Section 1252(b)(9) does not bar jurisdiction over the Plaintiffs' Fifth Amendment claim and the Court\n   <strong>\n    REINSTATES\n   </strong>\n   the Complaint\n   as to that claim and Plaintiffs' APA claim, to the extent it is based on the same alleged failure to \"promptly present.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Consistent with the Court's prior Order, Plaintiffs are nevertheless\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED LEAVE TO AMEND\n   </strong>\n   to assert a challenge to the conditions of confinement at detention facilities in the District.
