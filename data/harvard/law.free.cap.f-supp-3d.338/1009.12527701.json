Innova contends that the OOH profile actually requires something \"more\" than a business degree because it refers to coursework in a number of areas, including industrial relations, psychology, writing, human resources management, and accounting.

Criterion 2: Bachelor's Degree Common to the Industry and the Complexity and Uniqueness of the Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Under this criterion, there are two ways in which Innova can establish that the Technical Recruiter position is a \"specialty occupation\": (1) by showing that \"[t]he degree requirement is common to the industry in parallel positions among similar organizations\" or, alternatively (2) by demonstrating that the position \"is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(4)(iii)(A)(2).

Innova's explanation of the position and of the supporting documentation, both initially and in response to the Request for Evidence, discusses Innova's requirement of\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   bachelor's degree or foreign academic equivalent and provides high-level assertions that the position is distinct from non-specialty occupations. Although Innova provided documents describing its business and a chart identifying the duties and responsibilities of the Technical Recruiter position along with the percentage of time Mr. Gogumalla would be expected to devote to each, it did not explain or show how those specific duties and responsibilities, or the nature of Innova's business, makes the position so unique or complex that it can only be performed by a person with a degree in a specific specialty. The conclusion Innova asked USCIS to draw is not self-evident from the documents and description it submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In its briefing before this Court, Innova includes the following argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Mr. Gogumalla's recruitment duties include evaluating the qualifications of candidates performing in positions that are highly specialized and technical.

No. 43 at 17. Elsewhere in its briefing, Innova argues that it provided USCIS with \"reasoned analysis\" demonstrating that the Technical Recruiter position \"requires specialized knowledge in EEOC and ADA guidelines, recruitment strategy, technology-based candidate screening, candidate pre-screening strategy, preparing and negotiating MSAs and SOWs, resource and account management, comprehensive technical interview techniques, and familiarity with employment laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions.\" Dkt. No. 45 at 12. As discussed above, however, Innova provided the agency with little \"reasoned analysis\" aside from high-level, conclusory assertions.

Instead, the agency merely recited the criterion and said that the employer did not meet the requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701094\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/445/1174/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701094\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/445/1174/\">\n    at 1180-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Next Generation\n   </em>\n   , the beneficiary was a computer programmer hired to work on a particular project. In denying the employer's petition, USCIS determined that, because the evidence indicated that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   employers hired programmers with an associate's degree or no degree, the programmer position did not\n   <em>\n    normally\n   </em>\n   require a bachelor's degree. The district court concluded that USCIS's denial of an H-1B visa was arbitrary and capricious because USCIS ignored evidence in the record that provided details about the project, including a description of the roles and responsibilities of each position needed for the project. Moreover, the court found that USCIS's reasoning that the position did not normally require a bachelor's degree could not be squared with evidence indicating that\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   computer programmers hold a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related subject.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526974\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/328/252/\">\n    328 F.Supp.3d at 265-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204685275\">\n    2017 WL 4685275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In both\n   <em>\n    Fred 26 Importers\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Next Generation\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that USCIS had ignored the employer's evidence altogether or provided reasons for its decision that were contrary to the evidence presented. Here, USCIS did not ignore evidence or provide reasons for its decision that are inconsistent with the evidence presented. Rather, USCIS concluded that there was\n   <em>\n    insufficient\n   </em>\n   evidence to support a finding that, due to the complexity or uniqueness of the Technical Recruiter position, the position did not qualify as a \"specialty occupation.\" Having reviewed the record, the Court finds that USCIS did not act arbitrarily or capriciously, nor did it abuse its discretion, in determining that Innova did not meet this second clause of the second regulatory criterion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Criterion 3: Position Normally Requires a Degree or its Equivalent\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The third way for Innova to demonstrate that the Technical Recruiter position is a \"specialty occupation\" is by showing that the company \"normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(4)(iii)(A)(3). Here, with respect to its \"Past Employment Practices\" (AR 120), Innova provided a November 1, 2016 job posting for the Technical Recruiter position (AR 310); evidence that its only other Technical Recruiter, Deepa Krishna, holds a bachelor's degree in Human Resource Management (AR 312); and Ms. Krishna's payroll records for the period November 1, 2016 to November 15, 2016 (AR 313-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In assessing this evidence, USCIS concluded that Innova did not demonstrate that it had, \"in the past, required the services of individuals with baccalaureate or higher degrees in a specific specialty for the offered position.\" AR 8. Here, the agency noted Innova's assertion that the company requires applicants to have \"at least a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration, Business Management, Human Resources, Marketing, or a related field.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed above, \"[a] position that requires applicants to have any bachelor's degree, or a bachelor's degree in a\n   large subset of fields, can hardly be considered specialized.\"\n   <em>\n    Caremax, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342164\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/1182/#p1187\">\n    40 F.Supp.3d at 1187-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, USCIS discounted the November 1, 2016 job posting because it was dated after the Petition for Mr. Gogumalla was filed. While the agency acknowledged that Innova demonstrated that one of its Technical Recruiters had a bachelor's degree, it also noted that her degree is not in the same field of study as Mr. Gogumalla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Innova contends that USCIS's Request for Evidence said the company should submit \"\n   <em>\n    present\n   </em>\n   and past job vacancy announcements....\" AR 105 (emphasis added). Innova says that the Petition should not have been denied simply because the company did what USCIS asked. Nevertheless, the Court concludes that USCIS articulated a rational and ample basis for its decision based on the record evidence in concluding that Innova did not meet this criterion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caremax, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342164\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/1182/#p1187\">\n    40 F.Supp.3d at 1189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that USCIS did not abuse its discretion in finding that the plaintiff failed to satisfy this criterion where the company acknowledged that this was its first public relations specialist position, and where its prior public relations employee held a different degree than the beneficiary in question).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Criterion 4: The Nature of the Specific Duties of the Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The fourth regulatory criterion provides that the Technical Recruiter position may qualify as a \"specialty occupation\" if Innova demonstrates that \"[t]he nature of the specific duties are so specialized and complex that knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(4)(iii)(A)(4). In their respective briefing, the parties discuss this criterion together with the second clause of the second criterion. For the same reasons described above with respect the second criterion, the Court finds that Innova has not shown that USCIS's denial of its petition was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court denies Innova's motion for summary judgment and grants the Director's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Mr. Gogumalla is one of three beneficiaries at issue in this action.
