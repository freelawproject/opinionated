(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. (ECF No. 1).) Plaintiff asserts that defendants Odwalla, Inc.

Odwalla is a California corporation and Coca-Cola is a Delaware Corporation with its principal place of business in Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10.) Of the various products it produces, Odwalla manufactures\n   and sells premium Odwalla \"100% Juice\" juices which contain the phrase \"No Added Sugar\" on the label (the \"Juices\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17.) Plaintiff does not dispute that the label is correct; as such, Plaintiff concedes that the Juices do not contain added sugar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17 (noting that the label \"is technically true\".) The labeling on Defendants' Juices appears as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff is a health conscious New York resident who purchased the Juices, including Groovin' Greens 100% and Berry Greens 100% Juice. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 8.) In purchasing the Juices, Plaintiff \"relied on Defendants' misleading statements that the product contained 'No Added Sugar.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff would not have purchased the product in absence of the \"No Added Sugar\" label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff contends that Defendants' inclusion of this phrase is impermissible under the FDCA, because the Juices \"do not resemble or substitute for a food that normally contains added sugar because fruit and vegetable juices do not normally contain added sugar.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Consequently, Plaintiff contends that the inclusion of \"No Sugar Added\" on the Juices is misleading, as it makes consumers believe that other 100% Juices without the \"No Added Sugar\" label contain added sugar and are therefore not as healthy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.) As a result of this deceptive labeling, consumers pay a premium for Defendants' products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants' moved to transfer this matter to the Central District of California, or in the alternative, to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a cause of action. After the motion was fully submitted, Defendants filed a request asking this Court to take judicial notice of a letter dated August 31, 2017 written by Douglas A. Balentine, Director of the Office of Nutrition and Food Labeling, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, at the United States Food &amp; Drug Administration (the \"FDA Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Request for Judicial Notice (\"Defs. Req.\") (ECF No. 31), Ex. A.) The letter was written to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (the \"CSPI\"), in response to the CSPI's May 24, 2017 letter requesting that\n   \"the FDA take action to enforce its regulation\" to prohibit companies from labeling 100% juices as \"No Added Sugar.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.

Coca-Cola is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Georgia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Sarah Ofner (\"Ofner Decl.\") (ECF No. 26) \u00b6 2.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Br. at 18; Plf. Br. at 21.) That section defines a \"substitute food\" as \"one that may be used interchangeably with another food that it resembles, i.e., that it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including shelf life) similar to, and that it is not nutritionally inferior to unless it is labeled as an imitation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.13\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The disagreement lies in how broadly the category of goods that the Juices \"resemble and substitute for\" should be construed. In support of their contention that it be defined broadly, Defendants point to an FDA Inspection Guide, Guide to Nutrition Labeling and Education (NLEA) Requirements (the \"Inspection Guide\"), which includes the following in the category of juices, nectars, fruit drinks: \"all fruit juices (excluding lemon and lime juice), nectars, noncarbonated drinks containing any amount of fruit juice or nectar.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jeffrey Rosenfeld (\"Rosenfeld Decl.\") (ECF No. 25), Ex. E.) As this guide is merely a chart categorizing various foods and beverages, and fails to contain any other explanatory information, it is insufficient to reflect the FDA's views on what substitutes or resembles Juices such as Defendants'.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203084278\">\n    2017 WL 3084278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (finding the same Inspection Guide insufficient).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, Defendants' fail to demonstrate how its Juices resemble or are substitutes for the beverages contained in its proffered \"fruit drink\" category. To the extent that Defendants ask this Court to take judicial notice of screenshots from various manufactures of several fruit drinks that do contain added sugar, this Court questions whether such documents are judicially noticeable. Even if they were, they are merely a sample of fruit drinks on the market and fail to demonstrate how the entire category proposed by Defendants \"\n   <em>\n    normally\n   </em>\n   contains added sugars.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203084278\">\n    2017 WL 3084278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Defendants' citation to the Questions and Answer section of the FDA's Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label is equally unavailing as it fails to demonstrate how the\n   Juices are organoleptically, physically, and functionally\" similar to fruit drinks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosenfeld Decl., Ex. F at 8.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds Plaintiff's citations to \u00a7 101.30(b)(3) persuasive. There, the FDA describes when a juice can be labeled 100% juice. Specifically, that section provides that juice products properly labeled as 100% juice but contain certain non-juice ingredients \"that do not result in a diminution of the juice soluble solids ... must be accompanied by the phrase 'with added ___,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.30\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), such as \"100% juice with added sweetener.\" The logical conclusion is therefore that all other juices entitled to the label \"100% Juice\", that do not require this modifier, must not include added sugar. Thus, a claim that adding the phrase \"No Sugar Added\" to a product properly labeled \"100% Juice\" violates \u00a7 101.60(2)(c)(iv) because the food that it resembles or substitutes for, other 100% juices, would not \"normally contain sugar,\" is not preempted by federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, this outcome is consistent with those from courts grappling with the definition of \"resemble\" or \"substitute\" on a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203084278\">\n    2017 WL 3084278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (declining the define the category broadly);\n   <em>\n    Rahman v.

It is granted insofar as it seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim and an Order precluding Plaintiff from seeking injunctive relief. It is denied in all other respects. As venue would not be proper in the Central District of California, transfer would not be appropriate. Additionally, the Court cannot consider the FDA Letter on this motion to dismiss and it therefore finds that, on the facts alleged and matters of which this Court may take judicial notice, Plaintiff's claims are not preempted by the FDCA because Plaintiff sufficiently alleges that Defendants' labeling violates the FDCA and Defendants have not convinced this Court that their labeling is in compliance therewith. Nevertheless, the Court acknowledges the potential import of the FDA Letter and believes it is more properly considered on a motion for summary\n   judgment. Defendants must answer the Complaint on or before October 12, 2018. The parties are also directed to appear for a status conference on October 19, 2018 at 11:30 a.m. at which time Defendants can seek leave to file a motion for summary judgment if they so choose.
