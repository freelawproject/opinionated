(Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 11.) In connection with his conviction, Plaintiff was classified as a Level One Offender under SORA, and as a result, he is required to report his residence to the Division on an annual basis and personally appear to be photographed at his local police precinct every three years. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 67-69);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Correction%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20168\">\n    N.Y.

(Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Section 1122-12, the HSOA, and the CPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 6, 2007, by Resolution 52-2007, the County adopted Article IV of Suffolk County Code Chapter 1122, and on May 15, 2007, by Resolution 466-2007, it amended and added to that Article.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suffolk County Code Art. IV,\n   <em>\n    available\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    https://ecode360.com/15135035\n   </em>\n   . In relevant part, Article IV of Chapter 1122 authorizes the Suffolk County Sheriff, in areas outside the Suffolk County Police District, to use deputy sheriffs to conduct initial address verifications of registered sex offenders and perform \"random spot-checks of these addresses to ensure that registered sex offenders are residing at the address they have provided.\" Suffolk County Code \u00a7 1122-11. Under Suffolk County Code \u00a7 1122-12 (\"Section 1122-12\"), however, the Suffolk County Sheriff is not to perform verifications and spot-checks in towns and villages that have requested, in writing, that the Sheriff not perform these duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 7, 2010, the County passed the Homeless Sex Offender Act, Local Law 3-2011, Suffolk County Code Chapter 745, Article V (the \"HSOA\"). (Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 29; HSOA, Budd Decl. Ex. G, Docket Entry 34-8.) The HSOA requires a \"homeless sex offender\"--\"[a]ny natural person required to register as a sex offender pursuant to [SORA] who has so registered, and who does not have a permanent residence on file,\" (Suffolk County Code \u00a7 745-23)--who is present in the County to \"report his or her overnight location to the Suffolk County Police Department [ (\"SCPD\") ] by 11:59 p.m. each day,\" (Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 29; Suffolk County Code \u00a7 745-24). \"Any person who violates [the HSOA] once shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to one year's imprisonment.\" (Suffolk Cty. Code \u00a7 745-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 5, 2013, the HSOA was modified by the County's passage of the Community Protection Act, Local Law 10-2013,\n   Suffolk County Code Chapter 745, Article VII (the \"CPA\"). (Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 34; CPA,\n   <em>\n    available\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    https://ecode360.com/27250164\n   </em>\n   .) Under the CPA, a registered sex offender seeking emergency housing is required to report \"his or her overnight location within one hour of checking in, registering, being placed, etc., in an emergency shelter or by 11:59 p.m. each day, whichever is earlier, to the SCPD.\" (Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 30; Suffolk County Code \u00a7 745-35(C).) \"Any person who fails to report his or her overnight locations as required by the [CPA] shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to one year in jail.\" (Suffolk Cty. Code \u00a7 745-37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is undisputed that from the time Plaintiff's sex offender registration period began in 1999, he was never homeless, he always reported his home address to the Division, and he was never found to have violated the check-in requirements of the HSOA or the CPA. (Cty.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cty. Resp. \u00b6 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition to modifying the HSOA, the CPA authorized SCPD to contract with PFML to conduct address verifications of registered sex offenders. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 2.) PFML is a not-for-profit organization that seeks to prevent and treat child sexual abuse and to provide services for victims of violent crime, and Laura Ahearn served as its Executive Director during the relevant time. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 1; Ahearn Dep. 7:17-8:2.) Pursuant to the CPA, the County--acting through SCPD--entered into a contract with PFML, effective May 1, 2013 through April 30, 2016 (the \"Contract\"). (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 5; Contract, Miranda Decl. Ex. F, Docket Entry 36-6.) Under the relevant terms of the Contract, PFML agreed to verify the addresses of registered sex offenders. (Contract \u00a7 III.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Contract and the Letter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Contract required PFML to use Registry Verification Field Representatives (\"RVR\" or \"RVRs\") \"to conduct in-person Home Address Verifications for Level One, Level Two and Level Three Sex Offenders required to report pursuant to SORA, excluding Homeless Sex Offenders and persons currently incarcerated ....\" (Contract \u00a7\u00a7 I.E, III.A.2.) Under the Contract, RVRs were retired law enforcement officers employed by PFML \"whose principal duties include[d] in-person or other means of verification of Sex Offender home or work addresses.\" (Contract \u00a7 I.E.) When conducting in-person home address verifications, RVRs were required to use unmarked vehicles and display photographic identification that did \"not resemble law enforcement identification.\" (Contract \u00a7\u00a7 III.A.2, III.A.3.) RVRs were to verify the home addresses of Level One Offenders, like Plaintiff, once per year. (Contract \u00a7 III.A.5; PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Ahearn testified that PFML's role under the Contract was to ensure that the sex offender registry was up to date. (Ahearn Dep. 70:15-71:9.) According to Ahearn, when RVRs were unable to verify information on the registry because a certain sex offender was not home, or the address was a vacant lot or an abandoned house, RVRs would notify law enforcement. (Ahearn Dep. 59:11-22.) Similarly, she testified that some registrants did not wish to cooperate with the RVRs, and if they did not cooperate, PFML would inform SCPD that they could not verify the offender's information. (Ahearn Dep. 67:17-68:8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Ahearn Dep. 71:5-9 (\"So, for us, the goal was to ensure that the registry is up to date. So if an individual ... chose to not participate or not cooperate, that was up to them and we would have to let law enforcement know, because we couldn't verify them.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ahearn testified that RVRs' notifications to SCPD might be in the form of a Sex Offender Registration Tip, which informed SCPD \"that there might be an inconsistency in the registry.\" (Ahearn Dep. 59:20-60:9.) She continued that after providing the tip, SCPD would decide whether to investigate the sex offender's compliance with registration requirements. (Ahearn Dep. 59:22-61:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Lieutenant Steven Hernandez of SCPD (\"Detective Hernandez\"), who was responsible for implementing the CPA, testified that he could not compel offenders to comply with RVRs because RVRs were not law enforcement officers. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 40; Pl.'s PFML Resp. \u00b6 40; Hernandez Dep., Budd Decl. Ex. K, Docket Entry 34-12, 31:6-23.) Further, he testified that if offenders asked SCPD if they had to cooperate with RVRs, SCPD detectives would tell the offenders that they were not required to do so. (Hernandez Dep. 54:2-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ahearn testified that shortly after the RVR program was implemented, a sex offender threatened to \"slit the throats of the RVRs.\" (Ahearn Dep. 82:15-23.) She testified that, in an effort to avoid harm to PFML staff, she reached out to the County to send a letter to announce that SCPD was collaborating with PFML. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ahearn Dep. 81:25-83:14.) As a result, in July 2013, (Pl.'s Dep., Miranda Decl. Ex. C, Docket Entry 36-3, 67:14-68:6), Detective Hernandez sent a letter to notify offenders of the Contract between SCPD and PFML (the \"Letter\"), (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 56; Letter, Miranda Decl. Ex. G, Docket Entry 36-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s PFML Resp. \u00b6 57; Hernandez Dep. 63:7-13 (agreeing that threats to PFML agents were a \"partial[ ] impetus\" for the Letter) ). The Letter provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Recently, the [SCPD] and [PFML] entered into a contract for the purpose of conducting verifications of registered sex offenders['] residential and employment addresses. Registered sex offenders are required to provide this information under [SORA], also known as Megan's Law (New York State Correction Law Article 6c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In the coming days and weeks, representatives of [PFML] will be visiting all registrants within the Suffolk County Police District. The purpose of this visit will be to conduct in person residence verifications. The representatives from [PFML] will display photographic identification which will identify them as a member of the [PFML] Organization. You will be asked to provide them with personal identification of a verifiable source (e.g. a NY State Driver's License or NY State Identification Card) or other accepted forms of documentation that provides current address information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, you may be requested to provide your employment information to the representative. If such a request is made, you will be asked to provide documentation (e.g. work identification card) to the representative for verification purposes. If proper documentation is presented this process should take only several minutes to complete.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Letter.) Plaintiff highlights Detective Hernandez's testimony that to encourage cooperation, the Letter did not inform offenders that they were not obligated to comply with PFML representatives. (Pl.'s 56.1 Counterstmt. \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    SCPD's and PFML's Verifications of Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff testified that from 2007 to 2012--before he received the Letter in 2013--SCPD officers or detectives appeared at his residence to verify his address. (Pl.'s Dep. 54:19-55:10.) He testified that after he received the Letter, in 2013\n   through 2016, agents of PFML or SCPD detectives--he could not distinguish between the two--came to his home approximately a dozen times. (Pl.'s Dep. 98:15-99:12.) Plaintiff testified that he spoke to SCPD detectives at his residence at least twice, encountered PFML RVRs at his home at least once, and was \"not sure\" whether any deputy sheriff went to his home to conduct a \"random spot check.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 83; Pl.'s Dep. 112:4-23 (recalling visits from SCPD detectives on January 1, 2014 and January 1, 2015); Pl.'s Dep. 116:9-117:8 (discussing 2013 visit from PFML RVR); Pl.'s Dep. 123:12-17 (\"Q[:] So altogether between 2013 through 2016, you personally had three contacts or visits where you interacted with either [PFML] agents or police officers and detectives? A[:] There could have been an additional one. I don't recall.\"); Pl.'s Dep. 124:12-17 (discussing spot checks by deputy sheriffs).) Additionally, he testified that his wife encountered either SCPD detectives or PFML agents at his home, (Pl.'s Dep. 90:20-92:17), and that on one occasion, his son spoke with someone who \"identified himself as police,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s Dep. 99:13-100:5). Plaintiff testified that while he and his family did not answer the door for PFML RVRs or SCPD detectives on some occasions, (Pl.'s Dep. 121:17-122:20), he was never arrested for failing to cooperate with verification attempts, (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    PFML's Attempted Verifications\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On October 16, 2013, RVR Mike Waser (\"RVR Waser\") attempted to conduct a verification of Plaintiff's home address. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 74.) When no one answered the door, he left his card. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 75.) Plaintiff testified that he did not contact PFML after receiving the card. (Pl.'s Dep. 95:7-96:2.) On October 17, 2013, RVR Waser returned to Plaintiff's residence and noticed that an individual was watching him from a window, but no one answered the door. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 76.) He made additional unsuccessful verification attempts on October 18, 21, and 24, 2013. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 77.) On November 4, 2013, RVR Waser returned to Plaintiff's home, and an unidentified male answered the door to advise him that Plaintiff was home but refused to come downstairs. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 78.) RVR Waser referred the matter to SCPD to confirm Plaintiff's address. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While PFML asserts that \"the contemporaneous records maintained by PFML indicate that there was never an interaction between [P]laintiff and PFML,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 90), Plaintiff testified that he answered the door for PFML on at least one occasion in 2013, (Pl.'s PFML Resp. \u00b6 90; Pl.'s Dep. 116:9-117:8, 179:9-21). Plaintiff testified that during the encounter, two RVRs stood approximately three feet from his door, identified themselves as PFML agents, and compared him to a photograph they possessed. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 95; Pl.'s Dep. 116:22-117:8, 156:10-11.) Plaintiff testified that the RVRs were wearing nametags on chains--not police badges--and were dressed in\n   plain clothes. (Pl.'s Dep. 116:23-117:6, 118:21-23.). According to Plaintiff, he did not say anything to the RVRs, and the RVRs did not ask for identification, ask for permission to enter his home, ask Plaintiff to leave his home, or indicate that he would be arrested if he failed to comply with the verification. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 96-99; Pl.'s Dep. 155:6-8.) Plaintiff testified that he stayed inside his house during the encounter, which lasted less than five minutes. (Pl.'s Dep. 155:18-21, 156:12-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On November 10, 2014, RVR Robert Carboine (\"RVR Carboine\") attempted an address verification at Plaintiff's residence, but no one answered the door. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 80.) Thereafter, he attempted, unsuccessfully, to verify Plaintiff's address on November 11, 12, and 13, 2014; December 4 and 5, 2014; January 21, 2015; and February 21, 2015. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 81.) RVR Carboine referred the matter to SCPD. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 82.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    SCPD's Interactions with Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff testified that on January 1, 2014, SCPD Detective Joseph Mucha (\"Detective Mucha\") and another officer or detective came to Plaintiff's home to verify his address. (Pl.'s Dep. 72:7-13, 77:7-18, 87:2-5.) According to Plaintiff, Detective Mucha also told Plaintiff that he was required to sign three one-page forms (together, the \"Forms\"). (Pl.'s Dep. 71:22-72:25 (discussing signing the forms), 79:2-14 (testifying that Detective Mucha said that Plaintiff \"had to sign [the forms]. [Plaintiff] could not refuse to sign\" them).) The first form describes Plaintiff's sex offender registration requirements under New York State law, but includes additional language that (1) he \"may be required to provide fingerprints or any other information necessary for compliance with the law,\" (2) he could be convicted of a felony if he failed to comply with legal requirements, (3) he had been advised of his sex offender reporting requirements under Chapter 745 of the Suffolk County Code, and (4) if he was homeless or receiving emergency housing assistance, he was aware of his check-in requirements. (Pl.'s Dep. 73:23-75:19; SORA Form, Budd Decl. Ex. J, Docket Entry 34-11, at ECF p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The second form describes homeless registered sex offenders' obligations to report their overnight locations to SCPD under the HSOA and advises that violation of the HSOA is an unclassified misdemeanor. (Pl.'s Dep. 80:9-16; HSOA Form, Budd Decl. Ex. J, Docket Entry 34-11, at ECF p. 2.) It includes an acknowledgment providing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I, _________, hereby acknowledge that I received, on this date, the attached notice regarding my obligations to comply with the reporting requirements set forth in [the HSOA]; I acknowledge that I have been notified (by police or social services agency) of the reporting requirements imposed upon me by [the HSOA]; I further acknowledge I understand the reporting requirements set forth in [the HSOA] and understand that any violations, by me of [the HSOA] will subject me to punishment as outlined in this notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (HSOA Form.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The third form discusses the CPA's requirement that a \"hard to place individual\"--\"[a]n individual registered with the [Division] pursuant to the provisions of SORA,\" (Suffolk Cty. Code \u00a7 745-33)--who seeks emergency housing must report his or her overnight location to SCPD and warns that violation of the CPA or the HSOA is an unclassified misdemeanor.

O'Neill, PFML, and Ahearn. (Compl., Docket Entry 1-2.) On February 5, 2016, PFML and Ahearn removed the action to this Court. (Notice of Removal, Docket Entry 1.) On September 22, 2017, pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the Court dismissed the following parties as defendants in this matter: Steven Bellone, SCPD, Edward Webber, Timothy Sini, Dominick Arpino, Joseph Mucha, Suffolk County Department of Social Services, and John F. O'Neill. (Sept. 2017 Order, Docket Entry 27.) The Court so-ordered the parties' subsequent stipulation and dismissed Ahearn as a defendant on November 9, 2017, leaving the County, PFML, and John Does 1-10 as defendants. (Nov. 2017 Order, Docket Entry 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Though the Complaint is far from clear, the Court construes it to allege that the County's and PFML's address verifications violated Plaintiff's First Amendment right to privacy, (Compl. \u00b6 48), his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures, (Compl. \u00b6 50), and his right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and Article I, Section 11 of the New York State Constitution, (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-61). Additionally, the Complaint alleges that the County violated Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by requiring that he sign the Forms during the January 1, 2014 visit. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.) The Complaint also asserts a claim that the County and/or County deputy sheriffs violated Plaintiff's rights to equal protection and due process by allowing deputy sheriffs to conduct verifications. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-75.) Finally, the Complaint contains a claim for declaratory relief, requesting that the Court declare that New York State law preempts the\n   CPA and that the CPA is unconstitutional.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 64 and at 15.) Plaintiff seeks judgment against Defendants in the amount of $1,000,000 for each cause of action; an order enjoining Defendants from performing address verifications or \"spot-checks\" of Plaintiff, enjoining Defendants from requiring him to sign the Forms or any acknowledgments, and declaring that the CPA is preempted by New York State law; and attorney's fees, costs, and disbursements. (Compl. at 15.) The County and PFML answered the Complaint on March 29, 2016. (Cty.'s Ans., Docket Entry 12; PFML's Ans., Docket Entry 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On December 5, 2017, the County and PFML filed motions for summary judgment.

(Cty.'s Br. at 1.)\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the County argues that Section 1122-12 and the check-in requirements of the CPA and the HSOA never applied to or were enforced against Plaintiff, and that as a result, he lacks standing to assert claims under those laws. (Cty.'s Br. at 6-11.)\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the County contends that Plaintiff's privacy rights were not violated by the address verifications because PFML agents and SCPD detectives simply knocked on Plaintiff's door. (Cty.'s Br. at 11-14.)\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the County argues that Plaintiff's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment were not violated because SCPD's conduct was not sufficiently outrageous or egregious. (Cty.'s Br. at 14-17.) Alternatively, it asserts that Plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment claims should be dismissed as duplicative of his First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendment claims. (Cty.'s Br. at 17.)\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , the County submits that even if Plaintiff had standing to assert an equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to Section 1122-12, his claim would fail because there is no evidence that County deputy sheriffs would have conducted address verifications differently from SCPD detectives. (Cty.'s Br. at 17-19.)\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , the County contends that even if Plaintiff had standing to bring a Fifth Amendment claim with respect to the \"acknowledgement\" of his check-in requirements under the HSOA and the CPA, his claim is not viable because the acknowledgment did not contain incriminating language and because he has not been charged with a crime. (Cty.'s Br. at 19-20.)\n   <em>\n    Sixth\n   </em>\n   , the County argues that the Court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's state-law preemption claim because it is a \"complex, unsettled, and novel\" issue. (Cty.'s Br. at 20-22.) Alternatively, the County argues that SORA does not preempt the CPA because the CPA addresses the enforcement of SORA's address verification requirements, \"which is an area that SORA cannot constitutionally occupy.\" (Cty.'s Br. at 22-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   PFML moves for summary judgment dismissing all claims against it. (PFML's Br. at 1.)\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , PFML maintains that it is not a state actor subject to liability under Section 1983. (PFML's Br. at 8-11.)\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , PFML contends that even if it were a state actor, its agents never seized Plaintiff because he regularly refused to submit to PFML agents' verification attempts, and during the one encounter they may have had with Plaintiff, a reasonable person would not have believed he was required to cooperate with them. (PFML's Br. at 12-20.)\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , PFML argues that even if a seizure occurred, it was reasonable in light of the minimal intrusion on Plaintiff compared to the important governmental interest in tracking and monitoring sex offenders. (PFML's Br. at 21-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In his opposition--an unfocused discussion centered on Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment claims--Plaintiff maintains that PFML is a state actor that violated his Fourth Amendment rights by attempting to verify his address. (Pl.'s Opp. at 11, 15-16.) The Court liberally construes the brief as arguing that the check-in provisions of the CPA and the HSOA injured Plaintiff. (Pl.'s Opp. at 11-12.) With respect to his Fifth Amendment claim, Plaintiff contends that because the County required that he sign an acknowledgement of the CPA's and the HSOA's check-in requirements, he was forced to \"prospectively create evidence against himself, had he ever had the misfortune to find himself homeless,\" \"which is precisely the violation of the 5th Amendment.\" (Pl.'s Opp. at 12.) Plaintiff mentions Section 1122-12 only in passing and not in relation to any claim under that law. (Pl.'s Opp. at 11.) He does not address the County's arguments targeting his\n   claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the Court should exercise jurisdiction over his preemption claim and decide that SORA preempts the CPA. (Pl.'s Opp. at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Abandoned Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Initially, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has abandoned the second and fourth causes of action, asserting violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The County unambiguously moved for summary judgment on those claims. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cty.'s Br. at 1 (\"The County further asserts that ... the CPA, as applied to Plaintiff, has not infringed upon his First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.... Accordingly, the County respectfully requests partial summary judgment in its favor dismissing the first, second, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth causes of action contained within the Complaint as a matter of law.\").) In opposition, Plaintiff did not discuss the First or Fourteenth Amendments or address the County's arguments with respect to those claims, but opposed Defendants' motions with respect to his claims under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Therefore, Plaintiff's second and fourth causes of action are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE as abandoned.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CIT Bank N.A. v.

June 7, 2016) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Additionally, the Court finds that Plaintiff abandoned his Section 1122-12 claim--the sixth cause of action in the Complaint. Again, the County clearly moved for summary judgment on the claim, (\n   <em>\n    see,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cty.'s Br. at 1, 6-7), and while Plaintiff opposed the motion on other grounds, he made only passing reference to Section 1122-12, (Pl.'s Opp. at 11). Specifically, while Plaintiff cited Section 1122-12 when discussing the Forms in the context of his Fifth Amendment claim, the Forms do not refer to Section 1122-12. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   SORA Form; CPA Form; HSOA Form.) Thus, Plaintiff's sixth cause of action is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE, and Defendants John Does 1-10, defined in the claim as \"Deputy Sheriffs currently unknown,\" (Compl. \u00b6 69), are TERMINATED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Standing to Challenge the HSOA's and the CPA's Check-In Requirements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff challenges the check-in requirements of the HSOA and the CPA, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-39, 80), and appears to argue that he has standing to do so because he was required to sign an acknowledgement of homeless offenders' obligations under the laws, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 11-12).

While the Court is cognizant that like in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's interaction with PFML occurred within the curtilage of his home, (Pl.'s Dep. 117:17-19 (testifying that PFML RVRs were on his stoop) );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Florida v.

The RVRs made no demands of Plaintiff: He testified that he did not say anything to them and he did not \"think they said much of anything other than to take the picture and look at\" him. (Pl.'s Dep. 117:11-16.) They did not touch him, threaten him with arrest, ask him for identification, ask to enter his home, or ask him to leave his house. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 96-98; Pl.'s Dep. 153:18-23, 155:6-8.) Plaintiff did not believe that they were carrying guns, was not able to see if they had any other type of weapon, and was not aware of whether they had handcuffs. (Pl.'s Dep. 156:21-157:3.) Unlike\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , neither Plaintiff nor his wife were told by SCPD that he should answer the RVRs' questions, and unlike\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   , there is no evidence that RVRs waited for Plaintiff on his porch for fifteen minutes after learning that he was temporarily unavailable. In fact, on a prior occasion, someone in Plaintiff's house told an RVR that Plaintiff\n   <em>\n    refused\n   </em>\n   to come to the door, (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 78), and Plaintiff testified that on multiple occasions, he and his family did not answer the door for PFML RVRs or SCPD detectives, (Pl.'s Dep. 121:17-122:20). Regardless, Plaintiff was never arrested for failing to cooperate with the attempted verifications. (PFML's 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 88.) Considering all the circumstances, the RVRs' conduct would not have conveyed to a reasonable person in Plaintiff's position that he was required to comply with the RVRs or that he was not free to end the encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Though unclear from his briefing, Plaintiff appears to argue that PFML RVRs' interactions with his wife and son increased the coercive effect of their conduct,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   as did their referral of future address verifications to SCPD. (Pl.'s Opp. at 16.) The Court is unpersuaded.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the evidence shows that an SCPD detective\n   and not an RVR spoke with his son, and therefore, this interaction is irrelevant to PFML's motion. (Pl.'s Dep. 99:13-100:5, 105:18-106:12.)\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , even assuming that Plaintiff's wife encountered PFML RVRs and not SCPD detectives--Plaintiff was unsure whether his wife spoke with SCPD or PFML, (Pl.'s Dep. 91:13-16)--Plaintiff did not testify that they suggested to her that his compliance with verifications was mandatory. In fact, Plaintiff confirmed that he did not \"recall her having any conversations with [him] about it other than her saying that someone was at the house.\" (Pl.'s Dep. 92:14-17.) Therefore, her contact would not have increased the coercive effect of PFML's interaction with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , as to the referrals, Plaintiff cites no evidence showing that at the time of PFML's visual inspection, he was aware that they had referred him to SCPD for further investigation, and thus, the referrals could not have influenced how a reasonable person would have viewed the encounter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Plaintiff's third cause of action for the violation of his Fourth Amendment rights by PFML is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   VII.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff's Claim that SORA Preempts the CPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As discussed, Plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that the CPA is preempted by SORA, as well as related injunctive relief. (Compl. \u00b6 64 and at 15.) The County's primary argument with respect to this claim is that the Court should leave the preemption issue to the state courts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Cty.'s Br. at 20-22.) In opposition, Plaintiff contends that the Court should decide whether SORA preempts the CPA. (Pl.'s Opp. at 19.) With respect to the substance of the claim, Plaintiff's argument reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The County's argument as to why SORA is not pre-emptive of the CPA is similarly misplaced; the very premise of the Plaintiff's case (as in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ) is that\n   <em>\n    SORA\n   </em>\n   provides, exclusively, the statutory authority for regulating sex offender registration, verification, and notification requirements. Any additional, more stringent, coercive local statutory amplifications of SORA are unlawful and must\n   be determined to be so, for the aforesaid reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   (Pl.'s Opp. at 19 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   A court may exercise pendent jurisdiction over a state law claim where the state and federal claims \"derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\"\n   <em>\n    United Mine Workers of Am. v.

Here, Plaintiff's remaining claim for violation of his Fourth Amendment rights by the County, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 15), arises out of the same set of facts as the preemption claim. Additionally, despite the County's argument, the Court does not view this issue as unduly complex, unsettled, or novel. Accordingly, in its discretion, the Court is prepared to address whether the portions of the CPA regarding address verifications and PFML are preempted by SORA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   However, the County's primary argument on preemption concerns whether the Court should decide the issue in the first place. (Cty.'s Br. at 20-22.) Moreover, Plaintiff's opposition to the County's preemption argument consists of two sentences that lack substantive legal analysis and citations to authority. (Pl.'s Opp. at 19.) Further, to the extent Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, he must move for it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fuel Gas Supply Corp. v.
