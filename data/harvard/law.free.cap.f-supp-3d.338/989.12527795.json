(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 20 (\"Am. Compl.\").) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant called Plaintiff at frequent and unreasonable times in an attempt to collect a debt Plaintiff allegedly owed. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 24-25). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant called Plaintiff on her cellular telephone via an \"automatic telephone dialing system\" (\"ATDS\"), as ATDS is defined under the TCPA, and/or using an \"artificial or prerecorded voice\" as prohibited by the TCPA. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Plaintiff alleges that she received at least 1,459 calls despite clearly revoking any type of prior express consent and multiple requests to stop. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26-28.) The alleged calls occurred between April 2, 2011 and April 7, 2014, and again after December 15, 2015. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 27, 2014, between the time the alleged calls began and Plaintiff filed suit, a proposed class action alleging claims similar to Plaintiff's was filed against Defendant in Illinois.\n   <em>\n    See Snyder v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No.14-08461 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2014). A limited class was certified on June 28, 2017 and settlement preliminarily approved on October 5, 2017. Order,\n   <em>\n    Snyder v. Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 14-08461 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 5, 2017). Plaintiff did not join the class, but filed this action before the class certification was approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff seeks damages and injunctive relief for the alleged violations of the TCPA, invasion of privacy, and harm and distress caused by Defendant's repeated calls despite her pleas to stop being harassed. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.) In her Amended Complaint, Plaintiff asserts the following claims: (1) negligent violations of the TCPA; (2) knowing and/or willful violations of the TCPA; and (3) common law negligence. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-70.) Defendant\n   now moves to limit Plaintiff's TCPA claims based on the TCPA's four-year statute of limitations and to dismiss her negligence claim with prejudice because Defendant did not owe Plaintiff a duty of care and Plaintiff failed to adequately allege damages caused by any alleged breach of duty.

To hold otherwise, the Court observed, \"would frustrate the principal function of a class suit, because then the sole means by which members of the class could assure their participation in the judgment if notice of the class suit did not reach them until after the running of the limitation period would be to file earlier individual motions to join or intervene as parties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/\">\n    at 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716351\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/538/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At issue today is whether the tolling doctrine applies when the class action is not dismissed, and, if so, whether a potential class member must wait for the resolution of the class certification before filing an individual claim in order to get the benefit of the tolling. Defendant argues that Plaintiff is ineligible for tolling because she filed suit before the issue of class certification was resolved. Plaintiff maintains that her claims were tolled upon the filing of the\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   action regardless of when she filed her individual claim. This Court agrees with Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant cites a thirty-four-year-old case to suggest that\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   \"does not toll the limitations period for individual actions brought by members of the class while the class still exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Pulley v.

Such an approach implies that class action procedures exist to deter filing individual lawsuits and that tolling is necessary to preserve the right of individual claimants to file suit should the class fail. \"The consequence of such a rationale is that putative class members who have already decided not to join the class if one is certified, must nonetheless delay filing their action until certain events occur in the class action they have decided not to join.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206988969\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This approach does not promote judicial efficiency, nor does it effectuate the policy underlying the statute of limitations. It\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   diminish a putative class member's right to choose whether or not to participate in the class. The\n   <em>\n    American Pipe\n   </em>\n   tolling doctrine is not meant to protect only those putative class members who follow the class action procedure, but\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   putative members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, Plaintiff was a putative class member. The fact that she chose to file her own suit prior to certification of the class does not negate her tolling benefit. Defendant was put on notice of its TCPA violations when the\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   action was filed on October 27, 2014. Pursuant to the four-year statute of limitations, any potential violation by Defendant after October 27, 2010 is subject to liability. Therefore, all of Plaintiff's claims are properly pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant argues Plaintiff's negligence claim must be dismissed because Defendant owed Plaintiff no duty of reasonable care and because Plaintiff failed to allege a sufficient factual basis that a breach of any purported duty proximately caused any injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To prevail on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must establish: \"(1) the existence of a duty of care; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) an injury; and (4) that the breach of the duty was a proximate cause of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Moorhead Econ.

The existence of a Defendant's duty of care to Plaintiff is a threshold question because \"in the absence of a legal duty, the negligence claim fails.\"\n   <em>\n    Domagala v. Rolland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7069768,7069811\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/805/14/\">\n    805 N.W.2d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (Minn. 2011) (citing\n   <em>\n    Flom v.

Here, Plaintiff argues that Defendant owed Plaintiff a duty to act with reasonable care, that Defendant breached that duty by failing to prevent foreseeable injury through harmful debt collection practices, and that the breach was a proximate cause of the injury Plaintiff suffered. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant maintains that because there is no special relationship between lenders and borrowers, Defendant owed no duty to Plaintiff, and therefore did not commit a breach by calling Plaintiff nearly 1, 500 times. To this end, Defendant cites two cases involving negligent representation\n   based on statements made by mortgage lenders to borrowers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunnigan v. Fed.

While Defendant is correct that Minnesota does not recognize a special relationship between lenders and borrowers, Plaintiff's claim is not based on such a relationship. It is based on the common law duty of reasonable care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Reasonable care is \"[t]he standard by which the conduct of a person in a particular situation is to be judged in determining whether he was negligent in the care which an ordinary prudent man would exercise under like circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Klingbeil v.

Minnesota law imposes a duty to act with reasonable care when the defendant's own conduct creates a foreseeable risk of harm to a foreseeable plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Domagala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7069768,7069811\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/805/14/\">\n    805 N.W.2d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Defendant's alleged conduct-repeatedly calling Plaintiff despite Plaintiff's request that Defendant stop-created a foreseeable risk of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Other courts have found that ninety calls in a fifteen-month period was unreasonable, amounting to an invasion of privacy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

Cal. 2009). Here, Defendant allegedly placed nearly 1,500 calls-the majority of them in a single year. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) It is plausible that a reasonable person would have foreseen those calls would cause Plaintiff harm. Therefore, Plaintiff has properly alleged that that Defendant breached its ordinary duty of reasonable care to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's complaint must be dismissed because Plaintiff's allegations of mental anguish and frustration are insufficient to support a negligence claim. Nonetheless, the Court finds that Plaintiff's description of injuries including intrusion, invasion of privacy, wasting the battery life of her cell phone, and emotional distress caused by the unwanted calls to be sufficient. The Court can reasonably infer from Plaintiff's allegations that Defendant's continuous collection calls proximately caused Plaintiff's alleged injuries.\n   <em>\n    Cummings v.
