Also before the Court are Plaintiff the Cherokee Nation's Opposition to, (\"Opp'n,\" ECF No. 1267), and Defendants' Reply in Support of, (\"Reply,\" ECF No. 1284), the Motion. The Court heard oral argument on July 30, 2018. Having considered the parties' arguments and the law, the Court rules as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns an alleged conspiracy to fix the prices of packaged seafood throughout the United States. Plaintiff the Cherokee Nation is a federally recognized sovereign Indian nation and brings this action in its proprietary capacity and under its\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   authority against Defendants as part of a broader multi-district litigation (\"MDL\") currently pending before this Court. (First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 823, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This particular aspect of the MDL concerns whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2015, various plaintiffs across the country brought civil suits concerning defendants StarKist, Chicken of the Sea, and Bumble Bee's conduct. The several civil actions relating to this alleged conspiracy were consolidated in an MDL and the judicial panel on MDLs centralized pretrial proceedings to this Court on December 9, 2015, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Transfer Order, ECF No. 1). The Cherokee Nation was a latecomer to this litigation and filed suit on November 16, 2017, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   No. 17-CV-2332, ECF No. 1), which was then consolidated with the MDL. Plaintiff originally requested the Court create a track solely for itself, (ECF No. 751-1, at 3), but later amended its motion to request placement in the indirect End Purchaser Payer (\"EPP\") track, while also maintaining its own complaint, (ECF No. 798-1, at 2). On February 5, 2018, Plaintiff filed a First Amended Complaint, (ECF No. 823), and on February 23, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiff's amended motion\n   and assigned Plaintiff to the EPP track, (ECF No. 859).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff's amended Complaint sets forth detailed allegations concerning alleged price-fixing schemes in the packaged seafood industry, which has resulted in a Department of Justice investigation into Defendants' activities and guilty pleas by several packaged seafood executives. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 213, 221-28.) Defendants are major producers of packaged seafood. The complaint presents allegations of increased packaged seafood prices resulting from anticompetitive behavior on the part of Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 205, 208-10.) Plaintiff's citizens, members of the Cherokee Nation, are indirect purchasers of packaged tuna. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants' anticompetitive behavior has resulted in fixed or higher prices of packaged seafood, that indirect purchasers of packaged seafood have been deprived of free and open competition, and that indirect purchasers paid artificially inflated prices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 229.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's amended Complaint brings the following claims. First, Plaintiff asserts a cause of action under section 1 of the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which is Plaintiff's only federal cause of action. Second, Plaintiff asserts causes of action for violation of State law; specifically, California, Kansas, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Florida. Third, Plaintiff brings two causes of action under Cherokee Nation law-Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act (\"CNUDPA\"), 12 CNCA \u00a7 21\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and unjust enrichment. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   FAC.) Defendants have filed the present joint motion to dismiss, (ECF No. 983), challenging this Court's jurisdiction to hear Plaintiff's claims under Rule 12(b)(1) and asserting, in the alternative, that the amended Complaint fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD 15-16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Defendants contend that the Cherokee Nation cannot assert\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   claims under the law of other states because it cannot bring claims under those states' laws. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Third, the Cherokee Nation has not alleged injury to a substantial segment of their population.

(Opp'n 17.) Instead, Plaintiff argues that the Cherokee Constitution and Cherokee Code creates the requisite\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing 51 CNCA \u00a7 105.B.14 (2015); 12 CNCA \u00a7 13; and\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Plaintiff also contends that the Clayton Act provides statutory\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   authority and therefore does not require it to assert \"quasi-sovereign or proprietary interests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

(Opp'n 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the alternative, Plaintiff states that it has alleged the requisite harm to its population, as well as expressed a quasi-sovereign interest in the economic well-being of its citizens.

(Reply 5.) Defendants assert that\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   's\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   requirements reflect Article III standing requirements, rather than requirements that can be replaced by Congress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They would distinguish Plaintiff's cases;\n   <em>\n    Chimei Innolux\n   </em>\n   required a quasi-sovereign interest, despite Plaintiff's characterization of\n   <em>\n    Chimei Innolux\n   </em>\n   as relieving Plaintiff of such a requirement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) Next,\n   <em>\n    Burch\n   </em>\n   only stands for the proposition that state attorneys general have authority to proceed\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   in suits for injunctive relief under section 16 of the Clayton Act, but does not relieve them of the\n   <em>\n    parens\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    patriae\n   </em>\n   requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Finally, Defendants contend that\n   <em>\n    Mid-Atlantic Toyota\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable solely because it is a 35-year-old out-of-circuit case that is contrary to binding authority. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants reiterate their earlier position that\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   applies and Plaintiff cannot meet the\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      A.\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    Parens Patriae\n    <em>\n     Standing Under the Antitrust Improvements Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties differ sharply on whether Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing requirements are constitutional or prudential. If the requirements are prudential then Congress generally can expand standing to reach the full limits of Article III.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gladstone, Realtors v.

Thus, if Congress has modified the standing requirements then Plaintiff would no longer need to meet the\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing test articulated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   . For reasons discussed in more depth below the line,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court assumes without deciding that\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing is prudential and not constitutional. The Court makes this assumption because, as will be seen, Plaintiff cannot meet the applicable prudential standing requirements for the various causes of action alleged. Plaintiff argues two sources of authority extend its standing to the fullest extent of Article III: the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and Cherokee Nation law. The Court discusses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 1976, Congress passed and President Ford signed into law the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=90%20Stat.%201394\">\n    90 Stat. 1394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   The Act created a new right of action for States under existing federal antitrust law.\n   <em>\n    Mid-Atl.

The Act provides that an \"attorney general of a State\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   may bring a civil\n   action in the name of such State, as parens patriae on behalf of natural persons residing in such State, in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the defendant, to secure\n   <em>\n    monetary relief\n   </em>\n   as provided in this section for injury sustained by such natural persons to their property by reason of any violation of sections 1 to 7 of this title.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c(a)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, Congress has expressly authorized state attorneys general to bring suit under the Antitrust Improvements Act and Plaintiff need not demonstrate prudential standing, so long as it brings a claim for monetary relief under \u00a7 15c. But here is the critical point: Plaintiff does not bring an action under \u00a7 15c. Its amended Complaint clearly states that it only seeks injunctive relief under the Sherman Act, (FAC \u00b6 252); \u00a7 15c only allows monetary relief. To the extent it seeks monetary relief, Plaintiff does so under Cherokee Nation law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Prayer for Relief, \u00b6 b.) Logically, Plaintiff cannot rely on \u00a7 15c to provide standing when it has no claim under that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nonetheless, the Nation argues that the Antitrust Improvements Act, codified in \u00a7 15c, provides standing to bring a non-monetary, i.e., injunctive, relief claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 18-19.) Plaintiff's reading of the law in incorrect. The Antitrust Improvements Act did not amend section 16 of the Clayton Act, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2026\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides a private cause of action for injunctive relief. The plain language of the \u00a7 15c only mentions monetary-not injunctive-relief. Section 15c only created a new procedural means-the\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   civil action-through which a State could enforce already existing rights of recovery under section 4 of the Clayton Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ill.

To that end, recently enacted Cherokee Nation law provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Cherokee Nation Attorney General acting as parens patriae, may bring a civil cause of action in any district court of the United States ... having jurisdiction over a defendant, to secure monetary or injunctive relief based on any\n   <em>\n    applicable\n   </em>\n   federal statute, common law, or the laws of any state.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   12 CNCA \u00a7 7 (2018) (emphasis added). Similarly, 51 CNCA \u00a7 105.B.2 authorizes the Attorney General to \"initiate or appear ... in any action in which the interests of the Nation or the People of the Nation are at issue.\" Thus, the issue is whether these constitutional and statutory sections allow the Cherokee Nation to displace the general rule articulated in\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court reads the foregoing Cherokee Nation provisions as authorizing the Attorney General to bring a suit under\n   <em>\n    applicable\n   </em>\n   substantive law, whether federal or state. That is half the equation; the other half is what constitutes \"applicable\" law. Can the Cherokee Nation Attorney General bring suit as if he is the Kansas attorney general simply because Cherokee Nation law authorizes parens patriae but the Kansas legislature does not explicitly do so? Plaintiff cites no authority for such a proposition. The proper inquiry is whether the Nation's Attorney General is within the scope of the cause of action authorized by Congress or a state legislature.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.R.

The Court will shortly discuss Plaintiff's standing under section 16 of the Clayton Act,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   section I.C, to request declaratory relief,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   section I.D, and standing under various state substantive law,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   section II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.\n    </em>\n    Parens Patriae\n    <em>\n     Standing Under Section 16 of the Clayton Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff's amended Complaint seeks injunctive relief for violation of section 1 of the Sherman Act.

Plaintiff would apply\n   <em>\n    Hood\n   </em>\n   in this case because the Court's prior rulings determined that claims similar to Plaintiff's claims were not frivolous. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (citing ECF Nos. 283, 295, 492).) Plaintiff advances a second argument; that injunctive relief is appropriate to eliminate the \"lingering effects\" of illegal conduct.

(Reply 2.) That is, they do not seek dismissal on jurisdictional\n   grounds; thus\n   <em>\n    Bell v. Hood\n   </em>\n   and its progeny are inapplicable.

Is \u00a7 15c sufficient to confer standing for injunctive relief? The answer is no. Does Cherokee Nation law confer standing: yes, but only if the substantive law in question, state or federal, allows standing by a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   plaintiff.

While the Supreme Court \"has not attempted to draw any definitive limits on the proportion of the population of the State that must be adversely affected by the challenged behavior,\" the Court does require that \"more must be alleged than injury to an identifiable group of individual residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Snapp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636688\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/592/#p607\">\n    458 U.S. at 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636688\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/592/#p607\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The allegations do not describe in any further depth the proportion or magnitude of the injury to the Cherokee Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   One could imagine a case where the line between a significant proportion and an insignificant proportion of a population is a close call. This is not one of those cases. The Court cannot adjudicate whether Plaintiff has alleged injury to a\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   proportion of its population because Plaintiff has not alleged facts about\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   proportion of its population. Rather, Plaintiff states, in conclusory fashion, that its citizens \"have overpaid for Packaged Tuna.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) In an effort to fend off this conclusion, Plaintiff argues that it cannot allege with more specificity the magnitude of the injury or the number of citizens injured because of Defendants' fraudulent concealment of their anticompetitive scheme. (Opp'n 18 n.8 (citing FAC \u00b6\u00b6 231-46).) Those fraudulent concealment allegations concern actions by Defendants to conceal their own activities; such activities\n   do not prevent Plaintiff from gathering and alleging information about its own population. If Plaintiff cannot explain how Defendants have injured a significant portion of the Cherokee Nation then perhaps the proper recourse is for individual consumers to join putative class actions against Defendants or bring their own claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   By way of comparison, in the\n   <em>\n    Microsoft\n   </em>\n   case, the district court found that \"millions of citizens of, and hundreds, if not thousands, of enterprises in each of the United States and the District of Columbia utilize PCs running on Microsoft software.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9402081\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/209/132/\">\n    209 F.Supp.2d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court briefly discusses the relevance of this section; Plaintiff's sole federal question claim has been dismissed.

The plain language of the statute only discusses a singular attorney general, i.e.,\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   attorney general. This is different from statutory language that authorizes multiple attorneys general.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15c (\"Any attorney general of a State....\").

The issue then becomes, does this reasoning extend to California law? The\n   <em>\n    Infineon\n   </em>\n   court said no. There, the court reasoned that the California legislature provided a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   cause of action in \u00a7 16760, which only authorized the California attorney general to bring such a claim.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3127313\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/531/1124/#p1165\">\n    531 F.Supp.2d at 1132-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court thinks such reasoning sound. The California legislature clearly provided a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   cause of action under \u00a7 16760.

Plaintiff is thus arguing that the Attorney General is bringing a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   claim on behalf of those persons who were allegedly harmed. The plain language does not authorize such representative actions. The structure of the statute confirms the plain language. Section 44-108(A) allows \"[t]he state\" to bring an action for appropriate relief and, as previously discussed, section 44-107 authorizes the Arizona attorney general to bring an action. Thus, the statute provides for public causes of action in sections 44-108(A) and 44-107 and a private cause of action in section 44-108(B). Because the structure distinguishes the causes of action, the Arizona legislature likely did not intend to allow a representative type action in a private cause of action. Or, at least, the Court does not make such a finding without authority saying so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Thus, the Arizona Uniform State Antitrust Act provides no authorization for a foreign attorney general to bring a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   suit and the Court finds Plaintiff cannot bring a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   claim for violation of the Arizona Uniform State Antitrust Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges a cause of action for unjust enrichment under Arizona law.

Further, section 57-1-1.2 includes \"any governmental or other legal entity with the exception of the state\" within its definition of a person.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This is a novel argument based on the unique language in the New Mexico statute; indeed, no other statute examined in this order mentions any governmental entity. However, a critical distinction should not be overlooked. The Nation's Attorney General, who would qualify as the \"governmental entity,\" is not the party who was injured. It is his fellow Cherokee citizens who are injured and are the \"persons\" as defined by the Act. Those persons have a cause of action under section 57-1-3 ; the New Mexico attorney general has a cause of action under section 57-1-8. No provision or authority demonstrates that a foreign attorney general may use either cause of action.

The Nation's Attorney General is not a person who was aggrieved; the individual and private citizens of the Nation, residing in Florida, are the aggrieved persons.

Plaintiff does not meet this requirement and has no standing under federal law. With respect to Plaintiff's state statutory causes of action, no State explicitly authorizes an out-of-state attorney general to bring an action in a federal court pursuant to out-of-state law. This same observation was made by the court in\n   <em>\n    Infineon\n   </em>\n   and Judge Hamilton's reasoning is worth noting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Not a single source relied on by plaintiffs expressly provides or even implies that a representative action by an Attorney General may be brought pursuant to\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   state's laws, .... [E]ven the most expansive of the general empowerment statutes relied on by plaintiffs, while recognizing the Attorney General's ability to bring actions in out-of-state courts, stops short of actually authorizing the Attorney General to bring actions in out-of-state jurisdictions\n   <em>\n    pursuant to\n   </em>\n   out-of-state laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3127313\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/531/1124/#p1165\">\n    531 F.Supp.2d at 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same reasoning applies here. Plaintiff's Attorney General does not have\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing to bring claims based on the laws of other states. Simply because citizens of the Cherokee Nation live in other states, the Nation's Attorney General cannot borrow other sovereign State's laws. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion and\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's claims to the extent Plaintiff seeks to bring a\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   claim under other State's statutory law. The Court\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSES WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's unjust enrichment claims because Plaintiff has not demonstrated prudential standing, but perhaps could amend\n   its complaint to meet the standing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Supplemental Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The only remaining claims are Plaintiff's eighth and eleventh causes of action for a violation of the Cherokee Nation's Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act, 12 CNCA \u00a7 21\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   and its nineteenth cause of action for unjust enrichment under Cherokee Nation law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 296, 328, 375.) Neither cause of action arises under federal law. Further, Plaintiff has confirmed that it is not bringing a class action and it has not argued this Court's diversity jurisdiction applies. (Opp'n 15 n.4.) Thus, the only remaining basis for jurisdiction is under the Court's supplemental jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendants contend that the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff's pendent claims.
