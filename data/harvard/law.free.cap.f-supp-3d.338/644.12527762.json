Van Tatenhove, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Angela Wilbers was involved in a car wreck with Geico's insured, Thomas Mangold, on January 31, 2014. After settlement negotiations failed, Wilbers filed suit against Mangold in Franklin Circuit Court on December 22, 2014. The Complaint was ultimately amended to include claims of common law bad faith and a violation of the Kentucky Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (KUCSPA) against Geico Casualty Company. Wilbers subsequently accepted a settlement offer, and Franklin Circuit Court dismissed all claims against Mangold, thereby leaving outstanding only the claims against Geico. Geico timely removed the action to this Court pursuant its diversity jurisdiction and then filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons\n   explained below, Geico's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 31, 2014, Angela Wilbers was a passenger in a vehicle that was involved in a car wreck with Thomas Mangold, Geico's insured. [R. 56-1 at 1.] According to the police report, Mangold was \"inattentive\" when he rear-ended Wilbers's car, which was stopped in traffic. [R. 59-2 at 3-4.] Wilbers, as the passenger in her vehicle, claims she was reaching down to retrieve something on the floor when the car was rear-ended, which caused her to hit her head on the dashboard resulting in pain in her head, neck, and back. [R. 59 at 2.] The other two individuals involved in the wreck suffered no injuries. [R. 56-1 at 2.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following the accident, Wilbers was transported by ambulance to Baptist Hospital, where she was diagnosed with a thoracic strain, a cervical strain, and a head contusion. [R. 59 at 2; R. 59-3 at 115.] An MRI on February 4, 2014, revealed Wilbers had \"degenerative disc space disease of the cervical spine,\" or \"significant degenerative disc disease.\" [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 59-3 at 160; 163.] According to one doctor, Wilbers had a \"nerve root entrapment and ... preexisting degenerative osteoarthritis, which clearly has been aggravated by her accident.\" [R. 59-3 at 163.] The doctors recommended physical therapy and gave her work restrictions for six months. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 59 at 3; R. 59-3 at 164.] However, during an independent medical evaluation on August 20, 2014, Dr. James Owen concluded that Wilbers had no active impairment prior to the wreck and that, based on his understanding, Wilbers had no preexisting difficulty. [R. 59-2 at 3; R. 59-3 at 319-20.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 2, 2014, Wilbers sent a settlement demand to Geico seeking \"all policy limits.\" [R. 56-1 at 4.] The demand itemized medical expenses at $15,401.28 and lost wages at $5,788.46; however, at that time, Wilbers only provided documentation supporting $9,871.60 in medical expenses with no supporting documentation for her claim to lost wages. [R. 56-1 at 4.] Wilbers later supplemented her supporting documentation and, in doing so, increased the number of lost-work days and total lost wages. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.] This supplemental documentation increased Wilbers's lost wages to $7,897.50, but claimed even more undocumented lost wages, bringing the total lost wages to $8,447.40. [R. 56-4 at 258.] Geico received no further documentation for the remaining alleged medical expenses. [R. 56-1 at 6.] According to Wilbers, Geico's claim file indicates both a submitted and evaluated damages total of $23,568.78, and Geico's claims agent, Miranda Baggett, had received authorization to offer Wilbers the full policy limit of $25,000. [R. 59 at 4-5.] The claim file also included an entry stating \"[i]njury consultation not required because of obvious policy limits,\" [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 59-5 at 22], but the parties dispute whether that statement was entered before or after the settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 19, 2014, less that three weeks after Wilbers's policy-limits demand, Baggett made an initial settlement counteroffer of $12,621. [R. 59 at 5.] In a voicemail left the same day, Baggett advised Wilbers's attorney that two months of lost wages appeared to be excessive based on the documentation provided. [R. 56-1 at 7; R. 56-4 at 4.] Geico attempted to\n   follow up on the offer multiple times before Wilbers's attorney informed Geico on October 8, 2014, that he was not authorized to negotiate and that Wilbers was considering filing suit. [R. 56-1 at 7.] Geico advised it was willing to negotiate further, but that it believed the records showed no recent treatment and demonstrated only possible aggravation of a preexisting condition. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Counsel for Wilbers indicated Wilbers had begun treatment again and would like to send additional documents for review. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Geico indicated it was willing to continue settlement negotiations and would review the additional documents; however, Geico never received any additional documentation. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.] Instead, Wilbers elected to file suit against Mangold and sent Geico a copy of the complaint on December 23, 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the litigation, Geico continued to review the complaint, and, on March 11, 2015, Geico offered $25,000 to resolve the claim against Mangold. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Wilbers accepted the offer four months later because she had been out of town for work. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Subsequently, Wilbers amended her complaint to add claims against Geico for common law bad faith and a violation of KUCSPA. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Franklin Circuit Court ultimately dismissed Wilbers's claims against Mangold. [R. 1 at 2.] After becoming aware that Wilbers's claim against Geico satisfied this Court's diversity jurisdiction requirements, Geico timely removed the action. [R. 1.] In Wilbers's response to the Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, she concedes to the dismissal of her common law bad faith claim. [R. 59 at 1, n.1.] Thus, the only claim before the Court on this Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment is the violation of the KUCSPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

[\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 56-4 at 1-2.] Wilbers also suggests Geico's offering of $12,621 was outrageous because Geico's claim file notes that Baggett received authority to offer the policy's limit of $25,000. [R. 59 at 6.] However, in those same file notes, other Geico representatives express concern over excessive wage demands prior to Geico's counteroffer, and Miranda Baggett's notes indicate she left a voicemail the day of the offer indicating concern about the lost wage demands.

In fact, Wilbers appears to state that the initial counteroffer would only have saved Geico $3,379. [R. 59 at 5.] After Geico made its first counteroffer, Wilbers's refused to negotiate beyond her policy-limits demand before filing suit. At no time did Geico refuse to negotiate its counteroffer; in fact, Geico continuously attempted to negotiate even when Wilbers's counsel never provided the additional treatment documentation as promised. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 56-1 at 7-8.] In reality, there is evidence to suggest that between September 19, 2014, when Geico made its initial counteroffer, and December 23, 2014, when Wilbers filed her state action, Geico made at least nine phone calls to Wilbers's attorney to follow up on Geico's counteroffer. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 56-4 at 1-6.] Within 4 months of the suit being filed - and 6 months after the initial settlement demand - Geico made the settlement offer that Wilbers ultimately accepted. [R. 56-1 at 8.] Simply put, Geico's actions do not rise to the level of outrageous conduct as contemplated by the KUCSPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Wilbers contends that Miranda Baggett's Affidavit should be ignored because it is unreliable and is contradicted by her deposition testimony, and, alternatively, the Affidavit should be excluded under principles of judicial estoppel. [R. 59 at 27-28.] For support, Wilbers cites cases\n   where the affidavits were provided after, and contradicted prior, depositions in an attempt to create genuine issues of material fact. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 59 at 27.] Those cases are not applicable here. Miranda Baggett gave an affidavit before her deposition, and, in her deposition, she states, \"I don't recall anything other than what's on the affidavit.\" [R. 59-6 at 14.] Baggett's Affidavit and deposition testimony are not contradictory; therefore, her Affidavit will not be excluded on these grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, the cases Wilbers cites concerning judicial estoppel also are not applicable here. [R. 59 at 28-29.] Generally, judicial estoppel \"prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\"\n   <em>\n    New Hampshire v.

As Wilbers acknowledges, judicial estoppel \"protects the integrity of the judicial process by preventing a party from taking a position inconsistent with one successfully and unequivocally asserted by the same party in a prior proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Colston Inv. Co. v. Home Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9436304\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/74/759/#p763\">\n    74 S.W.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (Ky. Ct. App. 2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, Wilbers claims Geico previously argued its communications with its insured, Thomas Mangold, were protected by attorney-client privilege, but Geico now relies on those communications to support its summary judgment motion. [R. 59 at 28.] Specifically, Wilbers avers Geico strongly relies on Baggett's Affidavit, which, in turn, relies on Geico's communications with Mangold. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Wilbers previously attempted to fight this affidavit prior to filing her response to Geico's initial summary judgment motion, and Magistrate Judge Atkins ruled against that argument. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 46; R. 50.] While it is true that Baggett's Affidavit contains statements made by Mangold, [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R. 56-4 at 1-6], nothing in the record suggests Geico relies on those statements to support its motion. Therefore, Baggett's Affidavit will not be excluded on these grounds either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In order to sustain a claim under the KUCSPA, a plaintiff \"must meet a high threshold standard that requires evidence of 'intentional misconduct or reckless disregard of the rights of an insured or claimant....' \"\n   <em>\n    Phelps v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Here, Wilbers has not offered any proof that Geico acted with intentional misconduct, and Wilbers fails to point to evidence supportive of an assertion that Geico never intended to fairly negotiate with her. Under Kentucky law, an insurer can reasonably negotiate a claimant's demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollaway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12184646\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/733/#p737\">\n    497 S.W.3d at 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Geico attempted, on many occasions, to negotiate with Wilbers, but Wilbers refused. Therefore, Wilbers has not meet the high burden to sustain a KUCSPA claim, and summary judgment is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, and being otherwise sufficiently advised, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Geico Casualty Company's Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment [\n   <strong>\n    R. 56\n   </strong>\n   ] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .
