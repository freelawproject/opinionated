Gardephe, United States District Judge\n   In a prior case before this Court -\n   <em>\n    Backer v. USD 30 Billion MTN Programme et al.\n   </em>\n   , 16 Civ. 6577 (PGG) -\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Paul Backer brought fraud and other claims against Defendant Rabobank and sixty-four other Defendants, including other financial institutions allegedly involved in the issuance of Rabobank notes (the \"Previous Action\"). On September 30, 2017, this Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss. (Dkt. No. 74, 16 Civ. 6577) In a new case filed in Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, that was removed to this Court (the \"Current Action\"), Plaintiff has sued some of the same entities and their attorneys for alleged misconduct in connection with the Previous Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On August 8, 2018, this Court ordered Defendants to show cause why this case should not be remanded to state court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 52)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants filed a response on August 15, 2018. (Dkt. No. 54)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In a September 5, 2018 letter, Plaintiff requests that this Court stay the Current Action pending resolution of his petition to the Second Circuit for a writ of mandamus. (Pltf. Ltr. (Dkt. No. 57))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because Plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of his mandamus petition, his motion for a stay will be denied. As to remand, because no necessary and substantial issues of federal law are raised in the Current Action, this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, the case will be remanded to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because both the Current Action and the Previous Action are relevant to whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Current Action, the Court describes both actions below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the Amended Complaint filed in the Previous Action, Plaintiff alleged that he is a U.S. citizen who transferred funds from a Dutch bank account to an account at Rabobank, relying on Rabobank's false representations that it was in compliance with U.S. law and regulatory requirements. (Am. Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 18) \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15, 18, 42, 43, 59, 60, 16 Civ. 6577) Plaintiff claims that Rabobank \"redlined\" him by preventing him from purchasing a residence with a Rabobank loan (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41); that Rabobank refused to honor Plaintiff's transaction requests and retaliated against him for reporting certain information to regulatory authorities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96); that Rabobank executives engaged in illegal conduct throughout the world (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142-43, 146-53, 156); and that Rabobank issued two notes to avoid certain tax and compliance obligations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 215-61)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 12, 2016, Defendants moved to dismiss (Dkt. Nos. 28-31, 16 Civ. 6657) and for sanctions under Rule 11. (Dkt. Nos. 32-35, 16 Civ. 6657) Plaintiff then moved for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint (Dkt. Nos. 36, 36-1, 36-2, 16 Civ. 6657), which Defendants opposed. (Dkt. Nos. 39-40, 16 Civ. 6657)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 30, 2017, this Court granted Defendants' motion to dismiss and denied their motion for sanctions. (\n   Dkt. No. 74, 16 Civ. 6577) In brief, this Court found that Plaintiff had not alleged an injury traceable to any alleged violation of the Securities Act. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff had also not pleaded a substantial federal issue sufficient to provide a basis for this Court to exercise subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12) While the Amended Complaint invoked criminal wire fraud, bank fraud, and money laundering statutes, those statutes do not provide a private right of action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11) Moreover, even if the Amended Complaint were construed to plead a civil fraud claim, such a claim was not pled with the required particularity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's antitrust, RICO, discrimination, redlining, and civil rights claims were likewise not adequately pled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12) Finally, because all of Plaintiff's federal claims were dismissed, the exercise of supplemental jurisdiction was not warranted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13) In addition to granting Defendants' motion to dismiss, this Court denied Plaintiff leave to amend (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17), and denied Defendants' motion for sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As to Defendants' sanctions motion, this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court has granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint and denied Plaintiff's motion for leave to amend. In doing so, the Court has concluded that Plaintiff's claims are frivolous. Although\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff is apparently a lawyer, the allegations in his complaints are so incoherent as to raise concerns about his mental state. Accordingly, the Court concludes that imposing Rule 11 sanctions would serve no purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Plaintiff filed a motion for recusal and to vacate the September 30, 2017 Order. (Dkt. No. 77, 15 Civ. 6577) Plaintiff contended that the Court (1) mishandled the litigation in a number of ways (Pltf. Br. (Dkt. No. 76) at 2-6, 16 Civ. 6577); (2) has a prior relationship with Defendant Rabobank's counsel David R. Gelfand - an attorney at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP - because both served on the Appellate Division, First Department's Disciplinary Committee ten years ago (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 &amp; Ex. D); (3) presided over another case involving similar facts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9); (4) defamed him (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-13); (5) acted as a defense advocate (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-17); and (6) had exhibited bias against him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-20) In addition to moving for recusal, Plaintiff argued that the September 30, 2017 Order \"did not result from due or judicial process\" and thus must be vacated under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 30, 2017, Plaintiff filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court, New York County. (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 1-1) at 43) Defendant Cooperatieve Rabobank filed a Notice of Removal to this District on December 19, 2017. (Notice of Removal (Dkt. No. 1)) In this action - the Current Action - Plaintiff alleges that Defendants abused the legal process in the Previous Action. According to Plaintiff, Defendants took steps in the Previous Action that were intended to punish him for whistleblowing. For example, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants improperly disclosed information regarding certain transactions that he engaged in at Rabobank (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 1-1) \u00b6\u00b6 20a, 67-81); \"named and shamed\" him as a whistleblower (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20c, 55-66); and improperly demanded financial damages and Rule 11 sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 95-103)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 2, 2018, this Court accepted\n   the Current Action as related to the Previous Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Current Action, Plaintiff alleges that he was a client of Rabobank, that he \"developed original, actionable information on Rabobank fraud and other misconduct,\" and that he \"blew the whistle on [the] bank's ongoing criminal and otherwise illegal conduct for profit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-53) Plaintiff alleges that in the Previous Action, \"Defendants demanded financial damages and sanctions\" in retaliation for Plaintiff's alleged whistleblowing to European and U.S. financial regulators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9) In support of this claim, Plaintiff points to filings in the Previous Action in which Defendants cite communications from Plaintiff in which he threatened or actually filed regulatory or ethics complaints against Rabobank and its affiliates with regulators in Europe and the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 44) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendants used Plaintiff's initiation of regulatory proceedings against Rabobank as grounds to (1) oppose Plaintiff's motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint; (2) seek dismissal of the Amended Complaint; and (3) seek Rule 11 sanctions against Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8) Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants \"abused process by demanding financial damages and sanctions specifically for 'harassing' emails from Plaintiff to Milbank Defendants regarding Whistleblowing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff further complains that Defendants publicized his whistleblowing during the Previous Action, that this \"outing\" had \"no conceivable connection to the legal issues\" in the Previous Action, and that disclosure of his whistleblowing status caused him to lose certain professional opportunities and caused him \"permanent, ongoing and irreparable\" damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64, 66;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 55-66)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff also complains that Defendants abused process by disclosing his transactional history at Rabobank. According to Plaintiff, in a December 12, 2016 filing, Defendants disclosed that Plaintiff withdrew a large amount of cash from Rabobank and published his address, email, and phone number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Sherman Decl. (Dkt. No. 35) \u00b6 5, 16 Civ. 6577 (disclosing that on July 26, 2016, Plaintiff transferred $400,000 to a Chase Bank account in New York and $562,463.57 to an account in the Czech Republic)) Plaintiff argues that this transactional information was confidential, that Defendants knew that disclosure of this information was improper (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72), and that Defendants disclosed this information in their legal filings in order to suppress Plaintiff's whistleblowing and to \"damage and terrorize\" him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff complains that Defendants \"abuse[d] ... motion practice\" under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in connection with their motion to dismiss and for Rule 11 sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-103) Plaintiff claims that Defendants' primary purpose was to punish Plaintiff for his whistleblowing \"and to teach a lesson to anyone considering blowing the whistle on Rabobank illegality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121 (\"Defendants perverted legal process[ ] because of their rage at whistleblowers and their terror of truthful, actionable Whistleblowing as more of Rabobank's manipulation and fraud becomes public.\"))\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Complaint in the Current Action pleads state law claims for abuse of process and\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   tort against all Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-42)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed a motion for recusal in the Current Action - which raised many of the same arguments as the motion for recusal in the Previous Action - and for limited discovery in connection with his motion. (Dkt. No. 31)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Second Circuit. (Mandamus Petition (Dkt. No. 1),\n   <em>\n    In re Backer\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 18-2273 (2d Cir. July 31, 2018)) The petition requested that the Second Circuit direct this Court to act on his motions for recusal in both the Previous Action and the Current Action and on his motion for a temporary restraining order in the Current Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 8, 2018, this Court denied Plaintiff's motions for recusal, discovery, and reconsideration of the Order granting Defendants' motion to dismiss the Previous Action. (Dkt. No. 53) Also on August 8, 2018, this Court ordered Defendants to show cause why this case should not be remanded to Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (Dkt. No. 52) Defendants filed a response on August 15, 2018. (Dkt. No. 54)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff filed an amended mandamus petition on September 5, 2018. (Am.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2) In a September 5, 2018 letter, Plaintiff requests that this Court stay its determination of subject matter jurisdiction pending resolution of Plaintiff's amended mandamus petition.

For example, Plaintiff asserts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [t]he Court has viciously and ... lacking any provocation, evidence or motion stigmatized and defamed Plaintiff, consistently pursued a profoundly biased, extrajudicial and punitive policy toward Plaintiff depriving him of any ability to participate in the litigation and the protection of [the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure], policy, statute and basic principles of fairness and judicial administration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Sept. 5, 2018 Pltf Ltr.

As discussed in the August 8, 2018 Order, the statement allegedly \"defaming\" Plaintiff was part of a ruling that was favorable to him - a denial of Defendants' well-founded motion for Rule 11 sanctions. Nothing in the August 8, 2018 Order or in the proceedings to date demonstrates that this Court has a deep-seated antagonism towards Plaintiff that makes fair judgment impossible. (Order (Dkt.

Indeed, Plaintiff does not cite the federal whistleblowing statute, except for the purpose of stating that the SEC has an obligation to not disclose the identity of whistleblowers. (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 1-1) \u00b6 58 n.54 (\"SEC 'shall not disclose any information, including information provided by a whistleblower to the Commission, which could reasonably be expected to reveal the identity of a whistleblower.'\" (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-6(h)(2)(A) ))\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendants' argument conflates two questions - first, whether Plaintiff is entitled to protection under the federal whistleblowing statute; and second, whether Defendants sought to punish Plaintiff in the Previous Action for his alleged \"whistleblowing.\" Plaintiff's abuse of process claim is based on a theory that Defendants' conduct in the Previous Action was motivated by a desire to punish him for his alleged whistleblowing. Plaintiff need not be entitled to protection under the federal whistleblowing statute in order for such a theory to succeed, however. Plaintiff may be a \"whistleblower\" in the colloquial sense, even if he is not entitled to protection under a federal statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In sum, the issue presented by Plaintiffs abuse of process claim is not whether he qualifies as a \"whistleblower\" under federal law, but rather whether Defendants acted for the purpose of punishing him for providing negative information to regulatory authorities. This issue does not present a question of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiff's lawsuit presents an issue as to \"whether Rabobank's Motion to Dismiss and Sanctions Motion were authorized and appropriate under the Federal Rules or instead violated the Federal Rules.\" Defendants contend that this issue necessarily involves a substantial question of federal law. (Def Br. (Dkt. No. 54) at 11) Plaintiff's claim does not depend on whether Defendants violated the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, however. While Plaintiff claims that \"Defendants['] abuse of process sought and\n   achieved collateral objectives that not only were not anticipated by the [Federal] Rules but directly violated the Rules['] letter and purpose\" (Cmplt.
