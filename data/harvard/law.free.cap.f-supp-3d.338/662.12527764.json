For the following reasons, Defendant's Motion is granted and Plaintiff's Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, David H. Lam, is a Detective in the Cleveland Police Department and an infantry Captain in the Ohio Army National Guard. He has been employed by Cleveland since 2008; and since 2004, he has been a drilling member of the Ohio Army National Guard. Plaintiff, Leonard Graf, is a Patrolman in the Cleveland Police Department and a helicopter maintenance mechanic Staff Sergeant in the Ohio Army National Guard. He has been employed by Cleveland since 2006; and since 2000, he has been a drilling member of the Ohio Army National Guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 10, 2016, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint for Money Damages Only (ECF DKT # 14). Plaintiff Graf brings an individual action only: \"Graf brings his claims against Cleveland as the claim of an individual Plaintiff against Cleveland as an individual Defendant, pursuant to the rules of civil procedure other than Fed. Civ.R. 23.\" (ECF DKT # 14, \u00b6 12). Plaintiff Lam brings this action on his behalf and on behalf of similarly-situated individuals who are current permanent public employees of an Ohio municipality or unincorporated township and who are also drilling military reservists who have not been paid all the State paid military leave they have accrued pursuant to R.C. \u00a7 5923.05. Plaintiff Lam also brings this action against a putative defendant class of Ohio municipalities and unincorporated townships that have adopted or promulgated a local ordinance that directly or indirectly eliminates, reduces or limits in any way the State paid military leave benefit of any of their permanent public employees who are also drilling military reservists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 6, 2017, the parties filed a Stipulation (ECF DKT # 47), dismissing all the claims of Plaintiff Lam against the City of Cleveland without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court entered the dismissal on the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Second Amended Complaint is brought in federal court pursuant to the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204301\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"USERRA\"). The USERRA compels civilian employers to deem military reservists to be on an authorized leave of absence or furlough from their civilian employment while performing their reserve military duties and training in times of peace or war. Further, the USERRA prohibits discrimination against persons because of their service in the reserve components of the uniformed services, including the National Guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Complaint additionally alleges that R.C. \u00a7 5923.05 requires public employers to pay their reservist employees their civilian pay for up to one month in each calendar year in which they are performing their reserve military duties and training. (ECF DKT # 14, \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint specifically alleges that the City of Cleveland has promulgated a Codified Ordinance \u00a7 171.57, and has entered into a Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\") with the Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association, which have the practical effect of reducing or eliminating the employment benefit of State paid military leave to its employees who are military reservists in violation of the USERRA and R.C. \u00a7 5923.05. (ECF DKT # 14, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 2, 2017, the Court granted Defendant City of Cleveland's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings and dismissed Count II of the Second Amended Complaint for the alleged violation of the USERRA by denying Reservists a benefit of their employment accrued during the performance of their military service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The only remaining counts are Count I requesting Declaratory Judgment and Count III alleging violation of the USERRA (denying reservists on military leave rights and benefits provided by Cleveland to other similar employees on comparable furloughs or other leave of absences under their CBA with the named Plaintiffs' union; specifically providing only differential pay to reservists on military leave compared to providing paid leave to other employees on jury duty).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Both Plaintiff Graf and Defendant City of Cleveland have filed Motions for Summary Judgment in their favor on the Declaratory Judgement Count and on the claim for Comparable Leave under the USERRA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204316\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

I, \u00a7 8 of the U.S. Constitution and no such powers, including militia powers, are granted, reserved or delegated to the political subdivisions of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, according to Plaintiff, the USERRA preempts Codified Ordinance \u00a7 171.57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Third, Plaintiff insists that case law in Ohio on this issue is sparse but conclusively favors reservists like himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiff proposes that the military leave provision of the CBA violates \u00a7\u00a7 4117.10 and 5923.05 of the Ohio Revised Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff Graf asserts that the Ordinance is an exercise of police power, R.C. \u00a7 5923.05 is a general statute of statewide concern and additionally, the Court should be persuaded by the public policy considerations of \"the readiness and preparedness of the state and federal military reservists during a shooting war in which Ohio Reservists are taking an active role.\" (ECF DKT # 57 at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In opposition, Defendant City of Cleveland counters these assertions, directs the Court's attention to relevant Ohio case law and challenges Plaintiff's entitlement to declaratory relief because of non-compliance with R.C. \u00a7 2721.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant points out that R.C. \u00a7 2721.12 requires Plaintiff to serve a copy of his Complaint on the State Attorney General because it alleges that the City Ordinance is unconstitutional. Although the Second Amended Complaint was filed on October 10, 2016, Plaintiff did not serve notice upon the Ohio Attorney General until he was prompted by Defendant. The docket reflects that Plaintiff belatedly served the Ohio Attorney General on February 26, 2018 (ECF DKT # 65). Since Plaintiff cured the jurisdictional defect, the Court will not dismiss the Declaratory Judgment Count on the basis of the R.C. \u00a7 2721.12 mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, the Court agrees with Defendant that Plaintiff Graf is not entitled to judgment in his favor on Count I for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Plaintiff Graf sets out the military and war powers held by the federal government as provided in the U.S. Constitution and then contends that Codified Ordinance \u00a7 171.57 is an unconstitutional exercise of authority over military leave and training. The Court has thoroughly read the constitutional provisions cited and the language of the City Ordinance on military leaves of absence. The Ordinance in question does not mandate when or how a City employee participates in\n   military training nor when military leave is necessary. Rather, it provides for compensation and benefits when an employee is called to active duty or for training in the Armed Services and National Guard. The Court refuses to stretch and contort the wording, meaning and intent of the Ordinance to make it into an exercise of military power as Plaintiff suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court is also not convinced that the USERRA preempts the City's legislation. In a prior Opinion and Order (ECF DKT # 38), the Court outlined its analysis of the USERRA\n   <em>\n    vis-a-vis\n   </em>\n   the Cleveland Codified Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   First, from the Court's reading of the relevant sections of the USERRA, it is clear that the intent of the federal legislation is to prohibit discrimination and less beneficial treatment of employee-service members because of their military service. Second, the Court notes that Plaintiffs' Complaint acknowledges that \"[n]o provisions in USERRA directly compel civilian employers to pay their reservist employees during periods of deemed military leave.\" (ECF DKT # 14, \u00b6 5).... Under the City Ordinance \u00a7 171.57 and the operative CBA, employees on military leave of absence receive the difference between their full military pay and their civilian pay. They earn exactly what they would have earned had they not taken military leave. The USERRA does not mandate otherwise...\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p.7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant City of Cleveland is not legislating when or how members of the Armed Services who are City employees can take a military leave of absence nor denying such employees any rights or benefits to which they are entitled under the USERRA. On an individual level, Plaintiff Graf offers no evidence that his requests for military leave were ever refused or that he suffered any discriminatory treatment upon his return to civilian employment through application of the City Ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiff's claim that the USERRA preempts Codified Ordinance \u00a7 171.57 is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court recognizes that there are only a few cases addressing the central issues of this lawsuit; but these decisions are totally on point and dictate the outcome the Court reaches today. On the other hand, Plaintiff relies upon an outdated Attorney General's Opinion from 1960, a Hamilton County Common Pleas Court decision from 1937 and a 2009 Ohio Supreme Court decision which addresses the unrelated issue of municipal residency restrictions. Plaintiff's criticisms that the Ohio Supreme Court decisions, offered by Defendant City of Cleveland, are distinguishable and not controlling precedent or do not apply the proper tests of constitutional validity or exhibit judicial activism and improper jurisprudence on statutory construction, are untenable. Furthermore, Plaintiff is asking the Court to sit as an appellate court reviewing the final decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court. This the Court cannot and will not do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Northern Ohio Patrolmen's Benevolent Assn. v.

For instance, a two-day funeral leave will not be \"comparable\" to an extended leave for service in the uniformed service. In addition to comparing the duration of the absences, other factors such as the purpose of the leave and the ability of the employee to choose when to take the leave should also be considered.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.150\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In his Motion for Summary Judgment on Count III of the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiff Graf abandons earlier comparisons to leaves and furloughs such as Call-In Duty and Court Time and restricts his arguments to the treatment afforded City employees on Jury Duty. He asserts that the City's Jury Duty leave benefit is \"comparable\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204316\">\n    38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but is more favorable than the \"differential\" benefit provided for Military Leave. Therefore, Plaintiff asks the Court to find that Codified Ordinance \u00a7 171.57 and the associated CBA provision in Article XIII discriminate against employees in the military service and violate federal law. Upon review of the evidence, the Court is not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   According to City of Cleveland policy, employees are provided jury duty leave with pay if they turn in their compensation received from the court for jury service. (Deposition of Personnel Director Nycole West, ECF DKT # 55-28 at 12-16). There is no practical difference between that policy and how police officers are treated under the CBA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16). Under the CBA, a police officer employee on jury duty shall be considered on a tour of duty and will be compensated accordingly as long as the officer surrenders the compensation received\n   from the court. (CBA Article XI, 15(I), ECF DKT # 55-11 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In his deposition, Plaintiff Graf was asked if he had ever been called for jury duty while employed with the City of Cleveland and he answered: \"One time, yes.\" (ECF DKT # 55-5 at 57). The inquiry continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Q. And then when you returned, did you provide the City of Cleveland with your check that you received from the court?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   A.

The employee receives his or her full City pay and is not entitled to both City pay and compensation from either the court or the military.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In his Reply Brief (ECF DKT # 69-1), Plaintiff provides a hypothetical calculation to illustrate his contention that the Jury Duty benefit is discriminatorily more favorable than the military leave policy. This hypothetical is not evidence; and furthermore, Plaintiff bases his math on a false premise and on a poor analogy. Initially, Plaintiff represents that the USERRA \u00a7 4316\"says that the employer must pay the Reservist the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     same amount of dollars\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   it provides another non-military employee.\" (Id. at 23-24). The Court is unable to find that language in the statute. Moreover, Plaintiff states that \"non-military Patrolmen on jury-duty leave\" receive a leave benefit from the City of \"full pay minus their jury-duty pay.\" (ECF DKT # 69-1 at 25). But the City does not deduct any amount from an employee's pay for jury duty. The employee receives full pay for the period of jury duty upon turning in the jury voucher. The Court cannot imagine that Plaintiff is arguing that it would be fair or favorable if the City were to require him to turn in his military pay upon completion of his leave of absence. This is especially so since his military pay exceeds his patrolman's salary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court holds that Plaintiff Graf is not entitled to judgment in his favor on Count III of his Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III. CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For these reasons, the Motion (ECF DKT # 55) of Defendant City of Cleveland for Summary Judgment on Plaintiff's Remaining Claims is granted and the Amended Motion (ECF DKT # 57) of Plaintiff Leonard Graf for Summary Judgment is denied. In light of the stipulated dismissal of Plaintiff David Lam and all of his class claims, and because Plaintiff Graf alleges only individual claims against one Defendant, the City of Cleveland, the entire case is dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
