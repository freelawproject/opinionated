Non-party Toby Mandel Hall, a stranger to both Barnes and Cabrero, observed what he described as an assault by Barnes against Cabrero, and called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants Derrick Williams and Mark Mitchell, who are officers of the New York City Police Department, arrived within minutes. Hall came forward and identified himself as the individual who called 911. He told defendant Williams that Barnes had placed his hands around Cabrero's neck, and that Barnes had been choking, dragging and pushing Cabrero. Barnes was arrested for criminal obstruction of breathing, and thereafter criminally charged pursuant to a complaint signed by Williams. Criminal proceedings against Barnes were later dismissed under New York's speedy trial provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Barnes now brings this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and New York law. He brings claims of false imprisonment and malicious prosecution under both section 1983 and New York law and, and a claim of assault and battery under New York law. Discovery is closed and defendants move for summary judgment in their favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because Hall's statements established probable cause as a matter of law to arrest and charge Barnes, the defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted as to Barnes's section 1983 claims. The Court declines to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Barnes's remaining state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the night of May 15, 2015, Barnes drank alcohol and danced with Cabrero at a restaurant and bar called Caf\u00e9 Nunez on West 35th Street. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 1; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 1.) Barnes and Cabrero were in a romantic relationship. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 2; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 2.) After about an hour, Barnes left Caf\u00e9 Nunez, and Cabrero followed him. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 3; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 3.) Cabrero had consumed several alcoholic beverages. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 5; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Barnes and Cabrero walked toward the subway entrance on West 35th Street and 8th Avenue. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 6; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 6.) The two stopped, and Barnes physically grabbed Cabrero; Barnes asserts that he was attempting to help her walk. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 7.) Barnes then \"got loud,\" which he asserts was an effort to prompt Cabrero to respond to his questions about why she was crying. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 8; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 8.) A group of onlookers gathered around Barnes and Cabrero. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 9; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A non-party witness, Toby Mandel Hall, testified in his deposition that Barnes \"appeared to be pushing\" Cabrero into the wall, a characterization that Barnes disputes. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 10; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 10.) Hall testified that Cabrero seemed to be in distress and was \"crying and whimpering,\" and that Barnes had his hands around Cabrero's neck and was \"dragging her,\" characterizations that Barnes disputes. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14.) Hall testified that Barnes's appeared \"to pressure her, to control her, to move her against the building eastward,\" and that he was speaking and gesturing aggressively, \"as if he was berating her.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Barnes disputes all of Hall's characterizations. (Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hall called 911 to report the apparent altercation, and gave a description of the location and persons involved. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At approximately 9:20 p.m., defendants Mitchell and Williams were patrolling in a marked police car, when they received a transmission about an assault in progress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 20; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 20.) They arrived about five minutes after Hall's 911 call, and testified in their depositions that Barnes was standing in front Cabrero, who was \"crying hysterically.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 21-23; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23.) Williams testified that it looked like the two were arguing, and that he and Mitchell separated them. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.) Mitchell testified that Cabrero stated, \"I just wanted to go home.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 28; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 28.) Plaintiff Barnes states that he does not recall speaking to any officer, but Mitchell testified that Barnes told him that he and Cabrero were romantically involved. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 33; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 33.) Mitchell also testified that Barnes told him that Cabrero had not wanted him to leave Caf\u00e9 Nunez. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 35; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 35.) Defendant Erik Hansen, an NYPD patrol supervisor, arrived at the scene, and testified that Barnes yelled to Cabrero, \"Don't tell them anything. Tell them nothing happened.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 37; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hall came forward and identified himself to the officers as the person who called 911, stated that he observed Barnes and Cabrero arguing, and stated that Barnes had \"placed his hands around her neck.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 39; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 39.) Barnes does not dispute that Hall made these statements to Williams, though he disputes their accuracy. (Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 39.) Hall confirmed that Barnes and Cabrero were the participants in the incident that he described to the 911 operator. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 41; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Hall's statements were recorded in an arrest report and criminal complaint made by Williams. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 43-44; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) It is undisputed that Hall is the only witness who described Barnes as having choked and dragged Cabrero, and that Williams was the only NYPD officer who spoke to Hall at the scene. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 65; Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant Hansen instructed defendant Williams to arrest Barnes for criminal obstruction of breathing, and Williams did so. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 47-48; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) Barnes was handcuffed, and Williams testified in his deposition that Barnes was acting \"[e]rratic, combative,\" including \"yelling and screaming.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 50; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 50.) Barnes disputes that he behaved in this manner. (Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Barnes was transported to the NYPD's Midtown South Precinct. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 51; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 51.) At the precinct, defendant Williams performed a pat-down search of Barnes. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 52; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 52.) Cabrero filled out a handwritten statement on a Domestic Incident Report, which stated in part that Barnes \"got loud, and that's when people started coming around,\" and that she wanted to leave but Barnes \"kept asking me and grabbing me so I couldn't leave....\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 53-55; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.) At her deposition, Cabrero confirmed the accuracy of her handwritten statement. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 56; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 16, 2015, defendant Williams spoke to a Manhattan Assistant District Attorney about the arrest, and signed a criminal complaint charging Barnes with Criminal Obstruction of Breathing or Blood Circulation under New York Penal Law section 121.11(a) and harassment in the second degree under New York Penal Law section 240.26(a). (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 57-58; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 57-58.) On September 9, 2015, all charges against Barnes were dismissed pursuant to the speedy trial provisions of New York Criminal Procedure Law section 30.30. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 59; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Barnes testified that he sustained bruises to his wrists as a result of being handcuffed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 70; Def. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 70.) Barnes was in NYPD custody from May 15 to May 16, 2015. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 60; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Barnes commenced this action on April 6, 2016. (Docket # 1.)

In this instance, while Barnes disputes the accuracy of Hall's version of events, he does not dispute that Hall called 911, reported an assault in progress, identified himself to the officers upon their arrival, and told defendant Williams that Barnes had placed his hands around Cabrero's neck.

While Barnes disputes that he had, in fact, applied pressure to Cabrero's neck, it was reasonable of the officers to arrest Barnes based on Hall's version of events.

Crowley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3674210\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/460/388/#p395\">\n    460 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 (2d Cir. 2006) ). \"Once a police officer has a reasonable basis for believing there is probable cause, he is not required to explore and eliminate every theoretically plausible claim of innocence before making an arrest.\"\n   <em>\n    Ricciuti v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11901849\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/124/123/#p128\">\n    124 F.3d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 128 (2d Cir. 1997). The evidence cited by Barnes was not sufficient to raise doubts about the veracity of Hall's account. The absence of visible injury to Cabrero, such as red marks on her neck, does not weigh against the reliability and veracity of Hall's account, nor does Cabrero's purported denial that Barnes had choked her. Assuming the truth of Barnes's version of events, the officers were not required to adjudicate the credibility of Hall's statements against Cabrero's denial. \"Once officers possess facts sufficient to establish probable cause, they are neither required nor allowed to sit as prosecutor, judge or jury. Their function is to apprehend those suspected of wrongdoing, and not to finally determine guilt through a weighing of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Krause v. Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10528670\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/887/362/#p372\">\n    887 F.2d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (2d Cir. 1989).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ultimately, the arrest of Barnes was based on the statements and observations of Hall, a non-interested witness who called 911, identified himself to the officers and described Barnes's obstruction of Cabrero's breathing. While Barnes denies that he actually obstructed Cabrero's breathing, the fact of Hall's statements is not in dispute. The Court concludes that, as a matter of law, there was probable cause to arrest Barnes, which precludes Barnes's claim for false arrest. Defendants' summary judgment motion as to the false arrest claim under section 1983 is therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Summary Judgment Motion Is Granted as to Barnes's Malicious Prosecution Claim.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Barnes asserts that Williams maliciously prosecuted him under section 1983 by signing a criminal complaint to commence proceedings against him. To establish a claim of malicious prosecution under section 1983, Barnes must prove \"(1) the initiation or continuation of a criminal proceeding against plaintiff; (2) termination of the proceeding in plaintiff's favor; (3) lack of probable cause for commencing the proceeding; and (4) actual malice as a motivation for defendants actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Manganiello v.

He must also show a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700817\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/149/#p161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The existence of probable cause is a complete defense to a malicious prosecution claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700817\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/149/#p161\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700817\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/149/#p161\">\n    at 161-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   As discussed, defendants have come forward with evidence that establishes probable cause as a matter of law for Barnes's prosecution on the charge of criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation. Defendants' motion is therefore granted as to Barnes's claim of malicious prosecution for that crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Barnes was also charged separately for harassment in the second degree, pursuant to New York Penal Law section 240.26(1). \"A person is guilty of harassment in the second degree when, with intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person: 1. He or she strikes, shoves, kicks or otherwise subjects such other person to physical contact, or attempts or threatens to do the same.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20L.%20%C2%A7%20240.26\">\n    N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In her handwritten statement completed at the Midtown South Precinct, Cabrero wrote, \"I just wanted to go to the train but [Barnes] kept asking me and grabbing me so I couldn't leave.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 55.) This description written by Cabrero\n   is consistent with an intent to harass or annoy her by subjecting her to physical contact.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20L.%20%C2%A7%20240.26\">\n    N.Y. Penal L. \u00a7 240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Additionally, it is undisputed that Hall told Williams that Barnes and Cabrero had been arguing and that Barnes had placed his hands around Cabrero's neck, and that Hall described an assault in progress to the 911 operator. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 39, 41; Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 39, 41.) The criminal complaint signed by Williams cited to Hall's statements. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6 44; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 44.) Hall's statements were consistent with an intent to harass or annoy Cabrero by the use of physical contact. The Court therefore concludes that, as a matter of law, there was probable cause to commence criminal proceeding against Barnes. Defendants' summary judgment motion is therefore granted as to the malicious prosecution claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants' motion is separately granted because Barnes has not come forward with evidence of actual malice by Williams as a motivation for commencing criminal proceedings. In a malicious prosecution claim, \"malice\" is \" 'a wrong or improper motive, something other than a desire to see the ends of justice served.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fulton v.

Aside from the purported absence of probable cause, Barnes has not pointed to any improper motive held by Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants' summary judgment motion is therefore granted as to Barnes's malicious prosecution claim under Section 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    The Court Declines to Exercise Supplement Jurisdiction over Barnes's Remaining State Law Claims.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Lastly, defendants urge that the Court should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs' remaining state law claims, or alternatively, if such jurisdiction is exercised, summary judgment should be granted in their favor.
