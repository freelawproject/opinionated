In an order dated August 28, 2017 (the \"Prior Order\"), the Court granted Plaintiff summary judgment on its claim for specific performance and awarded Plaintiff attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order, Dkt. 54. The Prior Order also directed Plaintiff to move for summary judgment on its remaining claims or those claims would be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, seeking monetary damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Notice of Mot., Dkt. 55; Pl.'s Mem. of Law, Dkt. 59 at 2. Plaintiff also seeks attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law, Dkt. 59 at 2. Defendant cross-moves, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(4) and 12(c), to vacate the Prior Order and for judgment on the pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Notice of Mot., Dkt. 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the following reasons, Defendant's cross-motions are DENIED, and Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $180,204.36 in damages, $116,950.00 in prejudgment interest, and $5,837.12 in attorneys' fees and expenses. All claims for which Plaintiff did not move for summary judgment are DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Note\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the facts of this case.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Prior Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In brief, in August 2015, Defendant sold Plaintiff a Convertible Redeemable Note (the \"Note\") with a principal face value of $110,000, a maturity date of August 2016, and an interest rate of 10 percent per annum.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2; Malin Decl., Ex. A (\"Note\"). Plaintiff purchased the note for $100,000 (a 10 percent discount).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 2; Malin Decl., Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Note contained a conversion option, pursuant to which Plaintiff could convert the Note's outstanding principal and interest into shares of Defendant's common stock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 2; Note \u00a7 4(a). The Note set the conversion price at a 60 percent discount of the stock's lowest trading price during a 20-day \"look back\" period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 4(a). The Note required Defendant to deliver the converted shares to Plaintiff within three business days of Defendant's receipt of a Notice of Conversion and provided that Defendant's failure to do so would be an \"Event of Default.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Note would become immediately due and payable, and default interest would begin accruing at a rate of 24 percent per annum.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Additionally, the Note required Defendant to place into a reserve four times the number of shares that would be required if the Note were fully converted.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12. Finally, the Note required Defendant to pay \"all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which [were] incurred by [Plaintiff] in collecting any amount due under the Note,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7, in addition to attorneys' fees incurred in any \"action or proceeding to enforce any provision of [the] Note,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendant's Breach of the Note\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 30, 2015, Plaintiff sent a Notice of Conversion to Defendant, seeking to convert $83,600 of the Note's outstanding value into 1,857,777 shares of Defendant's common stock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 2; Malin Decl. \u00b6 4; Malin Decl. Ex. C; Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 3. The Notice of Conversion set the conversion price at $0.045 per share, based on a 60 percent discount of the stock's lowest trading price during the \"look back\" period (specifically, its price of $0.0751 per share on December 4, 2015).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Malin Decl. Ex. C. Defendant failed to timely deliver the shares to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 2; Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In March 2016, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 3. The Settlement Agreement required Defendant to pay Plaintiff $168,065 in eight monthly installments of $21,008.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 10. While it is not entirely clear how the parties arrived at the $168,065 figure, the amount appears to represent principal, interest, and default interest due under the Note, along with an additional 40 percent \"spicer.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.5. After entering into two addenda to the Settlement Agreement, Defendant paid Plaintiff one installment in cash and three installments in shares, for a total value of $84,033 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , approximately half of the amount due under the Settlement Agreement).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4, 10; Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 6; Pl.'s Reply Mem. of Law at 15. Defendant has not paid the remaining amount due under the Settlement Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff filed this action on November 21, 2016, and subsequently moved for summary judgment, seeking an order directing Defendant to deliver the shares requested in the Notice of Conversion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Prior Notice of Mot., Dkt. 28; Prior Order at 1, 11. The Court granted Plaintiff's motion, holding that the Note was a valid contract and that Defendant had breached it by failing to deliver the requested shares.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 12 (\"There is a valid contract in place, and Blue Citi performed its obligations thereunder.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"There is no dispute between the parties that 5Barz breached the Note.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (same);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (same). The Court also awarded Plaintiff $18,988.33 in attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14. Defendant subsequently delivered the shares as ordered.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13;\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 6; Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Prior Order also held that the Settlement Agreement was an executory accord to the Note, meaning that Defendant's obligations under the Note remain in force unless and until Defendant materially fulfills its obligations under the Settlement Agreement (and its addenda).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 5-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff now moves for summary judgment on its breach of contract claim, seeking damages for the reduction in the value of Defendant's shares between the date on which Defendant was first required to deliver the shares (which Plaintiff alleges was December 30, 2015) and the date that Defendant finally delivered the shares as required by the Prior Order (September 1, 2017).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law at 2. Plaintiff also seeks reimbursement for attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in connection with this motion.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant cross-moves to vacate the Prior Order and for judgment on the pleadings, seeking to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Cross-Mot.

In its Prior Order, the Court found that Defendant breached the Note, and the Court ordered Defendant to deliver the shares requested in the Notice of Conversion. This remedy, however, did not account for the reduction in the value of those shares between the date that Defendant was obligated to deliver them (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , three business days after Defendant received the Notice of Conversion) and the date the Defendant actually delivered them (September 1, 2017).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 11-12; Pl.'s Mem. of Law at 7. Plaintiff would have been better off had Defendant properly performed its obligations under the Note. Plaintiff is entitled to damages in order to be put \"in as good a position as it would have been had the contract been fully performed.\"\n   <em>\n    McKinley Allsopp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1990%20WL%20138959\">\n    1990 WL 138959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant argues that \"Plaintiff has already received the benefit of its bargain\" in the form of $84,033 paid under the Settlement Agreement and $83,600 in principal that the Prior Order directed Defendant to convert into shares. Def.'s Resp. Mem. of Law at 4; Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 8. In Defendant's view, these payments mean that \"Plaintiff has been made whole and is not entitled to additional damages.\" Def.'s Resp. Mem. of Law at 4. Defendant is wrong. First, as to the $84,033, the Court held in the Prior Order that the Settlement Agreement is an executory accord.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 5-9. Because Defendant materially breached the Settlement Agreement (by paying only half of the amount owed under the Agreement), the Prior Order held that the payments under the Settlement Agreement did not extinguish Defendant's obligations under the Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (stating that Defendant's comparison between the Settlement Agreement and the Note is a comparison between \"apples and oranges\"). As to the $83,600 in principal that the Court ordered Defendant to convert into shares, the Prior Order's remedy did not account for the value that Plaintiff could have captured by selling the shares had Defendant delivered them when it was first obligated to do so. Even if the conversion had accounted for the entire outstanding principal and interest due under the Note-which it did not,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-Plaintiff would still be in a worse position than if Defendant had timely performed the contract, because the shares that Plaintiff sought to convert were worth more at the time of the breach than at the time the shares were finally delivered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that Plaintiff is not entitled to damages because the Note is criminally usurious and void as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Mem. of Law at 4. For the reasons that the Court has discussed, this argument lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For all these reasons, no genuine dispute exists as to Plaintiff's entitlement to damages for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The measure of Plaintiff's damages is slightly more complicated. Plaintiff offers evidence that on December 30, 2015 (the date that Plaintiff issued the Notice of Conversion), the volume-weighted average price of a share of Defendant's common stock was $0.142.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 7 (citing Malin Decl. Ex. D). The Notice of Conversion sought to purchase 1,857,777 shares on that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Thus, had Defendant delivered the shares on December 30, 2015, Plaintiff would have received shares worth $263,804.33.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. By the time Defendant eventually delivered the shares (September 1, 2017), however, the volume-weighted average price per share had dropped to $0.045.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (citing Malin Decl. Ex. E). As a result, Plaintiff's shares on the date that Defendant delivered them were worth only $83,599.97.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The total difference in value is $180,204.36.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Plaintiff argues that it is entitled to that amount in damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law at 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff's analysis contains several assumptions. First, the Note allowed Defendant \"three business days\" after receiving a Notice of Conversion to deliver the shares to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Note \u00a7 4(a). Thus, a breach of Defendant's obligations did not occur until after those three business days had elapsed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8(k) (defining an \"Event of Default\" as Defendant's failure to deliver shares \"within 3 business days of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion\"). Plaintiff issued the Notice of Conversion on December 30, 2015, so Defendant's breach did not occur until three business days later, January 6, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Malin Decl. Ex. C. By seeking damages for the difference in stock price between December 30, 2015 and September 1, 2017, Plaintiff incorrectly assumes that Defendant's breach occurred on December 30, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The present record does not indicate the price of the stock on the date of breach, January 6, 2016. The Court notes, however, that \"New York courts have significant flexibility in estimating general damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Tractebel Energy Mktg., Inc. v. AEP Power Mktg., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106410\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/89/#p111\">\n    487 F.3d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (2d Cir. 2007). Under New York law, \"[t]he plaintiff need only show a stable foundation for a reasonable estimate of the damage incurred as a result of the breach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106410\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/89/#p111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3106410\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/487/89/#p111\">\n    at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LifeTree Trading Pte., Ltd. v.

May 14, 2018). Even though these shares are thinly traded, the price of shares on December 30, 2015, is a reasonable estimate of Plaintiff's damages. Looking to publicly available stock-price data, the Court takes judicial notice that\n   the price of Defendant's stock was higher on January 6 than on December 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ganino v.

Mar. 30, 2018) (same). Plaintiff, then, has essentially waived its right to higher damages through a more precise calculation as of the date of breach. Under these circumstances, the Court will not insist that Plaintiff take a larger share of the pie than it has asked for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The second assumption in Plaintiff's analysis is slightly more problematic. Plaintiff states that it \"has sold all of the shares\" that it received from Defendant. Supp. Malin Decl. \u00b6 8. But Plaintiff does not provide any information about the price at which it sold the shares. Plaintiff seeks damages for the reduction in the value of the shares between December 30, 2015 and September 1, 2017, but if the stock price rose subsequent to September 1, and if Plaintiff sold the shares at that higher price, then the difference between that higher price and the price on September 1 should be deducted from Plaintiff's damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Two facts, however, convince the Court that Plaintiff's damages analysis is appropriate. First, Defendant fails entirely to address this point or otherwise to raise a nonfrivolous dispute as to the proper measure of damages. Second, Plaintiff's statement that it has sold its shares was filed with the Court on October 29, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supp. Malin Decl.; taking judicial notice of publicly available stock-price data, the Court notes that the price of Defendant's shares declined considerably between September 1 and October 29, 2017, making it questionable whether Plaintiff was able to sell the shares at a premium.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ganino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11227214\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/154/\">\n    228 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   167 n.8.

Plaintiff seeks attorneys' fees for approximately 15.4 hours of work, at a rate of $375 per hour, plus expenses, for a total of $5,837.12.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law at 9; Fleischmann Decl. Ex 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Prior Order found that Plaintiff's counsel's billing rate of $375 per hour was reasonable, given his seniority and experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 13-14. Defendant now argues that Plaintiff's counsel billed a different client at a rate of $350 per hour, purportedly raising a dispute of fact as to whether his $375-per-hour rate is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Mem. of Law at 10. Plaintiff's counsel, however, offers undisputed evidence that his relationship with that other client began a year earlier than his relationship with Plaintiff, and that his fees increased by $25 per hour during the intervening period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply Mem. of Law at 16; Supp. Fleischmann Decl. \u00b6 3. The Court believes that this increase is reasonable and, in any event, adheres to its prior ruling that $375 per hour is a reasonable rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   As for the number of hours expended in connection with this motion, Plaintiff has offered an invoice showing his contemporaneous time records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fleischmann Decl. Ex. 1. The Court has reviewed these records and finds that the number of hours expended is within the range of what would be expected for a motion of this sort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court awards Plaintiff $5,837.12 in attorneys' fees and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III. All of Plaintiff's Other Claims Are Dismissed\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Prior Order directed Plaintiff to move for summary judgment on any claims that it wished to pursue and stated that if Plaintiff failed to do so, the Court would dismiss the remaining claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prior Order at 14. In the motion currently before the Court, Plaintiff moves for summary judgment only as to its breach of contract claim and its claim for attorneys' fees (that is, the Second and Fifth Causes of Action in the Complaint, respectively).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. of Law at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff has not moved for summary judgment on its claims for conversion, for a permanent injunction, or for breach of the Settlement Agreement (that is, the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Causes of Action in the Complaint, respectively). Accordingly, those claims are dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 55) is GRANTED. The Court awards Plaintiff $180,204.36 in damages, $116,950.00 in prejudgment interest, and $5,837.12 in attorneys' fees. Defendant's cross-motions to vacate and for judgment on the pleadings (Dkt. 68) are DENIED. All claims on which Plaintiff did not move for summary judgment (specifically, Plaintiff's claims for conversion, for a permanent injunction, and for breach of the settlement agreement) are DISMISSED. The Clerk is respectfully directed to terminate all open motions and to CLOSE the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The Court will refer to the parties' filings as follows: the Declaration of Robert Malin, Dkt. 56, submitted in support of Plaintiff's motion, as \"Malin Decl.\"; the Declaration of Jeffrey Fleischmann, Dkt. 57, submitted in support of Plaintiff's motion, as \"Fleischmann Decl.\"; Plaintiff's Rule 56.1 Statement, Dkt. 58, as \"Pl.'s 56.1 Stmt.\"; Plaintiff's memorandum of law, Dkt. 59, submitted in support of its motion for summary judgment, as \"Pl.'s Mem. of Law\"; Defendant's memorandum of law, Dkt. 65, submitted in opposition to Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, as \"Def.'s Resp.

Nevertheless, Defendant does not dispute the underlying facts that it received the Notice of Conversion and that it failed to timely deliver the shares requested.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Defendant argues that the price of the common stock on the date of the Notice of Conversion was $0.0751 per share, not $0.142 per share as Plaintiff alleges.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Resp. Mem. of Law at 4; Def.'s 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11. Defendant cites no part of the record for this assertion, but the argument appears to be based on the following notation in the Notice of Conversion: \"Applicable Conversion Price: .045 (.0751 on Dec. 4).\" Malin Decl. Ex. C. From this notation, Defendant leaps to the conclusion that the price of common stock on the date of the Notice of Conversion (\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , December 30, 2015) must have been $0.0751. This argument is frivolous. The Notice of Conversion clearly indicates that $0.0751 was the price of the stock on December 4, 2015, that is, during the historical \"look back\" period from which the conversion price was calculated-not on the date that the Notice of Conversion was issued, December 30, 2015.\n    <em>\n     See id.\n    </em>\n    And in case there were any doubt, Plaintiff has submitted a website printout confirming these prices,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Supp. Malin Decl.
