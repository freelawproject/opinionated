Agent Lozoya testified extensively about his communications with the CS, much of which he was able to corroborate through his own surveillance of Cruz. First, Agent Lozoya noticed that the white pickup truck had an Arizona license plate which matched the CS's report that the methamphetamine would be coming from Arizona. Second, Agent Lozoya witnessed Cruz near El Paseo and Boutz Rds. around the time the CS informed him that Cruz would be at that intersection. Third, Agent Lozoya saw Cruz with a female and a young child, corroborating the CS's report of a family. Fourth, after Agent Lozoya had surveilled Cruz for some time, the CS called him to tell him that Cruz would be at an O'Reilly's near El Paseo and Boutz Rds., which Agent Lozoya confirmed in real time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Fifth, Agent Lozoya noticed that the black Ford pickup truck had a Kansas license plate which corroborated the CS's statement that his source was traveling to Kansas to pick up a vehicle. In addition to these corroborations, Agent Lozoya worked with the CS since 2016 resulting in several successful orders of methamphetamine, thus proving the CS's reliability. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that Agent Lozoya had reasonable suspicion to believe that Cruz was trafficking methamphetamine through Las Cruces.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, under the collective knowledge doctrine, Agent Lozoya's reasonable suspicion is \"vertically\" imputed to Officer Palomares. In other words, Officer Palomares' stop of Cruz was justified under the Fourth Amendment because Agent Lozoya had reasonable suspicion to believe Cruz was engaged in illegal activity when he called Officer Palomares and instructed Officer Palomares to stop Cruz for any traffic violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Officer Palomares witnessed Cruz straddle the dotted line for a few seconds, with about a quarter of the width of the trucks over the dotted line. Cruz has failed to point to any weather conditions, road features, or other circumstances that would have affected or interfered with his ability to keep his vehicle in a single lane. Moreover, the video evidence does not show any weather conditions or road obstructions that would have required Cruz to straddle the dotted line between the Do\u00f1a Ana exit and the right lane of the Interstate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nevertheless, Cruz argues that he did not violate Section 66-7-317(A) because he was driving a pickup truck that was towing a second pickup truck at night. While this description is supported by the record, it fails to show why Cruz could not have maintained his lane, especially since he was driving ten to fifteen miles per hour under the speed limit. Both before the Do\u00f1a Ana exit and after, Cruz maintained his lane, and so, evidently, it was not impossible for him to maintain his lane. In\n   his briefing, Cruz asserts he was unfamiliar with I-25 and that he confused the exit lane with a third lane, and upon realizing his mistake he \"safely and feasibly executed\" a maneuver into the right lane of the Interstate. The United States does not contend that Cruz created any dangerous condition by straddling the dotted line, instead it argues that if he thought the exit lane was a new lane he would have moved entirely into the exit lane or he would have used his signal showing his intention to move right. The Court finds Cruz's unfamiliarity argument unpersuasive, primarily because he straddled the line rather than moving entirely into the exit lane believing it to be a new lane. Thus, under the totality of the circumstances, Officer Palomares had reasonable suspicion to believe Cruz violated Section 66-7-317(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    3.
