Compl. (\"SAC\"), ECF No. 76, \u00b6\u00b6 6-26.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated and conspired to violate RICO by engaging in numerous predicate acts of racketeering activity, including mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, and violations of the Travel Act, with the purpose and intent of misappropriating millions of dollars Plaintiff inherited from his late parents in the late 1990s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 185-234, 236-39.) Plaintiff also asserts several state law causes of action for unjust enrichment, constructive trust, and accounting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 186-234, 236-39, 241-45, 247-50, 252-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants previously moved to dismiss this action for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim under RICO, among other grounds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 35; Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 36,) After this Court heard oral argument on the motion, but before a decision was rendered, the Supreme Court issued an opinion in\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   , the Court held, among other things, that RICO does not apply extraterritorially and a private party suing under RICO must therefore \"allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    at 2111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Applying a residence-based test for determining whether Plaintiff suffered a domestic injury, this Court found that Plaintiff had failed to allege an economic injury in the United States, as opposed to in Chile or the British Virgin Islands (\"BVI\"), where he and the Bascu\u00f1an Entities \"reside.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bascu\u00f1an v.

In doing so, the Second Circuit held as a matter of first impression that \"when a foreign plaintiff maintains tangible property in the United States, the misappropriation of that property constitutes a domestic injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265932\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/806/#p824\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265932\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/806/#p824\">\n    at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 84.) Defendants argue dismissal is warranted\n   because, among other things, the SAC fails to allege a domestic injury with respect to much of Defendants' alleged conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Mem.\"), ECF No, 85, at 19-21.) Defendants also contend that to the extent the SAC does allege a domestic injury under RICO, it impermissibly relies on an extraterritorial application of the RICO predicate statutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-24.) Finally, Defendants argue that the SAC fails to adequately allege a continuous pattern of racketeering activity, as required to state a claim under RICO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because the SAC fails to allege a domestic injury, impermissibly relies on an extraterritorial application of RICO, and fails to adequately allege a continuous pattern of racketeering activity, Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Bascu\u00f1an Estate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff, a citizen and resident of Chile, inherited a substantial family fortune (the \"Bascu\u00f1an Estate\") following the death of his parents in the 1990s. (SAC \u00b6\u00b6 7, 35.) The Bascu\u00f1an Estate consists largely of companies and assets owned by Plaintiff, including a substantial stake in Banco de Cr\u00e9dito e Inversiones (\"BCI\"), a Chilean bank formerly headed by Plaintiff's father and in which he held a controlling interest prior to his death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Unable to manage his own finances due to various physical and emotional ailments, Plaintiff relied on a financial manager initially hired by his parents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-37.) In 1999, however, Plaintiff engaged his cousin, Defendant Elsaca, to manage the Bascu\u00f1an Estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39.) Elsaca, also a citizen and resident of Chile, is an economist and licensed accountant by trade, and the former head of the Superintendencia de Valores y Seguros (de Chile), which the SAC describes as the Chilean equivalent of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 37.) Plaintiff agreed to pay Elsaca an annual salary for managing the Bascu\u00f1an Estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Soon thereafter, Elsaca convinced Plaintiff to grant him a power of attorney (\"POA\") that conferred broad authority on Elsaca to manage the Bascu\u00f1an Estate and enter into transactions on its behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) The POA did not provide Elsaca with any additional compensation for his services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Instead, Elsaca paid himself a monthly salary for managing the Bascu\u00f1an Estate, as he and Bascu\u00f1an had agreed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that for the ten years Elsaca was charged with managing the Bascu\u00f1an Estate, he and his co-conspirators engaged in a multifaceted fraudulent scheme to misappropriate money, securities, and other assets from the Bascu\u00f1an Estate to the tune of approximately $70 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Afghan Trust Misappropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One aspect of Defendants' alleged scheme involved the misappropriation of assets from one of Plaintiff's trusts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.) The Afghan Trust, as the trust was known, was established in 1998 and administered by J.P. Morgan in New York, and used to finance Plaintiff's charitable endeavors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2001, after Elsaca took over the management of the Bascu\u00f1an Estate, he established the Capri Star Trust on Plaintiff's behalf using funds from the Afghan Trust. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) The Capri Star Trust was created and administered by UBS AG in New York and its stated purpose was also to finance Plaintiff's charitable undertakings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiff, however, the Capri Star Trust's true purpose was to enable Elsaca and his associates to divert money from the Afghan Trust to their own personal accounts in the United States and elsewhere in the form of sham fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Capri Star Trust designated Elsaca as its investment advisor, entitling him to a fee set by the Trust Committee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) The Trust Committee, whose sole members were Elsaca and his lawyer, non-party Jos\u00e9 Pedro Silva Prado (\"Silva\"), set the investment advisor's fee at 1% per annum of assets under management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that Elsaca periodically authorized fund transfers from the Afghan Trust to the Capri Star Trust in order to generate higher investment management fees for himself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.) More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that although Elsaca did not actually provide any such investment advice, he and/or Silva transferred more than $2.7 million from the Capri Star Trust to accounts under Elsaca's control in New York and Switzerland in the form of sham investment management fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-56;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A.) Elsaca and his agents allegedly authorized these fraudulent transfers by wires or mail to UBS employees in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff alleges that Elsaca and Silva conspired to extract money from the Capri Star Trust in the form of sham legal fees paid to Silva's law firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.) Between 2001 and 2009, for example, Elsaca authorized approximately $390,000 to be paid from the Capri Star Trust's account to Silva for legal services that were never actually rendered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-64.) Elsaca and his agents also allegedly authorized these transfers by wire or mail to UBS employees in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fintair Misappropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that Defendants secretly misappropriated at least $60 million from the Bascu\u00f1an Estate using a web of investment funds and off-shore shell companies, including the Anacapri Private Investment Fund (\"Anacapri\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-70.) According to the SAC, Elsaca created Anacapri for Plaintiff's benefit in 2003, using funds from three separate Bascu\u00f1an Entities Elsaca controlled pursuant to the POA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.) The SAC, however, does not indicate where the funds belonging to these entities were held before they were transferred to fund Anacapri. Plaintiff alleges that Elsaca thereafter caused Anacapri to acquire Fintair, a BVI company Elsaca created for himself in 2000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although Fintair became part of the Bascu\u00f1an Estate as a result of the Anacapri acquisition, Elsaca opened a bank account in New York in Fintair's name (the \"Fintair Account\"), representing to the bank that he remained its sole owner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.) Plaintiff alleges that between September 2003 and July 2009, Elsaca, as well as Defendants Jara and Bret\u00f3n,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   made over a dozen wire and security transfers from the Bascu\u00f1an Estate into the Fintair Account, after which Elsaca transferred the funds to himself, entities he owned, and associates of his, including Jara and Bret\u00f3n. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-86;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B.) Again, however, the SAC does not indicate where the funds were held before they were transferred from the Bascu\u00f1an Estate to the Fintair Account. Plaintiff claims\n   that the Fintair Account fund transfers were not disclosed to him, and that the transferred funds were never returned to the Bascu\u00f1an Estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 88-89.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that between 2000 and 2009, Elsaca, Jara, and Bret\u00f3n caused approximately $16 million to be transferred from Anacapri to bank accounts in New York maintained by GM &amp; E (the \"GM&amp;E Accounts\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123-25.) According to the SAC, Plaintiff has been unable to ascertain the location from which the funds used to pay the sham investment management fees were transferred. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126.) Plaintiff claims that these transfers, accounting for approximately 30% of the total funds contributed by the Bascu\u00f1an Entities to Anacapri, were sham investment management fees, which were never authorized by, nor disclosed to, Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120-21, 125.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Tarascona Bearer Share Theft and Misappropriation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At the time he signed the POA in 1999, Plaintiff held 1.47% of his stake in BCI through Tarascona Corp. (\"Tarascona\"), a BVI entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 91.) Tarascona was in turn wholly owned by Hofstra Corp. (\"Hofstra\"), another BVI entity that was part of the Bascu\u00f1an Estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 91.) Hofstra's interest in Tarascona was represented by bearer shares stored in a J.P. Morgan safety deposit box in New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that between 1999 and 2004, Elsaca opened almost a dozen accounts at Morgan Stanley in Tarascona's name \"for the purpose of misappropriating [the Bascu\u00f1an Estate's funds] and laundering them through the global banking system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129.) As with other aspects of the alleged scheme, the SAC does not identify the location from which the assets used to fund the Tarascona accounts were taken. Plaintiff alleges that Elsaca misrepresented to Morgan Stanley in New York that\n   <em>\n    he\n   </em>\n   -not Plaintiff, nor Hofstra-owned Tarascona, so that he could freely transfer money from Tarascona to his own personal accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 130-32.) According to the SAC, between 2000 and 2003, Elsaca transferred more than $2.7 million from the Tarascona accounts in New York to bank accounts he opened in the name of Hay's Finance Corp, one of Elsaca's BVI shell companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 132, 135;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff also alleges that on or about December 11, 2007, Elsaca or one of his agents traveled to New York and removed the Tarascona bearer shares from Hofstra's safety deposit box. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92,) Plaintiff further alleges that, three days later, Elsaca directed a Panamanian law firm to register the stolen Tarascona bearer shares in the name of Nueva T Corp. (\"Nueva T\"), a BVI entity Elsaca incorporated for himself on or about November 30, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-98.) (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.) Plaintiff claims that approximately two weeks later, Elsaca sold Nueva T to Anacapri-and by extension, the Bascu\u00f1an Estate-for $43 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition, Plaintiff claims that between 2007 and 2010, Elsaca misappropriated proceeds of BCI stock dividends held in a Tarascona account in Chile and diverted them to bank accounts in New York, including the Fintair Account, before transferring them to himself and his associates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Sham Anacapri Sale\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff claims that after misappropriating millions of dollars from Anacapri\n   through the Fintair Account, Elsaca and his associates ultimately misappropriated Anacapri itself through a sham sale to one of Elsaca's shell companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) More specifically, Plaintiff alleges that in July 2009, Elsaca and Jara authorized a capital reduction plan for Anacapri, which resulted in the Nueva T shares being reregistered in the names of the Bascu\u00f1an Entities that owned Anacapri. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 110-11.) Without the Nueva T shares, Anacapri's book value decreased to approximately $21.5 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.) Nevertheless, Elsaca caused the Bascu\u00f1an Entities to sell Anacapri at a steeply discounted price of about $7.5 million to Defendant Agr\u00edcola E Inmobiliaria Chauqu\u00e9n Limitada, a Chilean company owned by Elsaca. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22, 113.) Plaintiff alleges that the capital reduction plan and subsequent sham transaction were never disclosed to him.
