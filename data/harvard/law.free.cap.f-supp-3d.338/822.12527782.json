The White Sox contend that Fowler's claim is preempted by \u00a7 301 because resolving the claim requires interpretation of Article XIII of the Basic Agreement. Doc. 35 at 6-7. Article XIII establishes a joint Safety and Health Advisory Committee, \"comprised of an equal number of members representing the Association and representing the Clubs,\" \"to deal with emergency safety and health problems as they arise\" and \"to engage in review of, planning for and maintenance of safe and healthful working conditions for Players.\" Doc. 1-2 at p. 70, Art. XIII(A)(1). Committee meetings can be called by any member who believes an emergency safety problem requires attention, and otherwise occur at least once a year \"for purposes of review and planning.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 70, Art. XIII(A)(2). The Committee can make non-binding recommendations to the clubs and players.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 71, Art. XIII(A)(3). The Players Association is not required to raise a safety issue with the Committee before filing a formal grievance in arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 71, Art. XIII(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The White Sox argue that, by establishing the Committee and empowering it to plan for and maintain safe working conditions for the players, Article XIII \"lessens the scope of the White Sox's duty\" to independently ensure the safety of the facilities, as \"they c[an] reasonably rely on the Joint Committee's guidance in that regard.\" Doc. 35 at 17. Put another way, the White Sox conclude from Article XIII that, absent any objection from the Committee, the injury that Fowler suffered when he ran into the box was not reasonably foreseeable-and therefore that his negligence claim fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clifford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=288%20Ill.%20Dec.%20557\">\n    288 Ill.Dec. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=817%20N.E.2d%201207\">\n    817 N.E.2d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   If the White Sox's argument were plausible, then a court would need to interpret Article XIII to determine whether (or to what extent) the White Sox owed Fowler a duty of care, and Fowler's negligence claim would be completely preempted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boogaard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6825090\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/126/1010/#p1017\">\n    126 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1016-25 ;\n   <em>\n    Nelson v.

Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5403562\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/56/372/\">\n    56 Ill.2d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20N.E.2d%20617\">\n    308 N.E.2d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 619 (1974), the storeowner could not have foreseen that the doors would cause injury because a non-party who was better qualified to evaluate them had concluded that they were safe.\n   <em>\n    Catalano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202720432\">\n    2017 WL 2720432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   That principle explains the results in\n   <em>\n    Duerson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Duerson\n   </em>\n   , the estate of a former Chicago Bears player alleged that the National Football League (\"NFL\") negligently failed to inform him of the risks of brain injury after repeated concussions,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201658353\">\n    2012 WL 1658353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, and in\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   , a group of former players alleged that the league negligently failed to curb excessive prescription of pain medication by the clubs,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207205048\">\n    2014 WL 7205048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. In both cases, the courts found that the players' state law claims were completely preempted by \u00a7 301 because certain provisions in the NFL's collective bargaining agreement could \"be interpreted to impose a general duty on the NFL clubs to diagnose and treat\" players' medical conditions, which would allow the league to \"reasonably rely on the clubs\" to appropriately handle the players' medical issues.\n   <em>\n    Duerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201658353\">\n    2012 WL 1658353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207205048\">\n    2014 WL 7205048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (\"[B]ecause the CBAs expressly and repeatedly allocate so many health-and-safety duties to the clubs, the CBAs can fairly be interpreted, by implication, to negate any such duty at the league level.\"). Those CBA provisions required each club to employ an orthopedic surgeon as a club physician, to pay the cost of all medical care provided to players by club staff, and to have a club physician conduct a pre-season examination of each player.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duerson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201658353\">\n    2012 WL 1658353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ;\n   <em>\n    Dent\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207205048\">\n    2014 WL 7205048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5. From those provisions, the courts explained, one could reasonably conclude that the clubs-who directly employed medical staff to serve the players-bore the primary responsibility for the players' medical care. And as in\n   <em>\n    Catalano\n   </em>\n   , the NFL could reasonably rely on the clubs and their expert employees, who were much better positioned to monitor the players' health than the league.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That principle is inapposite here. Article XIII leaves no doubt that the clubs were in a vastly better position than the Committee to assess the safety of their own premises. The clubs did not give up any control over their premises to the Committee, nor did they even grant it any consistent supervisory role. The Committee may act only if called to session by one of its members, or in one of its annual meetings \"for purposes of review and planning.\" Doc. 1-2 at p. 70, Art. XIII(A)(2). And Article XIII acknowledges that players can take their safety concerns straight to arbitration, without attempting to convene the Committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 71, Art. XIII(A)(4). When the Committee does address\n   a safety concern, its recommendations are only advisory, leaving final authority over the premises with the clubs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 71, Art. XIII(A)(3). It would have been wholly unreasonable for any club to delegate its responsibility to ensure the safety of its playing field to the intermittent and weak Committee described in Article XIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That conclusion applies with particular force to a small, hidden hazard like the metal box that injured Fowler. Because the box was hidden from players' view (as Fowler alleges, Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 17, and the White Sox do not dispute), no player could have realized the risk it posed and attempted to convene the Committee to address the problem. And it strains credulity to suppose (and the White Sox do not assert) that the Committee would examine such granular details of individual ballparks in its occasional meetings \"for purposes of review and planning.\" It follows that the White Sox's interpretation of Article XIII is not plausible, that the Basic Agreement therefore will not affect the White Sox's duty of care to Fowler, and therefore that Fowler's claims are not completely preempted under Section 301.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9154205,9156711\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/387/649/\">\n    387 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   659 ;\n   <em>\n    Cramer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11088629\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/255/683/#p692\">\n    255 F.3d at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The White Sox also argue, briefly, that determining Fowler's damages will require interpretation of the CBA provisions stating that players shall receive their full salary and \"reasonable medical and hospital expenses\" while injured. Doc. 35 at 26. But those provisions determine the clubs' obligations to\n   <em>\n    their own\n   </em>\n   injured players, not the obligations of clubs that allegedly injure another teams' player, which is the situation presented here. Doc. 1-2 at 349 (providing, in the Uniform Player's Contract that players enter into with the individual clubs for which they play, that a player is entitled to \"reasonable medical and hospital expenses incurred by reason of the injury\" on the conditions that written notice of the injury is \"served upon and received by the Club\" and that the club may designate the player's health care providers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because Fowler's claims are not completely preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA, they are true state law claims. And because complete preemption is the sole ground on which the White Sox premise removal, Doc. 1, any other grounds for removal have been forfeited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    W.C. Motor Co. v. Talley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4170457\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/63/843/#p852\">\n    63 F.Supp.3d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 852 (N.D. Ill. 2014) (holding that \"the\n   <em>\n    proponent\n   </em>\n   of subject matter jurisdiction, as with any party that bears the burden on a particular point, may forfeit an argument that could have been made to\n   <em>\n    support\n   </em>\n   jurisdiction\") (citing cases). Fowler's motion to remand accordingly is granted. The case is remanded to the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
