Plaintiff responded in opposition [Doc. 48], defendants replied [Doc. 50], and plaintiff filed a surreply [Doc. 51], to which defendants have not responded nor moved to strike. Plaintiff asserts that the defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they searched the curtilage of his residence. Contrary to defendants' argument, there is a genuine factual dispute about whether plaintiff has waived this claim. But because a reasonable officer could have believed that defendant disclaimed his privacy interest in the residence, qualified immunity is warranted. For this and the other reasons explained below, defendants' motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff James D. Watson filed this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that defendants violated the Fourth Amendment by unconstitutionally searching his home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants include the 5th Judicial Task Force, officers David Mendez\n   and Ron Talbott in their official capacities, and officers David Mendez and Ron Talbott in their individual capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants Mendez and Talbott (\"defendants\" or \"officers\") are members of the 5th Judicial Task Force (the \"task force\") and are employed by the Blount County, Tennessee Sherriff's Office. The task force is a law-enforcement entity created by statute, whose primary function is to coordinate law-enforcement efforts to investigate and prevent drug trafficking. Task-force officers have normal police powers and enjoy statewide jurisdiction. In light of this, their duties are not limited only to drug-enforcement activities. For example, task-force officers regularly serve civil levies stemming from outstanding costs or fines related to drug crimes, and these payments provide funding for the task force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 20, 2013, defendant Mendez and Deputy Patrick Pearson of the Blount County Sherriff's Office attempted to serve a civil levy, issued by the Blount County Circuit Court Clerk, on plaintiff at his presumed residence: 815 Old Reservoir Road in Maryville, Tennessee (the \"residence\"). The officers knocked on the front door intermittently for approximately twenty minutes with no response. Around this time, defendant Talbott arrived at the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly after Talbott's arrival, plaintiff exited the residence. The officers explained that they were there to serve a civil levy on plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response to the officers' questioning, plaintiff made several statements regarding his interest in the residence. Plaintiff's response to defendants' statement of material facts states that it is \"undisputed\" that plaintiff stated he did not live at the house, the house belonged to his girlfriend who was inside at the time, and that he could not get back into the house because he left his keys inside [Doc. 49 p. 4]. Plaintiff's affidavit, however, states that he told the officers \"[he] did not own the house but [he] had left [his] keys inside the house.\" Plaintiff's affidavit clarifies that he and his fianc\u00e9e were leasing the house at the time but does not state that he told this information to defendants [Doc. 48-1 p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The officers proceeded to ask plaintiff whether he had anything of value on his person, and plaintiff produced change from his pocket. The officers declined to execute the levy at that time and told plaintiff that he was free to go. Plaintiff walked away from the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After plaintiff left, defendants continued to knock on the front door and tried the knob to confirm that it was locked. They then walked around the exterior of the house \"to look for items that could possibly be levied\" [Docs. 42-1; 42-5]. \"At the edge of the house,\" defendants state that they noticed the smell of marijuana coming from a crawl space vent [Doc. 44 p. 4]. Defendants continued walking around the house and noticed the same smell coming from a vent at the back of the house. During their walk around the edge of the house, defendants were three to five feet away from the crawl space vents [Docs. 42-1; 42-5]. Defendants also noticed what appeared to be partially smoked marijuana joints in a bucket on the front porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That same day, defendants obtained a search warrant for the residence based on the smell of marijuana, the apparent presence of partially smoked marijuana joints,\n   previous complaints about suspicious activity at the residence, plaintiff's criminal record, and a tip from a confidential informant. Upon executing the warrant, defendants located a large amount of marijuana inside the residence, along with other evidence indicative of the sale and use of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At some point, a forfeiture proceeding concerning plaintiff took place [Doc. 44 p. 6; Doc. 44-6]. The circumstances surrounding the forfeiture proceeding are unclear, but in relation to the forfeiture proceeding, plaintiff's attorney signed a release of liability, which stated in relevant part, \"Claimant, by his or her signature below does waive any legal claim or cause of action which he/she might otherwise have as a result of any acts underlying this forfeiture proceeding\" [Doc. 42-6]. Plaintiff does not dispute that his attorney signed this release, but plaintiff argues that he did not see the release before it was signed, that he was not aware that his attorney was signing away his right to bring the instant claim, and that his attorney had no authority to waive his right to file the instant claim [Doc. 48-1 p. 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff brings this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging that defendants violated his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches [Doc. 1]. The Court stayed the case pending resolution of the underlying criminal proceedings, in which plaintiff had moved to suppress evidence derived from the officers' search of the residence [Doc. 11]. The trial court granted that motion, and the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed two to one, finding that plaintiff had not disclaimed his expectation of privacy in the residence [Doc. 27].\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendants present four arguments in their motion for summary judgment: (1) under the release agreement, plaintiff has waived his right to bring a \u00a7 1983 claim stemming from the December 20, 2013, search of the residence; (2) the task force is immune from suit; (3) the officers are immune from suit in their official capacities; and (4) the officers are entitled to qualified immunity and are thus not liable in their individual capacities. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Release of Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiff's attorney signed a release of liability, which assertedly waived the instant claim as part of an agreed resolution of a related forfeiture proceeding. The language in question states, \"Claimant, by his or her signature below does waive any legal claim or cause of action which he/she might otherwise have as a result of any acts underlying this forfeiture proceeding\" [Doc. 42-6]. Plaintiff does not dispute that his attorney signed this waiver, but instead argues that he did not knowingly give his attorney authority to waive the instant claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Mason v. City of Warren Police Dept.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-14182,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%205025841\">\n    2011 WL 5025841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Oct. 21, 2011), to argue that a release of liability in a forfeiture settlement may preclude a party from bringing subsequent claims under \u00a7 1983. Defendants characterize\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The [\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   ] court explained that contracts are interpreted according to their plain and ordinary meaning, and a release of liability is valid if it was fairly and knowingly made. The plaintiff did not contest the release of liability as involuntary or unknowingly made, and the court determined, as a matter of law, that the settlement agreement was unambiguous on its face. The court held that the settlement agreement clearly stated the plaintiff's intent to release any and all claims arising from the property seizure in consideration for the release of her car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [Doc. 43 p. 6 (internal citations omitted) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Mason\n   </em>\n   on two grounds. First, defendants provided a single sentence of context related to the forfeiture proceedings in question-\"During the forfeiture proceedings, a Proposed Civil Settlement Agreement and Release of Liability was executed and signed by Joe Costner, the attorney for plaintiff\" [Doc. 44 p. 6]. Based on the provided information, it is not \"clear\" or \"unambiguous\" that the language in question actually constitutes a waiver of a \u00a7 1983 claim stemming from defendants' venture into the curtilage of plaintiff's home after declining to serve the civil levy. It does not appear that any property was\n   seized or forfeited until the subsequent execution of the search warrant. Thus, whether the initial attempted service of the civil levy and associated search of the curtilage constitute \"acts underlying\" the forfeiture proceeding in question is not clear or unambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, plaintiff has contested the validity of the waiver, and specifically argues it was \"involuntary and unknowingly made.\" Plaintiff states that he had no opportunity to review the waiver before it was signed by his attorney, and that based on his conversations with his attorney he did not knowingly or voluntarily waive his right to pursue the instant claim in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For these reasons, on the current record, there are disputed issues of material fact about the scope of the contractual language and the validity of the contract. It is telling that defendant declined to address this issue in detail or cite to any case law supporting its position in its reply brief [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 50 p. 1]. Summary judgment on this basis is therefore not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Task Force Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendants next argue that the task force is a state agency immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment and is not a \"person\" subject to suit under \u00a7 1983. Plaintiff did not respond to this argument in its response brief or surreply [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 48, 51]. As defendants have presented a reasonable argument that the task force is immune from suit, and plaintiff has not responded to this argument, the Court will grant summary judgment in defendants' favor on this issue.

Official Capacity Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As was the case with task force immunity, plaintiff did not respond to defendants' argument that officers Mendez and Talbott are immune from suit in their official capacities [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 48, 51].

In plaintiff's affidavit, he states that he told the officers \"[he] did not own the house but [he] had left [his] keys inside the house\" [Doc. 48-1]. And even in the officers' version of events, which plaintiff does not dispute, plaintiff stated that he did not live at the house, that the house belonged to his girlfriend who was inside at the time, and that he could not get back into the house because he left his keys inside [Doc. 44].\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In both scenarios, plaintiff tells the officers that he had keys to the house, which suggests that he maintained a privacy interest in the residence. Furthermore, plaintiff had just walked out of the home at the time of his conversation with the officers, which undermines any argument that the officers thought he had abandoned the residence. Finally, the fact that plaintiff and his fianc\u00e9e leased, rather than owned, the home at issue is immaterial because maintaining a privacy interest does not require ownership.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v.

Although the instant case involved a civil levy and the curtilage of a home rather than a tax levy and an office, the Court finds that the Supreme Court's reasoning is equally persuasive when applied to the facts at issue here. So, while the officers claim they entered the curtilage \"to look for items that could possibly be levied\" [Docs. 42-1; 42-5], this justification for their search is inadequate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Although the Court is to view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, for present purposes the choice between these two accounts is immaterial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Court does not rely on the findings of the state courts in its analysis, but does note that the disclaimer issue was resolved in favor of plaintiff both at the trial and appellate level under a less deferential standard, seeing as those courts did not view the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff in their analysis.\n    <em>\n     E.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     State v.
