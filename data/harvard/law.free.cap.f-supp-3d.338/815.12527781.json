To understand why, it is useful to start with some history. Pfizer does not cite, and the court has no knowledge of, any pre-\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   decision holding that, in a class action where the defendant is not subject to general jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction must be established not only as to the named plaintiff(s), but also as to the absent class members. The pre-\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   consensus, rather, was that due process neither precluded nationwide or multistate class actions nor required the absent-class-member-by-absent-class-member\n   jurisdictional inquiry urged by Pfizer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   does not alter that landscape. The case was a mass action, not a class action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That distinction is critical because there are no absent class members in a mass action; rather, \"each plaintiff [in a mass action] is a real party in interest to the complaints.\"\n   <em>\n    Molock\n   </em>\n   , 297 F.Supp.3d at 126.\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   thus does not address, let alone resolve, whether due process requires that the defendant be subject to specific jurisdiction not only as to the named plaintiff's claims, but also as to the absent class members' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Casso's Wellness Store &amp; Gym, L.L.C. v.

Mar. 19, 2018) (\"Unlike\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , which involved a mass tort action where each plaintiff was a named plaintiff, in a putative class action, the plaintiff seeking to represent the class is the only plaintiff named in the complaint, and his claims-not the unnamed non-resident members[']-are relevant to the personal jurisdiction inquiry.\");\n   <em>\n    Fitzhenry-Russell v.

That characterization is hard to square with the extraordinary sea change in class action practice that Pfizer's reading of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   would prompt. Had the Supreme Court truly sought to bar certification of nationwide or multistate\n   <em>\n    class\n   </em>\n   actions on due process grounds in all but the one or two States where the defendant is subject to general jurisdiction, it implausible that it would have done so obliquely, in a\n   <em>\n    mass\n   </em>\n   action, and with the caveat that it was \"leav[ing] open the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court\" as the Fourteenth Amendment does \"on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1783-84 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broomfield v.

The key question here is whether absent class members are parties for purposes of assessing personal jurisdiction over the defendant-if so, then specific jurisdiction must be assessed as to each absent class member's claim, and if not, then not. The question is more complicated than it appears at first glance. As the Supreme Court explained: \"Nonnamed class members ... may be parties for some purposes and not for others.

Precisely because absent class members are along for the ride, it makes sense that they are not parties for the purpose of constitutional and statutory doctrines governing whether a court has the power to adjudicate their claims.

It follows that there is no good reason why absent class members should be treated as non-parties for purposes of establishing subject matter jurisdiction, but as parties for purposes of establishing personal jurisdiction over the defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Diane P.

True, the REA instructs that the federal rules of procedure, including Civil Rule 23, \"shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). But this court's holding deprives defendants of no substantive right because, as shown above, a defendant has no right to exclude an absent class member from the class on the ground that the defendant is not subject to personal jurisdiction as to that class member's claim. It is for the same reason that the cases holding that absent class members need not establish their own standing, and are not considered for venue, diversity of citizenship, or amount-in-controversy purposes, do not violate the REA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although the analysis could stop here, one more point is in order. In\n   <em>\n    Devlin\n   </em>\n   , the Court explained that \"[t]he rule that nonnamed class members cannot defeat complete diversity is ... justified by the goals of class action litigation,\" in that \"[e]ase of administration of class actions would be compromised by having to consider the citizenship of all class members, many of whom may even be unknown, in determining jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254780\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/1/#p9\">\n    536 U.S. at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254780\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/1/#p9\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That consideration applies as well to personal jurisdiction. The economies achieved by aggregating claims under Rule 23 would be similarly compromised if courts in class actions where the defendant was not subject to general jurisdiction had to ascertain whether specific jurisdiction could be asserted over each absent class member's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To illustrate the point, consider a hypothetical class action where: (1) the named plaintiff alleges product defects arising at several of the defendant's manufacturing plants, only one of which is in the forum State; and (2) the defendant is not incorporated and does not maintain its principal place of business in that State. It is virtually certain that the defendant would not be subject to general jurisdiction in that State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BNSF Ry. Co. v.

So, if Pfizer were right that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   applied to absent class members, the hypothetical court would bear the onerous task of determining, as to each absent class member not injured by the product in the forum State, whether the product was manufactured at the plant in the State, and thus whether a sufficient alternative nexus existed between that class member's injury and the forum to permit the exercise of specific jurisdiction over the defendant as to that class member's claim.\n   <em>\n    Devlin\n   </em>\n   counsels strongly against such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Pfizer's renewed motion to strike the complaint's nationwide class claims is denied.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
