Mueller, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs in the above, related cases are insurance companies. Defendants include a commercial farming company, George Perry &amp; Sons, Inc. (Perry); Perry's Vice President of Operations and farm manager, Paul Gomes; and Gary Mattes both individually and doing business as Gary's Apiaries (collectively, Mattes), a beekeeping business. Plaintiffs sue for a judicial determination that they owe no duty to defend or indemnify Perry and Gomes under the insurance policies issued to Perry with respect to Mattes's state court lawsuit against Perry and Gomes for alleged destruction of Mattes's beehives while the beehives were on Perry's property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nationwide\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Compl. at 1-2, ECF No. 1; Unigard Compl. \u00b6 1, ECF No. 1. Unigard plaintiffs also seek reimbursement from Perry of all attorney's fees and costs the Unigard plaintiffs have advanced to defend the lawsuit. Unigard Compl. \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for summary judgment. Nationwide Mot., ECF No. 11; Unigard Mot., ECF No. 20. Defendants have opposed. Nationwide Opp'n, ECF No. 36; Unigard Opp'n, ECF No. 27. Plaintiffs have replied. Nationwide Reply, ECF No. 42; Unigard Reply, ECF No. 36. Plaintiffs contend both a rented (or loaned) property exclusion and a care, custody or control exclusion in their insurance policies with Perry apply as a matter of law, meaning plaintiffs have no duty to indemnify Perry or Gomes with respect to the Mattes lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nationwide Mot. at 4-9; Unigard Mot. at 6-11. Defendants contend genuine disputes of material fact exist that preclude determining the agreement between Mattes and Perry was a contract to rent property, not a services contract. Nationwide Opp'n at 7-10; Unigard Opp'n at 7-12. Defendants also dispute plaintiffs' contention that Perry had exclusive care, custody or control of the beehives. Nationwide Opp'n at 10-14; Unigard Opp'n at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As explained below, the court finds genuine disputes of material fact preclude finding as a matter of law that the rented or loaned property exclusion or the care, custody or control exclusion apply. The court therefore DENIES summary judgment to plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to evidence submitted by the parties and documents the court judicially notices, the court draws the following facts primarily from the following documents,\n   whose existence and content are undisputed unless otherwise noted: Nationwide plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Facts (NSUF), Nationwide ECF No. 11-2; defendants' Response to Nationwide plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Facts (NRSUF) and Statement of Disputed Facts (NSDF), Nationwide ECF No. 36-1; Unigard plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Facts (USUF), Unigard ECF No. 22; defendants' response to Unigard plaintiffs' Statement of Undisputed Facts (URSUF) and Statement of Disputed Facts (USDF), ECF No. 27-1; and Unigard plaintiffs' Reply to defendants' response, Unigard ECF No. 36-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nationwide plaintiffs issued multiple insurance policies to Perry between 2012 to 2016. NSUF Nos. 20-26. These policies provided, in relevant part, that Nationwide will \"pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... 'property damage' to which this insurance applies.\" NSUF No. 28. The policies included exceptions for any property the insured rents. NSUF Nos. 30-31, 36, 38. Additionally, the policies excluded property damage for \"[p]ersonal property in the care, custody or control of the insured.\" NSUF Nos. 33, 36, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Unigard plaintiffs also issued multiple insurance policies to Perry, between 2010 and 2012. USUF No. 24. These policies provided that the insured \"will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of ... 'property damage' ....\" USUF No. 25. Similar to the Nationwide plaintiffs' insurance policies, the Unigard plaintiffs' insurance policies contained exceptions for property Perry rented, property loaned to Perry, or \"[p]ersonal property in the care custody or control of the 'insured' ....\" USUF No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2013, Mattes sued Perry and Gomes for negligence, negligence per se, intentional misrepresentation and concealment, and negligent misrepresentation and negligent concealment relating to the mass death of Mattes's pollinating bees on farm property owned by Perry. Nationwide ECF No. 12-1\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; NSUF No. 1. Mattes later filed an amended complaint containing the same four claims. NSUF No. 2; Nationwide ECF No. 12-2. In the amended complaint, Mattes alleged \"Perry's operations included the commercial production of watermelons and pumpkins, for which Perry rented bee hives for pollination from Mattes during 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Mattes also alleged that \"Perry orally contracted with Mattes to provide bee hives to pollinate Perry's crops\" from 2009 to 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. According to Mattes, Perry's application of various pesticides near the location of Mattes's bees caused \"catastrophic losses to his bee hives resulting in more than a 95 percent die off in 2012 alone ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties have submitted deposition testimony taken in the Mattes state suit, and agree the court can rely on it here. Mattes was deposed in February and March of 2015, and Gomes was deposed in\n   June 2016. Mattes Decl. \u00b6 14, Nationwide ECF No. 36-5; Gomes Decl. \u00b6 10, Nationwide ECF No. 36-2. During his first deposition, Mattes stated Gomes first called him in April 2009 \"and asked [Mattes] if [Mattes] wanted to do their melons and pumpkins.\" Mattes Dep. Vol. I at 98:19-22, ECF No. 36-5 Ex. A. Mattes responded, \"Right,\" when asked if Mattes recalled Gomes's inquiring \"if [Mattes was] interested in providing pollination services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 102:8-10;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 117:16-20 (Mattes responding in part, \"Yeah,\" to a question about providing pollination services to Perry). Mattes acknowledged that \"[p]rice and how many hives they need and when they need them\" were the terms typically involved in an oral agreement with farmers for pollination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103:14-17. Before contracting with Perry and Gomes, Mattes had gotten \"heavier into feeding\" his bees used to pollinate crops, and \"[n]ow [they] supplement feed quite a bit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 93:8-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to Mattes, initial hive placement \"was always done at night or early morning\" and did not involve anyone affiliated with Perry being there during the initial placement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144:13-15. It was \"[u]sually [Mattes's] decision\" to place the bee hives: \"They pretty much left it in our hands where to put them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 145:5-20. Mattes would check on hives at times \"with a drive-by\" without stopping if \"everything look[ed] good.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150:17-21;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 151:7-12 (discussing visual inspections of \"[t]he amount of bees going in and out ....\"). Mattes recalled that \"[w]e generally looked at [the hives] once or twice\" for Perry's watermelon pollination between the time Mattes dropped off the hives and later picked them up.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 150:22-151:2. In 2009, Mattes \"did replace some [hives] with nukes,\" which were smaller versions of normal bee hives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:2-7, 153:19-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mattes Decl. \u00b6 8 (explaining nukes or \"nucs\" as smaller versions of normal bee hives). At times, Mattes would be informed that Perry did not \"want [Mattes] working any bees while the pickers are out here [in the field] ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 149:12-24. Mattes's hives would remain in Perry's fields for about one month to pollinate pumpkins and \"from June through September\" to pollinate watermelons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   148:18-149:8, 161:14-17. Gomes would call Mattes and tell Mattes \"to get [the hives] out.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 161:18-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although \"[t]he rule is once [Mattes] put [the hives] there, leave them there,\" Mattes stated \"there were times [Mattes] had gone out there and they moved them, which is not a good thing to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 123:10-21. On these occasions, nobody had advised Mattes that the hives were not in an appropriate location; \"they just moved them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 144:20-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mattes also acknowledged non-employee compensation of $27,460 reported on a 2009 IRS 1099 form as corresponding with the amount Mattes charged Perry for pollination services that year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 138:1-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During his deposition as the person most knowledgeable for Perry, Gomes testified he would tell a prospective pollinator \"[w]e're going to have X amount of acres of watermelons, they will be in these general locations and everything and we will need bees.\" Gomes Dep. at 56:2-8, Nationwide ECF No. 11-7. Gomes knew \"we want[ed] to put a hive or a hive and a half per acre.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:11-12. Gomes would \"let them know\" when to bring the bee hives out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:12-15. Gomes acknowledged Mattes would invoice Perry, and the invoice would reflect where Gomes told Mattes to put the bees and however many bees Gomes determined were necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:25-59:3. However, in response to a specific invoice exhibit presented to Gomes at deposition, Gomes stated the only thing that particular invoice \"doesn't\n   show\" is whether the \"bees that [Mattes] billed me for ... were his bees or somebody else's bees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:4-9. Gomes stated if Mattes did not have enough bees, Mattes would rent bees from somebody else.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gomes would check to ensure the hives were where Gomes told Mattes to put them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78:21-79:1, 94:23-95:2. According to Gomes, beekeepers are \"not going into the field\" within 24 hours of pesticide application; they would go \"[a]round the field\" or in a buffer zone, but not into the field itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130:18-132:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For these motions, no party disputes Mattes's allegation that Perry applied pesticides to its fields while Mattes's bees were pollinating those fields, the applied pesticides were toxic to the bees, and as a result of the pesticide exposure over a four-year period, the bee hives suffered a catastrophic loss of bees. NRSUF Nos. 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mattes, in a declaration submitted in opposition to the pending motions, has stated he maintained access to the bees after placing them near Perry's fields, regularly visiting, inspecting, feeding, medicating and vaccinating the bees. Mattes Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7-9 (explaining he would drop in smaller versions of normal bee hives if bee populations were insufficient and would \"requeen\" a hive with another queen if needed). Mattes expected Perry would not interact with his bees or their hives and that Perry would not attempt to move them, consistent with Mattes's expectation of all growers who receive his pollination services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. According to Mattes, interacting with the hives would create a safety hazard both to farm workers and to the bees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moving the hives and caring for the bees takes special skills, knowledge and equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a declaration submitted in opposition to the motions, Gomes states Perry does not employ a trained beekeeper and has always contracted with beekeepers in the area who keep their own hives. Gomes Decl. \u00b6 2. According to Gomes, Perry's personnel stayed away from Mattes's hives when working in Perry's fields.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. \"Perry did not move or relocate Mattes'[s] hives.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Although the parties do not dispute a 2009 invoice from Gary's Apiaries referring to the number of bee hives Perry \"rented\" from Mattes, the parties dispute the meaning of this invoice. NRSUF No. 5. For instance, Mattes's general practice with Perry was to provide one invoice up front and receive payment of that amount, then submit a second invoice for the actual number of hives used during the growing season. Mattes Dep. Vol. I at 135:20-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mattes Decl. \u00b6 4 (\"I charged Perry for my services on a 'per hive' basis.... consistent with how I charged other local growers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In motions\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   filed in the Mattes state suit, Perry and Gomes repeatedly refer to Mattes as owning \"a bee business in which he rents bee hives to local farmers\" and represent that Perry \"rented bee hives from Mattes from 2009 to 2012.\"\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   , Nationwide ECF No. 35-1 at 3, 6, 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Perry has submitted the declarations of Todd Garibaldi, a licensed insurance broker, and Charleen Carroll, owner of Pollination Contracting Inc.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Garibaldi Decl., Nationwide ECF No. 36-3; Carroll Decl., Nationwide 36-4. Garibaldi refers to his experience of \"farming for over 30 years,\" having \"retained the pollination services of many different beekeepers\" and being \"familiar with the general practices of farmers and beekeepers in arranging for pollination services.\" Garibaldi Decl. \u00b6 2. Garibaldi asserts he \"require[s], and the beekeeper insists, that the beekeeper remain in control of his or her bees and hives while providing the pollination services that [Garibaldi's] crops need.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The beekeepers Garibaldi hires are \"responsible for inspecting, feeding, medicating, and providing any other care that the bees or hives require.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In her declaration, Carroll indicates she is the owner of a company that, since 1978, has \"connect[ed] beekeepers and growers, primarily almond growers, for pollination services.\" Carroll Decl. \u00b6 1. Carroll provided testimony in the Mattes suit, including \"opinions related to the almond market, pollination services in general, and [her] experience working with Mr. Mattes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Carroll states \"growers and beekeepers use the terms 'hive rental' and 'pollination services' interchangeably.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Carroll also states beekeeping \"requires very specialized skills,\" and the contracts her company \"has been involved with over the last forty years\" contain \"provisions that the beekeeper will always have access to his or her hives while the hives are present in the grower's fields, the grower shall not move the hives without express permission from the beekeeper, and the grower shall be penalized ... if any hive is moved without permission from the beekeeper.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A court will grant summary judgment \"if ... there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.
