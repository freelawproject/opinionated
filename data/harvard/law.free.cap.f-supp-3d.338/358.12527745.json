Vladeck and Vladeck, Raskin &amp; Clark, P.C. for a charging lien. ECF No. 88. In their Amended Answer to Second Amended Complaint with Affirmative Defenses, Jury Demand and Counterclaims (\"Amended Answer\"), ECF No. 80, defendants allege that they are entitled to a statutory charging lien \"in the amount no less than $593,333.00, plus statutory interest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 328. In a separate counterclaim, however, defendants allege that they are entitled to \"\n   <em>\n    quantum meruit\n   </em>\n   for the reasonable value of the legal services rendered to Prout ... in the amount no less than $40,000.00, plus statutory interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 309-10. For the reasons stated below, defendants' charging-lien counterclaim is dismissed to the extent defendants seek a charging lien in excess of $40,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Familiarity with all prior proceedings is here assumed. In brief, this case arises out of defendants' representation of Prout in connection with Prout's claims against his former employer, Invesco, Ltd., for whistleblower retaliation and violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"). Prout alleges that defendants negligently let the statutes of limitations lapse on his claims for non-willful violation of the FMLA and for retaliation under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\"). In June 2017, Prout discharged defendants and hired Sanford Heisler Sharp, LLP, which negotiated a $1.75M settlement with Invesco.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 278-81. Of that $1.75M settlement, Sanford Heisler allegedly received a fee of $593,333.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 316-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In their Amended Answer, defendants deny Prout's allegations and assert counterclaims for breach of contract, quantum meruit, and a charging lien, all of which\n   arise out of Prout's alleged failure to pay defendants for legal services rendered. The breach of contract counterclaim seeks an \"amount no less than $29,115.00, plus statutory interest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 303, and the quantum meruit counterclaim seeks an \"amount no less than $40,000.00, plus statutory interest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 310. However, the charging lien counterclaim, which defendants bring under New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 475, seeks an \"amount no less than $593,333.00, plus statutory interest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 328, based on the legal fee that Sanford Heisler allegedly received. Prout moves to dismiss the charging lien counterclaim under Rule 12(b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a preliminary matter, defendants argue that Prout's Rule 12(b)(6) motion is procedurally barred by Rule 12(g)(2) because Prout already brought a Rule 12(f) motion to strike paragraphs of defendants' Answer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 55. Under Rule 12(g)(2), \"a party that makes a motion under [ Rule 12 ] must not make another motion under [ Rule 12 ] raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\" There is an exception to Rule 12(g) (2), however, for motions brought under Rule 12(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(2)(B). Accordingly, at oral argument, the Court determined, without objection, that Prout's motion could be construed as a motion under Rule 12 (c), thereby avoiding any procedural problems posed by Rule 12(g)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript dated October 5, 2018 at 10:18-24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Moving to the merits, New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 475, here applicable, provides that an \"attorney who appears for a party has a lien upon his or her client's cause of action, claim or counterclaim, which attaches to a verdict, report, determination, decision, award, settlement, judgment or final order in his or her client's favor, and the proceeds thereof in whatever hands they may come.\" Where a client discharges an attorney without cause,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the amount of the charging lien is \"determined on a quantum meruit basis.\"\n   <em>\n    People v.
