Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 50. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute involves two parcels of real property owned by Golf Village covering approximately 8.1 acres located in Powell, Ohio, at the northeast corner of Sawmill Parkway and Seldom Seen Road (\"Property\"). The Property is currently vacant and zoned for planned commercial use. Plaintiffs seek to develop a portion of their planned development, the Golf Village Community, as a residential hotel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In April 2016, Plaintiffs, through counsel, sent a letter to the City of Powell's Director of Development, Betz, seeking approval of their proposed use of the Property. Plaintiffs requested a \"prompt decision pursuant to Section 113.05(a) [of the City's Zoning Code] that the proposed residential hotel is a permitted use\" so that they could then submit a final development plan to the City for approval. Ex. 3 at 6, ECF No. 45-3. A month later, on May 5, 2016, Betz responded, declining to provide Plaintiffs with the requested decision. He stated that the Zoning Code does not establish a process for providing applicants with \"advisory opinions,\" but instead requires \"that an applicant must submit a full and complete application\" for \"a Zoning Certificate approval.\" Ex. 4 at 3, ECF No. 45-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, on May 24, 2016, Plaintiffs submitted an Application for Appeal to the City's Board of Zoning Appeals challenging the Zoning Administrator's decision not to provide Golf Village with the requested interpretation of the Zoning Code. No hearing was held. On June 9, 2016, however, the City's Law Director emailed Plaintiffs, asserting that the Zoning Administrator's May 5, 2016, response was not an appealable administrative action. For that reason, he stated, the City would take no action on Plaintiffs' Application for Appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 8, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal in the Delaware Court of Common Pleas, appealing the City's June 9, 2016 refusal to hear their administrative appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golf Vill.

In sharp contrast to the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Miles Christi\n   </em>\n   , taking the allegations as true, there is no viable option for Plaintiffs to get relief from the City's Zoning Board without judicial intervention. Thus, the \"consequences of staying [the Court's] hand\" here, according to Plaintiffs' allegations, would be to force Plaintiffs to incur the expense of a zoning application with the understanding that such an exercise would be futile since the Zoning Administrator has admitted that the proposed development will not be approved. Moreover, the existence of constitutional claims, while not sufficient alone to show hardship, adds additional support to a finding that hardship has been shown.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miles Christi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078159\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/533/#p537\">\n    629 F.3d at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
