Defendants David W. Elkin (\"Elkin\"), Richard M. Shorin (\"Shorin\"), The Elkin Group, Inc. (\"TEG\"), and U.S. Mobilcomm, Inc. (\"USM\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") seek judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b) regarding Plaintiff Jeffrey M. Norman's (\"Norman\" or \"Plaintiff\") remanded claims. (D.I. 301) The issues before the Court on remand have been fully briefed. (D.I. 313, 315, 316, 318, 319, 321) For the reasons discussed below, the Court will grant Defendants' motion to the extent that it will enter judgment in Elkin's favor on Norman's claims for (i) breach of contract based on Elkin's failure to make pro rata distributions of the proceeds of the sale of USM's assets in 2001, (ii) conversion, (iii) usurpation of corporate opportunities, (iv) breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty, (v) breach of the duty of disclosure, (vi) unjust enrichment, and (vii) declaratory judgment. However, the Court will also enter judgment in Norman's favor on Norman's (i) breach of contract claim based on Elkin's execution of the Shareholder Loan Agreement (\"SLA\") and (ii) for Elkin's failure to distribute the proceeds from the sale of USM's assets on a pro rata basis in 2002, as well as (iii) attendant damages for those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 13, 2009, a jury returned a verdict in Norman's favor on Norman's breach of contract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   fraud, and conversion claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 118) Norman was awarded $1 in nominal damages on his breach of contract claim, $105,756 in compensatory damages and $48,000 in punitive damages\n   on his fraud claim, and $38,062 in compensatory damages on his conversion claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 118) Following trial, Elkin moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that Norman's claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman v. Elkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118399\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/464/#p469\">\n    726 F.Supp.2d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469 (D. Del. 2010) (\"\n   <em>\n    Norman II\n   </em>\n   \"). Former Judge Joseph J. Farnan, Jr. largely agreed with Elkin and held that all of Norman's claims were time-barred except for Norman's second and third theories of breach of contract (alleging execution of the SLA and failure to make\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distributions, respectively). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118399\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/464/#p469\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 470-76 ) Judge Farnan entered an Amended Judgment consistent with that decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 158)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following resolution of additional motions filed by both Norman\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Elkin, the Court held a second jury trial on Norman's two remaining breach of contract theories. The jury again found in Norman's favor and awarded him $1 in nominal damages based on Elkin's execution of the SLA and $73,180.17 in compensatory damages for Elkin's failure to make\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distributions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 246) Elkin again moved for judgment as a matter of law. The Court again agreed with Elkin and entered judgment in his favor on both theories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman v.

Aug. 14, 2015) (\"\n   <em>\n    Norman IV\n   </em>\n   \"). As to Norman's SLA-based claim, the Court concluded that Norman had failed to present evidence he was damaged by Elkin's actions independent of his other theory of breach (i.e., independent of Elkin's failure to make\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distributions).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The Court also agreed with Elkin that Norman's breach of contract claim for failure to make\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distributions of the proceeds from the sale of USM assets was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3. The Court concluded Norman had been on inquiry notice of his claims since \"before December 2, 2002,\" and that the statute of limitations was not tolled during the pendency of Norman's \u00a7 220 action in the Delaware Court of Chancery and, thus, his claim was time-barred.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Consistent with that decision, the Court vacated the jury's verdict and entered final judgement in Elkin's favor. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 285)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Norman appealed. So did Elkin, based on the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Norman's fraud and conversion claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman v.

The Third Circuit affirmed on alternative grounds the Court's decision to enter judgement in Elkin's favor on his fraud claim, but vacated entry of judgment in Elkin's favor on all other claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n    at 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Facts Relating to Norman's Remaining Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Elkin and Norman Found USM and Acquire Phase I Licenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 1991 and 1992, the FCC granted first-wave (\"Phase I\") 220 MHZ licenses by lottery. Norman and Elkin founded USM for the purpose of aggregating and selling these licenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 3 \u00b6 A) Norman and Elkin were USM's sole shareholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It was primarily Norman's responsibility to acquire Phase I licenses. After the acquisition phase ended, Norman's day-to-day involvement in USM ended. Elkin continued to manage USM's affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Acquisition of Phase II Licenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 1998, the FCC announced a competitive auction of \"Phase II\" licenses. Elkin registered USM with the FCC as a qualified bidder for Auction 18. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 3 \u00b6 Y;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 97; D.I. 318 at 4) Elkin also registered TEG, his own company, as a qualified bidder for Auction 24. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 3 \u00b6\u00b6 AA-BB) Elkin testified that it was necessary to register TEG as a qualified bidder because USM did not have adequate funding to participate in the auctions, yet USM needed to ensure the Phase II licenses - which overlapped with the Phase I licenses owned by USM - ended up in \"friendly hands.\" (D.I. 315 Ex. 2 at 106-07)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   USM won the rights to several Phase II licenses in Auction 18, and TEG won the rights to a single Phase II license in Auction 24. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 3 \u00b6 AA; D.I. 315 Ex. 4 at 101) Elkin subsequently transferred USM's rights in Phase II licenses to TEG. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 4 at 107) Some FCC notices listed USM as the winning bidder of the Phase II licenses, while others referred to TEG as the owner of the licenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n    860 F.3d at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Norman \"closely monitored\" the FCC auction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After the auction closed, Norman emailed Elkin asking for information about Auction 18. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 4 at 102-03) Elkin did not respond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Elkin Executes the SLA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   When Norman and Elkin founded USM, they entered into an oral agreement regarding capitalization of the company. To meet USM's $1M capital requirement, Norman was to contribute $250,000 and Elkin was to contribute $750,000. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 3 \u00b6 D)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Sometime between 1995 and 2002, Elkin - without seeking Norman's approval - caused USM to enter into the SLA, pursuant to which USM agreed to treat any amount Elkin contributed above his capital requirement as a loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Elkin continued to make contributions to USM. USM's \"Shareholder Loan Schedule\" lists Elkin's contributions as totaling over $600,000, with certain contributions listed as loans. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 7 at 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Sale of Licenses and Distributions to Elkin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   From 1999 to 2001, Elkin sold off USM's and TEG's licenses. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 CC-EE, GG, JJ, KK, MM) USM used the proceeds from these sales to repay Elkin's loans, so that its creditors would be paid before distributions were made to holders of equity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204886049\">\n    2015 WL 4886049\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Over the course of two years, Elkin caused USM to pay out distributions to Elkin totaling $615,026. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 SS-YY) Norman was paid nothing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I.315 Ex. 4 \u00b6 DDD)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Norman Learns of License Sales and Distributions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Norman received federal income tax K-1 forms from USM for the tax years 2000 and 2001 that declared USM had realized a capital gain. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 4 \u00b6 RR;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204886049\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9 at 19;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204886049\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 10 at 21) The forms did not specify what had been sold, nor did they list any shareholder loans or distributions.

During the Summer 2002 Call, Elkin told Norman that some of USM's licenses had been sold and that Elkin had taken a distribution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 6 at 251-52) When Norman pressed Elkin about why Norman had not also received a distribution, Elkin told him, \"Oh, it wasn't your turn.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 252) Norman asked Elkin to send him more information about the sales but never received it. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On October 2, 2002, Norman's attorney sent Elkin a letter requesting information pursuant to 8 Del.

At a hearing in August 2005, former Vice Chancellor Parsons found \"there [was] a credible basis here for inferring possible mismanagement and wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Elkin,\" including by executing self-dealing transactions with no notice to Norman, the minority shareholder. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 Ex. 16 at 219) The Chancery Court granted Norman's \u00a7 220 request on October 2, 2005. Based on his successful \u00a7 220 action, Norman was able to obtain a number of documents related to his subsequent claims against Elkin. Norman filed suit against Elkin in the Court of Chancery on December 5, 2005. (D.I.I) Elkin then removed the action to this Court.

In his \u00a7 220 action, Norman sought to investigate possible mismanagement by Elkin related to the sale of USM assets and how the proceeds from those sales were distributed. The claims Norman later brought against Elkin and USM were related to that information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman V\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n    860 F.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting Norman gained \"valuable information\" related to his claims through his \u00a7 220 action).

Elkin contends that the statute of limitations should not be tolled because there is no evidence of fraudulent concealment.

Therefore, a lack of fraudulent concealment does not, on its own, dictate that tolling is inappropriate. Thus, even assuming Elkin did not fraudulently conceal his alleged wrongdoing, this does not outweigh the other factors in this case that indicate tolling is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court also disagrees with Elkin that whether a plaintiff had sufficient evidence to bring suit prior to initiating a \u00a7 220 action is determinative of whether to toll the statute of limitations. The Third Circuit rejected that proposition as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While it is a consideration, a plaintiff's ability or inability to bring suit without the information gleaned during his \u00a7 220 action is not dispositive of whether to toll the limitations period.

(D.I. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 UU-YY) Elkin contends that Norman was on inquiry notice of his\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   distribution-based claims no later than September 1, 1999, when TEG filed a public application with the FCC to assign a Phase II license to a third-party. (D.I. 313 at 8) Elkin points to additional FCC notices - specifically, TEG's and USM's applications to transfer\n   licenses to third-parties between January 2000 and February 2001 - that, Elkin contends, gave Norman additional notice of his claims. (D.I. 313 at 9) Elkin further argues that Norman's 2000 K-1, which Elkin contends Norman received sometime \"in the spring of 2001,\" put Norman on notice of his claims because Norman testified that he knew the long-term capital gain allocated to him on the K-1 meant, by definition, that USM had sold licenses. (D.I. 313 at 9) (citing D.I. 313 Ex. C at C-8-9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Norman sees things very differently. First, Norman contends that his claims related to the 2002 distributions are timely because the distributions occurred after November 2001, meaning these claims arose less than three years before the filing of his \u00a7 220 action. (D.I. 315 at 14) As for the 2001 distributions, Norman contends that because his claim is based on the improper distributions themselves - and not the license sales that led to the distributions - \"[i]t is remarkable for Elkin to argue that Norman should have known about improper distributions years\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the challenged distributions even took place.\" (D.I. 318 at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.I. 321 at 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court agrees with Norman with respect to the 2002 distributions.

This evidence includes, most prominently, public filings from 1999 to 2001 indicating that TEG and USM had reassigned their Phase II licenses to third-parties. (D.I. 314 Ex.

Norman's conversion claim is time-barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Elkin seeks judgment as a matter of law on Norman's conversion claim based on Elkin's substitution of TEG for USM in Auction 18. (D.I. 61 \u00b6 B.1.f) Elkin contends Norman's conversion claim is time-barred because Norman was on inquiry notice of his claim by November 1998, when TEG filed a publicly available FCC Form 601 to have the Auction 18 licenses issued to TEG (and not to USM).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 313 at 6) Elkin contends that a number of other publicly available FCC notices from 1999 to 2001 \"clearly named TEG as the applicant, owner and/or assignor of the Phase II licenses\" and, thus, put Norman on additional notice of his conversion claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I 313 at 6-7) (pointing to FCC notices regarding issuance of Auction 18 licenses to TEG (rather than USM), application by TEG to participate in Auction 24, and assignment of Phase II licenses from TEG to third-parties) In addition, Elkin contends Norman had \"further notice that USM was not the party acquiring the Phase II licenses\" because Norman was not asked to contribute any money toward the FCC deposit for the Auction 18 licenses and the USM balance sheet did not show the FCC deposit or any Phase II licenses as assets. (D.I. 313 at 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Norman disagrees. (D.I. 315 at 2-3, 15) As an initial matter, Norman argues that his conversion claim did not accrue until 2000 and 2001 when Elkin exercised \"unauthorized\" use or control over the Phase II licenses by \"s[elling] the licenses and retain[ing] all the proceeds for himself.\" (D.I. 315 at 15-16) Norman also insists that all the FCC notices about Auction 18 listed USM - not TEG - as the qualified bidder and winner of the Phase II licenses, such that they could not have put him on notice of his conversion claim. (D.I. 318 at 8-9) As Norman sees it, he was first on inquiry notice of his conversion claim in December 2002, when he received Elkin's letter \"disclos[ing] the potential existence of TEG sales.\" (D.I. 315 at 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On the issue of when Norman's claim accrued, the Court agrees with Elkin. Having filed suit based on the premise that \"the Defendants' actions were adverse to [Norman's] claimed interest in the Phase II licenses,\" Norman cannot now claim TEG and USM were \"equivalent\" to one another, thereby undermining his entire theory of conversion, in an effort to ensure that his claim is timely. (D.I. 316 at 3) Accordingly, the Court concludes Norman's claim accrued when Elkin registered TEG as the applicant and/or owner of the Phase II licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court further concludes that a reasonable person in Norman's position would have had inquiry notice of his conversion\n   claim before November 2002. As of 1998, publicly available FCC notices indicated that TEG was applying to have the Auction 18 Phase II licenses issued to itself, rather than USM. To the extent Norman challenges Elkin's actions beyond registering TEG in Auction 18, FCC filings from 1999 to 2000 made clear TEG was bidding on Phase II licenses and reassigning them to third parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 314 Ex. A) In addition, during the Summer 2002 Call, Elkin informed Norman that he had sold licenses and taken a distribution. This was sufficient to put Norman on inquiry notice of his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Cellular\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7862384\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/677/497/#p504\">\n    677 A.2d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding plaintiff had notice of claims based on public filings with FCC).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   While Norman contends he had no reason to see or search for this information, Norman testified that he had tracked the results of Auction 18 on the FCC website and, after the auction closed, emailed Elkin asking for more information about the results of the Phase II auction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118399\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/464/#p469\">\n    726 F.Supp.2d at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Elkin seeks judgment in his favor on Norman's usurpation claim, contending Norman was on inquiry notice of his usurpation claim \"no later [than] November 4, 1998.\" (D.I. 313 at 6) Elkin advances the same arguments - and evidence - with respect to Norman's usurpation claim as he did for Norman's conversion claim. (D.I. 313 at 6-8) (arguing that FCC notices of TEG's application for and assignment of Phase II licenses, as well as fact Elkin never asked Norman for capital contributions and USM balance sheet did not show assets related to Phase II licenses, put Norman on inquiry notice of usurpation claim)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Norman counters that he was not on notice of his usurpation claim because there was no \" 'smoking gun' \" that should have prompted Norman, a minority shareholder, to inquire into Elkin's behavior until he received the December 2002 Letter disclosing sales of Phase II licenses by TEG. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 315 at 19-20) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Mushroom Transp.

Public filings from 1998 and 1999 listed TEG as the applicant for issuance of Auction 18 Phase II licenses and listed TEG as a qualified bidder for Auction 24. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 314 Ex. A) A number of other FCC notices from 1999 and 2000 made clear TEG had been granted Phase II licenses and, later, reassigned them, all of which would have been sufficient to give Norman notice of his usurpation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Cellular\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7862384\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/677/497/#p504\">\n    677 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   504 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dean Witter P'ship Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20442456\">\n    1998 WL 442456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Norman's allegation that his fiduciary relationship with Elkin insulates him from having to investigate wrongdoing absent a \"smoking gun\" is unavailing.

Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9205248,2190380\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/382/325/\">\n    382 F.3d at 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"the trusting plaintiff still must be reasonably attentive to his interests.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Dean Witter P'ship Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20442456\">\n    1998 WL 442456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Norman was not entitled to ignore public filings that clearly indicated that TEG had been registered in Auction 18 and Auction 24 in place of USM, the USM K-1s that indicated there had been license sales, and Norman's Summer 2002 phone call with Elkin, in which Elkin told Norman that USM had sold licenses. These notices should have prompted investigation by Norman into potential wrongdoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will grant judgment in Elkin's favor on Norman's usurpation of corporate opportunities claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Norman's breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty claim is time-barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Norman alleges Elkin breached his fiduciary duty of loyalty by (1) engaging in self-dealing during the Phase II auctions by using USM's position to benefit TEG, (2) executing the SLA, (3) conducting USM's business for himself as a purported creditor, and (4) forcing USM into insolvency after execution of the SLA. (D.I. 315 at 17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Elkin seeks judgment in his favor on all bases of Norman's fiduciary duty claim. Elkin contends that the same FCC notices discussed above were sufficient to put Norman on notice of his claim before November 2002. (D.I. 313 at 6) Norman counters that, as to the first, third, and fourth bases for his claim, he was not on inquiry notice until he received Elkin's December 2002 Letter, which disclosed purchase and sale agreements showing TEG had sold Phase II licenses. (D.I. 315 at 17) As to the SLA-basis of his claim, Norman contends he was not aware of the facts underlying his claim until Elkin sent him a copy of the SLA in October 2003. (D.I. 315 at 17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the reasons discussed above with respect to Norman's conversion claim, the Court agrees with Elkin that Norman's claim based on Elkin engaging in self-dealing during the Phase II auctions is time-barred because a reasonable person would have been on notice of this portion of his claim before November 2002. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment in Elkin's favor on that portion of Norman's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Norman's claim with respect to Elkin's execution of the SLA is also time-barred. Elkin contends Norman was on notice of the facts underlying this claim by November 1998, when Norman received a USM balance sheet and other financial documents indicating USM was losing money, yet its capital was increasing. (D.I. 313 at 10) Elkin contends the financial figures were so striking that a reasonable\n   investor should have realized Elkin was continuing to contribute money to USM and \"could [not] have expected Elkin to [do so] ... without an appropriate mechanism in place,\" such that Norman had sufficient facts to put him on notice that Elkin had executed the SLA (or taken some similar measure). (D.I. 313 at 10-11) The Court agrees. Norman, as the only other shareholder of USM, was aware of how much capital Elkin had contributed (and that Norman himself had not contributed any additional capital).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norman II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4118399\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/726/464/#p469\">\n    726 F.Supp.2d at 474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The information Norman received regarding USM's financials - particularly given Norman's knowledge that USM had yet to make a sale and was struggling to survive as a company - should have been startling enough to prompt further inquiry by Norman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pomeranz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20217039\">\n    2005 WL 217039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (\"[P]laintiffs cannot avoid the conclusion that the March Schedules still should have raised their eyebrows regarding what was happening to the financial strength of the Partnership.\").

As discussed above, numerous public filings would have put Norman on inquiry notice of his claim well before November 2002. In addition, Norman received 2000 and 2001 K-1s from USM (sometime in 2001 and 2002) that allocated to Norman a tax liability on more than $100,000 of income, which Norman testified made clear to him that USM had sold licenses. (D.I. 313 Ex. C at C-8-9) Elkin also informed Norman that USM had sold licenses during their Summer 2002 Call. This was sufficient to put a reasonable person in Norman's position on inquiry, if not actual, notice of his claim before November 2002. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment in Elkin's favor on this portion of Norman's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, the record shows that Norman was on inquiry notice of his claim based on Elkin forcing USM into the zone of insolvency following execution of the SLA before November 2002. (D.I. 61 \u00b6 B.1.d) That evidence includes: the FCC notices that TEG and USM had sold Phase II licenses, the USM balance sheets indicating that the company was losing money, and the Summer 2002 Call in which Elkin told Norman he had sold licenses and that Elkin had taken a distribution, but it was not Norman's turn to take a distribution. All of this, together, is sufficient for a reasonable person to be put on notice that he should undertake further inquiry to determine if a wrong had been committed against him. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment in Elkin's favor on this portion of Norman's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Elkin's breach of the fiduciary duty of disclosure is time-barred\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Norman claims Elkin breached his duty of disclosure by (1) executing the SLA, (2) selling the Phase II licenses and distributing the proceeds to himself, and (3) selling substantially all of USM's assets, without disclosing those events to - or seeking the approval of - Norman. (D.I. 315 at 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Elkin seeks judgment in his favor on Norman's claim due to it being time-barred. (D.I. 316 at 8-9) Norman responds by urging the Court to \"maintain\" Judge Farnan's finding that Norman had inquiry notice of his claim related to the SLA in October 2003, when Elkin provided Norman a copy of the SLA. (D.I. 315 at 18) As\n   to his other two disclosure claims, Norman contends that Judge Farnan's finding that Norman was on inquiry notice of these claims based on Elkin's December 2002 should also be maintained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 315 at 18)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the reasons discussed above regarding Norman's breach of fiduciary duty claim, and on the record now before the Court, the Court concludes that Norman's claim regarding execution of the SLA is time-barred. In addition, for the reasons discussed above in the context of Norman's breach of contract and conversion claims, the Court concludes Norman's claim based on Elkin selling the Phase II licenses and distributing the proceeds himself and selling substantially all of USM's assets are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    e.

(D.I. 61 \u00b6 B.1.f.) Elkin contends this claim is time-barred based on the \"inquiry notice effects of the FCC notices and the K-1s.\" (D.I. 316 at 9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For many of the reasons discussed above in the context of Norman's\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   theory of breach of contract (for which the statute of limitations is year longer than it is for Norman's unjust enrichment claim), the Court agrees with Elkin. The FCC notices and K-1s were sufficient to put Norman on notice that of the need to investigate potential wrongdoing. This is inquiry notice, and Norman was put on such notice of his claim regarding all of the challenged distributions based on these facts prior to November 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment for Elkin on Norman's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    f.

Elkin seeks judgment in his favor on Norman's declaratory judgment claim based on the statute of limitations. (D.I. 313 at 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Court concludes that all bases of this claim are time-barred.

With respect to Norman's second theory of breach, the Third Circuit held that Elkin's execution of the SLA was an independent breach that entitles Norman to nominal damages and ordered the Court to reinstate the jury verdict in Norman's favor and the award of nominal damages.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     at 128-29\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Court will do so. Finally, the Third Circuit affirmed on alternative grounds the entry of judgment in Elkin's favor on Norman's fraud claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276155\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/111/#p121\">\n     at 131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Accordingly, the judgment in Elkin's favor on that claim likewise stands.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Norman contends that the Form 601 was not admitted into evidence at either trial, and, therefore, the Court cannot consider it, despite the fact that Norman testified that he was tracking the results of Auction 18 on the FCC website and, thus, presumably would have seen the Form 601. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.I. 318 at 7) Elkin does not dispute that the Form 601 was never admitted into evidence. Regardless, it is not necessary to the Court's conclusion as to the timeliness of Norman's claims, as the other FCC notices and Summer 2002 Call would, on their own, be sufficient to put Norman on notice of his various claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Norman's reliance on Judge Farnan's previous conclusions is unavailing.
