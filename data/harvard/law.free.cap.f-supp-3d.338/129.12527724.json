(Dkt. 1).

Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Dkt. 10; Dkt. 14), and Plaintiff's response (Dkt. 15). For the reasons discussed below, Plaintiff's motion (Dkt. 10) is granted, the Commissioner's motion (Dkt. 14) is denied, and the matter is remanded to the Commissioner for further administrative proceedings consistent with this Decision and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff protectively filed her application for DIB on November 9, 2012.

(Dkt. 10-1 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 9 at 115). Plaintiff's application was initially denied on September 19, 2013. (Dkt. 9 at 139-166).

Initially, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff last met the insured status requirements of the Act on December 31, 2016. (Dkt. 9 at 32). At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful work activity since May 2, 2012, the alleged onset date.

With respect to Plaintiff's representations that she suffered from fibromyalgia, Raynaud's syndrome and generalized anxiety disorder, the ALJ concluded that these were not medically determinable impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any Listing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of Listings 1.04A-C, 11.14, 12.04A-C, and 12.08, in reaching his conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform a range of light work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 416.967(b), with the additional limitations that Plaintiff:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   is limited to performing work with a specific vocational profile of two or lower, involving simple, repetitive one and two-step tasks; cannot be required to determine quality, quantity or method of work; must be able to alternate between sitting and standing at fifteen-minute intervals while remaining at her work station; cannot have contact with the public, and can have occasional contact with coworkers and supervisors; and can occasionally kneel and squat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At step five, the ALJ relied on the testimony of a vocational expert (\"VE\") to conclude that, considering Plaintiff's age, education, work experience, and RFC, there were jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy that Plaintiff could perform, including the representative occupations of bench assembler, electrical accessories assembler, and inspector. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48). Accordingly, the ALJ found that Plaintiff was not disabled as defined in the Act.

(Dkt. 9 at 788-89). On September 23, 2015, Dr. Shamsi, along with a licensed clinical social worker, completed a Mental Residual Functional Capacity Questionnaire, relating to Plaintiff's ability to function in a work setting. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1076). Dr. Shamsi assessed Plaintiff's GAF as 55 and noted that her medications caused joint pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on an examination of Plaintiff's mental/emotional capabilities, Dr. Shamsi found that Plaintiff was \"seriously limited, but not precluded\" (meaning \"ability to function in this area is seriously limited and less than satisfactory, but not precluded. This is a substantial loss of ability to perform the work-related activity\"), in several areas, including: maintaining attention for a two hour segment; working in connection with or proximity to others without being unduly distracted; completing a workday or workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms; performing at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number or length of rest periods; dealing with normal work stress; and carrying out detailed instructions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1078-79). Dr. Shamsi further found Plaintiff incapable of accepting instructions and responding appropriately to criticism from supervisors or dealing with the stress of semiskilled and skilled work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Shamsi opined that Plaintiff had a \"noted increase\" in pain with increased stress and, due to her impairments, Plaintiff would miss about two days of work per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1079-80). Finally, Dr. Shamsi opined that Plaintiff is not a malingerer; that Plaintiff's impairments are consistent with her symptoms and functional limitations; and that\n   Plaintiff has difficulty coping with stressful situations and criticism. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1080).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In his decision, the ALJ acknowledged that Dr. Shamsi's opinion is \"largely consistent with the residual functional capacity determined above,\" but nevertheless gave the opinion \"little weight because it is at odds with benign findings on mental status examination reported by Dr. Shamsi just thirteen days before the opinion was rendered, and, with regard to the claimant's ability to interact with supervisors, is internally inconsistent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45). The ALJ did not provide any additional explanation or analysis as to why he declined to give Dr. Shamsi's opinion any further weight, including any indication that he considered the length of Plaintiff's treatment with Dr. Shamsi (the record contains approximately 70 pages of medical records submitted by Dr. Shamsi), the evidence in support of the opinion, and/or whether the opinion was from a specialist. Rather, the decision contains only a cursory explanation that this single mental status report, in the ALJ's opinion, conflicted with a prior evaluation by Dr. Shamsi, and was internally inconsistent with regard to one of the criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this regard, the ALJ failed to address the multiple opinions, including opinions by Dr. Shamsi, that Plaintiff's symptoms are exacerbated when presented with stressful situations. Dr. Shamsi's reports on Plaintiff's condition include consistent references to Plaintiff's inability to handle stress and/or a significant increase in Plaintiff's symptoms when experiencing stressful situations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 788 (on June 9, 2014, noting depressed mood and poor frustration tolerance);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 794-95 (on October 29, 2014, displaying abnormalities including anxious mood, preoccupation with external stressors, and poor frustration tolerance);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 798 (on December 24, 2014, Plaintiff presented with \"thought content ... characterized by preoccupation and external stressors.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1079 (Plaintiff has a \"noted increase\" in pain with increased stress). In sum, the Court finds that the three-line explanation contained in the ALJ's decision as to why Dr. Shamsi's opinion is afforded little weight does not fulfill the \"good reasons\" requirement, as it is not sufficiently specific, and does not \"comprehensively set forth reasons for the weight assigned to a treating physician's opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Halloran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9263224\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/362/28/#p32\">\n    362 F.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, the ALJ's opinion, which references categories of Dr. Shamsi's report for which Plaintiff received favorable ratings, is completely devoid of any discussion of activities for which Plaintiff is \"seriously limited,\" discussed above, including her ability to maintain attention for a two hour segment; work in connection with or proximity to others without being unduly distracted; complete a workday or workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms; perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number or length of rest periods; deal with normal work stress; and carry out detailed instructions. An adequate explanation as to why the ALJ afforded little weight to Dr. Shamsi's opinion should have, at the very least, included a discussion of the several significant activities falling within that category, and why they do not support a finding of disability in Plaintiff's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While Defendant identifies several perceived inconsistencies in Dr. Shamsi's opinion (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 14-1 at 24-25), these articulations are absent from the ALJ's opinion. Defendant's after-the-fact explanation as to why the ALJ rejected Dr. Shamsi's opinion cannot serve as a substitute for the ALJ's findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Feb. 28, 2018) (\"[i]t is not the role of this Court to weigh the evidence of record and determine in the first instance whether or not Plaintiff's learning disorder constituted a severe impairment-that task falls to the ALJ, who failed to fulfill his obligation in this case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The ALJ's failure to properly evaluate Dr. Shamsi's report was not harmless error, particularly regarding the opinion that Plaintiff would miss two days per month of work. At the October 2015 hearing, the vocational expert testified that Plaintiff would \"be restricted to unskilled work that's more concrete and routine in nature and that allows her to do that work either in a sitting or standing position.\" (Dkt. 9 at 90). The vocational expert also testified that unskilled work \"does have productivity expectations,\" and \"unskilled workers need to stay on task about 85 to 90 percent of the workday....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90-91). Significantly, the vocational expert noted that employers of unskilled workers \"allow an unscheduled absence about one time a month, 12 times over the course of the year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91). In other words, had the ALJ accepted Dr. Shamsi's opinion that Plaintiff could be expected to have two absences per month, she would not meet the demands of the occupations listed by the vocational expert at the hearing. As such, remand of this matter for further administrative proceedings, wherein the ALJ can appropriately analyze and weigh Dr. Shamsi's opinion, is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs Remaining Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As set forth above, Plaintiff has identified additional reasons why she contends the ALJ's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.
