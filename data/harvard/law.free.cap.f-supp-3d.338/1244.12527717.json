Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint asserts claims against the Taos County Sheriff's Office and John Does 1-10. The Taos County Sheriff's Office maintains that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-46-1\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 4-46-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   preclude Plaintiff's assertion of claims against it. Plaintiff, in contrast, insists that a county sheriff's department is liable under both state and federal law. Resolution of Defendant's Motion requires the Court to explore the interplay between various procedural rules, a state naming statute, principles of agency, and federal and state discrimination laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   First, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(b) addresses a defendant's capacity to sue and be sued. It provides that for defendants, other than corporations and individuals not acting in a representative capacity, the capacity to sue or be sued is determined by \"the law of the state where the court is located.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(b). Thus, New Mexico law determines whether the Taos County Sheriff's Office has the capacity to be sued for violations of the ADA, Title VII, and the NMHRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 4-46-1, New Mexico's so-called \"naming statute,\" provides that, \"[i]n all suits or proceedings by or against a county, the name in which the county shall sue or be sued shall be the board of county commissioners of the county.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-46-1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, a straightforward application of Rule 17(b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   and Section 4-46-1 would suggest that Plaintiff must name the Board of County Commissioners of Taos County, rather than the Taos County Sheriff's Office, as the defendant in this case. But, as the Court indicated at the April 19, 2018 Motion Hearing, a handful of Tenth Circuit cases challenge a straightforward application of Rule 17 and Section 4-46-1 in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit determined that, because the board of county commissioners there lacked the power to control the hiring, termination, or supervision of the sheriff's employees under Colorado law, the board owed the sheriff's employees no duty under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323770\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1213/\">\n    312 F.3d at 1215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Bundy\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit, this time examining New Mexico law, noted that \"[w]hile a board of county commissioners may set the salaries of the employees and deputies necessary to discharge the functions of the county, only elected county officials, including sheriffs, have the authority to hire persons necessary to carry out the officials' duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Bundy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3976977\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/215/759/\">\n    215 F. App'x at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 n.2 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-38-19\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 4-38-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) and N.M. Const. art. X, \u00a7\u00a7 2 (A) &amp; (B) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Together, these cases beg the question whether a board of commissioners' lack of control over hiring sheriff's office employees is fatal to claims asserted against the board. Indeed, cognizant of the Tenth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   , and its discussion of the limitations on a board of county commissioners' hiring authority in\n   <em>\n    Bundy\n   </em>\n   , this Court was hesitant to dismiss Plaintiff's claims against the Taos County Sheriff's Office, anticipating that the Board of County Commissioners of Taos County might thereafter assert that it had no liability as Plaintiff's employer. Notably, if the Taos County Sheriff's Office does not have the capacity to be sued, but the Board of County Commissioners for Taos County has no liability as an employer under the ADA or Title VII, Plaintiff might be left without a remedy for the violations alleged in his Complaint. Upon examination of the cases, the parties' arguments, and other relevant law, however, the Court concludes that neither\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Bundy\n   </em>\n   control here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   , a former confinement officer for the Clear Creek County Sheriff, asserted claims for violations of the ADA against both the board of county commissioners and the sheriff.\n   <em>\n    Bristol\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323770\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1213/\">\n    312 F.3d at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The board of county commissioners moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that it owed no duty to provide accommodation to the plaintiff under the ADA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323770\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff, on the other hand, maintained that both the board and the sheriff were his employers for ADA purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323770\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Tenth Circuit explained that the particular context there - \"where there [was] more than one alleged employer\" - implicated two tests for determining the employer under the ADA: the joint-employer test and the single-employer test.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323770\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1213/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323770\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/1213/\">\n    at 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Moreover, it found that \"even self-imposed limitations on [a sheriff's] right to discharge employees at will are invalid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2030-10-506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Seeley v.

Because the sheriff exercised control over labor relations in the sheriff's office under Colorado law, the court determined that the sheriff, not the board, was the plaintiff's employer for purposes of the\n   ADA under both the joint-employer and single-employer tests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1220.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But Colorado law differs from New Mexico law in terms of the role of sheriff's and boards of county commissioners.

In contrast, New Mexico law provides that sheriffs have the power to hire and fire deputies, \"except that in counties which have established a merit system by ordinance, the provisions of the ordinance shall control the demotion and discharge of deputies and other employees of the sheriff's office.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%204-41-5\">\n    N.M.

Finally, American Jurisprudence, Second Edition, has synthesized the law in this area, reporting that \"[g]enerally, the departments and subordinate entities of municipalities, counties, and towns that are not separate legal entities or bodies do not have the capacity to sue or be sued in the absence of specific statutory authority.\" 56 Am.

While a state\n   may limit\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   causes of action, it cannot, through a naming statute or otherwise, effectively undermine a Plaintiff's ability to assert a federal cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haywood v.

Nevertheless, given this Court's preference for addressing claims on the merits, the difficulty in discerning the suable entity or entities in this case, and the lack of discernable prejudice to Taos County Board of County Commissioners, the Court will give Plaintiff until September 14, 2018 to move to amend his Complaint in order to add the Board of County Commissioners of Taos County as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Darby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522177\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/939/311/\">\n    939 F.2d at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the district court abused its discretion when it denied the plaintiff leave to amend his complaint to add the city as a defendant, where the city had notice of the claim against it by virtue of the plaintiff's suit against the city's police department).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendant Taos County Sheriff's Department (\n   <em>\n    Doc. 4\n   </em>\n   ) is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Plaintiff is granted leave until September 14, 2018 to move to amend his complaint in order to add as a defendant the Board of County Commissioners of Taos County.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Although a plaintiff could, under the New York statute, still assert a claim against the State in the Court of Claims based upon a corrections officer's unlawful conduct, the Court noted that he \"cannot use \u00a7 1983 as a vehicle for redress because a State is not a 'person' under \u00a7 1983.\"\n    <em>\n     Haywood\n    </em>\n    , 556 U.S. at 734 n.4,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653240\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/729/#p736\">\n     129 S.Ct. 2108\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Will v.
