The Court held a hearing on the MSJ on September 28, 2018.

[Doc. # 77]. In that pleading, Morrill alleged four claims for: (1) direct copyright infringement; (2) contributory copyright infringement; (3) vicarious copyright infringement against Williams and Interscope Records only; and (4) a conversion claim under California state law against Steffani only.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Morrill also sought declaratory relief and attorneys' fees,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , although he soon stipulated to dismissing his request for declaratory relief. [Docs. ## 78-79].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 22, 2017, Defendants collectively moved to dismiss this action in its entirety through two separate motions. [Docs. ## 81-82]. Soon after, the Court dismissed with prejudice Morrill's conversion claim against Steffani and his request for attorneys' fees. Order Motion to Dismiss (\"MTD Order\") at 5, 13 [Doc. # 95]. The Court also dismissed Morrill's claim for copyright infringement of the Protected Songs' lyrics with prejudice and his infringement claim as to the Protected Songs' sound recordings without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The Court denied, however, Defendants' motion to dismiss Morrill's claim of infringement of the Protected Song's musical compositions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Morrill did not amend his infringement claim as to the Protected Songs' sound recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On July 20, 2018, Defendants filed their MSJ, arguing that the rest of Morrill's infringement claim should be dismissed because the Protected Songs' and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   's musical compositions are not substantially similar. [Doc. # 112.] And because Morrill's direct infringement claim fails, Defendants contend that they are also entitled to summary judgment on his remaining claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The MSJ is now fully briefed.

Plaintiff's Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"SUF\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2 [Doc. # 113-10]. 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   is a derivative version of 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   . First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") \u00b6 14 [Doc. # 77]. Morrill alleges that in 2014, Stefani and Williams copied the chorus from 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   into\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   , the allegedly infringing song. FAC \u00b6 28. According to Morrill, the lyrics, chorus, rhythm, melody, background music, and accompanying sounds in\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   and the Protected Songs are very similar.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-32. Morrill claims that he learned that\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   infringes on the copyrights he owns when he heard Stefani perform\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   on\n   <em>\n    The Voice\n   </em>\n   , a television singing competition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Morrill's copyright infringement claim against Defendants is based on alleged similarities between the Protected Songs' and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   's musical compositions. The parties' comparison between the Protected Songs and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   are supported by reports from Judith Finell on behalf of Morrill [Doc. ## 112-8 (\"Finell Report\"); 112-16]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and reports from Marcyliena Morgan and Lawrence Ferrara on behalf of Defendants.

Alleged Similarities between 1996\n    <em>\n     Lightah\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Spark the Fire\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Morrill, through Finell, identifies three main features between 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   : Features A, B, and C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Morrill,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Feature A\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   involves the \"recurring lyrics combined with structural and rhythmic similarities, including the hooks of both songs.\" Statement of Additional Facts (\"SAF\") \u00b6 221 [Doc. # 113-10].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finell observes that the two pieces share similar words, pronunciation, rhyming, vernacular deviation, shared metric placement, phrase structure, rhythm, and function.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 222. Specifically, Finell observes that 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   both include lyrics that pronounce \"Who's got\" as \"Who got,\" \"lighter\" as \"light-ah,\" and \"fire\" as \"fi-ah.\" SUF \u00b6 26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Feature B\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , Morrill contends that both pieces have \"a nearly identical rhythmic pattern[.]\" SAF \u00b6 224. The similar rhythmic pattern occurs in the\n   <em>\n    recurring vocal phrase\n   </em>\n   in 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   , whereas it occurs in the\n   <em>\n    hook phrases\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That similar rhythm in 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   is an eighth note-eighth note-sixteenth note-sixteenth note tied to\n   <em>\n    a sixteenth note\n   </em>\n   -eighth note. Finell Report at 8. The similar rhythm in\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   is an eighth note-eighth note-sixteenth note-sixteenth note tied to an\n   <em>\n    eighth note\n   </em>\n   -eighth note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the two pieces share a\n   similar rhythmic value for each note, similar rhythmic emphasis on strong and weak beats, and syncopation. SAF \u00b6 224.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Feature C\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   share a distinctive tritone-an interval spanning six adjacent pitches-that are featured in the instrumental accompaniments in both songs. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 92-95. An example of a tritone is a pitch going from C to an F-sharp because the two notes are separated by three whole tones (C to D, D to E, and E to F-sharp).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. In 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   , this tritone is found in various instrumental melodies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. In\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   , tritones are used throughout the song,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96, which Morrill argues is particularly distinctive because the instrumental section is sparse. SAF \u00b6 240. But the tritones in each song start and end on different notes, and create different rhythms. SUF \u00b6\u00b6 97, 99-100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Not only does he contend that Features A, B, and C are individually distinctive, Morrill argues that Features A and C, and Features B and C are protectable when combined. Opp'n at 18. Finell notes that Features A and C are protectable when combined because these features occur simultaneously in the first two verses and the chorus sections in 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   , and the two features always occur simultaneously in the chorus of\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   . SAF \u00b6 223. Likewise, Finell observes that Features B and C occur simultaneously in verses 2 and 3 of 1996\n   <em>\n    Lightah\n   </em>\n   and in the chorus of\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 227.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Similarities between 2009\n    <em>\n     Lighter\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Spark the Fire\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Along with Feature A, Morrill argues that 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   also share Features D and E.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Feature D\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   is that both songs have a \"distinctive triplet rhythm.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 230. Finell notes that Feature D is the hook in 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   and the \"backbone and driving force\" of\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But in 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   , the triplet is separated by two eighth notes. SUF \u00b6 149. In contrast, the triplet rhythms in\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   do not have an eighth note separating them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150. The triplets in the two songs, moreover, appear in different rhythmic phrases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Feature E\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   involves the structural similarity between the paired hook structures of the songs. SAF \u00b6 231. Finell notes that there are nearly identical phrases of hook 1 in each song. Hook 1 is followed by Hook 2 in\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   and most of the time in 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   , and Hook 2 contains phrases rhyming with Hook 1 in identical rhythms in both songs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 246. That is, both have similar phrases: (1) Hook 1 is \"who got my light-ah\" in 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   and \"who got the light-ah\" in\n   <em>\n    Spark the Fire\n   </em>\n   ; and (2) and Hook 2 is \"who got my fi-ah\" in 2009\n   <em>\n    Lighter\n   </em>\n   and \"let's spark the fire\" in the similarly named song.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finell adds that Features A and E are protectable when combined.

In this case, methodology goes to the weight of the expert's testimony, not whether the evidence is admissible.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kennedy v.

Thus, the Court\n    <strong>\n     OVERRULES\n    </strong>\n    Defendants' objection to Finell's evidence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Features A, B, and C are composed of thirteen shared elements.

Opp'n at 4. Not so-that rule assists only in proving copying. The Ninth Circuit recently explained that, with inverse ratio rule, when there is stronger evidence of access, less compelling similarities between the two works must be shown to give rise to an inference of copying and vice versa.\n    <em>\n     Rentmeester v. Nike, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516041\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1111/#p1124\">\n     883 F.3d 1111\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1124 (9th Cir. 2018). Once copying is shown, Morrill must still demonstrate the copying of protected expression. \"The showing of substantial similarity necessary to prove unlawful appropriation does not vary with the degree of access the plaintiff has shown.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516041\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/1111/#p1124\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Defendants' argument that both songs lack pitch does not show dissimilarity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    MSJ at 14. Because both pieces are rap, they will lack pitch; in fact, that is why rhythm is so crucial to Feature B.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SAF \u00b6 224.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Indeed, because the tritones in each song begin and end on different pitches, the combination of Features A and C, and Features B and C do not help show substantial similarity.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Opp'n at 18. The fact that the hooks are played with tritones is irrelevant to show substantial similarity because hooks and tritones are basic elements of music.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SAF \u00b6 223;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Batiste\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318842\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/595/#p616\">\n     28 F.Supp.3d at 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Likewise, assuming Feature B exists and the rhythms are similar, using tritones-which begin and end on different pitches-to express a similar rhythm is not protectable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Defendants also move for summary judgment on Morrill's claims for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. MSJ at 24-25. They argue that these claims are \"secondary liability\" claims that require proof of underlying infringement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318842\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/595/#p616\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. v.

Morrill does not contest this point. Opp'n at 24. Because the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment on Morrill's underlying direct infringement claim, it does the same as to Morrill's secondary liability claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
