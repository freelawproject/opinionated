DAVILA, United States District Judge\n   On July 10, 2018, the Contra Costa County Sheriff announced his department would formally terminate its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") to house undocumented immigrants at the West County Detention Facility in Richmond, California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Though this decision was supported by community organizers and activists, \"the announcement was tempered by calls for detainees to be reunited with families rather than transferred to another facility.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This habeas corpus action involves one of the most serious complications facing detainees who were transferred to another facility rather than released as a result of the Sheriff's decision. The Petitioners\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   are ten non-citizens with removal proceedings pending before the Immigration Court in San Francisco who were formerly housed at the West County Detention Facility. They are each represented by pro bono counsel based in the San Francisco Bay Area in connection with those proceedings. On August 16th and August 17, 2018, ICE transferred Petitioners to facilities in Tacoma, Washington and Aurora, Colorado. Petitioners allege the transfers will essentially leave them unrepresented, violating their right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   ICE's decision to detain Petitioners in locations so far from their attorneys is troubling and its motivation for doing so is questionable, particularly since several Petitioners were scheduled to appear in immigration court two weeks after the transfers. This court, however, lacks jurisdiction to do anything other than comment on ICE's irresponsible transfer decisions. Because Petitioners' right-to-counsel claims arise from their removal proceedings, this action must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioners are non-citizens from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and the former Yugoslavia who were ordered detained subject to ongoing removal proceedings venued in San Francisco. These proceedings are each at a different stage, though at least one petitioner - Bonilla Maradiaga - appears subject to a final removal order on appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. Several petitioners are represented in their removal proceedings by the San Francisco Public Defenders Office, while others are represented by different organizations or counsel based out of the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between August 16th and August 17, 2018, Petitioners were transferred from the West County Detention Facility in Richmond, California - a city adjacent to San Francisco - to other detention facilities in Tacoma, Washington and Aurora, Colorado. According to their pleadings, Petitioners and their attorneys were given little if any advance notice of the transfers, and some petitioners had master calendar hearings scheduled in immigration court in late August, September and October.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Petitioners allege their current detention in locations states-away from San Francisco significantly impacts the relationships with their attorneys and their ability to prepare their cases. None of Petitioners' current attorneys can continue with representation if Petitioners' removal proceedings are transferred to immigration courts in Washington or Colorado. And since Petitioners are indigent, they are unable to retain private counsel. Furthermore, Petitioners contend \"[t]here is virtually no meaningful access to pro bono immigration counsel\" in Tacoma or Aurora.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Petitioners initiated this habeas corpus action against the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Acting Director of ICE, and the Acting ICE Field Office Director on August 24, 2018. Their petition asserts one claim for interference with and denial of access to counsel under the Fifth Amendment. Petitioners also filed a Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (\"TRO\"), on which the court ordered briefing and a hearing. Dkt. Nos. 3, 7. The Government filed a timely opposition to the TRO motion on August 29, 2018, and the court heard from the parties at a hearing on August 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Government argues in response to the TRO motion that the REAL ID Act of 2005's amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") strip this court of jurisdiction to review Petitioners' habeas challenge. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Habeas Jurisdiction in Immigration Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As Petitioners recognize in their jurisdictional allegations, the district court is generally vested with jurisdiction to grant a petition for writ of habeas corpus if a prisoner \"is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws treaties of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether the claim can present in a civil complaint, as in\n    <em>\n     J.E.F.M.\n    </em>\n    , or through habeas, as here, \u00a7 1252(a)(5) and \u00a7 1252(b)(9) by their plain terms still channel an \"arising from\" claim through the PFR process to the courts of appeals, bypassing the district court.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Singh\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655526\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/499/969/#p975\">\n     499 F.3d at 978\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that post-REAL ID Act cases considering the applicability of \u00a7 1252 in the habeas context \"have [ ] distinguished between challenges to orders of removal and challenges that arise independently\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nadarajah\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2655964\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/1069/\">\n     443 F.3d at 1076\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (holding that a habeas petition did not invoke \u00a7 1252(b)(9)'s jurisdiction-stripping provision because it involved a detention challenge apart from removal proceedings). Indeed, \u00a7 1252(b)(9) specifically precludes any court from reviewing\n    through habeas corpus any question of law or fact arising from removal proceedings, including right-to-counsel challenges.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     J.E.F.M.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12137377\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/837/1026/\">\n     837 F.3d at 1033\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Based on the foregoing discussion, the court concludes that Petitioners' Fifth Amendment claims arise from their removal proceedings, and must be raised through the PFR process to the court of appeals. Because this court lacks jurisdiction to consider their claims, in habeas or otherwise, Petitioners' action must be dismissed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     E. Final Comments\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The lack of jurisdiction over Petitioners' claims does not preclude the court from commenting on the incomplete and damaging process that ICE employed to transfer Petitioners. ICE's policy on detainee transfers requires it employ a \"thorough and systematic review of the most current information available\" when undertaking a transfer determination.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    If this review reveals documentation to support the presence of immediate family in the area of responsibility; an attorney of record in the area of responsibility; pending or on-going removal proceedings, where notification has been given within the area of responsibility; or a granted bond or scheduled bond hearing, ICE \"\n    <em>\n     will not transfer a detainee.\n    </em>\n    \" Every Petitioner in this case was represented by an attorney within the San Francisco area of responsibility, but every Petitioner was inexplicably transferred out of state, contrary to the policy. Thus, though ICE's policy may have admirable goals as written, it has no purpose if it is so easily disregarded. ICE offered no response in this action to its flagrant failure to comply with its own directives other than to say it conducted a review of other issues, and its silence is deafening.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    To make matters worse, it was revealed at the hearing that some of Petitioners' cases were already transferred to immigration courts in other states. The speed at which this occurred - again without regard for the presence of counsel in San Francisco - is troubling. As a matter of optics, a policy which condones the movement of detained, represented immigrants without notice to their counsel, and leads to the immediate transfers their cases out of the area, does little to inspire public confidence in the executive's ability to fairly and responsibly adjudicate immigration cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    As the court understands the circumstances, there was still approximately two months remaining before ICE's contract with Contra Costa County finally terminated. Yet, represented immigrants like Petitioners with hearings scheduled for the same week, and indeed same day, as the TRO hearing were transferred to Washington and Colorado. Other than a lack of \"bed space,\" which quantum is apparently constantly in flux, no justification was given for the timing of Petitioners' transfers. And it is similarly unclear why Petitioners could not have remained at the West County Detention Facility, or another local facility with which the government contracts, until their hearings were completed. While the court understands it was not ICE's decision to terminate its contract, it seems no creative solution outside of an out-of-state transfer was seriously contemplated. But sometimes the easiest solution is not the best one.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In sum, this order should not interpreted as a judicial approval of ICE's decision to transfer Petitioners. While the court's application of the law compels it to dismiss\n    this case, the law does not compel it to countenance an agency's action that is contrary to the norms of this country's justice system.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    <strong>\n     III. ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    This action is DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE for lack of jurisdiction. All other matters are TERMINATED, and the Clerk shall close this file.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     IT IS SO ORDERED.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"4\">\n    <p id=\"p-61\">\n     At the hearing, counsel for Petitioners suggested the panel opinion in\n     <em>\n      J.E.F.M.\n     </em>\n     was subject to en banc consideration.
