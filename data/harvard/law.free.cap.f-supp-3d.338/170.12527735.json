(collectively, the \"Brokerage Defendants\") and Defendants Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, and Cede &amp; Co. (collectively, the \"DTC Defendants\"). The Court has jurisdiction of this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On November 14, 2017, TD Ameritrade Inc., TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., and Scottrade filed motions to dismiss to dismiss the Complaint (docket entry no. 1, Compl.) or, in the alternative, to compel arbitration. (Docket entry nos. 23, 31.) That same day, the DTC Defendants also filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint. (Docket entry no. 27.) On August 15, 2018, Magistrate Judge Moses issued a Report and Recommendation proposing that the Brokerage Defendants' motions to compel arbitration and the DTC Defendants' motion to dismiss be granted, and that the case be stayed as against the Brokerage Defendants and dismissed with prejudice as against the DTC Defendants. (Docket entry no. 59, the \"Report.\") Harris filed an Objection to the Report on August 30, 2018. (Docket entry no. 61, the \"Objection.\") Defendants filed their responses to the Objection, without making any objections of their own. (Docket entry nos. 63, 64, 65.) The Court has reviewed thoroughly all of these submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   When reviewing a Report and Recommendation, the Court \"may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) (LexisNexis 2017). The Court must make a\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   determination\n   to the extent that a party makes specific objections to a magistrate's findings.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Male Juvenile\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285057\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/34/#p38\">\n    121 F.3d 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38 (2d Cir. 1997). To the extent, however, that the party makes only conclusory or general objections, or simply reiterates the original arguments, the Court will review the Report strictly for clear error.\n   <em>\n    Pearson-Fraser v. Bell Atl.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2043367\">\n    2003 WL 43367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Harris objects primarily to the Report's failure to consider Harris' \"claim to be a shareholder of record,\" which Harris contends is a \"viable federal claim protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\" and \"based on her liberty and property interests found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .15c3-3\" (\"SEC Rule 15c3-3\"). (Objection at 4-5.) Harris argues that this Court should not adopt the Report and its recommended conclusion because the Report does not \"correctly identify[ ] the source and nature of the property and liberty interests Harris seeks to vindicate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) To the extent that this objection raises an argument that was previously raised in opposition to Defendants' motions to compel arbitration and dismiss the Complaint, the Court finds that there is no clear error in Judge Moses' conclusion that both of Harris' claims in this action are premised on state law causes of action. The Complaint does not on its face present a constitutional due process claim, nor does it invoke SEC Rule 15c3-3. To the extent that this objection raises a new legal argument for the first time, the Court finds that Harris has not presented a \"compelling justification for failure to present such [arguments] to the magistrate judge\" and the Court declines to consider it at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berbick v. Precinct 42\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4171721\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/977/268/#p274\">\n    977 F.Supp.2d 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). The Court notes that, even if it were to consider Harris' constitutional due process argument, that argument would be unpersuasive for substantially the reasons identified by the DTC Defendants in their response to Harris' Objection. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket entry no. 65 at 6-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Harris next objects to the Report's conclusion that arbitration with the Brokerage Defendants should be compelled. Specifically, Harris argues that her constitutional due process claim is outside the scope of her arbitration agreements with the Brokerage Defendants, and that FINRA's dismissal of previous claims against the Brokerage Defendants as \"not eligible for arbitration\" renders the arbitral forum unavailable for the adjudication of her constitutional due process claim. Harris' interpretation of FINRA's dismissal decision ignores the fact that FINRA's dismissal of her re-filed claims was prompted by the Brokerage Defendants' request that FINRA's Director of Arbitration decline to permit the use of the FINRA arbitration forum because the \"subject matter and relief sought\" by the re-filed claims \"are identical to that pursued\" by Harris in earlier FINRA arbitrations. (Docket entry no. 47, Second Page Decl. Ex. F.) Because this objection relies, in part, on Harris' improper constitutional due process argument, and because nothing in the language of Harris' arbitration agreements or FINRA's dismissal decision suggests that Harris' constitutional due process claim cannot be arbitrated, this objection is overruled\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, Harris objects to the Report's conclusion that she has failed to state a claim for trespass.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying once again on her contention that the Complaint asserts a constitutional due process claim, Harris\n   argues that the Report \"erroneously defined Harris's property by state commercial law instead of federal law,\" specifically, SEC Rule 15c3-3. (Objection at 37.) To the extent that Harris' objection is premised on a federal law property right not previously alleged in her Complaint or advanced in connection with the DTC Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court declines to entertain Harris' argument at this late stage. To the extent that some version of this argument was presented in opposition to the DTC Defendants' motion to dismiss, the Court has reviewed Judge Moses' analysis of Harris' trespass claim\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   and for clear error, and finds no basis to sustain Harris' objection. Regardless of the source of Harris' alleged property rights, as explained in the Report, Harris has failed to state a claim for trespass to chattels under New York law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report at 29-30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court has considered Harris' remaining objections and finds them to be without merit. Accordingly, and for substantially the reasons set forth in Judge Moses' thorough and well-reasoned Report, the Court overrules Harris' Objection in its entirety and adopts Judge Moses' Report and its recommended conclusions. Accordingly, the Brokerage Defendants' motions to compel arbitration and the DTC Defendants' motion to dismiss the Complaint are granted, and the case is hereby stayed and placed on the suspense calendar as to the Brokerage Defendants (TD Ameritrade Inc., TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., and Scottrade Inc.) and dismissed with prejudice as to the DTC Defendants (Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, Depository Trust Company, and Cede &amp; Co.). This case is hereby stayed pending the arbitration of Harris' claims against the Brokerage Defendants. The parties are directed to file a joint status report by April 5, 2019 and each January 5 and April 5 thereafter, stating whether this case should remain stayed, be restated to the active calendar, or be dismissed. This Memorandum Order resolves docket entry nos. 23, 27, 31 and 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff Jan Harris is the owner of 2,420,000 shares of penny stock issued by Bancorp International Group, Inc. (\"Bancorp\") and held in street name in her accounts at TD Ameritrade Inc. (together with TD Ameritrade Clearing, Inc., \"TDA\") and Scottrade Inc. (\"Scottrade\"). Since late 2009, plaintiff has sought to register the shares in her own name and obtain physical stock certificates evidencing her title. TDA and Scottrade (collectively the \"Brokerage Defendants\") have consistently demurred, explaining that Bancorp's stock is subject to a \"global lock,\" imposed by the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\") in 2005, which prevents them from transferring the record ownership of her shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beginning in 2010, plaintiff brought a series of arbitration claims against the Brokerage Defendants before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"), seeking physical stock certificates for her Bancorp shares. She lost on the merits against Scottrade in 2011, and against TDA in 2014. She then refiled substantially the same claims, against the same firms, but FINRA summarily dismissed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2016, plaintiff brought suit in a Nevada state court against DTC, its parent Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"), and its nominee Cede &amp; Co. (\"Cede\") (collectively the \"DTC Defendants\"), seeking, among other things, declaratory and injunctive relief confirming her entitlement to physical stock certificates,\n   issued by Bancorp, in her name. In January 2017, the trial court dismissed her claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and as time-barred, and in February 2018 the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed on jurisdictional grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In this action, filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   on August 9, 2017, plaintiff seeks equitable relief and damages against the Brokerage Defendants and the DTC Defendants, once again asserting that she is entitled to physical stock certificates reflecting her Bancorp shares. Count I alleges that each defendant is obligated to provide \"an accounting ... with regard to the legal title to 2,420,000 shares of Bancorp which Harris is entitled to exclusive possession of.\" Compl. (Dkt. 1) \u00b6 30. Count II alleges that by interfering with her \"right to immediate and exclusive possession\" of those shares, each defendant has committed and is committing \"an ongoing trespass,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36, entitling her to a mandatory injunction and unspecified damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Now before me for report and recommendation are (1) the Brokerage Defendants' motions to dismiss plaintiffs' claims against them pursuant to Fed.

No. 33), Ex. 3, \u00b6 21. The Scottrade agreement goes on to state that arbitration \"is final and binding on the parties,\" who are \"are waiving their right to seek remedies in court,\" and that the arbitrator's award \"is not required to include factual findings or legal reasoning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%203633868\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similarly, plaintiff's TDA customer agreement provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   All controversies concerning (a) any transaction, (b) the construction, performance, or breach of this or any other agreement, whether entered into prior to, on, or after the date of the Agreement, or (c) any other matter which may arise between [TD] Ameritrade or its representatives and me [Harris] shall be determined by arbitration in accordance with the rules of [FINRA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Page Decl.

Ex. A, at ECF page 3. On September 20, 2011, the arbitrator issued an award (the 2011 Award) denying Harris's claim on the merits. Scottrade Mem. Ex. B, at 1. The arbitrator explained that Scottrade \"is not willfully refusing to deliver the shares. It cannot deliver the BCIT shares because of the actions of a third party, the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation [DTCC], which placed a 'global lock' on BCIT, shares on August 16, 2005. The global lock means that the subject shares are not eligible for delivery, transfer, or withdrawal by any person or entity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator also noted that under Harris's agreement with Scottrade, the firm \"will not be liable for any loss caused directly or indirectly by suspension of trading of a stock such as that of BCIT.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It does not\n   appear that Harris ever sought to vacate or modify the 2011 Award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In 2011, Harris filed a similar FINRA arbitration claim against TDA.

She lost, on the merits, against Scottrade in 2011 and against TDA in 2014. On this record, it is clear that FINRA's refusal to give her a do-over had nothing to do with the scope of her arbitration agreement or the power of a FINRA arbitrator to decide her rewarmed claims. To the contrary: those claims were dismissed under Rule 12203(a) because they had already been decided. Regardless of the language used in FINRA's decision, this too was a merits determination, bottomed on \"the preclusive effect of a prior, related arbitration between the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins.
