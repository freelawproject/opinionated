(Doc. 15). Mr. Harrison contends that his prior Alabama state court conviction for being a prohibited person in possession of the same firearm at the same time and place bars his prosecution in this case pursuant to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The court WILL DENY Mr. Harrison's motion because, under the \"dual-sovereignty\" doctrine, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit successive prosecutions by a state government and the federal government of the same person for the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Harrison faces two prosecutions for being a felon in possession of a firearm on or about September 2, 2017. Mr. Harrison first pled guilty in the District Court of Jefferson County, Alabama on October 11, 2017 to being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm in violation of Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-11-72(a). (Doc. 15 at 10). Then on April 26, 2018, a federal grand jury returned a one-count indictment charging Mr. Harrison with being a prohibited person in possession of the same firearm on the same date in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). (Doc. 1). The possession of the firearm at issue in the Alabama state prosecution forms the basis of this federal prosecution. For this reason, Mr. Harrison contends that this federal prosecution subjects him to double jeopardy in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and moves the court to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

V. But as the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, \"under what is known as the dual-sovereignty doctrine, a single act gives rise to distinct offenses-and thus may subject a person to successive prosecutions-if it violates the laws of separate sovereigns.\"\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico v.

Mr. Harrison now faces punishment from the federal government for the exact same conduct. If Mr. Harrison is convicted of the federal charge against him, he will indisputably be punished twice for the same conduct. This dual-punishment may entirely fail to serve the Double Jeopardy Clause's objective \"to shield individuals from the harassment of multiple prosecutions for the same misconduct\" and be an \"affront to human dignity ... inconsistent with the spirit of [our] Bill of Rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172942\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1863/#p1867\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The court understands the well-settled theory underlying the dual-sovereignty rule: an \"offence\" is a crime as defined by a \"sovereign\"; the states and the federal government are separate \"sovereigns\"; therefore, a single act violating both a\n   federal law and a state law constitutes two distinct \"offences.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198785\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/82/#p88\">\n    474 U.S. at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6198785\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/474/82/#p88\">\n    106 S.Ct. 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bartkus\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 131,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163001\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/121/#p132\">\n    79 S.Ct. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lanza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926061\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/377/#p382\">\n    260 U.S. at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926061\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/260/377/#p382\">\n    43 S.Ct. 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If an \"offence\" is a transgression against a \"sovereign,\" a person commits an \"offence\" against \"the whole people\"; but if two authorities prosecute a person for the same\n   conduct giving rise to the transgression, the person is \"subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Moreover, under basic principles of federalism, \"we consider the State governments and the national governments, as they truly are, in the light of kindred systems .... [T]he national and State systems are to be regarded as ONE WHOLE,\" similar to the principle that sovereignty derives from the whole people.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Federalist No. 82 (Alexander Hamilton). Subjecting a person to two prosecutions for one act because two parts of a whole define the same conduct as a crime disregards these principles altogether.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Justice Hugo Black identified even more issues with the Supreme Court's ideas of sovereignty in his dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Abbate.\n   </em>\n   In that case, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the dual-sovereignty doctrine and held that a criminal defendant's prior state conviction for conspiracy did not bar a subsequent federal prosecution for the same conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 196,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Justice Black, with whom Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William Douglas joined, wrote a dissenting opinion because he was \"not convinced that a State and the Nation can be considered two wholly separate sovereignties for the purpose of allowing them to do together what, generally, neither can do separately.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 203 &amp; n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Black, J., dissenting) (noting that, as of 1959, almost all state constitutions had provisions similar to the Double Jeopardy Clause). This dilemma that Justice Black identified could be resolved by removing dual-sovereignty from the Supreme Court's idea of \"offence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In addition, and for good reason, Justice Black believed that the framers may have intended to prevent the dual-sovereignty doctrine from creeping into our jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 203-04,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Black, J., dissenting). Justice Black traced the history of the Double Jeopardy Clause back to 1789 when \"a proposed amendment to the Double Jeopardy Clause was rejected in our First Congress while the Bill of Rights was being considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 203,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Black, J., dissenting). If the amendment had passed, the Double Jeopardy Clause would have read, \" '[n]o person shall be subject, except in cases of impeachment, to more than one punishment or one trial for the same offence\n   <em>\n    by any law of the United States.\n   </em>\n   ' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 204 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting 1 Annals of Cong., 753 (1789) ). The amendment would have permitted successive prosecutions by a state government and the United States government, because the state crime is, of course, not an offence against \"any law of the United States.\" So, Justice Black believed that by rejecting the amendment Congress also rejected the dual-sovereignty doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    at 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court agrees that, just as Justice Black \"fear[ed]\" in his dissenting opinion, the Supreme Court has \"firmly established as the constitutional rule\" a doctrine that \"Congress refused to accept.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Aside from the Supreme Court's ideas of sovereignty, the Supreme Court has relied on public policy and practical concerns in upholding the dual-sovereignty doctrine, but other public policy and practical concerns weigh much more heavily\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   the dual-sovereignty doctrine. In\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Bartkus\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court emphasized that not allowing successive prosecutions by a state and the federal government would undermine each government's authority to define and punish crimes against it, especially in cases where the two authorities would impose drastically different sentences for the same conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bartkus\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 136-37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163001\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/121/#p132\">\n    79 S.Ct. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   But this court is more concerned with how the dual-sovereignty doctrine permits \"a man to be punished twice for the same offense, once by a State and once by the United States,\" which is practically the same \"as it would be for one of these two Governments to throw him in prison twice for the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbate\n   </em>\n   , 359 U.S. at 203,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n    79 S.Ct. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Black, J., dissenting). The court questions why one scenario is constitutional and the other is not when both produce identical results of double punishment, which may fairly be characterized as \"an affront to human dignity\" and \"dangerous to human freedom.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6163189\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/359/187/#p195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Even ignoring the issue of what sovereignty means, the Double Jeopardy Clause uses the word \"offence,\" not \"sovereign.\" The Supreme Court wrote \"sovereign\"-and the term's common-law baggage-into the definition of \"offence,\" but the plain meaning of \"offence\" does not require the concept of sovereignty. For example, as Justice Ginsburg implied, \"offence\" could plainly mean \"misconduct\" or acts punishable by a state or the federal government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanchez Valle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172942\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1863/#p1867\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ginsburg, J., concurring). If the framers intended the more plain definition of \"offence,\" such as misconduct, then the dual-sovereignty doctrine would have no place under the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Supreme Court will in its October 2018 term have the opportunity to address these issues when it decides \"whether the Court should overrule the 'separate sovereigns' exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause\" in\n   <em>\n    Gamble v.

There, as in this case, the criminal defendant could be prosecuted by the federal government for the same incident that formed the basis of a prior state court conviction.
