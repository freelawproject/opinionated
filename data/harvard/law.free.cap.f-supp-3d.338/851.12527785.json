Initially, in his motion, Mr. Gerba claims that 23 documents - emails numbered 1-8, 10-13, 20-21, 35-41, 47, and 49 in the Museum's privilege log - are being improperly withheld. [Dkt. # 51, at 2]. But he only raises and develops arguments as to documents nos. 3-8, 10-11, 20-21, 35-36, 38-39, 41, 47, and 49 in his brief. [Dkt. # 51, at 5, 6]. So, any arguments he might have made as to documents nos. 1-2, 12-13, 37, and 40, would be deemed waived, and those documents need not be produced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crespo v.

But, as establishing the privilege as to those documents is, after all, the Museum's burden,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, it will not be revisited in depth here, except to briefly recount about the subject matter of most of these emails, a purported stalking incident involving Mr. Gerba. The Museum fired Mr. Gerba in March of 2017. [Dkt. # 31, \u00b6. 34]. Thereafter, on June 19, 2018, the Museum's education and public programs manager, Dimitra Georgouses, went to Cook County Circuit Court and sought an order of protection against Mr. Gerba. [Dkt. # 31, \u00b6. 36]. She alleged that after her boyfriend dropped her off at work on June 17, 2018, Mr. Gerba followed him for 18 miles. She claimed he emailed her and told her he was sending her a present, which he did. He would only have gotten her address from her employment file. She further alleged that he inappropriately\n   texted and emailed her, trying to find ways to see her. [Dkt. # 31-3, at 5-7]. The judge didn't dismiss the case, but because he did not feel there was an emergency alleged he did not issue an Order. [Dkt. # 31-3, at 8-9]. Ms. Georgouses' claim came to nothing, however, as she failed to appear for her hearing, and her petition was therefore dismissed. [Dkt. # 31-4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In October of 2017, Mr. Gerba filed suit against the Museum, charging that his firing was a result of his complaints about, and refusal to go along with, some alleged financial legerdemain. He brought a claim under the Illinois Whistleblower Act, as well as claims for retaliatory discharge and defamation. That Complaint didn't survive the Museum's motion to dismiss: Mr. Gerba conceded he had no claim under the Illinois Whistleblower Act, because he never disclosed any information to the government. Judge Dow dismissed his other two claims, finding his allegations didn't support claims for defamation or retaliatory discharge. [Dkt. # 30]. Mr. Gerba tried again with his claims for retaliatory discharge and defamation on July 17, 2018, filing a First Amended Complaint. It has quickly become the target of another motion to dismiss from the Museum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As is too often the case, discovery has become contentious, especially regarding the claims of privilege. Mr. Gerba filed the first Motion to Compel on this topic in May, but it appeared that the parties hadn't fully complied with Local Rule 37.2, and thus Judge Dow had them meet and confer in an effort to reach a compromise. The Museum then amended its privilege log. That didn't do the trick, and the parties continued to dispute the applicability of the privilege, with Mr. Gerba filing his current Motion to Compel on September 26\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, the basics.

It is intended to \"encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Upjohn Co. v.

Yet the privilege is \"in derogation of the search for the truth\" and so it must be strictly confined and applied only where necessary to achieve its purpose.\n   <em>\n    Hamdan v. Indiana University Health North Hospital, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264567\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/416/#p421\">\n    880 F.3d 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 421 (7th Cir. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In practice, it has become a discovery bargaining chip, with one side often making sweeping, blanket claims of privilege, while the other claims entitlement to almost everything that party has. The two sides bargain and get as far as they can - as Local Rule 37.2 requires them to do - and then leave the final call to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   That can be a risky move. Discovery rulings are committed to the court's very broad discretion.\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Chuhak &amp; Tecson, P.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070597\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/772/#p784\">\n    725 F.3d 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784 (7th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That can mean that even if one side is \"right,\" the court can still be \"right\" if it rules against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago Reg'l Council of Carpenters Pension Fund v.

Indeed, in matters of discretion, \"it is possible for two judges, confronted with the identical record, to come to opposite conclusions and for the appellate court to affirm both.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The parties here have been unable to resolve all of their disputes have left the matter for the court's resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   There are certain points that are important here. The first is that the Museum has submitted a privilege log - amended - and under Fed.R.Civ.P 26(b)(5), that log has to describe the nature of the documents being withheld in a manner that will allow the reader to assess the validity of the claim of privilege. Given Mr. Gerba's arguments about the log, some additional points are also important. First, the mere fact that non-attorneys might be involved in a communication or might be the only ones involved does not necessarily mean their communication isn't privileged - although it often is not, of course. Communications between the client and the clients's representative or between the client's representatives can be privileged if they reflect the lawyer's thinking or are made for the purpose of eliciting the lawyer's professional advice or other legal assistance.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leonard-Allen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670321,4083748\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/948/\">\n    739 F.3d 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953 (7th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    BDO Seidman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3506696\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/492/806/#p815\">\n    492 F.3d at 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, just because an attorney happens to be a board member of the Museum doesn't mean the Museum can't consult him or her for legal advice. As such, communications made for that purpose are privileged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandra T.E. v. S. Berwyn Sch. Dist. 100\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223307\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/612/#p618\">\n    600 F.3d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 618 (7th Cir. 2010) (question is whether legal advisor was acting in his capacity as legal advisor);\n   <em>\n    Matter of Grand Jury Proceeding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412401\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/68/193/#p196\">\n    68 F.3d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (7th Cir. 1995) (\"A client does not lose the privilege merely because his attorney serves a dual role.\"). Mr. Gerba's complaints in this regard are understandable for, as the judge in Ms. Georgouses' case said, the Museum appears to be \"filled with lawyers ....\" [Dkt. # 31-3, at 5]. But, nevertheless, the privilege protects communications where board members or family members or friends of the Museum are wearing their legal counselor hats. Again, in the end, the question isn't whether an attorney is someone's cousin, it's whether the communication was made in confidence, in the connection with the provision of legal services, to an attorney,\n   and in the context of an attorney-client relationship.\n   <em>\n    Shaffer v. American Medical Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851796\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/439/#p446\">\n    662 F.3d 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 446 (7th Cir. 2011) ;\n   <em>\n    Sandra T.E.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223307\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/612/#p618\">\n    600 F.3d at 618\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With that in mind, review of the Museum's privilege log leads to the following conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Emails 1-4\n   </strong>\n   - These emails are communications from the President of the Museum to the Museum's human resources director and the Museum board member and attorney whom the Museum also consults for legal advice and members of his firm.

The matter discussed is a purported incident of stalking by Mr. Gerba. That's certainly a topic that would inspire a consultation with an attorney and these documents consequently are privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Email 5\n   </strong>\n   - communication from Museum president to HR director said to be \"forwarding/summarizing information conveyed to attorney for purpose of obtaining legal advice.\" Again, this is related to the stalking incident. The fact that the two individuals are non-attorneys does not mean the privilege cannot apply, as Mr. Gerba suggests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roth v.

Email 21 is from one of the Calamos Family Partners attorneys to the Museum board member/attorney and other Calamos Family Partners attorneys. The topic of the emails is \"Gerba Separation Agreement.\" All we are told by way of affidavit from the Museum president, Ms. Calamos, is that Calamos Family Partners \"have, at times, provided the time of their legal and financial personnel to the Museum ....\" [Dkt. # 55-1]. \"At times,\" however, does not mean this time and Ms. Calamos's affidavit allows for the individuals from\n   Calamos Family Partners to have been wearing \"financial hats\" in these communications. Contract review can be legal or financial or both. Indeed, the Museum claims in its brief - an unsupported assertion that, unlike a sworn statement in an affidavit, is not evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

The subject of email 36, however, is \"legal advice on the maintenance of Museum security\" following the stalking incident.

As with most of the emails in the log, the subject is the purported stalking incident and, again, this is a natural topic for seeking legal advice and the document is privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    Email 47\n   </strong>\n   - This email is from the Museum's HR director to the board member/attorney and the Museum's president and, again, the topic is alleged stalking by Mr. Gerba. As with the other emails of this nature, the document is privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    Email 49\n   </strong>\n   - This is email from the Museum's HR director to the Museum's president regarding a litigation hold and legal advice at the time of the purported stalking incident. Again, given the participants and the subject matter, the document is privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Mr. Gerba's motion to compel [Dkt. # 51] is denied in part and granted in part insofar as the Museum is ordered to produce emails nos. 20, 21 36, 37, 38, 39, and 40 immediately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiff has also filed a Motion to Extend, by seven days, the deadline for filing his Reply Brief in the dispute over the Museum's claims of attorney-client privilege as to certain emails. The motion claims that the plaintiff's Reply Brief was due on October 15th -- the very day plaintiff filed his motion for an extension of time -- under Local Rule 47.1(b). That rule, however, has nothing to do with Reply Briefs and instead refers to circumstances dictating the summoning of separate jury panels. The court had not set any briefing schedule and, in point of fact, had not contemplated the need for any reply brief as the matter merely requires review of the disputed entries in the defendant's privilege log and consultation of applicable case law, which the court has already completed. Notably, the plaintiff noticed his motion for presentment on October 18th, three days after he thought his reply brief was due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moreover, had the plaintiff had an October 15th deadline for a Reply Brief, he would have had to show good cause to gain an extension of time, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1), and he has not attempted to do so. Accordingly the plaintiff's motion [Dkt. # 58] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    <em>\n     The cases are not semantically consistent in invoking a standard for review in cases involving the attorney-client privilege.
