The Kelly's Defendants and Plaintiffs West American Insurance Company and Peerless Indemnity Insurance Company (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") dispute whether several insurance policies require Plaintiffs to indemnify and cover defense costs in two state court actions. These underlying actions involve former employees who allege the Kelly's Defendants violated the City of Albuquerque Minimum Wage Ordinance (\"MWO\"). The Kelly's Defendants urge the Court to decline to exercise its jurisdiction here because facts relevant to the scope of insurance coverage have yet to be developed in the pending state court case. But Plaintiffs are not parties to the pending state case, and the issue of insurance coverage has not been addressed in that case. Having considered counsel's submissions and the five\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factors laid out by the Tenth Circuit to determine\n   when a federal court should exercise its jurisdiction in claims for declaratory relief, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April 2016, former employees of Kelly's Brew Pub sued the Kelly's Defendants in state court, alleging that the defendants had been violating the MWO by withholding servers' earned tip money, not paying servers the tipped minimum wage, and failing to keep required payroll records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 1 (Plaintiffs' Complaint) \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39-45.) That case-\n   <em>\n    Atyani v. Bonfantine\n   </em>\n   -is currently pending in the Second Judicial District Court, Bernalillo County, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D-202-CV-2016-02775. In February 2017, a different former employee filed a similar suit against the Kelly's Defendants alleging similar violations of the MWO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frank v. Bonfantine\n   </em>\n   , D-202-CV-2017-00852.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.) The policies cover bodily injury and property damage if the injury or damage \"is caused by an 'occurrence' that takes place in the 'coverage territory.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) The policies specifically exclude bodily injury and property damage that is \"expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The policies define an \"occurrence\" as an \"accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Property damage\" is defined as \"[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property\" or \"[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Kelly's Defendants sought defense costs and indemnity under these policies to resolve the claims against them in\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atyani.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51; Doc. 13-1, Ex.

Whether a court's analysis of these factors should focus on just the controversy between the federal parties or consider additional parties to the state suit depends on the particular facts of each case, but it may be \"[e]specially relevant ... whether the state court action would necessarily resolve the issues in the declaratory judgment action.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901177\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/977/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, though the Kelly's Defendants claim the fact development in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   will bear directly on the scope of their liability coverage, a resolution of the claims in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   alone will not and cannot resolve the present coverage dispute because Plaintiffs are not parties to the state case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 26-1, Ex. A.) Further, the scope and extent of coverage is not addressed nor pleaded in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   , (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901177\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/977/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), so a second proceeding in either state or federal court would be necessary to determine liability coverage even if\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   resolves\n   some relevant issues of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530383\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/979/#p983\">\n    31 F.3d at 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that jurisdiction was proper in part because both parties \"concede that a suit like this one would have been required at some point in some case other than the state tort action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A judgment here would immediately clarify the legal relations between Plaintiffs and the Kelly's Defendants and resolve their liability coverage dispute, a dispute that will not be addressed at all in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the fact that the state court action will not resolve the coverage controversy means the first two\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factors weigh strongly in favor of exercising jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Third\n    <em>\n     Mhoon\n    </em>\n    Factor: Procedural Fencing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The third\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factor asks whether the party seeking declaratory relief has done so with an improper purpose or to \"race to res judicata.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530383\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/979/#p983\">\n    31 F.3d at 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This factor weighs against exercising declaratory relief when the timing of the federal claim suggests that its main purpose is to delay the state court action or receive a favorable judgment on an issue before the state court has a chance to fully develop the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

But the order and timing of filing alone is not enough to show procedural fencing-some allegation of improper use of timing or procedure to manipulate the courts is required. In\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   itself, for example, the plaintiff did not bring its claim for federal declaratory relief until the underlying state tort case was \"quite far along,\" yet the court did not find a procedural fencing issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530383\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/979/#p983\">\n    31 F.3d at 982, 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no evidence that Plaintiffs are using the federal claim to avoid a negative outcome in the state case, and a general assertion that Plaintiffs are trying to avoid further fact development does not rise to the level of procedural fencing. The third factor leans in favor of exercising jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth and Fifth\n    <em>\n     Mhoon\n    </em>\n    Factors: Friction between State and Federal Courts, Encroaching on State Courts' Domain, and More Effective Alternative Remedies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The final\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factors are concerned with whether a declaratory judgment in federal court would prevent the state court from determining the same issue or lead to friction between two conflicting resolutions of the same dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brillhart v.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15 at 4-5.) However, the defendants fail to note that there are\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   policy defenses that may allow the Court to determine whether the alleged actions underlying the complaint are excluded from coverage as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that the alleged MWO violations, in addition to potentially falling under various coverage exclusions, \"do not arise out of an 'occurrence' causing either 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' as required under the Policies in order to afford coverage.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 19 at 4.) Even if some of the facts regarding alleged MWO violations in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   overlap with the determination of policy coverage, it is extremely unlikely that the Court's interpretation of contractual terms in the liability policies-terms such as \"occurrence\" and \"personal property\"-will cause friction with the state court or prevent it from determining whether the defendants violated the city ordinance.

However, though the defendants have now brought a counterclaim against Plaintiffs in this action for breach of contract, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 50), the fact remains that insurance coverage is not in dispute in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   and Plaintiffs are not parties to that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, the Kelly's Defendants assert that New Mexico law bars fact-based determinations of insurance coverage in federal declaratory judgment actions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 15 at 5.) The defendants rely on language in\n   <em>\n    Lopez v. New Mexico Public Schools Insurance Authority\n   </em>\n   to argue that fact-dependent coverage disputes may only be resolved in the underlying state action, but a closer look reveals that this is true only when \"the alleged facts tend to show an occurrence within the coverage.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552540\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/207/\">\n    117 N.M. 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1552540\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/117/207/\">\n    870 P.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 748 (N.M. 1994) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Found.

Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , the court held that the underlying state action was better suited to determine whether an ambiguous injury claim resulted from covered negligence or excluded intentional abuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11597406\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/36/1308/#p1312\">\n    36 F.Supp.2d 1308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1312 (D.N.M. 1999). However, the court noted that in such cases the complaint must actually \"state facts that suggest the case falls within the\n   policy's coverage; abstract and completely unsubstantiated allegations will not do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11597406\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/36/1308/#p1312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530383\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/979/#p983\">\n    31 F.3d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In short, there is no rigid requirement that all coverage disputes that turn on disputed facts must be determined in an underlying state court action, and this is particularly true when coverage issues are not even addressed in the underlying action. The claims and defenses in\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   never explicitly or implicitly address the Kelly's Defendants' insurance coverage, nor describe the alleged MWO violations in terms that would clearly suggest or tend to show property damage falling under Plaintiffs' policies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 50-1, Ex. A.) Thus, federal declaratory relief is the most efficient and logical way to settle the present coverage dispute and will not conflict with any subsequent fact development in the underlying\n   <em>\n    Atyani\n   </em>\n   case. Each of the\n   <em>\n    Mhoon\n   </em>\n   factors weighs in favor of this Court exercising its jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    THEREFORE\n   </strong>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendants Dennis Bonfantine, Janice Bonfantine, D.B.
