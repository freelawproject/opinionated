Doc. 1. Pfizer moves to dismiss Woodhams's claims for lack of personal jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2), to dismiss Al Haj's claims under Rule 12(b)(6), and to strike the complaint's class claims under Rule 12(f). Docs. 15, 17, 20.

The answer would be obvious to any reasonably competent carnival game operator: Pfizer fixes the recommended adult dose of Maximum Strength Robitussin at\n   <em>\n    20 ml\n   </em>\n   , double the recommended adult dose of Regular Strength Robitussin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. This results in the recommended adult dose of Maximum Strength Robitussin having the same amount of DXM Hbr (20 mg) and twice as much guaifenesin (400 mg) as does the recommended adult dose of Regular Strength Robitussin.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The rub is that Maximum Strength Robitussin contains only 5.9 doses per four-ounce bottle, while Regular Strength Robitussin contains double that-11.8 doses per four-ounce bottle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31.

Using the prices alleged in the complaint,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34, a purchaser of Maximum Strength Robitussin is charged approximately twenty percent more per mg of guaifenesin, and more than\n   <em>\n    twice\n   </em>\n   as much per mg of DXM Hbr, than is a purchaser of Regular Strength Robitussin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To differentiate the two products, the Maximum Strength Robitussin package contains a large red bar within which the phrase \"Maximum Strength\" is printed in white letters, and it places the word \"MAX\" in red letters underneath the letters \"DM.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The complaint contains three counts, each brought on behalf of Plaintiffs individually and a putative nationwide class of \"[a]ll persons that paid for Maximum Strength RobitussinCough +Chest Congestion DM for personal, family or household uses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.

Because the complaint plausibly alleges that designating the product as \"Maximum Strength\" Robitussin was misleading, the ICFA's safe harbor provision does not shield Pfizer from liability, at least at this stage of the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In sum, Al Haj's ICFA claim survives dismissal.

Pfizer is correct that the Seventh Circuit has cautioned against certifying nationwide classes in consumer fraud cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aqua Dots Prods. Liab.

But those cases were decided on Rule 23(f) appeals from orders, made on a developed record, certifying or refusing to certify a class; here, by contrast, the case is at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   True enough, Rule 23(c)(1)(A) provides that the court may reject a plaintiff's attempt to represent a class as soon as it becomes obvious that he will be unable to satisfy Rule 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.
