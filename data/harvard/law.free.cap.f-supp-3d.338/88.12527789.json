The plaintiffs brought claims of breach of contract (Count One), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count Two), and unfair and deceptive practices in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Insurance Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 38a-816 et seq.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts, which are taken from the parties' Local Rule 56(a) Statements and the exhibits, are undisputed unless otherwise indicated. \"Plaintiffs Kenneth and Cheryl Courteau have lived at 98 Winwood Circle, Somers, Connecticut (\"the Property\") continuously since 2006.\" (ECF No. 33, Defendant's Local Rule 56(a)1 Statement (\"Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt.\") at \u00b6 1; ECF No. 36-1, Plaintiffs' Local Rule 56(a)2 Statement (\"Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt.\") at \u00b6 1.) The defendant \"insured the Property under separate policies of insurance, each with one year terms, beginning on October 1, 2006 and continuing until October 1, 2016.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 2; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 2.) During the plaintiffs' tenure in the Property, \"Plaintiff Kenneth Courteau had seen all along what he characterized as normal wear and tear cracks in the house concrete.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 3; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 3.) \"In or around September 2015, Plaintiffs received an offer to purchase their home, which they accepted. The deal fell through, however, when the prospective buyers obtained a home inspection report that contained negative findings concerning the foundation and garage concrete.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 4; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"On October 19, 2015, Plaintiffs submitted an insurance claim to [the defendant].\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 5; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 5.) After \"[a]n adjuster retained by [the defendant] inspected the Property on October 22, 2015,\" the defendant \"denied Plaintiffs' claim by letter dated October 26, 2015.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.) The plaintiffs' insurance policies with the defendant took two forms between 2006 and 2016. \"From October 1, 2006, when Plaintiffs first insured with [the defendant], through October 1, 2013, the [defendant's] Policy (\"Policy\") did not contain any applicable coverage for collapse of a building or part of a building.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 10; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 10.) The versions of the Policy used thereafter contained \"incidental coverage, applicable to direct physical loss to covered property involving the collapse of a building or part of a building.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 8 (internal quotation marks omitted); Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The post-2013 Policy defined\n   the \"collapse of a building or part of a building\" as \"an abrupt caving in, falling in, falling down, or giving way of the building or the part of the building that prevents the building or the part of the building from being occupied for the purpose for which it was intended just before caving in, falling in, falling down, or giving way ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It also stated that \"the following are not considered to be in a state of collapse: a) a building or part of a building that has not caved in, fallen down, or given way even if it displays evidence of bending, bowing, bulging, cracking, expansion ... and b) a building or a part of a building in danger of caving in, falling in, falling down, or giving way.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 9; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The damage alleged by the Plaintiffs ... is the result of a process of deterioration that has been occurring since the concrete [for the Property] was originally poured in 1984 ....\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 11; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 11.) \"Petrographic analysis by Dr. Sidney Carter confirmed that core samples drilled from Plaintiffs' foundation walls contain[ ] iron sulfide materials, principally pyrrhotite, and that the cracking in the concrete relates to the oxidation of the iron sulfide minerals within the aggregates.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 13 (internal quotation marks omitted); Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 13.) Despite these findings, the plaintiffs \"currently occupy the Property\" and continue to \"use [the] basement as they have since they have owned the Property.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6 14; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6 14.) \"No one has told Plaintiffs that the cracks in their foundation walls present a safety hazard,\" \"that the Property or the foundation walls are in imminent danger of falling down, or that they need to move out of the property.\" (Def.'s L.R. 56(a)1 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; Pl.'s L.R. 56(a)2 Stmt. at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Plaintiffs' Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to their complaint, \"the plaintiffs were notified [in October of 2015] that the basement walls of their home had a series of horizontal and vertical cracks throughout by way of a home inspection commissioned by a prospective buyer of their home.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.) The plaintiffs subsequently \"undertook an investigation of the 'pattern cracking' condition,\" revealing that it had occurred \"due to a chemical compound found in certain basement walls constructed in the late 1980s and the early 1990s with concrete most likely from the J.J. Mottes Concrete Company.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) The plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he aggregate used by the J.J. Mottes Concrete Company in manufacturing the concrete in that particular time period contained a chemical compound which, with its mixture with the water, sand, and cement necessary to form the concrete, began to oxidize (rust) and expand, breaking the bonds of the concrete internally and reducing it to rubble.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After this realization, the plaintiffs claim they \"made a timely claim for coverage of the loss in accordance with the terms of the [defendant's Policy] and the policies issued during the preceding years.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15.) The plaintiffs allege that \"[t]he defendant denied [their] claim for coverage by way of [a] letter claiming that the [Policy] does not afford coverage for the condition affecting their basement walls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.) The plaintiffs claim that the defendant denied them coverage under the Policy on grounds contrary to \"the express\n   provisions of the [Policy].\" (ECF No. 18 (\"Complaint\") at \u00b6 18.) As such, they allege a claim of breach of contract against the defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Conn.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2042\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 1-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The plaintiffs also allege a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing on the basis that the defendant \"intentionally cited policy exclusions wholly inapplicable to the plaintiffs' claim for coverage knowing full well that the plaintiffs, like most insureds, are unsophisticated with respect to the complex language contained in insurance policies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Breach of Contract Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties' dispute over the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim focuses on the language of the Policy. The plaintiffs argue they are entitled to relief under both the pre-2013 and post-2013 versions of the Policy-or at least that there are factual disputes that preclude summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 4-5.) For the reasons that follow, I conclude that their claims are foreclosed under both versions of the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Further, the parties' experts also described the damage to the Property in terms of \"cracking\" and \"bulging.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36-2, Exhibit A, Report of David Grandpre (\"Grandpre Report\") at 54-55 (describing damage to Property as \"[i]rregular horizontal, vertical, and diagonal cracks in a map pattern,\" \"map pattern cracks in the concrete,\" \"[h]orizontal cracks extending into the concrete wall,\" \"[m]ap-pattern cracks in the concrete basement floor,\" \"map-pattern cracks,\" \"multiple vertical, horizontal, and diagonal map-pattern cracks,\" and \"vertical cracks that were similar to normal concrete shrinkage cracks\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (ECF No. 32-5, Exhibit E, Report of Leonard J. Morse-Fortier (\"Morse-Fortier Report\") at 6 (describing the walls of the Property as \"cracked\").) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The parties' experts both attributed the cause of the cracking and bulging in the Property to defective concrete. The plaintiffs' expert stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Concrete made with otherwise good and proper materials sets up, or hardens, in a matter of weeks, and then it continues to harden into a solid mass over its lifetime. This was not the case at the [Property]. The concrete was internally fractured, crumbling, and was no longer a solid mass. The concrete used at the [Property] contained a compound, most likely within the aggregate, which was subjected to a chemical reaction. As the chemical reaction took place, a chemical compound larger than the original elements formed, resulting in internal expansion that caused the concrete to fracture and expand. The chemical reaction initially damaged the inside of the concrete on a microscopic level. The reaction was hidden from view. The reactive compound is larger, and this expansion causes the concrete to fracture internally. Eventually the expansion became visible at the surface of the walls. One kind of such reaction is called alkali-silica reaction, commonly referred to as \"ASR.\" A similar, but different, chemical reaction can occur if there is iron sulfide in the aggregate. As the iron sulfide oxidizes or rusts, the products of the reaction expand, fracturing the concrete. The chemical reaction was likely aided by water initially batched into the concrete, and later by water absorbed by the concrete. The source of water includes water vapor in the air within the basement and above grade on the exterior\n   sides of the basement. My opinion is based on my observations at the [Property] and my previous experience investigating the cause of similar concrete deterioration characteristics in other locations where the concrete was reportedly supplied by Joseph J. Mottes Company of Stafford Springs, CT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Grandpre Report at 4.) The defendant's expert reached a similar conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The cracks result from the oxidation and expansion of pyrrhotite, a reactive iron sulfide mineral present in the concrete aggregate. In the presence of water and air, the pyrrhotite oxidized and expanded, causing the concrete to crack and increasing the likelihood of additional water intrusion and further cracking. The process of deterioration has been ongoing for a long period of time. Mr. Courteau noted that he did not observe cracks at the time they purchased the house in 2006, though he also noted that there was very little of the concrete foundation wall that was exposed to view. So long as there is pyrrhotite present and the concrete is exposed to water and air, the deterioration may continue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Morse-Fortier Report at 6.) Thus, the evidence in the record suggests that the damage to the Property consists of cracking of the concrete-sometimes resulting in bulging of the walls and other structures-caused by the use of defective concrete. (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Complaint at \u00b6 9 (\"The [concrete] aggregate used by the J.J. Mottes Concrete Company in manufacturing the concrete in [the time period in which the Property was constructed] contained a chemical compound which, with its mixture with the water, sand, and cement necessary to form the concrete, began to oxidize (rust) and expand, breaking the bonds of the concrete internally and reducing it to rubble.\").)

As in\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   , the exclusions under the pre-2013 Policy for \"cracking,\" \"bulging,\" and \"defects\" in construction materials preclude coverage under the pre-2013 Policy for the damage to the plaintiffs' Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The plaintiffs attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Kim\n   </em>\n   on the basis that the policy in that case \"excluded losses both\n   <em>\n    caused by\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    consisting of\n   </em>\n   cracking and defective materials,\" whereas the pre-2013 Policy provides\n   that \"the loss must be\n   <em>\n    caused by\n   </em>\n   the excluded item.\" (ECF No. 36 at 13 (emphases in original).) This distinction does not help the plaintiffs. As noted above, the plaintiffs' expert and the complaint both allege that the cracking of the walls was caused by the use of defective concrete to construct the Property. Thus, if the cracking itself is deemed the \"loss\" (a term not defined in the Policy), the undisputed evidence in the record shows that that \"loss ... result[ed] from ... a defect ... in materials used in construction,\" (Pre-2013 Policy at 12), and thus is excluded from coverage. On the other hand, if \"loss\" is accorded its ordinary meaning in this context, i.e., \"[t]he amount of financial detriment caused by an ... insured property's damage,\" Garner, Black's Law Dictionary, Ninth Ed., then the loss was caused by cracking and thus is excluded under the cracking exclusion. (Pre-2013 Policy at 8 (\"We do not pay for loss caused by ... cracking ... of a building structure.\").) In either case, the damage falls under the exclusions in the pre-2013 Policy. The plaintiffs have failed to present any other potential cause of the damage to the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiffs also contend that the exclusion for \"settling, cracking, shrinking, bulging or expansion\" applies only to losses caused by \"\n   <em>\n    normal\n   </em>\n   , gradual readjustment of the building materials in a home.\" (ECF No. 36 at 13 (internal quotation marks omitted).)

(ECF No. 36 at 22.) This argument rests on the contention that \"intended\" may be defined as \"designed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (citing Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus).) The plaintiffs contend that the Property is not capable of being \"sold for its intended or designed purpose,\" and that \"no willing purchaser would purchase the home for use as a single-family residence, at least without substantial discount in an amount sufficient to remedy the condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.) The problem with this argument is that the Policy requires an event that prevents the building from being \"occupied\" for the purpose for which it was intended before the event occurred, not one that prevents (let alone merely hinders) the building from being \"sold\" for the purpose for which it was intended. And the fact remains that the plaintiffs have continued to occupy their home and to use it as a dwelling-its intended purpose. There is no evidence in the record indicating that they cannot continue to live at the Property for at least the near future. As long as the plaintiffs can safely remain in their home their contention that the property cannot be occupied for the purpose for which it was intended will fall wide of the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Other parts of the \"collapse\" provision confirm there is no coverage here. As noted, the physical manifestation of the damage to the Property has been described as \"cracking,\" \"expansions,\" and \"bulging.\" But the \"collapse\" definition specifically excludes these harms in the absence of something more. The post-2013 Policy specifically excludes coverage for \"a building or a part of a building that has not caved in, fallen in, fallen down, or given way even if it displays evidence of bending, bowing, bulging, cracking, expansion ... leaning, sagging, settling or shrinkage.\" (Post-2013 Policy at 11.) Thus, the post-2013 Policy specifically excludes the plaintiffs' claimed damages from its definition of \"Collapse.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liston-Smith v.

The plaintiffs do not allege that their property \"abruptly\" collapsed within the meaning of the Policy, or that any change occurred to the Property \"without preparation or warning.\" Instead, they cite a competing definition of \"abrupt\" as \"sudden\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   unexpected.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 20 (citing \"Abrupt\" Definition, Dictionary.com, http://dictionary.com.reference.com/browse/abrupt).)

(Post-2013 Policy at 11 (emphasis added).) It would strain the imagination to map such language onto a process that occurred gradually, over the years, as the deterioration of the concrete in the Property undisputedly did. How would one pinpoint the moment \"just before\" such a slow-moving series of changes reached the point at which the Property became uninhabitable? Further confirmation that the term \"abrupt\" in the collapse provision means \"quick\" or \"temporally sudden\" appears in the part of that provision stating that a collapse has not occurred when \"a building ... is\n   <em>\n    in danger of\n   </em>\n   caving in, falling in, falling down, or giving way.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) ).

Ass'n, Inc. v. Millers Capital Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. CCB-07-1779,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202331048\">\n    2008 WL 2331048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Md. June 2, 2008). That case concerned an insurance policy, which, like the post-2013 Policy, provided \"collapse\" coverage for \"[a]n abrupt falling down or caving in event.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202331048\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphases omitted). The case concerned the plaintiff's claim for damages caused when its property, without warning, partially caved in-evidenced by a \"loud noise sounding like a truck had hit the building.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. (internal quotation marks omitted). The court concluded that coverage applied because a portion of the plaintiff's property had \"buckled approximately three inches down and three inches to the south.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Further, a professional engineer who inspected the damage the day after the \"loud noise\" was heard concluded \"the building was in danger of further collapse and had to be evacuated immediately.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).) That is not what happened here. The plaintiffs do not allege that the Property buckled or that it is unsafe-as noted above, the evidence in the record would not support any such assertion-or that there was any temporally sudden event that caused the cracking. Thus,\n   <em>\n    130 Slade\n   </em>\n   is also inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The plaintiffs also contend that the post-2013 Policy's definition of \"collapse\" is contradictory because it applies to circumstances involving a \"caving in\" or \"giving way\" even where there has not been a total falling down. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 36 at 17.) This contention misreads the \"collapse\" provision in the Policy. The definition of \"collapse\" has at least three main components: \"an (1) abrupt (2) caving in, falling in, falling down, or giving way of the building or the part of the building (3) that prevents the building or the part of the building from being occupied for the purpose for which it was intended just before caving in, falling in, falling down, or giving way.\" (Post-2013 Policy at 11.) Under this definition, there can be covered \"collapses\" without a total falling down. For example, if the ceiling of a property abruptly caved in a few inches but the property remained standing, it would still constitute a \"collapse\" under the post-2013 Policy if it rendered the property unusable for occupation. Thus, the post-2013 Policy's definition of collapse is not contradictory-and it is certainly not so as applied to this case. In any event, even if the plaintiffs could establish that the Property had \"caved in\" or \"given way\" in any meaningful sense, they still could not satisfy the \"abrupt\" and intended purpose portions of the \"collapse\" definition recounted above. For these reasons, I conclude that the damage to the plaintiffs' Property is not covered under the post-2013 Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As such, I conclude that the damage to the plaintiffs' Property is not covered under the defendant's Policy. Thus, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs' breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The defendant contends that the plaintiffs' breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim fails due to the dismissal of the breach of contract claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 32 at 27.) \"Bad faith in general implies both actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive.\"\n   <em>\n    Capstone Bldg.
