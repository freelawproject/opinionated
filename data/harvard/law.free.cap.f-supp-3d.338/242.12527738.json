(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23(d) ) The benefits administered by the JIB \"are [therefore] available only to electrical workers covered by a [CBA] between their employer and [the Union].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23(e) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Funds are also \"multiemployer plans\" under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), \"which means that they are established pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24) According to Charter, it is not possible to provide \" '[b]enefits identical to [the CBA with the Union],' as demanded by [the Union] ... except under a multiemployer plan,\" because multiemployer plans and single employer plans are subject to different statutory and regulatory provisions.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26 (internal quotation marks omitted) ) According to Charter, because multiemployer plans must be established pursuant to a CBA, the requirement of \"identical\" benefits effectively requires Charter to enter into contracts only with companies that have CBAs.

(Oct. 10, 2017 Tr. (Dkt. No. 64) at 9:20-22) As an initial matter, the Court noted that the SAC did not even disclose Charter's response to the Union's March 26, 2017 proposal - \"[i]n other words, Charter doesn't actually plead that it rejected the Union's proposal.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:8-11) More importantly, the SAC did not \"plead facts explaining how the Union's request that subcontractors pay 'identical' wages and benefits constitutes a demand for an unlawful union signatory clause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10:11-15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court acknowledged that - in several letters and briefs submitted in connection with the pending motions - Plaintiff explained that the JIB is responsible for providing pension and medical benefits under the CBA, and that the JIB only provides such benefits to employees of companies that are signatories to CBAs with the Union. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20186\">\n    at 10:16-11:3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Pltf.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oct. 10, 2017 Tr. (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court concluded that the SAC did not plausibly allege that the Union had insisted on an unlawful union signatory clause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:22-25) The SAC therefore failed to state a claim under LMRA Section 303.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:3-19) This Court therefore granted Defendants' motion to dismiss the SAC.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:24-20:1) In an October 15, 2017 letter, Plaintiff stated that it intended to move for leave to file a \"revised Third Amended Complaint.\" (Oct. 15, 2017 Pltf.
