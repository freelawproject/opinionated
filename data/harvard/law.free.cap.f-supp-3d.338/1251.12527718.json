In addition to the motion and supporting brief, the Court has considered the Plaintiff's response [Doc. 15] the Defendants' reply [Doc. 16], the evidence submitted by the parties, and the relevant legal authorities. The Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiff's constitutional claims against them, and that the motion for summary judgment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are supported by the record and viewed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November of 2012, Plaintiff Paul Hunt was a medical student at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine (\"UNMSOM\"). Doc. 1-1 at 1. UNMSOM has a Social Media Policy to address the use of social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flickr, which provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \u2022 Be mindful that all posted content is subject to review in accordance with UNMSOM policies and the Student Professional Code of Conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 Exercise discretion, thoughtfulness and respect for your colleagues, associates and the university's supporters/community (social media fans).

It provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Individuals at all levels are allowed to discuss issues of concern in an open and honest manner, without fear of reprisal\n   or retaliation from individuals above or below them in the university's hierarchy.

To all of you who support the Democratic candidates: The Republican Party sucks. But guess what.

The Facebook post was not directed at any individual, nor did it contain any reference to UNM or UNMSOM. Doc. 15-1 at 1 \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 15, 2012, Defendant Scott Carroll, M.D. (\"Carroll\") wrote a letter to Hunt informing him that the Dean of Students had formally referred Hunt to the Committee for Student Performance and Evaluation (\"CSPE\"). The referral stemmed from allegations of unprofessional conduct made by other students against Hunt arising from his Facebook post. Doc. 3-2 at 9. In the letter, Carroll stated, \"[w]hile you have every right to your political and moral opinions and beliefs, there is still a professionalism standard that must be maintained as a member of the UNM medical school community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Carroll then quoted from the UNM Respectful Campus Policy that states, \"the right to address issues of concern does not grant individuals license to make untrue allegations, unduly inflammatory statements or unduly personal attacks, or to harass others ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the letter informed Hunt that \"CSPE will be conducting an investigation into the allegations at its November 20th meeting at 3pm [sic] and we would like you to prepare a statement regarding the allegations and be prepared to answer questions from the committee members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On November 20, 2012, Hunt appeared before the CSPE, where he recognized members of the NMSOM faculty, as well as some fellow students. Doc. 15-1 at 4, \u00b6 17. He read a prepared statement acknowledging his \"guilt\" and asking for help.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. Then he answered questions from members of the CSPE.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 24, 2013, Carroll again wrote to Hunt informing him that after the November 20th meeting, the CSPE \"substantiated that [Hunt's] Facebook post was in fact unprofessional conduct due to violations of the UNM Respectful Campus Policy (2240) and the UNM School of Medicine Social Media Policy. Doc. 15-1 at 11. Carroll told Hunt that he would be given a two-part \"professional enhancement prescription.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The first, focusing on ethics,\n   involved mentorship by a faculty member who would \"assign readings and supervise a reflective writing assignment on patient autonomy and tolerance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The second, focused on professionalism, was comprised of four parts: (1) a reflective writing assignment on the public expression of political beliefs by physicians, (2) an apology letter, which Hunt could present to anyone of his choice, or no one at all, (3) rewriting the Facebook post in a passionate, yet professionally appropriate way, and (4) ongoing meetings with Dr. Tim Nelson over a one-year period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Next, the letter informed Hunt that the professionalism violation would be noted in the recommendation letter the Dean would provide to residency training programs, but that in the future Hunt could petition CSPE to remove the notation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The letter stated the further professionalism lapses or failure to fulfill any of the professionalism requirements described in the letter could result in adverse action, including dismissal from the UNMSOM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Finally, Carroll's letter quoted the UNMSOM Promotions and Due Process Policy, informing Hunt that if he believed the CSPE's decision imposing corrective action was flawed, he could request in writing that the Senior Associate Dean of Education review the decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Hunt did not utilize the review process. Doc. 3-2 at 2, \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Over the next twelve months, Hunt met with his \"professionalism mentor,\" Dr. Nelson, twelve times as prescribed in the January 24, 2013 letter. Doc. 15-1 at 5, \u00b6 25. In addition, Hunt rewrote his Facebook post as required by CSPE; however, it rejected his first attempt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29; Doc. 15-1 at 12 (Ex. D). However, the CSPE accepted Hunt's second rewrite. Doc. 15-1 at 6, \u00b6 30; Doc. 15-1 at 14 (Ex. E). The second rewrite still expresses Hunt's fervent opposition to abortion, but the tone of the piece is calm and rational, and it contains no expletives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 22, 2014, Defendant Carroll notified Hunt that his professionalism enhancement prescription was completed but that \"any future reports of unprofessional behavior to CSPE will be considered in light of your previous lapse in professionalism.\" Doc. 15-1 at \u00b6 31; Doc. 15-1 at 16 (Ex. F). Dr. Carroll also noted, \"If you would like this notation removed from your Dean's letter, you will need to submit a written petition to CSPE requesting its removal at a future date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On January 15, 2016, Plaintiff Paul Hunt (\"Hunt\") filed his First Amended Complaint in the Second Judicial District Court, Bernalillo County, New Mexico. In Counts I, II, and III of his amended complaint, Hunt asserts claims for violation of his First Amendment rights (freedom of speech, viewpoint discrimination, and retaliation, respectively). In Count IV, Hunt asserts that his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process was violated. Hunt asserts the first four counts against the UNM Board of Regents, unnamed CSPE members, and Carroll pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count V does not assert a cause of action, but rather contains a request for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Board of Regents, Defendant Teresa Vigil, M.D. (\"Vigil\"), and Defendant Paul Roth, M.D. (\"Roth\"), presumably as a remedy for the causes of action set forth in the first four counts. Specifically, Hunt asks for a declaration that his constitutional rights have been violated and an injunction requiring Vigil, as the current interim chair of the CSPE, to recommend to Roth, as Dean of the School of Medicine, to remove all references to the Facebook matter from Hunt's permanent record. Doc. 1-1 at \u00b6 57. Similarly, in Count VI Hunt does not assert a cause of action but requests another remedy:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   imposition of punitive damages against unnamed CSPE members and Carroll.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On April 8, 2016, the Defendants removed the case to this federal district court, asserting federal question jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendants have filed their motion as one to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.

Here, Defendants have attached to their motion and asked the Court to consider affidavits, university policies, and other matters outside the pleadings. Hunt, in turn, has done the same in his response brief. Accordingly, the Court will treat the motion as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine issues as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Defendants argue that Hunt's claims for money damages for alleged violations of his constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the Board of Regents and the individual defendants in their official capacities should be dismissed. The Court agrees. As the Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court have made clear, \"Neither states nor state officers sued in their official capacity are 'persons' subject to suit under section 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Gunter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527489\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/989/#p991\">\n    15 F.3d 989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 991 (10th Cir. 1994) (citing\n   <em>\n    Will v.

Hunt therefore may not seek damages from the Board of Regents or the individual defendants in their official capacities, and those claims will be dismissed. State officers sued in their individual capacities, however, \"are 'persons' subject to suit under section 1983.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527489\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/989/#p991\">\n    15 F.3d at 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court will consider Hunt's claims against the individual defendants in their individual capacities for both monetary and injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While Hunt recognizes the unavailability of damages against the Board of\n   Regents and the individual defendants in their official capacities, he contends that he may still seek injunctive and declaratory relief from the Board of Regents. Defendants, in turn, argue that because Hunt has not named the individual regents in his amended complaint, he has failed to state a claim against a person covered by Section 1983.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with Defendants. Hunt has not named any individual members of the Board of Regents, but rather only the Board itself. As explained above, the Board of Regents is an entity, not a \"person\" that may be held liable under Section 1983.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v. Board of Trustees of State Colleges of Colorado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11220527\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/1168/#p1172\">\n    215 F.3d 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1172 (10th Cir. 2000) (\"Having sued only the Board rather than the individual trustees, Mr. McLaughlin has failed to state a claim against a person covered by section 1983.\"). Accordingly, the Board of Regents is not subject to suit under \u00a7 1983, and Hunt's claims against the Board of Regents for injunctive and declaratory relief will be dismissed for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As a result of the foregoing discussion, what remains are Hunt's \u00a7 1983 claims in Counts I through IV against Carroll, Vigil, and Roth in their individual capacities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously discussed, Counts V and VI do not assert causes of action, but rather request particular remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    II. First Amendment Claims Against Defendants In Their Individual Capacities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As explained above, the Defendants have raised the defense of qualified immunity. As a result, Defendants have shifted the burden to Hunt to demonstrate that Defendants violated his First Amendment (freedom of speech) and Fourteenth Amendment (due process) rights, and that those rights were clearly established at the time of the violation. Courts have discretion to decide the order in which to engage in the two-prong qualified immunity analysis.\n   <em>\n    Tolan v.

Here, the Court exercises its discretion to address only the clearly established prong of the standard as to the First Amendment claim. The issue before the Court is whether-assuming Carroll violated Hunt's First Amendment right to post on Facebook by subjecting him to discipline-this right was clearly established in late 2012 and in 2013, when that discipline was imposed.

In support of that argument, he relies on two Tenth Circuit decisions,\n   <em>\n    Seamons v.

In\n   <em>\n    Seamons\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was a high school student who was assaulted by five of his football teammates in the locker room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1230.

Brian's behavior neither disrupted classwork nor invaded the rights of other students. His speech was not part of a school-sponsored expressive activity such that listeners might believe that Brian's speech had the imprimatur of school sponsorship. We simply see no overriding school interest in denying Brian the ability to report physical assaults in the locker room. At most, the school's interest here was based on its fear of a disturbance stemming from the disapproval associated with Brian's unpopular viewpoint regarding hazing in the school's locker rooms. Under\n   <em>\n    Tinker\n   </em>\n   , that is not a sufficient justification to punish Brian's speech in these circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1238.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Like\n   <em>\n    Seamons, Taylor\n   </em>\n   also took place in a high school setting.

This case can hardly be categorized as a clear case of a content-based restriction in violation of the First Amendment. Most importantly, circuit courts have come to conflicting conclusions on whether a school can regulate off-campus, online student speech where such speech could foreseeably cause a material disruption to the administration of the school.

During the period of late 2012 and into 2013, when Carroll and other members of the CSPE imposed corrective action on Hunt, there was no clearly established law prohibiting their actions. Defendants found that the inflammatory nature of Hunt's Facebook post violated university policies and as a result they imposed additional training requirements and required him to rewrite the post to express the same viewpoint, but in a more professional manner. They also made a notation of the incident in Hunt's file. What precludes a finding that Carroll violated clearly established due process rights is the lack of prior decisions classifying reprimands of professional students as academic or disciplinary, and the lack of uniformity in the decisions that do exist. There was no controlling authority in this Circuit or a \"consensus of cases of persuasive authority\" in others on which the Defendants could have relied to determine whether they should be held to the standards of disciplinary, as opposed to academic, dismissals.\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

When conduct that leads to an adverse academic decision is of a disciplinary nature, due process may require the procedural protections of\n   <em>\n    Goss v.

In this case, the Court concludes that Hunt, like the student in\n   <em>\n    Horowitz\n   </em>\n   , was \"awarded at least as much due process as the Fourteenth\n   Amendment requires.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2906\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/78/#p80\">\n    435 U.S. at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2906\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/78/#p80\">\n    98 S.Ct. 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, Hunt was given written notice of the charges against him. Carroll's November 15, 2012 letter to Hunt informed him that his Facebook post regarding abortion and the election had resulted in complaints of unprofessional conduct from Hunt's fellow students. Carroll's letter quoted from the UNM Respectful Campus Policy that states, \"the right to address issues of concern does not grant individuals license to make untrue allegations, unduly inflammatory statements or unduly personal attacks, or to harass others ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2906\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/435/78/#p80\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also quoted from the Respectful Campus Policy. Finally, the letter informed Hunt that \"CSPE will be conducting an investigation into the allegations at its November 20th meeting at 3pm [sic] and we would like you to prepare a statement regarding the allegations and be prepared to answer questions from the committee members.\" Thus, Hunt was informed in writing of the allegations against him, as well as the basis for those allegations, and the campus policies that he was alleged to have violated. Second, Hunt was given a hearing where he had an opportunity to present his side of the story and to make his own position clear. On November 20, 2012, Hunt appeared before the CSPE, where he recognized members of the NMSOM faculty, as well as some fellow students. Doc. 15-1 at 4, \u00b6 17. He read a prepared statement acknowledging his \"guilt\" and asking for help.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.

As explained above, the Board of Regents is an entity, not a \"person\" that may be held liable under Section 1983. Similarly, state officers sued in their official capacities are not \"persons\" subject to suit under section 1983. Defendant Carroll in his individual capacity is entitled to qualified immunity on Hunt's First Amendment claims because the law was not clearly established. In addition, Carroll is entitled to qualified immunity on Hunt's procedural due process claim because Hunt failed to demonstrate that his due process rights were violated. Finally, because Defendants prevailed on Hunt's substantive claims, Hunt cannot assert a right against Defendants Vigil and Roth for injunctive or declaratory relief, nor against Carroll for punitive damages. Defendants' motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 3] is hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Both sides recognize that, having agreed to the removal of the case to federal district court, the Board of Regents has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit in this Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    According to the First Amended Complaint [Doc. 1-1], Hunt asserts his first four counts against \"Board of Regents, CSPE members, and Scott Carroll, M.D.\" Hunt alleges that Defendant Vigil \"is the interim chair of the CSPE,\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4, \u00b6 5, and therefore the complaint can reasonably be read to assert his constitutional claims in Counts I through IV against her. According to the First Amended Complaint, Defendant Roth is the Dean of the UNMSOM, that he \"has the ultimate authority to remove all references to the Facebook mater from Plaintiff's academic record,\" and that he is a named defendant because \"he has the ability to provide prospective injunctive relief for Plaintiff.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 6. Thus, it not clear that Hunt is asserting his constitutional claims against Roth in his individual capacity. However, the parties do not address this question in their briefs. Resolution of this issue not being essential to the resolution of the motion, the Court will not address it here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    November of 2012 is the relevant time frame regarding the clearly established law in this case.

Doc. 15 at 29. In support of his argument, Hunt attaches copies of Facebook posts allegedly made by other UNMSOM students who he asserts also violated university policies but were not punished by the university.

However, leaving aside the specific legal claim to which it relates, a claim of content discrimination must show that a similarly situated person was treated differently than Hunt based on the content of their speech.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pahls v.

However, Hunt comes forward with no evidence that any complaints about the cited posts were ever made to UNMSOM or that Carroll or any other university official knew about the posts. In the absence of evidence that any official at UNMSOM knew about the posts, they cannot be held liable for failing to address them in the same manner that they addressed Hunt's Facebook post.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
