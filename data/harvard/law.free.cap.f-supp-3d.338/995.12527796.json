The First Amended Complaint\n   (\"FAC\"), the operative pleading before the Court, alleges that the County's enforcement efforts violate Plaintiffs' right to free speech, due process and equal protection. The pleadings also allege that the County is foreclosed from enforcing its ordinances as a result of the judgment entered by District Judge Charles Breyer in Plaintiffs' prior lawsuit against the County, styled as\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Free Speech v.

Plaintiffs alleged that certain zoning provisions contained within the County Code of Ordinances (collectively referred to as \"Zoning Ordinance\") are unconstitutional. The Complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the County, pursuant to section 1983, based on the following claims for relief: (1) violation of the right to free speech under the First Amendment; (2) violation of the right to Equal Protection under the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) violation of the right to free speech under the California Constitution; and (4) violation of the right to Equal Protection under the California Constitution.

In addition, each of the claims alleged in the FAC is barred by res judicata and otherwise lacks substantive merit. No amendment to the pleadings would cure these deficiencies.
