Doc. 1. Hoist moves under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction, contending that the parties are not of diverse citizenship. Doc. 13. The motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For purposes of the diversity jurisdiction, \"a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of every State and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of the State or foreign state where it has its principal place of business.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Hoist is an Illinois corporation with its principal place of business in Illinois, Doc. 1 at \u00b6 2, making it a citizen of Illinois. Borusan is a business entity organized under the laws of the Republic of Turkey as an \"anonim sirket\" or \"A.S.\" and maintains its principal place of business in Turkey.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    at \u00b6 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Doc. 13-1 at 3; Doc. 17-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-5. If, as Borusan contends, a Turkish A.S. is the equivalent of a United States corporation, then Borusan is a citizen of Turkey, and the parties are diverse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BouMatic, LLC v.

So, for instance, the Dutch business entity called a besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid (\"BV\") qualifies as a corporation under \u00a7 1332(c)(1) because it \"has the standard elements of 'personhood' (perpetual existence, the right to contract and do business in its own name, and the right to sue and be sued)\"; it \"issues shares to investors who enjoy limited liability (which is to say, are not liable for the business's debts)\"; and its \"[s]hares can be bought and sold, subject to restrictions that the business declares\"-all common traits \"in this nation's\n   close corporations.\"\n   <em>\n    BouMatic\n   </em>\n   , 759 F.3d at 791.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although \"anonim sirket\" may be literally translated from Turkish as \"joint stock company,\" Doc. 13 at 3, a Turkish A.S.-like a Dutch BV-has all of the salient attributes of a United States corporation. First, an A.S. is a corporate person with indefinite existence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tugrul Ansay and Eric C.
