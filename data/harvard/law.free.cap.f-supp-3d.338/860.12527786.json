The limitations period for Savory's \u00a7 1983 claims is two years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dominguez v.

The parties agree that Savory could not have brought his \u00a7 1983 claims until the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted because those claims, if successful, would necessarily imply the invalidity of his convictions. The parties further agree that Savory's \u00a7 1983 claims accrued when the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar on those claims lifted. Doc. 71 at 17; Doc. 79 at 12-13. The parties dispute, however, when the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As Savory sees it, the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar was in place until January 12, 2015, when he received a favorable (in his view) termination of his conviction in the form of a gubernatorial pardon. Doc. 79 at 14. If that is correct, then the \u00a7 1983 claims accrued on January 12, 2015 and thus are timely. As Defendants see it, the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted on December 6, 2011, when Savory's parole was terminated. Doc. 71 at 17. If that is correct, then \u00a7 1983 claims accrued on December 6, 2011, the limitations period on those claims expired on December 6, 2013, and the claims are untimely. Defendants are correct, and understanding why requires some explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   as a general rule prevents convicted criminals from challenging their intact convictions via \u00a7 1983 instead of via the habeas statute, which is the exclusive remedy for persons \"who challenge the fact or duration of their confinement.\"\n   <em>\n    DeWalt v.

In\n   <em>\n    DeWalt\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit held that because habeas is not an option after a person is no longer in custody, a post-custody \u00a7 1983 claim challenging the validity of a conviction does not interfere with the operation of the habeas statute, and thus\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    does not bar the claim.

So, because Savory's \u00a7 1983 claims accrued when the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted, because the\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   bar lifted when Savory could no longer seek federal habeas relief, and because Savory could no longer seek habeas relief as of the termination of his parole on December 6, 2011, Savory's \u00a7 1983 claims accrued on that date, and the statute of limitations expired two years later, on December 6, 2013.

Savory thus reads\n   <em>\n    DeWalt\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   as holding that, although\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   does not bar a \u00a7 1983 suit when habeas was never an option, when a plaintiff challenges a conviction,\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   continues to bar a \u00a7 1983 suit unless and until the conviction is favorably terminated, regardless of whether the plaintiff remains in or has left custody.
