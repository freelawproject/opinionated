Defendants and the Government have filed objections to the Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 478, 480, 482, 483, 485, and 488.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants are USPlabs, LLC (\"USPlabs\"), a dietary supplement own-label distributor based in Dallas, Texas; S.K. Laboratories, Inc. (\"S.K. Labs\"), a California corporation that manufactured USPlabs' supplements and consulted on supplement formulation; Jacobo Geissler (\"Geissler\"), a co-founder, co-owner, and chief executive officer of USPlabs; Jonathan Doyle (\"Doyle\"), a co-founder, co-owner, and president of USPlabs; Matthew Hebert (\"Hebert\"), a co-owner of USPlabs responsible for product packaging design; Cyril Willson (\"Willson\"), also known as \"Erik White,\" a consultant to USPlabs, formerly a co-owner; Kenneth Miles (\"Miles\"), USPlabs' compliance officer; and Sitesh Patel (\"Patel\"), a vice-president and employee of S.K. Labs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Indictment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 5, 2016, the Government filed an 11-Count Superseding Indictment (\"the Indictment\") (Doc. 95) against Defendants. The charges in the Indictment stem from Defendant USPlabs' sale of dietary/weight loss supplements, which were manufactured by Defendant S.K. Labs. Doc. 95 at 5-6. The Indictment generally alleges that Defendants conspired to import and sell synthetic dietary supplements, but falsely marketed the products as plant-based under the theory that federal regulatory agencies would be less likely to question the importation of plant extracts, and retailers would be more likely to sell such products. Doc. 95 at 6. The Indictment further alleges that, during the conspiracy, certain Defendants created false documentation to import a synthetic substance-1, 3-dimethylamylamine, known as DMAA-which they represented was a geranium plant extract. According to the Indictment, certain Defendants then used the DMAA in some of their supplements, which thereafter became best-selling products. Doc. 95 at 7, 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   It is further alleged that when DMAA became the subject of controversy in the\n   dietary supplement industry, USPlabs, through Defendant Geissler, began importing other chemicals under false labels to determine if they could be used in new dietary supplements. Doc. 95 at 9. Two such ingredients were aegeline, a synthetic version of an extract from a tree native to India, and the pulverized roots of a Chinese herb, cynanchum auriculatum (\"CA\"), both of which USPlabs is alleged to have purchased from China using fake certificates of analysis (\"COA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first aegeline-containing version of one of Defendants' supplements was OxyElite Pro \"New Formula\" (\"OEP-NF\"). Doc. 95 at 9-10. The second version of the supplement contained both aegeline and CA and was called OxyElite Pro \"Advanced Formula\" (\"OEP-AF\"). Doc. 95 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As alleged in the Indictment, in the fall of 2013, an outbreak of injuries was reported to be associated with USPlabs' aegeline-based products after numerous consumers in Hawaii experienced liver-related symptoms, including liver failure. Doc. 95 at 11. Following an inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), USPlabs agreed to cease distributing the OEP products, but is alleged to have instead pushed sales as fast as possible. Doc. 95 at 11. The Indictment also alleges that USPlabs issued a press release falsely stating that the ingredients in OEP had been researched and showed no negative liver effects, even though Defendants Geissler and Willson knew that a study had shown such negative side effects. Doc. 95 at 11. Eventually, Geissler instructed that both aegeline and CA be removed from the product going forward. Doc. 95 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Indictment contains the following charges\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 1\n   </strong>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud\n   </em>\n   (as to all Defendants except Miles),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201343\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1349 ; Doc. 95 at 12-17.

Accordingly, prior to addressing the Magistrate Judge's Report and the parties' objections and responses to the objections, the court reviews the relevant legal principles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The United States Constitution states that a criminal defendant cannot \"be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,\" U.S. Const. amend. V, and that he has \"the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation[.]\" U.S. Const. amend. VI. In keeping with these constitutional principles, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1) provides that an indictment \"must be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged and must be signed by an attorney for the government.\" In each count, the indictment \"must give the official or customary citation of the statute, rule, regulation, or other provision of law that the defendant is alleged to have violated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"A count may allege that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that the defendant committed it by one or more specified means.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When applying this standard, common sense should prevail over technicalities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 The Late Charles A.

For the most part, Defendants' Motions to Dismiss address the specificity and sufficiency of the Indictment as it relates to Counts 2 though 10.

Also unlike the Indictment in\n   <em>\n    Hanafy\n   </em>\n   , in which the Government alleged that the misbranded material duplicated a lawful label or simply failed to reveal additional information, here, the Indictment alleges that Defendants conspired to use affirmatively false \"labels\" and other affirmatively false \"labeling\" that, among other things, misidentified the actual articles of food. Doc. 95 at 6-11. For example, the Government has alleged that Geissler instructed a Chinese chemical seller to hide the names of chemicals to be shipped from China to Texas \"by writing: 'Please send as Green coffee samples and send them all together.... And don't label the individual bags. Label as green coffee sample 1, 2, 3 etc.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.

As the Government persuasively argued in its objection to the Report: \"Accepting the recommendation to dismiss Count 7 would mean that, for instance, Viagra labeled as Tylenol would not be misbranded under the FDCA.\n   <em>\n    Hanafy\n   </em>\n   did not hold or even suggest that dangerous substances can be fraudulently labeled as safe substances with no consequences.\" Gov't's Obj. 6 (Doc. 478).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition to actual labels on the products themselves, the court agrees with the Government that the COAs referred to in the Indictment also explain and convey \"substantial information\" about the product. Paragraph 16 of the Indictment alleges that a COA provides information to a manufacturer \"certifying that the ingredient listed in the COA ha[s] been tested or otherwise evaluated, ... [is] what it purport[s] to be ... and [does] not contain dangerous levels of mercury or other toxic substances.\" Doc. 95 at 4.

Finally, Count 7 alleges that the false labeling included such COAs as well as other false labeling. Doc. 95 at 22-24.

Further, even were the Government required to detail in the Indictment how the written materials at issue constituted \"labels\" and \"labeling,\" the Government has done so here with its allegations of actual false labels on the products themselves and COAs, both of which were allegedly intended to explain and provide \"substantial information\" about the products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kordel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hanafy II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Laboratories (\"S.K. Labs\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 95 at 5-6. The\n   <em>\n    First Superseding Indictment\n   </em>\n   (the \"Indictment\") generally alleges that Defendants conspired to import and sell synthetic dietary supplements, but falsely marketed the products as plant-based under the theory that federal regulatory agencies would be less likely to question the importation of plant extracts, and retailers would be more likely to sell such products. Doc. 95 at 6. It is alleged that, during the conspiracy, certain Defendants created false documentation to import a synthetic substance, known as DMAA, which they represented was a geranium plant extract; Defendants then used the DMAA in certain of their supplements, which thereafter became bestselling products.\n   <em>\n    Doc. 95 at 7\n   </em>\n   , 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   It is further alleged that when DMAA became the subject of controversy in the dietary supplement industry, USP, through Defendant Jacobo Geissler, began importing other chemicals under false labels to determine if they could be used in new dietary supplements. Doc. 95 at 9. Two such ingredients were aegeline, which is a synthetic version of an extract from a tree native to India, and the pulverized roots of a Chinese herb called cynanchum auriculatum (\"CA\"), both of which USP is alleged to have purchased from China using fake certificates of analysis. The first aegeline-containing version of one of Defendants' supplements was OxyElite Pro \"New Formula\" (\"OEP-NF\"). Doc. 95 at 9-10. The second version of the supplement contained both aegeline and CA and was called OxyElite Pro \"Advanced Formula\" (\"OEP-AF\"). Doc. 95 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As alleged in the Indictment, in the fall of 2013, an outbreak of injuries was reported to be associated with USP's aegeline-based products after numerous consumers experienced liver-related symptoms, including liver failure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 95 at 11. Following an inspection by the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"), USP agreed to cease distributing the OEP products, but is alleged to have instead pushed sales as fast as possible. Doc. 95 at 11. The Indictment also alleges that USP issued a press release falsely stating that the ingredients in OEP had been researched and showed no negative liver effects, even though Geissler and Defendant Cyril Willson knew that a study had shown such negative side effects. Doc. 95 at 11. Eventually, Geissler instructed that both aegeline and CA be removed from the product going forward. Doc. 95 at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Doc. 221 at 14-15. Defendants assert that neither the FDCA nor its regulations define the term \"extract,\" thus the statutory phrase \"false or misleading\" is unconstitutionally vague as applied to dietary supplements whose labels claim to use \"extracts.\" Doc. 221 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Defendants assert that Count 10 also must be dismissed because the statute on which the count is based is unconstitutionally vague as applied. Doc. 221 at 16. Defendants particularly take issue with the language in the statute providing that a dietary supplement is \"adulterated\" if it \"presents a\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    unreasonable\n   </em>\n   risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in labeling.\" Doc. 221 at 16 (emphasis added). Defendants contend that the italicized\n   words are irremediably vague and ambiguous. Doc. 221 at 16-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   With respect to Count 9, the Government responds that the court or a jury can resolve any dispute about the definition of the term \"extract,\" but the use of the word does not make the governing statute vague. Doc. 240 at 14-15. Additionally, the Government avers that the FDCA's plain language provides ample definitions of the terms \"adulterated\" and \"misbranded\" sufficient to satisfy due process, and such provisions must be given their common sense meanings, i.e., it is common sense that potentially dangerous and/or mislabeled supplements are illegal. Doc. 240 at 12. As to Count 10, the Government urges that the term \"significant or unreasonable\" risk is not vague because jurors make decisions every day using similar standards, and any perceived problem with respect to that language is not addressed by the doctrine of vagueness, but by the requirement that the Government must prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Doc. 240 at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In Count 9, it is alleged that Defendants misbranded OEP-AF as containing CA \"extract\" when in fact USP and Geissler substituted an ingredient that cost about six times less. Doc. 240 at 15. As the Government properly observes, substituting a cheaper ingredient for a more expensive one, but listing the more expensive ingredient on the label would constitute misbranding. Moreover, as argued by the Government, simply because there is no statutory or regulatory definition of \"extract\" does not render the penal statute vague. Indeed, a number of both defense and Government's experts appear to be knowledgeable about what an \"extract\" is. Government expert Dr. Oberlies appears to have considerable experience in various extraction methods, Doc. 294 at 16-18, and several experts from both sides discuss extracts or rely on extensive scientific literature that discusses extracts,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 222 at 18, 28-29, 65-66, 71-73; Doc. 222-1 at 47; Doc. 222-2 at 7, 19; Doc. 222-3 at 7, 17; Doc. 222-5 at 14; Doc. 222-14 at 11, 29; Doc. 232 at 9, 11, 13, 24-25, 31-32, 39, 59, 65-67.

Doc. 293-12. The Application further included a letter the Government sent to Zhang Xiaoming at the Chinese Department of Judicial Assistance and Foreign Affairs, which explained the nature of the Government's investigation and stated that it sought bank, business, and official records as well as the opportunity to interview Zhou. Doc. 293-13. The Federal Express mailing label addressed to Xiaoming also was included. Doc. 293-13 at 4. Finally, attached to the Application was a sworn declaration signed by Government attorney Patrick Runkle attesting to the above. Doc. 293-15. The process followed by the Government in this case is substantially the same process described in\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, the Government provided Defendants with more than enough evidence to prove that it submitted the Request. More importantly, the Application and its attachments were sufficient to support Judge Fitzwater's tolling order. Finally, because Defendants have not been provided with the actual Request, their argument that the Government did not wholly comply with the MLAA's requirements for making an official request is speculative.

Defendants also argue that the FDA did not allege that USP's products were adulterated until the day after the FDA's \"proceedings\" were completed, so any sales of OEP products during said \"proceedings\" could not have obstructed or impeded the due and proper administration of the law.

Doc. 387 at 17-18. Defendants assert that the FDA's authority to demand information during an inspection is limited by specific grants of statutory authority, and Defendants' alleged omission of information is not a criminal act because they had no duty to disclose.

The latter two charges are based on an October 2013 shipment of OEP-AF with a label that falsely declared CA root extract as an ingredient in the product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss the respective counts against them pursuant to Rule 12(b)(3)(B)(v) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for failure to state an offense. Doc. 383 at 1. They argue that Counts 5, 8, and 9 fail to establish that the identification of CA as an \"extract\" on OEP-AF's label and related advertisements is false and misleading. Doc. 383 at 3. Defendants assert that, according to the dictionary definition of the term \"extract,\" the CA root utilized in OEP-AF is in fact an extract because Defendant Geissler stated that it was \"washed with water to remove fibers and sh-t.\" Doc. 383 at 5 (defining \"extract\" per Merriam Webster's Dictionary as \"a product (such as an essence or concentrate) prepared by extracting; especially: a solution (as in alcohol) of essential constituents of a complex material (such as meat or an aromatic plant).\" Defendants further note that the dictionary definition of extract also means \"to withdraw (something, such as a juice or a constituent element) by physical or chemical process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting MERRIAM WEBSTER'S DICT. ) (online ed. 2017) ). Defendants claim that under these definitions, the form of CA used in OEP-AF was an \"extract,\" even as pulverized powder, because the process described by Defendant Geissler \"withdrew\" a portion of the root from fibers and other materials contained in the root \"by a physical ... process,\" prior to converting the substance into powder. Doc. 383 at 5-6. In the alternative, Defendants argue that Count 5 should be dismissed because the Indictment does not allege facts sufficient to establish that the alleged \"extract\" misrepresentation was material to consumers or that CA powder does not confer the same benefits as CA extract. Doc. 383 at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   The Government responds that the issue of whether the ingredient in OEP-AF was an extract is a question for the jury. Doc. 407 at 3-4. The Government points out that the Indictment, which is valid on its face, alleges that pulverized root of CA is not the same as CA extract, and the allegations in the Indictment must be taken as true in addressing a motion to dismiss. Doc. 407 at 3-4. As for the materiality of Defendants' representations specifically in relation to Count 5, the Government urges that the Indictment's alleged facts permit an inference of materiality and, that too, is a question for the fact-finder.

The Indictment here makes several allegations that pertain to the materiality element of Count 5. Among other things, the Indictment alleges that Defendants created and used a promotional write-up for OEP-AF that touted \"ethanol extracts\" of the CA root as among the \"hard-hitting super extracts\" in the product. Doc. 95 at 16. Defendants stated that these extracts had produced \"exciting emerging data\" in scientific studies when, as alleged in the Indictment, the extract Defendants advertised was not in the product. Doc. 95 at 16. Defendants admit in their motion that OEP-AF contained no ethanol extract of CA (they claim it was a \"water\" extract). Doc. 383 at 5-6. They also admit that the advertising text as alleged in the Indictment appeared on their website. Doc. 383 at 6. These allegations are sufficient to infer materiality because, if true, Defendants falsely stated in advertising that their dietary supplement contained a \"hard-hitting\" extract that had produced \"exciting emerging [scientific] data.\" Further, if proven, it is also apparent that Defendants made these misrepresentations to convince consumers to buy their product. It is inarguable that consumers purchase dietary supplements, in part, based on their purported ingredients and the supposed effects of those ingredients. Thus, Defendants' alleged statements about what their supplements contained are material to those buying decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Defendants USPlabs, LLC, Jacobo Geissler, Jonathan Doyle, Matthew Hebert, S.K.

Doc. 392 at 1, 4-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   Miles alleges that he was hired by USP in June 2012 - years after the alleged conspiracies began - as a salaried employee for the position of Chief Compliance Officer and he was not the \"quality assurance executive\" the Indictment describes. Doc. 392 at 5-6 (arguing that the quality assurance executive was Lorena Macias). Miles contends that his role at USP was to improve its \"Good Manufacturing Procedures\" in compliance with the FDA regulations. Doc. 392 at 5-6. In doing so, Miles alleges that he necessarily relied on representations from USP's owners, his fellow employees, legal counsel, and independent auditors. Doc. 392 at 5. As such, Miles argues that he did not have the power or authority to take necessary measures to prevent or remedy the alleged violations of the FDCA statute nor was he privy to the emails, falsified documents, or communications which the Government claims as proof of intent to defraud and mislead in Counts 9 and 10. Doc. 392 at 5-8. Further, Miles contends that he was completely unaware that OEP was causing \"liver issues\" or that the other Defendants were hiding that information. Doc. 392 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Again, the Government maintains that (1) the Indictment sufficiently charges Miles as being responsible for FDCA compliance and shipping and causing the shipment of products in violation of the FDCA; and (2) Miles' arguments that he had no such responsibility and could not have prevented the criminal acts are factual disputes that can only be resolved by a jury.

He first argues that the allegations and undisputed facts establish that the ingredient at issue was an extract, or at least that Willson believed it to be, so he cannot be properly alleged to have made or intended to make a false representation. Doc. 394 at 1-2. Additionally, Willson asserts that the Indictment's allegations are vague because they do not explain what an \"extract\" is.
