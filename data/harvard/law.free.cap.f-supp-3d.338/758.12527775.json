Doc. 60. The relevant factual assertions in the Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) statement cite evidentiary material in the record and are supported by the cited material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.D. Ill. L.R. 56.1(a) (\"The statement referred to in (3) shall consist of short numbered paragraphs, including within each paragraph specific references to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other supporting materials relied upon to support the facts set forth in that paragraph.\"). Local Rule 56.1(b)(3)(B) required Wigod to file a \"concise response to [PNC's Local Rule 56.1(a)(3) ] statement ... contain[ing] a response to each numbered paragraph in the moving party's statement, including, in the case of any disagreement, specific references to the affidavits, parts of the record, and other supporting materials relied upon.\" N.D.

On August 31, 2016, Wigod applied to PNC for a modification of her mortgage loan. Doc. 53 at \u00b6 1. PNC responded on October 12 with a letter stating that additional information was needed to complete the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2; Doc. 53-1 at p. 3, \u00b6 3. Wigod's husband faxed PNC the document completing her application during the evening of Saturday, October 22. Doc. 53 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Doc. 53-1 at pp. 29-32. The next business day was Monday, October 24. Doc. 53 at \u00b6 5. On November 23, 2016, PNC sent a letter to Wigod denying the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Count I of the operative complaint alleges that PNC violated the ECOA, as implemented by its Regulation B, by notifying her of the denial of her application more than thirty days after it received the completed application. Doc. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 42-50. Regulation B states in relevant part: \"A creditor shall notify an applicant of action taken within[ ] 30 days after receiving a completed application concerning the creditor's approval of, counteroffer to, or adverse action on the application.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.9\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(i). PNC argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because it did not \"receiv[e]\" Wigod's completed application until Monday, October 24, 2016-the first business day after Wigod's husband, on Saturday, October 22, faxed the document that completed the application-and then sent the denial notice on November 23, exactly thirty days later. Doc. 52 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The problem for PNC is that the regulation requires a creditor to provide notification \"within[ ] 30 days after receiving a completed application,\" not \"within[ ] 30 days\n   <em>\n    of the first business day\n   </em>\n   after receiving the completed application on a weekend.\" When the drafters of Regulation B wished to measure time with reference to business days, they did so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.14\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (requiring creditors to provide an applicant with a copy of an appraisal \"promptly upon completion [of the appraisal], or three\n   <em>\n    business days\n   </em>\n   prior to consummation of the transaction ..., whichever is earlier\") (emphasis added). The fact that the drafters did not reference business days in Regulation B's thirty-day provision means that the provision measures time in calendar days, not business days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dean v.

As PNC sees it, to \"receive\" something requires \"affirmative acceptance by the receiving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Because PNC says that it was closed on Saturday, October 22, the earliest that affirmative act could have occurred for the document that completed Wigod's application was Monday,\n   October 24, when it reopened for business. PNC's submission cannot be reconciled with common usage.

Wigod sent PNC an appeal letter seeking clarification \"as to the inputs used to determine [her] income or credit obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.

Count II of the operative complaint alleges that PNC violated this provision because its letter to Wigod did not provide specific reasons for denying her application; Count II also seeks relief on behalf of a purported national \"Vague Notice\" class. Doc. 28 at \u00b6\u00b6 33, 51-57. PNC seeks dismissal of Wigod's individual claim on the ground that it is protected by the ECOA's safe harbor. Doc. 34 at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The safe harbor protects a creditor from ECOA liability for \"any act done ... in good faith in conformity with any official rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the [Consumer Financial Protection] Bureau [\"CFPB\"].\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691e(e). In Appendix C to Regulation B, the CFPB set forth ten \"sample notification forms\" that are \"intended for use in notifying an applicant that adverse action has been taken\" under \u00a7 1002.9(a)(2)(i).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , App. C. Form C-1 lists this explanation as among the grounds that may be used to justify an adverse action regarding credit: \"Excessive obligations in relation to income.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Form C-1. PNC's notice to Wigod identified, in slightly different words, this very reason for denying her loan modification application: \"Income insufficient to support credit obligations.\" Doc. 28 at \u00b6 23. Although the language PNC used does not mimic the language in Form C-1, both unmistakably provide the identical reason for an adverse action: given the applicant's existing debt burden, her income is too low to justify the extension of additional credit. PNC's language thus falls within the safe harbor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Payne v. Diner's Club Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7400734\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/696/1153/#p1157\">\n    696 F.Supp. 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (S.D. Ohio 1988) (rejecting a vague notice claim where \"the [creditor's] statement was substantially similar to the sample forms in Appendix C of the regulation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Wigod argues that PNC's explanation, \"Income insufficient to support credit obligations,\" is confusing because it \"leaves Wigod and others guessing as to whether the bank believes their incomes are insufficient to handle their current obligations or, conversely, whether their incomes meet their present-day debts but are inadequate to support any additional obligations.\" Doc. 39 at 8. Precisely the same attack could be made on the language set forth in Form C-1-\"Excessive obligations in relation to income\"-and that attack necessarily would be defeated by the safe harbor. It follows that the attack on the materially identical language used by PNC is defeated by the safe harbor as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Even putting aside the safe harbor, Wigod's argument that her notice was improperly vague fails. Wigod purports to be confused whether her \"present-day obligations are the issue or whether the amount of new credit sought presents the problem.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. The answer is, of course, both. In denying Wigod's loan modification application, PNC had no reason to inform her that her income was insufficient to support her\n   <em>\n    current\n   </em>\n   obligations, irrespective of the loan modification she requested. The sole purpose of PNC's notice was to communicate a decision on Wigod's application for\n   <em>\n    modified\n   </em>\n   credit terms. That context makes clear\n   that PNC's reason for denying Wigod's modification request, \"Income insufficient to support credit obligations,\" meant that Wigod had too little income and too much preexisting debt to support the modified credit terms she was seeking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The sufficient specificity of PNC's statement is confirmed by comparing it with the statements found to be too vague in the two cases cited by Wigod. Doc. 39 at 9-10. Both cases were decided under a related ECOA provision,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201691\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A), which requires creditors to \"provid[e] statements of reasons in writing ... to applicants against whom adverse action is taken.\" In the first case, the creditor simply identified \"credit-related information obtained from sources other than consumer reporting agencies\" as the reason for adverse action.\n   <em>\n    Stoyanovich v.

In the second case, the Fifth Circuit held that \"credit references are insufficient\" was impermissibly vague because it was unclear whether the number of references was too low (a \"quantitative inadequacy\"), or whether the references themselves were negative (a \"qualitative deficiency\").\n   <em>\n    Fischl v.

As noted, Regulation B requires a creditor to provide the applicant \"[a] statement of specific reasons\" for taking an adverse action. Nothing in that provision indicates that the statement is inadequate if the reason given by the creditor turns out to be factually unfounded. This is not to applaud a creditor's use of incorrect information to deny an application; it is only to say that doing so does not violate Regulation B's \"statement of specific reasons\" requirement. Indeed, the Seventh Circuit has explained that a principal aim of the ECOA's notice requirement is that \"[i]n those cases where the creditor may have acted on misinformation or inadequate information, the statement of reasons gives the applicant a chance to rectify the mistake.\"\n   <em>\n    Treadway v.

Accordingly, any\n   factual error underlying PNC's notice to Wigod did not violate Regulation B, but rather gave her the opportunity to bring the error to PNC's attention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To this, Wigod says that she\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   bring to PNC's attention its error regarding her income, but that PNC violated the ECOA by \"refus[ing] to comply with the notification requirements after being informed of its error.\" Doc. 39 at 11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3335219\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/522/835/\">\n    522 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   841 ). The court at this stage accepts Wigod's factual allegation as true. The trouble for Wigod is that she does not explain how this particular action violated any provision of Regulation B or the ECOA as a whole. As\n   <em>\n    Sayers\n   </em>\n   observes, Regulation B provides that \"[a] creditor's failure to comply with [ \u00a7 1002.9 ] is not a violation if it results from an inadvertent error,\" as long as the creditor corrects the error \"as soon as possible\" after discovering it.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201002.16\">\n    12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1002.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

But that is not the claim presented in Count II of the operative complaint. Wigod's claim alleges only that PNC's notice did not have the specificity demanded by Regulation B's \"statement of specific reasons\" provision-after all, she named the putative class seeking relief under Count II the \"Vague Notice Class,\" Doc. 28 at \u00b6 33-and for the reasons given above, PNC's notice is not unlawfully vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Wigod's ECOA vague notice claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Doc. 39 at 13. The trouble with this response is that those provisions have nothing to do with Wigod's modification application. To state a good faith and fair dealing claim, Wigod must allege that PNC exercised in bad faith its discretion under a provision that obligated the bank to respond to modification applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Echo, Inc. v.

Indeed, the same situation could theoretically arise any time a class definition contains a term over whose scope lawyers could argue (which is to say, always).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In any event, even if PNC's fail-safe argument had merit, it would not require striking Wigod's class allegations, but rather would warrant refining the class definition at the class certification stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Messner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722982\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/802/#p824\">\n    669 F.3d at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A fail-safe problem] can and often should be solved by refining the class definition rather than by flatly denying class certification.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   PNC's summary judgment motion on Count I (ECOA late notice claim) is denied, as is PNC's motion to strike that count's class allegations. PNC's motion to dismiss is granted. Counts II (ECOA vague notice claim), III (good faith and fair dealing claim), and IV (ICFA claim) of the operative complaint are dismissed, but the dismissal is without prejudice to repleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Runnion ex rel. Runnion v. Girl Scouts of Greater Chi. &amp; Nw. Ind.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190984\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/510/#p519\">\n    786 F.3d 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 (7th Cir. 2015) (\"Ordinarily, ... a plaintiff whose original complaint has been dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) should be given at least one opportunity to try to amend her complaint before the entire action is dismissed.\"). Wigod has until February 28, 2018 to file a second amended complaint. If Wigod files a second amended complaint, PNC shall file its response by March 14, 2018. If Wigod does not file a second amended complaint, the dismissal of Counts II, III, and IV will convert automatically to a dismissal with prejudice.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
