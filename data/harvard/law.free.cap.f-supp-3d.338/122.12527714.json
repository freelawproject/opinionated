(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21).

Here, the ALJ did not rely on any treating source opinion evidence in determining Plaintiff's RFC; indeed, the Commissioner concedes that the opinions offered by three of Plaintiff's\n   providers regarding the Plaintiff's RFC were not \"medical opinions.\" (Dkt. 14-1 at 15-21).

At the outset, the Court notes that the record is missing treatment records from Dr. Silvestri, Plaintiff's treating neurologist. (Dkt. 7 at 40-41). Plaintiff testified that she visited Dr. Silvestri every two to three months to receive treatment for her March 2013 stroke, and that she has residual effects from her stroke. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41). Although the ALJ left the record open for a week following the hearing to accommodate submission of additional medical records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 55), no such records were received. This gap in the record illustrates that the record in this case is not clear or complete, and it was not appropriate for the ALJ to render an opinion in absence of a medical opinion relating to Plaintiff's functional capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to his written decision, the ALJ arrived at Plaintiff's RFC by reviewing Plaintiff's medical history beginning in March 2013, which consists mostly of documents relating to treatment notes, examinations, and test results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-19). The ALJ also considered physical assessments submitted by Elizabeth Stom, MSFT, and Jill Galley, PA-C. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20). The ALJ assigned little weight to Ms. Galley's opinion, based on the fact that she is not a medical expert recognized by the social security laws and regulation, and other medical evidence in the record did not support her opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20). The ALJ ultimately determined Plaintiff's RFC based on her medical records from 2013 and 2014, neurological examinations, and Ms. Stom's functional capacity examination, which noted self-limiting behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Based on this information,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [t]he Administrative Law Judge conclude[d] that due to the claimant's complaints of pain in her upper and lower extremities, it is reasonable to limit her lifting and carrying to no more than 10 pounds frequently and 20 pounds occasionally. Due to the claimant's complaints of pain and the side effects of medication ... it is reasonable to find that she should not be exposed to unprotected height or dangerous moving machinery and should occasionally kneel, crouch crawl and balance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The ALJ's method for determining Plaintiff's RFC was inappropriate based on the medical information in the record. Where the record primarily discusses a plaintiff's impairments, symptoms, and treatment, but does not shed light on the plaintiff's physical limitations, the ALJ may not rely on the record in determining the plaintiff's RFC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trippett v.
