It is uncontested that \"a valid agreement to arbitrate exists\" between BPP and Carlisle, that Carlisle is \"entitled to invoke the arbitration clause,\" and that both BPP and Carlisle are \"bound by that clause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Docket No. 163, Ex. 1; Docket Nos. 172 and 173. BPP and Carlisle signed the settlement agreement with the arbitration clause, making BPP party to the arbitration dispute. (Docket No. 163, Ex. 1 at pp. 12-14.) Carlisle is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause as a party to the settlement agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson &amp; Johnson Int'l v. P.R. Hosp.

(\"The second requirement ... that the parties moving to compel arbitration be entitled to invoke the arbitration clause.... is satisfied where the movants are signatories or parties to the agreement containing the arbitration provision.\"). BPP does not challenge the validity of the arbitration clause, nor does it deny its or Carlisle's status as being parties to the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The dispute also falls squarely within the scope of the arbitration clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Access Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199997\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/367/#p375\">\n    638 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   375 ; Docket No. 173 at pp. 3-6. The arbitration clause states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   If during the course of the performance of the Roof Work, disputes arise between BPP and Carlisle regarding the quality, acceptability, completion, workmanship, or the timeliness of the Roof Work, those disputes shall be resolved in the first instance by agreement between BPP and Carlisle of their representatives. In the event that BPP and Carlisle cannot agree on the resolution of the dispute, the dispute shall be referred to ... a neutral third party decision maker (the \"Arbitrator\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Docket No. 163, Ex. 1 at p. 9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   BPP disputes the timeliness of the roof work. (Docket No. 170 at pp. 3-6.) BPP contends that it \"has still not received the requested dates or performance schedule,\" and that \"Carlisle has not initiated an effort to perform its remaining Roof Work obligations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. BPP provides email communications between BPP and Carlisle to demonstrate the parties' efforts and failure to schedule the roof work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 10-26. BPP, nonetheless, argues that this dispute is outside the scope of the arbitration clause. According to BPP, the arbitration clause does not apply to its claims because \"Carlisle's failures or refusals to undertake\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   performance cannot have occurred and are not occurring during Carlisle's performance of Roof Work.\" (Docket No. 173 at p. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The dispute, however, arises precisely from the roof work, as supported by the email communications attached to BPP's motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 170 at pp. 10-26 (\"From our perspective almost three roofs are finished. We need to make sure the change orders are processed and paid.\"). Because the parties have \"a valid agreement to arbitrate,\" Carlisle is entitled to invoke the arbitration clause, BPP \"is bound by that clause,\" and BPP's claims \"come[ ] within the clause's scope,\" the Court is \"satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration ... is not at issue\" and compels the parties to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dialysis Access Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199997\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/367/#p375\">\n    638 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   375 ;\n   <em>\n    Rent-A-Ctr., W., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    561 U.S. at 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455276,3644316\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/63/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
