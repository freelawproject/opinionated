The actions have little in common, as they involve such disparate matters as the conditions of plaintiff's confinement at various federal correctional facilities, the handling of plaintiff's mail, plaintiff's access to computers and legal resources, and the denial of plaintiff's naturalization application. Plaintiff has not demonstrated that centralization under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the motion for centralization of these actions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   MDL No. 2860 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: MANETIRONY CLERVRAIN LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Eastern District of California\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   CLERVRAIN v.
