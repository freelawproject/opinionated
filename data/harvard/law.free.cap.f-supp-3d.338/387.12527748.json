BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On March 15, 2016, Defendant entered a guilty plea in this Court to five counts of manufacturing child pornography, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and one count of possession of child pornography, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202252\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B). Defendant pleaded guilty to taking inappropriate photographs of children on five separate occasions between August of 2010 and July of 2015, while working as a photographer for a local radio station's \"Kids Corner\" events for children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant admitted that he worked for the radio station for 26 years, and misused \"his position as a photographer for the radio station to record children and infants in sexually explicit positions as they bathed and changed in public.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant also pleaded guilty to possessing pornographic photographs of children that he took from child pornography sites on the internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plea agreement, signed by Defendant, contained a provision waiving Defendant's right to collaterally attack his conviction, except for specifically delineated situations including raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. After reviewing the plea agreement, including this provision, with Defendant, this Court accepted Defendant's guilty plea as knowingly and voluntarily entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was later sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months of incarceration, below the guideline range of 292 to 365 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant now challenges his conviction on four grounds: (1) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate diminished capacity and involuntary intoxication defenses, (2) the government failed to prove one of the elements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (3) the police violated Defendant's Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they searched Defendant's person and property, seized electronics and photographs, and interrogated him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) Defendant's conviction in this Court violated the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment in light of the prior state court proceedings based on the same conduct. The government argues that each of these claims is barred by the collateral review waiver, and that Defendant's challenges are without merit even if not waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), a prisoner serving a sentence in federal custody may petition the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence by asserting that \"the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relief under AEDPA is extraordinary and \"generally available only to protect against a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are properly raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Collateral Waiver Provision in the Plea Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Through a plea agreement, a criminal defendant may \"waive many of the most fundamental protections afforded by the Constitution,\" provided it is done knowingly and voluntarily.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   A collateral attack waiver provision is valid where it is: (1) entered into knowingly and voluntarily and (2) enforcement of the waiver does not work a miscarriage of justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[A] court has an affirmative duty both to examine the knowing and voluntary nature of the waiver and to assure itself that its enforcement\n   works no miscarriage of justice based on the record evidence before it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the change of plea hearing, the government summarized the terms of the plea agreement, including Defendant's agreement to waive his \"rights to appeal or collaterally attack his conviction, sentence, or any other matter relating to the prosecution\" with certain exceptions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Defendant stated that he agreed to the terms of the plea as stated by the government.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant stated that he understood the rights he was giving up by pleading guilty, including the \"right to file any appeal in this case or any later challenge, such as a habeas corpus motion to either vacate, set aside, or correct [Defendant's] sentence.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court found Defendant to be \"fully alert,\" \"competent,\" \"fully capable of entering an informed plea,\" and that the plea was knowing and voluntary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Enforcing the waiver provision as to Defendant's claims that the government failed to prove each element of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202251\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that Defendant's constitutional rights were violated when the police questioned him, searched his property, and seized his photographs and electronics, and that Defendant's conviction in this Court violated Defendant's Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy, would not result in a \"miscarriage of justice.\" In determining whether enforcement of a waiver provision constitutes a miscarriage of justice, the court uses a \"common sense approach\" based on review of the underlying facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no list of circumstances that result in a miscarriage of justice, and the Third Circuit has instructed that courts should consider \"the clarity of the error, its gravity, its character (e.g., whether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing guideline, or a statutory maximum),\n   the impact of the error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the error on the government, and the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   A waiver is valid, not only for frivolous matters, but even where a Defendant seeks to appeal \"difficult or debatable legal issues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Courts apply the miscarriage of justice exception sparingly and without undue generosity, but with the aim of avoiding manifest injustice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant has not identified any \"nonfrivolous ground, not covered by the waiver, for a ... collateral attack.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant does not allege that he was misled regarding his plea or that there were any constitutional problems with the process by which he pled guilty, and therefore, Defendant voluntarily and knowingly \"acquiesced in the result.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, in light of his guilty plea, Defendant cannot now raise the claim that his constitutional rights were violated when the police searched his person and home, seized his electronics and pornographic photographs, and questioned him. A guilty plea \"is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that\" it \"renders irrelevant those constitutional violations not logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, a defendant who voluntarily and knowingly enters a guilty plea \"may not ... raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights\n   that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant does not suggest that any of the constitutional violations he alleges influenced his decision to plead guilty, and, in light of his voluntary guilty plea, his conviction \"does not rest in any way on evidence that may have been improperly seized.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not explicitly exempted from the collateral attack waiver and will be considered on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To prevail on a collateral attack based on ineffective assistance of counsel, a Defendant must demonstrate: (1) that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness based on prevailing professional norms and (2) that the deficient representation was prejudicial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In determining whether counsel has satisfied the objective standard of reasonableness set forth in the first prong, courts must be highly deferential toward counsel's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   To satisfy the prejudice prong, the defendant must show that, but for counsel's errors, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Where, as here, a defendant pleads guilty, the second prong is modified so that \"the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]here the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise the defendant of a potential affirmative defense to the crime charged, the resolution of the 'prejudice' inquiry will depend largely on whether the affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, \"where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to investigate or discover potentially exculpatory evidence,\" determining whether a defendant is prejudiced depends on whether the \"discovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate potential diminished capacity and involuntary intoxication defenses. However, counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to explain a course of action that, like the\n   potential defenses asserted by Defendant, would have no chance of success.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant argues that his counsel should have pursued an involuntary intoxication defense based on his \"substance abuse\" which \"could have by itself caused certain forms of organic brain damage.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Defendant argues that he had a viable diminished capacity defense because he has poor memory due to head injuries, suffers from depression, has a history of marijuana and cocaine abuse, and that \"credible testimony\" from a psychologist or psychiatrist who worked with Defendant would report him to have \"special needs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Defendant's alleged issues with memory and depression would not have allowed him to defeat any of the elements of the crimes to which he pled guilty. Defendant has not alleged that he was intoxicated at the times of the offenses, which spanned five years, nor has he explained how his issues with memory or depression are exculpatory. In fact, at the plea colloquy, Defendant acknowledged his mental health issues,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, despite these issues, explained that he discussed his plea agreement thoroughly with counsel and agreed to the government's factual proffer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The record also does not support a finding that the discovery of additional evidence related to these defenses would \"have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Defendant contends that his counsel failed to investigate his mental health issues, the record shows that, in the face of overwhelming evidence against Defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   counsel brought forth many of these issues in mitigation at sentencing, including obtaining many letters from family and friends,\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court imposed a sentence well below the guideline range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant failed to overcome the \"strong presumption\" that his counsel's actions fell \"within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance\" and were \"sound ... strategy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim will be denied on its merits, and the government's motion to dismiss will be granted as to all other claims, which are barred by the\n   collateral attack waiver in Defendant's plea agreement.
