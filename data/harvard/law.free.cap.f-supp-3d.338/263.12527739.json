Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"Chase\"). Prior to the instant case, Chase brought a foreclosure action in New Jersey state court and obtained a final judgment against Plaintiff on September 7, 2017, after Plaintiff's default. Plaintiff alleges that the underlying promissory note and mortgage she signed may have been securitized and sold to Government National Mortgage Association (\"Ginnie Mae\"), sued here as the Trustee for Ginnie Mae Remic Trust 2010-127. The Complaint asserts claims for (1) wrongful foreclosure, premised on a lack of standing; (2) fraud in the concealment; (3) fraud in the inducement; (4) unconscionable contract; (5) breach of contract; (6) breach of fiduciary duty; (7) quiet title; (8) slander of title; and (9) declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and (6) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. As discussed below, the Court concludes that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine bars Plaintiffs' claims for wrongful foreclosure, unconscionability, quiet title, slander of title, and declaratory relief; Plaintiff lacks standing to bring her fraud claims;\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    judicata\n   </em>\n   bars the remaining claims against Chase; and Plaintiff does not state a claim against Ginnie Mae. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Andrea Hylton is a New Jersey resident.

The Mortgage served as security for repayment of the Note. (Sampson Decl., Ex. A (Mortgage) (Dkt.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5) Plaintiff submitted four applications for a loan modification over the next three years, but Chase denied all her applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6) After the last denial, a law firm representing Chase notified Plaintiff that a foreclosure action would be filed 40 days after her \"denial date.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9) Plaintiff alleges that on \"November 14, 2017, a Sheriff's Sale notification was placed on [her] front door with a sale date of November 7, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff complains that Chase \"had no intention of giving me a loan modification and while I was in the process of what I believed to be another loan modification, they filed for foreclosure on the property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Although Plaintiff asserts in her affidavit that Chase purchased the Note in October 2010, the Complaint suggests that the Note may have been sold to the Ginnie\n   Mae Trust in October 2010 and securitized.

The MORTGAGE was never transferred. The $190,673.00 note may have been however pooled, sold, transferred with other loans and mortgages and this pool of loans and mortgages in this security offering of $434,791,274.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 (Forensic Report) (Dkt.

Carrigan \"did, however, locate a REMIC TRUST that matches the characteristics for securitizing this loan, namely the\n   <strong>\n    GINNIE MAE REMIC TRUST 2010-127\n   </strong>\n   issued October 29, 2010.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 (Carrigan Aff.) at 28) (emphasis in original)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Carrigan's forensic report also states that Plaintiff's loan is a \"Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. Most of the loans Ginnie Mae insures are FHA or Veterans Administration (VA) loans.... GINNIE MAE guarantees principal and interest of the securitized trusts that it formed. This is an indication that the loan is securitized with Ginnie Mae as the sponsor of the mortgage backed securities (MBS) mortgage pool.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The report goes on to state that\n   <strong>\n    \"[a]lthough Aurora Financial\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    Group Inc[.] originated the loan, any subsequent purchaser may not have properly endorsed the subject note nor perfected the security interest in the note pursuant to the\n    <em>\n     New Jersey\n    </em>\n    Uniform Commercial Code.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40) The Assignment is signed by Ashley J. Collins, Assistant Secretary of MERS. The Forensic Report asserts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Ashley Collins signs for Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., as Assistant Secretary of MERS while admitting she is an Assignee employee. This is an indication that Ashley Collins attempted to assign the Mortgage to client JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. without an Assignor. Document is an Assignee-signed document and is invalid. This position of unilateral transfer is further strengthened by the fact that [t]here is no evidence of verified proof of funds; a note endorsement; a bill of sale; a declaration of value; or transfer taxes as having been paid to Burlington County, New Jersey \"For Good and Valuable Consideration[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Complaint claims that the \"Ashley Collins\" endorsement on the Assignment of Mortgage is \"a likely forgery.\" (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 1) \u00b6 9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Complaint also purports to quote from a declaration by Carrigan, which has not been provided to the Court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, \u00b6 6) The Complaint states that Carrigan performed a search for Plaintiff's loan on \" 'Freddie Mac's' loan look-up tool\" - available on the Freddie Mac website - and that his search yielded results indicating that \"Ginnie Mae owns [Plaintiff's] mortgage and ... note.\" (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13) The Complaint further represents that Carrigan had concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [w]ithin a reasonable degree of investigative certainty, ... that contrary to the chain of assignments, and [Chase's] position that it owns the Hylton Mortgage, evidence shows the subject Mortgage and Note is owned by Ginnie Mae. The facts surrounding the sale of the subject Mortgage to Ginnie Mae have not been disclosed, and thus a fraud has very likely been perpetrated upon the Court. The concealment of the sale to Ginnie Mae, along with evidence that the \"Ashley Collins\" endorsement upon the note is a likely forgery, means the \"original Note\" is not in the possession of [Chase].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 23, 2015, Chase filed a mortgage foreclosure action against Plaintiff and her husband in Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery Division, Burlington County (the \"Foreclosure Action\"). (Sampson Decl., Ex. C (Foreclosure Action Complaint) (Dkt. No. 15-3) ) In the complaint in that action, Chase states that Plaintiff has \"failed to make the payment that became due on January 1, 2015, and all payments becoming due thereafter, and is therefore in default as of January 1, 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7) On September 7, 2017, Chase obtained a final judgment against Plaintiff in the amount of $209,130.46 plus interest and costs.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cmplt. (Dkt.

Indeed, the Mortgage Plaintiff executed simultaneously with the Note explicitly warns Plaintiff that the Note and Mortgage might be sold:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   The Note or a partial interest in the Note (together with this Security Instrument) can be sold one or more times without prior notice to Borrower. A sale might result in a change in the entity (known as the \"Loan Servicer\") that collects Periodic Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument and performs other mortgage loan servicing obligations under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Mortgage (Dkt. No. 15-1) \u00a7 20) Moreover, Plaintiff has not suggested that she was subjected to duplicate collection or duplicate foreclosure efforts. Indeed, it is clear from the complaint and final judgment in the Foreclosure Action that Chase alone pursued foreclosure. (Sampson Decl., Exs. B &amp; E (Foreclosure Action Complaint &amp; Final Judgment) (Dkt. Nos. 15-2 &amp; 15-5) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Complaint next alleges that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   60.

In fact, Defendants were not entitled to do so and have no legal, equitable, or actual beneficial interest whatsoever in the Property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   61. Defendants misrepresented that they are the \"holder and owner\" of the Tangible Note and the beneficiary of the Mortgage/Deed of Trust. However, this was not true and was a misrepresentation of material fact. Documents state that the Originator allegedly sold the mortgage loan instrument to GINNIE MAE REMIC TRUST. Defendants are attempting to collect on an intangible debt obligation via the \u00a7 1031 - Exchange to which they have no legal, equitable, or pecuniary interest relating to Plaintiff's Real Property....

As in\n   <em>\n    Rajamin\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff's suggestion that some other entity owns the Note and Mortgage does not demonstrate an injury-in-fact, because she has not demonstrated that any entity other than Chase attempted to foreclose on the Mortgage, that she has been the subject of duplicative collection efforts, or that she has paid more than she owed or was asked to do so.

In these claims, Plaintiff contends that Defendants have breached provisions of the Mortgage. As to Ginnie Mae, it appears that Plaintiff's theory is that one Ginnie Mae entity held her loan for a period of time and then transferred it to an affiliate. According to Plaintiff, when this transfer took place, the first Ginnie Mae entity was obligated to cancel the security interest entirely under the terms of the Mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cmplt. (Dkt.

Given that Plaintiff has alleged she was subject to foreclosure proceedings (Cmplt. Ex. 1 (Hylton Aff.) (Dkt.
