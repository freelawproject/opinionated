Plaintiffs allege that PA 436 is facially discriminatory because it was adopted with knowing intent that the measures resulting in the total loss of local governing power would be disproportionately imposed on black communities given the sensitivity of their revenue streams and human services to economic downturns, while majority white communities would escape PA 436's application. As applied, PA 436 allegedly discriminates against black communities while it is not applied to white communities suffering equal or greater financial distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Background of PA 436\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to 1988, municipalities in Michigan that were experiencing financial difficulties could be placed into receivership by the courts. Court-appointed receivers were compensated from the property that the courts placed within the care of the receiver. In 1988, the State of Michigan enacted PA 101, which allowed the State to appoint an emergency financial manager (\"EFM\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   over cities experiencing a financial emergency. In 1990, the legislature replaced PA 101 with the\n   <em>\n    Local Government Fiscal Responsibility Act\n   </em>\n   , PA 72, which authorized Michigan's local financial emergency review board to appoint an EFM only after the Governor declared the local government to be in a financial emergency. The EFM's powers extended to matters of finances, including the authority to renegotiate contracts, while local elected officials remained in control of administrative and policy matters. Under PA 72, the State's local financial emergency review board appointed EFMs in the cities of Benton Harbor, Ecorse, Flint, Hamtramck, Highland Park and Pontiac, as well as over the Detroit Public Schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2011, Michigan repealed PA 72 when it passed the\n   <em>\n    Local Government and School District Fiscal Accountability Act\n   </em>\n   , PA 4. PA 4 converted all EFMs into Emergency Managers (\"EM\") and expanded the scope of their powers. EMs could act \"for and in the place of\" the municipality's elected governing body, including a general grant of legislative power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Citizens gathered signatures to place a referendum on the ballot to reject PA 4. The petitions were certified on August 8, 2012, and by operation of law PA 4 was suspended and PA 72 went back into effect. All PA 4 EMs were reappointed as PA 72 EFMs. At the general election on November 6, 2012, Michigan voters voted to reject PA 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the lame-duck session that followed the repeal of PA 4, the state legislature passed, and the Governor signed, the\n   <em>\n    Local Financial Stability and Choice Act\n   </em>\n   , PA 436. PA 436 changed the title of EFMs to EMs and expanded the scope of their powers to cover all the conduct of local government - both finance and governance. PA 436 contains some new provisions for local government not present in previous laws, including expanded local government options to address the financial emergency\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a procedure to remove the EM after he or she has served 18 months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EMs appointed under PA 4 and EFMs appointed under PA 72 all became EMs under PA 436.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Since PA 436 took effect on March 28, 2013, thirteen local units of government and five school districts have been under emergency management. But currently, no local governments in Michigan are subject to emergency management. Two school districts, Benton Harbor Area Schools, and Pontiac Public Schools, are subject to consent agreements. Muskegon Heights School District is under a receivership transition advisory board (\"TAB\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , but it is not represented by any of the plaintiffs in this case for purposes of bringing an as-applied challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City of Detroit, which proceeded through bankruptcy under an EM, is no\n   longer subject to PA 436. Rather, the City is subject to both the confirmed bankruptcy plan and a legislatively created financial review commission created as part of what was referred to as the \"Grand Bargain.\" \u00a7\u00a7 1631-1638;\n   <em>\n    In re City of Detroit,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338710\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/524/147/#p244\">\n    524 B.R. 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 244 (2014). The Detroit Public Schools (DPS) and its School Board are no longer subject to PA 436. They have been replaced by the new Community Schools District and exist only for the limited purpose of paying off DPS debt.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20380\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .12b (1) - (15) ; 380.383; 380.384. Neither the DPS nor the new Community District is currently subject to PA 436.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Impact of PA 436\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ten of Michigan's thirteen majority black communities had a solution under PA 436 imposed upon them by the State. In contrast, only four majority white communities have come under PA 436, and their city officials selected whether to have an emergency manager or to enter a consent agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Michigan Department of Treasury previously maintained a scoring system to determine the financial health of the State's cities and townships. Fiscal indicator scores between five and seven placed a municipality on a fiscal watch list, while scores between eight and ten resulted in the community receiving consideration for review. Six out of seven communities (85%) with a majority population of racial and ethnic minorities received EMs when they had scores of seven. At the same time, none of the twelve communities with a majority white population received an EM despite having scores of seven or higher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2010 the State's scoring system was taken over by a private company, Munetrix. Munetrix is a municipal financial metrics company that consults with municipalities on budgeting, forecasting and reporting. Their numbers allegedly indicate that numerous predominately white school districts were in as much fiscal distress as those that received EMs, yet no predominately white school district came under PA 436 or received an EM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While recognizing that there are presently no EMs in office, plaintiffs assert that 56% of the State's black population is under the continuing effects of an EM, a consent agreement or a TAB, while only 3% of the State's white population is similarly impacted. Plaintiffs allege that as a result of PA 436, a disproportionate number of minorities are under the control of an EM instead of the local officials who were voted into office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Fed.

No local governments in Michigan have an EM at this time, so defendants argue that plaintiffs' lawsuit is moot. However, under P.A. 436, the EM's budget cannot be amended for two years following a community's exiting of receivership - including all contractual and employment agreements - and EM orders and ordinances cannot be amended for one year following receivership. MCL 141.1561(2). For this reason, plaintiffs argue that most communities are still under PA 436's ongoing restrictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs describe the residual effect of PA 436. The EM is given broad authority during the period of supervision and their decisions have a lasting impact. This is no different than a new city council that is bound by decisions made by its predecessor. Viewed this way, only the two school districts that are currently under a consent agreement, Benton Harbor Area Schools and Pontiac Public Schools, have a claim under the Equal Protection Clause that is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs' next argument, that PA 436 is likely to be invoked again with the next economic downturn, is speculative. As the Sixth Circuit found, PA 436 is not triggered by the wealth of a community but rather by its solvency, which is the result of how a community manages its resources.\n   <em>\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354599\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/707/#p713\">\n    836 F.3d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The harm that plaintiffs allege is from the enforcement of any of PA 436's four remedial options, not only the loss of locally elected officials' governing authority due to the appointment of an EM. Defendants concede that if the court construes the complaint to encompass all four of PA 436's options, then the two school districts have standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Benton Harbor Area Schools and Pontiac Public Schools are currently subject to PA 436 consent agreements. The consent agreement applicable to Pontiac Public Schools provides that if the governor chooses to place the school district into a \"receivership,\" which means an EM will be appointed in response to a material breach of the consent agreement, the district cannot contest that decision. Benton Harbor Area Schools' consent agreement contains very similar provisions. Therefore, in addition to still being subject to PA 436 because they are bound by consent agreements, it is possible that each school district could have an EM reappointed if either district is found to have breached the consent agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court finds that Pontiac City Council Member Kermit Williams and Benton Harbor Commissioners Donald Watkins, Duane Seats, Juanita Henry and Mary Alice Adams have standing to bring this\n   lawsuit on behalf of Benton Harbor Area Schools and Pontiac Public Schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Former State Treasurer Defendants Dillon and Clinton\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs stipulate to dismiss their claims against former State Treasurers Dillon and Clinton for the reason that the claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Equal Protection Clause\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides in relevant part that \"[n]o state shall make or enforce any law which shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The Supreme Court has stated that this language \"embodies the general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly.\"\n   <em>\n    Vacco v.
