Ms. Chandler requested relief for the years of 1997 to 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-A at App. 9. In her Request, Ms. Chandler claimed that she did not know that her ex-husband had filed tax returns during those years with incomplete or missing information.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at App. 9. Ms. Chandler further argued that their taxes were prepared by a professional accounting firm, that her money was not co-mingled with her ex-husband's, and that she was simply \"handed a thick pile of paper each year and told to sign the box.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at App. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The IRS received these forms on November 29, 2011, and ultimately denied Ms. Chandler's Request on December 24, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-B at App. 15. The IRS explained that it denied Ms. Chandler's claim because she failed to show that it was unfair to hold her responsible where she (1) did not prove that she had reason to believe the taxes would be paid at the time she signed the return, and (2) proffered documents that did not show an economic hardship.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The IRS specifically stated in its response that, if Ms. Chandler disagreed with its decision, she could file a petition with the United States Tax Court (\"Tax Court\") to review the denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The letter warned that any appeal must be made within 90 days from the date of denial notification.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Chandler failed to submit an appeal. Instead, after the 90-day window, she filed another Form 8857 with the IRS on September 23, 2012, requesting tax relief for the same years that the IRS had previously denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-C at App. 19. Although the IRS received Ms. Chandler's request after the 90 days had elapsed, it considered the new Form 8857 a request for reconsideration and again denied relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-D at App. 24. Ms. Chandler's attorney went on to file three similar submissions in February, May, and August of 2014, each of which the IRS denied for the lack of any new information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-E at App. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In June 2013, the IRS sent Ms. Chandler a Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income. In response, Ms. Chandler filed a Collection Appeal Request through the IRS's Collection Appeals Program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1 at App. 2. However, the IRS upheld the levy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-J at App. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   From 2014 through 2015, the IRS levied $22,890 in proceeds and applied this money to Ms. Chandler's tax liabilities for 2001 and 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1 at App. 3. But, in May 2015, the IRS wrote off $61,009.67 of Ms. Chandler's federal income tax liabilities for 2001 and $51,381.31 for 2002 because the collection statute of limitations had run.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In July of 2015, Ms. Chandler filed a Claim for Refund form, requesting a refund based upon her innocent spouse relief claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-H at App. 34. The IRS initially refused the claim as untimely but eventually considered its merits and denied it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-I at App. 35. Once more, Ms. Chandler filed a Collection Appeals Request to appeal the denial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 23, Ex. 1-J at App. 37. But, in 2017, the IRS informed Ms. Chandler that IRS Appeals decided to sustain the disallowance of her refund request and that IRS Appeals did not have the authority to address the issue of innocent spouse relief because she failed to petition the Tax Court after that claim was denied several years prior.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206015\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Chandler then filed this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.
