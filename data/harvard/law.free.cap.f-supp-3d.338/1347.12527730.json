VANCE, Chair\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    Before the Panel\n   </strong>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Customs and Tax Administration of the Kingdom of Denmark (SKAT), the common plaintiff, moves under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to centralize this litigation in the Southern District of New York. This litigation now consists of 140 actions pending in 11 districts, as listed on Schedule A. Defendants in 104 actions support centralization in the Southern District of New York. The Tew defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 15 actions in the Eastern District of Kentucky oppose inclusion of their actions in the proposed MDL. Defendants in the remaining actions, as well as the the non-Tew defendants in six Eastern District of Kentucky actions, did not file responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we find that these actions involve common questions of fact, and that centralization will serve the convenience of the parties and witnesses and promote the just and efficient conduct of this litigation. The actions share complex factual questions arising from plaintiff SKAT's allegation that the defendants - 141 U.S. retirement and pension plans and their alleged representatives and agents - engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain tax refunds from SKAT utilizing the services of overlapping individuals and firms that served as their authorized representatives, payment agents, and broker-custodians, following the same pattern of conduct in each action. In particular, SKAT alleges that, in all actions, defendants falsely represented that the plans owned shares in Danish companies, that taxes had been withheld on the dividends, and as tax-exempt entities, they were entitled to refunds under a double taxation treaty between Denmark and the United States. One of four payment agents allegedly was\n   involved in all of the tax refund applications, and these agents in turn allegedly used one of nine broker custodians to provide false documentation of stock ownership and related tax information. The record indicates that discovery is likely to be international in scope and will include a significant number of nonparties. Centralization will eliminate duplicative discovery; prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings, especially with respect to dispositive motions and discovery disputes; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel, and the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The sole opposition to centralization is from the Tew defendants, who argue only against inclusion of the Eastern District of Kentucky actions. They argue that their actions focus on Kentucky-based individuals and entities that have nothing to do with the other actions in this litigation. But the record before the Panel does not support their contention. SKAT alleges that the tax refund claims in the Kentucky actions were part of the alleged common scheme at issue in the broader litigation. Moreover, the brokerage firm allegedly supplying false documentation for the claims at issue in the Kentucky actions is the same firm allegedly involved in 14 actions in six other districts. Thus, we decline the Tew defendants' request to exclude the Eastern District of Kentucky actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We conclude that the Southern District of New York is an appropriate transferee district for this litigation. The majority of actions are concentrated in or near this district, and it is conveniently located for this nationwide litigation. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan is an experienced transferee judge, and he is familiar with the issues raised in this litigation. We are confident he will steer this matter on a prudent course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the actions listed on Schedule A and pending outside the Southern District of New York are transferred to the Southern District of New York and, with the consent of that court, assigned to the Honorable Lewis A. Kaplan for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    SCHEDULE A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   MDL No. 2865 -\n   <strong>\n    IN RE: CUSTOMS AND TAX ADMINISTRATION OF THE KINGDOM OF DENMARK (SKAT) TAX REFUND SCHEME LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    District of Connecticut\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   SKAT v.

These are essentially case management concerns that transferee judges routinely are called upon to address. Additionally, to the extent they are concerned about confusion of the issues at trial, we note that centralization is solely for pretrial purposes. Once discovery and other pretrial proceedings related to the common issues have been completed, the transferee judge may suggest Section 1407 remand of actions to their transferor courts for more individual discovery and trial, if necessary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
