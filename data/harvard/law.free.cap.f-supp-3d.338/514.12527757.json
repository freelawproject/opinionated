Because of certain provisions of a federal law, however, these three children have been threatened with removal from, in some cases, the only family they know, to be placed in another state with strangers. Indeed, their removals are opposed by the children's guardians or biological parent(s), and in one instance a child was removed and placed in the custody of a relative who had previously been declared unfit to serve as a foster parent. As a result, Plaintiffs seek to declare that federal law, known as the Indian Child Welfare Act (the \"ICWA\"), unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this case, the State Plaintiffs have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 72), on April 26, 2018, and the Individual Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 79), on the same day. Plaintiffs seek judgment as a matter of law on all of their claims.

Because two of the three preferences have no connection to a child's tribal membership, this blanket classification of Indian children is not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest and thus fails to survive strict scrutiny review.

First, the ICWA offends the structure of the Constitution by overstepping the division of federal and state authority over Indian affairs by commanding States to impose federal standards in state created causes of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Here, the ICWA regulates states. As stated above, the ICWA requires that the state \"in any adoptive placement of an Indian child under state law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with: (1) a member of the child's extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other Indian families.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

That requirement is, on its face, a direct command from Congress to the states.

Fed. Defs.' Resp. States 29, ECF No. 121. But regardless of the reach of the Indian Commerce Clause, no provision in the Constitution grants Congress the right to \"issue direct orders to the governments of the States,\" and the Indian Commerce Clause can be no different.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"303\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/#p1475\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Trib. Defs.' Resp. 29, ECF No. 118. Preemption generally applies when federal and state law conflict over matters in which they have concurrent jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wyeth v.

Ind. Pls.' Reply 20, ECF No. 143. The issue here is whether Congress established an unambiguous evidentiary standard in section 1915 of the ICWA. That determination is distinct from interpreting the meaning of the term good cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Congress did not codify a preponderance of the evidence standard in section 1915 of the ICWA.

Here, a holistic reading of the statute and the 1979 BIA guidelines confirms that Congress intended the default preponderance of the evidence standard to apply.
