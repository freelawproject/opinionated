What it hoped would be a seamless transition was anything but. According to the amended complaint, the new uniforms created a plague of health problems for American's workforce; within weeks, employees across the company reported developing skin rashes, respiratory problems, vertigo, and other ailments. The number of complaints supposedly grew so large so quickly that American backpedaled on the rollout two months later and permitted employees to revert back to their old uniforms. Within a year, the airline announced that it would cut ties with the uniform manufacturer, Twin Hill Acquisition Company, Inc. (\"Twin Hill\"). In the aftermath of the rollout, eleven American employees filed suit against their employer and Twin Hill on behalf of themselves and all other American employees who have been exposed to the uniforms. Plaintiffs contend that both defendants are liable for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that Twin Hill also is liable in negligence and products liability. Plaintiffs individually seek damages and on behalf of the class seek injunctive relief, including an order requiring Twin Hill to recall the uniforms it has provided to American employees and directing both companies to establish a medical monitoring fund to mitigate any possible long-term health effects to class members. American and Twin Hill responded to the amended complaint by filing\n   a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. Twin Hill also filed a motion strike all class allegations under Rule 12(f) and Rule 23. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants American's motion to dismiss but denies Twin Hill's motions to dismiss and strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In around September 2016, American implemented a uniform change across its worldwide workforce. Am. Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Flight attendants, pilots, other cockpit crew members, and service representatives were required to set aside their old blue uniforms in favor of new grey uniforms manufactured by Twin Hill.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2, 33. The uniform change was American's first in almost thirty years and was the product of several years of planning and development.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33. The change proved to be short lived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly after the companywide rollout-\"within weeks if not days\"-American employees began experiencing adverse reactions to the new uniform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The reactions included skin rashes, ear and throat irritation, headaches, fatigue, vertigo, the triggering of various auto-immune conditions, and negative effects on endocrine and liver functions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The reports of adverse reactions swelled in the months that followed, so much so that two of the unions representing American flight attendants set up special task forces to address the health issues posed by the uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   American had learned of similar reports prior to the rollout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29. Twin Hill had supplied uniforms to Alaska Airlines (\"Alaska\") in 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. However, Alaska was forced to transition to a different vendor after almost one-third of its flight attendants reported adverse health conditions akin to those later experienced by American employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, two years before American introduced Twin Hill uniforms to its workforce, American asked a number of pilots to field test the uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. Many of those pilots reported experiencing ill effects during testing, including rashes, flu-like symptoms, headache, vomiting, and respiratory problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When those adverse reactions came to light, one of the unions representing American pilots asked American not to introduce the uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The union's request went unheeded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early October 2016, about a month after American switched to Twin Hill uniforms, the airline \"formally recognized\" the health concerns posed by the uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. In doing so, American established a call center to address individual complaints about the uniforms and offered employees who had been adversely affected to either order replacement garments or continue wearing their old blue uniform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. American also agreed to perform \"further random testing of garments\" to determine the cause of the reported symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A month later, in November 2016, American went a step further and announced a reversal of the uniform change.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79. The airline permitted employees to obtain new grey uniforms manufactured by a company other than Twin Hill or go back to wearing their old blue uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-80.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Despite these accommodations, health problems continued among American employees. After the November 2016 announcement, \"thousands\" more employees reported adverse reactions, many of whom had never worn a Twin Hill uniform.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83. Some employees also reported an increase in the severity of their symptoms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. The problem, according to the amended complaint, is that these employees have been required to work alongside others who are still wearing Twin Hill uniforms-often in close quarters in aircraft cabins that utilize closed air systems that re-circulate air.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 82. An estimated 25-30% percent of American employees are \"reactors\"; that is, they are individuals who become ill through direct contact with, or being in close proximity to, the Twin Hill uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following these developments, on June 22, 2017, American announced in a letter to employees that it was terminating its relationship with Twin Hill as of 2020.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. The letter, which was signed by several American senior vice presidents, stated that \"[i]t is clear we [American] need a long-term solution because the current approach simply does not work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By September 2017, Twin Hill had shipped over 1.4 million garments and accessories to more than 65,000 American employees worldwide.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. The garments had been manufactured in a number of countries throughout the world, including Bangladesh, Indonesia, China, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. Between September 2016 and September 2017, over 4,700 flight attendants and over 600 pilots, in addition to other cockpit crew members and service representatives, reported experiencing ill effects from Twin Hill uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 57, 85. The introduction of the Twin Hill uniforms was the only single common event that occurred throughout American's workforce during that timeframe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Testing has been conducted on some of the uniform pieces manufactured by Twin Hill for American. Results from those tests indicate that Twin Hill uniforms are manufactured from synthetic materials and contain \"[d]etectable amounts\" of several chemicals, including known and possible carcinogens, as well as chemicals known to cause the type of \"auto-immune\" conditions experienced by American employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 70-74. For example, testing detected the presence of chlordane, a potent carcinogen that is banned in the United States and is known to cause migraines, respiratory problems, immune system problems, blurry vision, confusion, and intractable seizures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Test results also identified the presence of formaldehyde, another known carcinogen that is widely used in industrial applications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Chronic long-term exposure to formaldehyde by inhalation can cause a wide array of health problems ranging from skin rashes and respiratory problems to fatigue and even cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, testing has shown that levels of two other chemicals exceed limits established by OEKO-TEX, an independent testing certification service that sets standards for allowable amounts of chemicals in clothing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. The excess amounts were found in several of the most commonly worn clothing items among American employees, including the suiting skirts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53, 75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In September 2017, eleven American employees filed the present suit against American and Twin Hill. Plaintiffs include seven flight attendants, three pilots, and\n   one service representative who work for American in locations across the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-24. Each plaintiff alleges that he or she was issued Twin Hill uniforms in connection with the companywide rollout in September 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Each plaintiff further alleges that he or she has experienced \"adverse reactions\" while wearing Twin Hill uniforms or being near others who are wearing the uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-48. Finally, plaintiffs allege that, along with thousands of other American employees, they have been \"caught in a nightmarish 'Groundhog Day'-a never ending cycle of (a) going to work, (b) experiencing debilitating symptoms of headaches, fatigue, respiratory problems, vertigo and rashes as of result of working in and around [the uniforms], (c) leaving work and starting to recuperate, (d) only to repeat this again when they return to work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a five-count amended complaint. Counts I and II allege that both American and Twin Hill are liable for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress for exposing plaintiffs to Twin Hill's toxic uniforms. In Counts III and IV, plaintiffs assert that Twin Hill is strictly liable and negligent for manufacturing and supplying defective uniform. Finally, in Count V, plaintiffs seek to hold American and Twin Hill liable under a medical monitoring theory for exposing them to on-going and future risks of developing additional medical complications. The complaint also states that plaintiffs seek to represent a nationwide class of all current and former American employees who were exposed to Twin Hill's uniforms on or after September 1, 2016. On behalf of the class, plaintiffs seek an injunction barring Twin Hill from providing any new uniforms to American and requiring Twin Hill to recall the uniforms it previously supplied to American employees. They also seek to establish a medical monitoring program that includes: (1) a trust fund to pay for the costs of monitoring the health of employees who have been exposed to the uniforms; (2) notification to all affected employees that they may require monitoring to detect any long-term effects from their exposure; and (3) disclosure and analysis of the chemicals present in the uniforms for use by physicians who are to treat American's employees. Finally, the named plaintiffs seek damages for their individual injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   American and Twin Hill responded to the amended complaint by moving to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). American argues that plaintiffs' claims against it are barred by state workers' compensation statutes, which provide the exclusive remedy for on-the-job injuries. Twin Hill contends that plaintiffs fail to state a plausible claim for relief against it largely because there is no basis to conclude its uniforms are the source of the harm alleged. Twin Hill further asks the Court to strike the class allegations in the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(f) and Rule 23 on the basis that plaintiffs will be unable to establish that their claims merit class treatment. Before addressing those motions, the Court must clarify the appropriate pleading standard and identify the substantive law to be applied at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

That principal applies here; the complaint is premised on one core set of facts and establishes a single grievance (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , claim) stemming from plaintiffs' exposure to Twin Hill uniforms. The second import is that, although the defendants challenge the viability of each legal theory asserted against them, plaintiffs' complaint, asserting that single claim, survives if it is supported by any single recognized legal theory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

The intentional harm exception lies at the heart of whether plaintiffs may maintain a suit against their employer. If it can be said that American intended to inflict physical (battery) or emotional (IIED) harm on the plaintiffs, then they can pursue relief against American outside of the workers' compensation system. Resolution of this dispute turns (depending on the jurisdiction) on whether the defendants specifically intended, were certain or were substantially certain that the new Twin Hill uniforms would injure the plaintiffs. Because the allegations of the complaint do not plausibly suggest that American was even substantially certain that any of the named plaintiffs would be injured by the new uniforms, it falls short of stating causes of action for the intentional torts of battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress under the law of any of the Applicable States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Intent, as the term is commonly understood, refers to \"a state of mind ... about the consequences of an act (or omission).\" Prosser &amp; Keaton,\n   <em>\n    The Law of Torts\n   </em>\n   34 (5th ed. 1984).

Inst. 2010) (restyling definition to emphasize \"dual definition\" of intent).

The complaint stops short of alleging that American acted with a purpose to harm anyone. To be sure, plaintiffs contend that American intended its employees to \"come in contact with\" the Twin\n   Hill uniforms and, in the process, become exposed to chemicals in the uniforms. Am. Compl. \u00b6 101. But plaintiffs do not allege that American specifically desired the alleged\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     consequences\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   of the uniform change; namely, that its employees develop skin, respiratory, and other health problems. Plaintiffs instead stake their claim on the notion that American knew the Twin Hill uniforms were unsafe but went forward with the rollout anyway without concern for the consequences to its employees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 33 (\"American and Twin Hill's subsequent conduct shows that they too know that the uniforms are unsafe and exposed thousands of American Airlines employees to health hazards.\"), \u00b6 65 (\"The only explanation for such intentional and reckless conduct on Defendants' part is they have made corporate decisions to avoid confronting this serious problem in order to avoid any potential liability.\"), \u00b6 88 (\"American admitted by its statements and its conduct that it knew that the Twin Hill uniforms had and would continue to cause harm to Plaintiffs and the Class.\").

Pl. Opp'n to AA Br. 6-10, ECF No. 45. In support, they point to allegations showing American received adverse reaction reports from pilots during pre-launch testing and knew about Twin Hill's prior problems with uniforms manufactured for Alaska. In all events, plaintiffs continue, American knew the uniforms were hazardous shortly after they were introduced across the company. American received a flood of reports from across its workforce within days of the launch, and those complaints culminated in American's decision to roll back the new uniforms and repudiate its contract with Twin Hill. Even construing these allegations in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, the Court finds that they do not establish the intentional conduct necessary to avoid workers' compensation preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The problem is not that plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege that Twin Hill's uniforms can be harmful or even that American knew as much.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, as discussed below in the context of their product liability theory, the Court finds that the complaint plausibly alleges that the uniforms are unreasonably dangerous. And the Court agrees with plaintiffs that the allegations of the complaint, taken as true,\n   provide a basis to conclude that American knew something was amiss with the uniforms even before September 2016. Nevertheless, where the complaint falls short in alleging an intentional tort is that it fails to give rise to the inference that American knew with requisite certainty that any particular employees, much less\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the named plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , would be harmed by the Twin Hill uniforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs estimate that 25-30% of American's workforce has suffered adverse health effects from working in or around Twin Hill uniforms. Am. Compl. \u00b6 84 (referring to affected employees as \"reactors\"). There are two inferences that reasonably can be drawn from this allegation that bear on the issue of substantial certainty. The first is that each American employee faced a 25 to 30% risk of suffering ill effects after the uniforms were introduced. This inference does not take plaintiffs very far; even assuming American knew that its new uniforms posed such a risk to each employee, that risk exposure is too modest to plausibly suggest that American was substantially certain that the uniforms would injure any particular employee. \"Mere risk, however great, is not enough to show intent under the traditional concept of substantial certainty.\" Dan B.

This inference shifts the vantage point of certainty from what American knew about the risk of harm to its employees individually to what American knew about the risk of harm to its employees collectively. And it is from this collective perspective that plaintiffs seek to gage American's intent. Plaintiffs contend that American is liable to any employee who was ultimately harmed by the uniforms as long as the airline knew (or was substantially certain) that some portion of its workforce would be harmed. Pl Opp'n to AA Br. 6-7, ECF No. 45 (arguing that allegations support \"inference that American has knowingly ... taking actions that are causing ... harm ... to thousands of its employees\"); Pl. Supp. Mem. 2, ECF No. 89 (stating that American knew that it was \"going to harm thousands of American employees with [the Twin Hill] uniforms\"). The difficulty with the plaintiffs' collective view of substantial certainty, however, is that it blurs the line between negligence, recklessness, and knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Substantial certainty, like negligence and recklessness, is a way point along the spectrum of culpability.

Supp. Br. 6, ECF No. 89. But that's not quite right; the premise conflates statistical knowledge that harm will result to some members of a collective group with individualized knowledge that harm will result to an identifiable victim. Liability on an intentional-tort theory generally requires the latter: to recover, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant intended (or at least was substantially certain) that the plaintiff-not someone else-would be harmed by the conduct at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the allegations of the complaint, however, none of the named plaintiffs (and likely none of American's employees) could make a claim that American was substantially certain that he or she would develop a rash, respiratory problems, or any of the other ailments allegedly caused by the Twin Hill uniforms. At least that is the import of plaintiffs' allegation that 25-30% of American employees are reactors; the odds are substantially higher that the employee, like most of his or her counterparts (the 65-70% non-reactors) would\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be bothered by the uniform.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Recognizing this problem, the plaintiffs focus not on the question of whether American intended to harm a particular plaintiff but on the statistical risks to employees as a collective group; they suggest that given the scope of distribution-over 1.4 million clothing articles issued to over 65,000 employees-American was aware that the uniforms were bound to harm thousands of its employees based on the issues that had cropped up during testing and among Alaskan employees. They contend that even if the risk of harm to any one of them was low, American knew that harm to some portion of its workforce was statistically certain given that the risk was run tens of thousands of times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The problem with this contention-and relying on statistical knowledge in general-is that scale alone does not transform negligence into knowledge. As one commentator has explained, \"[i]f performing a single act is merely negligent, then so is performing a hundred similar acts[.] ...

Dist. Ct. App. 2014) (explaining that plaintiffs cannot \"add together or cumulate the individual probabilities of an accident on each occasion to reach a conclusion that an accident is inevitable or that a risk is inordinately high\") (citation and emphasis omitted). And the same is true where a defendant \"engages in a single act that exposes multiple persons to a risk of harm\"; multiplying the number of people exposed does not alter the defendant's culpability if each person is exposed to the same level of risk. Simons,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 46-48 &amp; n. 89.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is why it matters not that the plaintiffs in this case seek to represent a class of injured employees; a class action is an aggregation of individual claims, not a vehicle that transforms those individual claims into a single claim predicated upon substantial certainty of harm to the collective group. The collection of claims that is the class is only as good as the individual claims it comprises; if a putative class member cannot plausibly allege that American was substantially certain that he or she would be harmed, that class member has no individual claim for battery (or any other intentional tort). The putative class cannot sidestep this problem by substituting statistics about the likelihood that American's conduct was bound to harm employees collectively. Alleging that American had statistical knowledge that some portion of its workforce would suffer harm, then, is entirely different than saying that American specifically knew that a specific employee would be harmed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs further argue that none of the Applicable States have applied comment e and, as a result, the particularity it requires has no bearing on this analysis. Pl. Supp. Br. 3. While it is true that none of the state supreme courts at issue have explicitly endorsed the Third Restatement's approach, the rule is aligned with their approaches to enforcing workers' compensation exclusivity.

The focus of the rule is on whether the employer could have \"confidentially predicted\" the identity of potential victims that would be harmed by its business decision.\n   <em>\n    Berkel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656064\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/543/288/#p300\">\n    543 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   301 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Helf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163684\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/203/962/\">\n    2009 UT 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8163684\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/203/962/\">\n    203 P.3d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"For a workplace injury to qualify as an intentional injury under the Act, the employer ... must know or except that the assigned task will injure the particular employee that undertakes it.\"). Thus, the Court concludes that to avoid workers' compensation preemption in the Applicable States that recognize the knowledge prong of intent, a plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant was (at least) substantially certain that its actions would injure the plaintiff, either individually or as a member of a small class of potential victims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In light of this requirement, the Court concludes that the complaint fails to plausible allege that American knew, or was substantially certain, that any of the named plaintiffs would be harmed. First, there is no basis to conclude that American could have confidently predicted that any of these plaintiffs, in particular, would be harmed when it first rolled out the uniforms. Nothing in the complaint indicates that the named plaintiffs were susceptible to developing health problems from the uniforms, let alone that American had notice of such predisposition. The story might be different for the pilots who served as uniform testers. In their case, American would have some basis to predict that those who reported experiencing adverse effects during the testing phase would experience the same effects after being asked to wear the uniform full time (assuming, of course, that no changes were made to the uniforms between testing and rollout). But there is no indication that any of the pilot plaintiffs served as uniform testers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nor is there a basis to conclude that any of the named plaintiffs were part of a small class of employees who were certain to develop health problems. Plaintiffs contend that, even under comment e, it is enough that American knew that some portion of its over 65,000 employees would be harmed. In support of this argument, they urge the Court not to read the Restatement literally; rather, they insist, the rule requires only that the defendant be substantially certain that some \"defined group or class of people, as opposed to some unknown group in some unknown area, would be harmed.\" Pl. Supp. Mem. 4, ECF No. 89. They add as well that requiring a narrower class of potential victims is unnecessary here given that are \"no temporal attenuations\" that make the connection between American's conduct and the harm alleged \"more complex,\" given that some employees experienced adverse reactions immediately after the roll-out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. This argument lacks force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   If the Court were to adopt plaintiff's construction, then the identity requirement would be satisfied in every occupational hazard case because an employer's workforce would always constitute a \"defined\" group. To be sure, the qualifications referenced in comment e-\"a small class of potential victims within a localized area\"-typically raise a question of fact regarding whether a risk is sufficiently concentrated and imminent to support a finding of substantial certainty. But, the allegations of harm here are so far removed from being \"small\" or \"localized\" that the complaint does not plausibly invoke this standard. It is one thing to say that the known risk posed by a specific machine to the small number of identifiable employees who use it could satisfy substantial certainty standard,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Suarez v. Dickmont Plastics Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"759930\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/99/\">\n    229 Conn. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=639%20A.2d%20507\">\n    639 A.2d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), because in that case the employer's ersatz \"intent\"-its substantial certainty-remains narrowly focused on a truly discrete group of employees. It is entirely another to apply the doctrine of substantial certainty to virtually every one of tens of thousands of employees, performing widely varied roles, throughout every part of the company and located throughout the world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nor does the fact that some employees experienced ill effects shortly after the roll out solve this problem. Although the timing certainly supports plaintiffs' contention that the uniforms are the cause of the harm at issue, it does not shed light (at least in this case) on the identity of any potential victims. At bottom, that American was aware of the risk that some portion of its workforce would develop health problems does not support liability for an intentional tort sufficient to overcome exclusivity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lucenti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491913\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/1/\">\n    327 Conn. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491913\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/176/1/\">\n    176 A.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"mere knowledge and appreciation of a risk,\" without more, does not amount to substantial certainty);\n   <em>\n    Reed Tool\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971079\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/689/404/#p407\">\n    689 S.W.2d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]o establish intentional conduct, more than the knowledge and appreciation of risk is necessary ....\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Millison v.

Again, such knowledge might give rise to liability under some other legal theories in a different context, but it does not permit the named plaintiffs in this case to seek damages outside the confines of the Applicable States' workers' compensation regimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Finally, and contrary to plaintiff's contention, the outcome of the substantial certainty analysis does not change if the focus is shifted to American's refusal to pull all Twin Hill uniforms from circulation after receiving a torrent of complaints from employees. Plaintiffs acknowledge that American took some measures to address the adverse reaction reports. American initially permitted employees who reported experiencing health problems to order new uniforms or revert to their old ones. Am. Compl. \u00b6 63. And when that did not eliminate the problem, American reversed course on the uniform rollout in November 2016 and stopped requiring (at least affected) employees to wear Twin Hill uniforms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-80. Given these allegations, what plaintiffs are really contending is that American is liable for battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress because it was certain that employees were being harmed from working near others who still wore Twin Hill uniforms. Put differently, plaintiffs allege that in light of the thousands of adverse reaction reports that were filed after November 2016, American must have known that its employees were being harmed through close proximity, not just direct contact, with the Twin Hill uniforms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This contention fails for much the same reason the uniform rollout allegations are insufficient. The complaint provides no basis to find that American knew that any of the named plaintiffs would suffer or continue to suffer harm after being permitted to wear alternative uniforms. That plaintiffs are among the portion of American's workforce who react to Twin Hill uniforms through close proximity does not mean that American knew they would be among that population. To the contrary, the complaint at most alleges that American knowingly permitted a hazardous condition to exist throughout its workforce and willfully failed to furnish a safe place to work. And absent some indication that the employer was substantially certain that the plaintiffs would be injured by such misconduct, neither basis is sufficient to overcome workers' compensation exclusivity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Reed Tool\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9971079\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/689/404/#p407\">\n    689 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   406 (citing 2A A.

Therefore, because the allegations in the amended complaint do not support intentional-tort liability-either under the purpose or knowledge sense of intent-the plaintiffs' recovery against American is limited to the remedies provided by the Applicable States' workers' compensation regimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Two other issues regarding plaintiffs' claims against American must also be addressed before closing. First, plaintiffs\n   contend that even if the exclusivity rule applies, it does not foreclose their ability to seek injunctive relief. Pl. Resp. to AA's Supp. Br. 1, ECF No. 93. While that may be true (at least in Nevada,\n   <em>\n    Conway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934857\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/870/\">\n    116 Nev. 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934857\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/116/870/\">\n    8 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   841 ), plaintiffs' claims against American are nonetheless subject to dismissal as currently pled. That is because the primary form of injunctive relief they seek against American is to enjoin it from \"continuing to commit battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress upon Plaintiffs and the Class.\" Am. Compl. at 27. Given that the Court finds that complaint does not plausibly allege that American has committed or is committing battery or intentional infliction of emotional distress, plaintiffs are not entitled to such relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The second issue concerns plaintiffs' medical monitoring theory. Although plaintiffs argue (in response to Twin Hill's motion to dismiss) that they have pled sufficient facts to proceed on this theory, they fail to address how it squares with workers' compensation exclusivity. It is not readily apparent to this Court how this theory (whether labeled as a cause of action or a form of relief) would overcome exclusivity, especially considering that the crux of the relief plaintiffs seek is to establish a medical monitoring trust fund; that is, a pool of damages meant to compensate American employees for the risk of future harm imposed on them by their employer. There may be reasons to conclude otherwise, but the plaintiffs offer no explanation as to how they can maintain a medical monitoring claim consistent with the exclusivity rule in the absence of conduct that qualifies as intentional under that rule. Accordingly, the Court finds that this theory is barred as well. Because that the plaintiffs' claims against American are precluded by the applicable exclusivity statutes, American's motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Twin Hill's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Having dismissed American, the Court now turns to Twin Hill's motion to dismiss. Twin Hill argues that plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged facts showing an entitlement to relief under any of the five legal theories they assert: battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, strict liability, or medical monitoring. Because the Court concludes that plaintiffs state a claim under a product liability theory, Twin Hill's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the complaint must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Although there is \"no monolithic products liability law in the United States,\" 1 M. Stuart Madden,\n   <em>\n    Products Liability\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.01 (2018), there are some shared principles that characterize product liability theory across jurisdictions. In many states, including the Applicable States, plaintiffs must show at least that the product at issue has an unreasonably dangerous defect; that the defect existed at the time the product left the manufacturer's control; and that the defect caused the injury for which the plaintiffs seek redress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, plaintiffs typically may show that a product is defective due to a flaw in the manufacturing process, a\n   design defect, or because of inadequate warnings or instructions.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Simoneau v.

First and foremost, plaintiffs aver that thousands of American employees have suffered adverse health effects from working in and around the uniforms, including skin rashes, ear and throat irritations, headaches, vertigo, the triggering of auto-immune conditions, and impairment of endocrine and liver functions. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 38-48. The complaint also states that testing has shown that some Twin Hill uniform garments contain several \"auto-immune affecting chemicals,\" including known and possible carcinogens, which, on their own or in combination, can cause a litany of health problems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-75. For example, plaintiffs allege that long-term exposure to small amounts of pentachlorophenol, one of the chemicals detected, \"can cause damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, lungs, [and] nervous system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. And \"chronic long term exposure by inhalation\" to formaldehyde, another one of the chemicals present, \"can cause a cascade of health issues from skin rashes and respiratory problems to cancer, as well as causing fatigue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   These allegations are sufficient to infer a design defect under a consumer expectation test and the various risk-utility tests. An ordinary American employee would not expect company-issued uniforms to give rise to any health problems-let alone skin, respiratory, and auto-immune issues-through normal wear. And although plaintiffs do not posit an alternative design in the complaint, one can be inferred from their allegations: a uniform free of the hazardous chemicals identified in the complaint. Whether it would actually have been feasible for Twin Hill to manufacture the uniforms in a way that minimized or eliminated these substances is a question of fact to be developed through discovery, but it is plausible to infer at this stage that it was feasible to design uniforms that did not use such chemicals; companies outfit their employees in uniforms every day that do not create the sort of health issues alleged in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The allegations also give rise to the inference that Twin Hill failed to exercise reasonable care in designing the uniforms. In particular, the allegations suggest Twin Hill knew, or at least should have known, that its uniforms would cause numerous American employees to develop health problems. Twin Hill was aware that \"many\" American pilots reported experiencing \"rashes, flu-like symptoms, headaches, vomiting, and respiratory problems\" during testing and that one of the pilot unions requested that the uniforms not be used.

According to Twin Hill, plaintiffs \"acknowledge\" that no single chemical is present in the uniforms \"at a high enough level to cause health problems,\" and \"all but admit[ ] that testing likely cannot determine whether or not a synergistic effect from a combination of chemicals caused health effects.\" TH Br. 11-12 (citing Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-36). Neither contention is accurate. In paragraph 35, plaintiffs merely acknowledge that its\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     defendants' position\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that testing fails to show any single harmful chemical in the uniforms. Indeed, as discussed above, plaintiffs allege that testing on some of the uniform pieces shows the existence of chemicals that may be harmful on their own. Twin Hill also misconstrues paragraph 36, which states that \"[n]o amount of testing can serve to negate the real-world events that are taking place\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that thousands of American employees developed similar symptoms after the uniforms were introduced into the workforce. This is not, as Twin Hill suggests, an admission that no amount of testing can confirm whether a combination of chemicals is producing harmful effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Even if testing to date has not identified an objectively high level of any single chemical or corroborated plaintiffs' synergistic theory, the complaint still plausibly alleges that Twin Hill's uniforms are the source of the harm at issue. Plaintiffs contend that a large number of American employees began experiencing similar health problems shortly after the Twin Hill uniforms were introduced.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 55. Employees began reporting health problems \"within weeks if not days\" of the rollout.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The number of reports allegedly swelled over the course of the next several months, with over 5,000 American employees complaining of uniform-related health problems within a year of the launch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 55, 57. Moreover, plaintiffs allege that the introduction of the Twin Hill uniforms was the only \"common event that happened to the entire workforce\" during that timeframe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. They add as well that the adverse reactions typically dissipate when employees are not exposed to the uniforms yet reappear when the employees are exposed to the uniforms again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-39. These factual allegations, taken as true and in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, are sufficient to establish above a speculative level that the uniforms are the source of harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adkins v.

To be sure, the uniforms are not the\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   plausible explanation for the health problems being reported, as the plaintiffs suggest. But it is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     one\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   plausible explanation, and that is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Twin Hill's final argument is that plaintiffs \"cloak their allegations in generalities.\" TH Reply 8, ECF No. 51. Twin Hill essentially complains that plaintiffs do not allege what \"specific uniforms garments they wore or were exposed to\" and what specific \"adverse health effects\" they experienced, let alone how those effects \"could be associated with the uniforms garments Plaintiffs wore.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228982\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/973/905/#p916\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   TH Br. 16, ECF No. 43. Given this lack of specificity, Twin Hill contends, plaintiffs do not provide sufficient information-which is well within their possession and control-to support their individual claims. This argument lacks force as well. Addressing the second issue first, the complaint does in fact specify how the plaintiffs have been affected. Twin Hill focuses on the rote allegations in which plaintiffs state in a general fashion that they experienced \"adverse reactions\" while working in or around Twin Hill uniforms. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-48. But Twin Hill overlooks the very next paragraph in the complaint: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , as well as thousands of other American Airlines employees,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     are\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ...\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     experiencing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   debilitating symptoms of headaches, fatigue, respiratory problems, vertigo and rashes as a result working in and around persons who are wearing the [Twin Hill] uniforms.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Nor is the Court persuaded that plaintiffs must provide more detail about the uniform garments they wore or to which they were exposed. Twin Hill suggests that there is an insufficient link between the uniform garments that plaintiffs tested and the ones that allegedly caused plaintiffs to suffer adverse effects-especially given that Twin Hill has supplied \"dozens of different garments choices\" to American employees. TH Br. 8, ECF No. 51. There are two problems with this argument. First, it draws on facts that are beyond the four corners of the complaint. Second, the Court may infer from the complaint that plaintiffs' Twin Hill uniforms contain some of the same chemicals as the uniforms that were tested. Plaintiffs allege that they have experienced symptoms that are consistent with those associated with exposure to the chemicals identified through testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31, 49, 70-74. The facts may prove otherwise and the plaintiffs will need to establish causation, but they at least will have the benefit of discovery to meet this burden. Therefore, because plaintiffs have stated a claim against Twin Hill under at least a product liability theory, Twin Hill's motion to dismiss the complaint is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Rule 23(d)(1)(D), moreover, provides that \"[i]n conducting an action under this rule, the court may issue orders that: ... require that the pleadings be amended to eliminate allegations about representation of absent persons and that the action proceed accordingly.\" Coupled with these provisions is Rule 12(f), which permits district courts to strike \"an insufficient defense\" from a pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Twin Hill argues that the class allegations here should be stricken for two reasons, but neither persuades.

In particular, Twin Hill suggests that the class may require applying the law of all fifty states and points to the lack of uniformity in product liability and medical monitoring law across jurisdictions. Moreover, Twin Hill continues, the divergent legal standards will be complicated by individualized factual questions, such as \"how long each individual wore the uniforms, the alleged chemical(s) present in each uniform, and each individual's health history.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.

Given American's nationwide presence and the inherent mobility of its workforce, none of the parties can presently predict with any confidence which states' law may apply to the claims of putative class members. And as for the named plaintiffs, there is no guarantee that the Court will apply at a later stage the same law that it is applying now.

Although it is unclear whether subclasses would fully address Twin Hill's concern down the road, what matters here is that the subclass mechanism is a potential alternative to denying certification outright.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Messner v.

Second, there is at least one common question of fact that could give rise to certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   One critical issue in this suit is whether any of Twin Hill's uniform pieces are capable of causing the type of harm the plaintiffs allege-either by proximity or direct contact. And more importantly, this issue, at least, is likely to be addressed through classwide proof and expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Twin Hill contends that plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief on behalf of the class yet cannot show that any members of the class are suffering from a continuing harm in light of American's decision to permit employees to wear alternative uniforms. TH Br. 23, ECF No. 43. But Twin Hill ignores allegations in the complaint that plaintiffs and putative class members continue to suffer ill effects by working\n   near employees who still wear Twin Hill uniforms. Because the Court finds that plaintiffs' proximity theory is not implausible based on the facts alleged, plaintiffs sufficiently plead on-going or future harm. Whether plaintiffs can establish a likelihood of future harm is again an issue for another day. Therefore, the Court denies Twin Hill's motion to strike class allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the above reasons, American's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss is granted.

Moreover, as at least one other district court in this circuit has recognized, a complaint \"must do more than merely allege intentional injury as an exception to the general exclusiveness rule\" to survive dismissal; \"it must allege\n    <em>\n     facts\n    </em>\n    that add up to a deliberate intent to bring about injury.\"\n    <em>\n     Hurd v.

The first is a decision by a California superior court in a suit by Alaska employees against Twin Hill holding that Alaska employees failed to show above a speculative level that the chemicals found in their uniforms were causing the symptoms they alleged. Ex. A to TH Br., ECF No. 43-1. The second document is a report issued by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (\"NOISH\"), which concludes that its testing of American employees' uniforms did not \"identify a single chemical, an individual uniform component, or combinations that were responsible for the constellation of symptoms\" reported by American employees. Ex. A to TH Reply, ECF No. 51-1. Although the Court may take judicial notice of documents in the public record and reports of administrative bodies,\n    <em>\n     Wigod v.

Although Twin Hill's submissions may cast some doubt on plaintiffs' ability to ultimately prove causation, they do not negate the well-pleaded allegations supporting plaintiffs' theory of causation, which, at this stage, the Court must accept as true. Plaintiffs will have the opportunity to develop their own evidence of causation in this case and test the NOISH report's findings through discovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Because the Court finds that plaintiffs have pled facts supporting at least one of their theories of relief, it need not evaluate the other theories asserted against Twin Hill.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 882. Denial of the motion to dismiss, however, does not affirm the viability of any of the legal theories advanced by the plaintiffs against Twin Hill other than the product liability theory. Indeed, the flaws in the intentional tort theories aimed at American may well apply in the context of the plaintiffs' claim against Twin Hill (though the fact that workers' compensation exclusivity rules do not come into play as to Twin Hill might also bear on the analysis). It remains for the plaintiffs to identify, and Twin Hill to test, the plaintiffs' legal theories in discovery and, if warranted, for Twin Hill to seek summary judgment as to any theory it believes fails as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Because plaintiffs seek class certification only under Rule 23(b)(2) they will not be required to establish that common questions of fact predominate over individual issues.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
