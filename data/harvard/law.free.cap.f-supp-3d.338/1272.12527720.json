Nirenberg's Motion to Dismiss Counts VI and X of the Amended Complaint with Prejudice (Doc. 37) filed on August 3, 2018, and Plaintiff's Opposition (Doc. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Spears invented a depth gauge to be attached to boat trailers. The gauge gives a visual cue to the driver of the tow vehicle that the trailer is at proper depth to launch or recover a boat. (Doc. 31 at 4). Spears was granted a patent on the invention, which he licensed to SHK (formerly known as United Marine, Inc.) by way of a Licensing Agreement signed by Spears and SHK CEO David Nirenberg. (Doc. 31-2). The License Agreement contains the handwritten addition, \"Modifications to the patent should be added to the patent as soon as possible.\" (Doc. 31-2 at 3). Spears interprets this language to give him ownership rights to any subsequent embodiments of his invention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   About a year after the Licensing Agreement was signed, SHK hired Spears as a Research and Development Supervisor. (Doc. 31 at 7). During the performance of the Licensing Agreement and his employment with SHK, Spears gave SHK and Nirenberg confidential information about improvements to his invention. (Doc. 31 at 7). Nirenberg used the information to file U.S. Patent Application No. 13/800,145, which he assigned to SHK. (Doc. 31 at 9). SHK assigned the '145 Application to Lake Red Rock, and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%209%2C127%2C940\">\n    U.S. Patent No. 9,127,940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   later issued, naming Nirenberg as the sole inventor and Lake Red Rock as the assignee. (Doc. 31 at 9; Doc. 31-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Spears sued SHK, Nirenberg, and Lake Red Rock LLC for ten causes of action relating to the '940 Patent and the Licensing Agreement. (Doc. 31). Lake Red Rock was voluntarily dismissed, and Count VII was thus abandoned because it was only asserted against Lake Red Rock. (Doc. 36). SHK and Nirenberg move to dismiss the remaining unjust-enrichment claim (Count VI) and the constructive-fraud claim (Count X) under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and view them in a light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Preemption of the Unjust-Enrichment Claim (Count VI)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   SHK and Nirenberg argue that Spears' unjust-enrichment claim is preempted by federal patent law because it hinges on whether Spears is the true inventor of the '940 Patent. (Doc. 37 at 4-5). They contend that applying state law to determine rights and remedies based on inventorship would frustrate the intentions and objectives of Congress. (Doc. 37 at 4-5).

Spears' unjust-enrichment claim is more like Thompson's than OptoLum's because his claim is based on Defendants' misappropriation of ownership of a patent, not misappropriation of inventorship. Spears alleges that he has a contractual right to ownership of the '940 Patent, distinct from any ownership rights he may have as the true inventor. So even if a determination of inventorship is relevant to the unjust-enrichment claim, it is not essential because Spears has advanced an alternative, non-patent theory that could entitle him to relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    HIF Bio, Inc. v.

(Doc. 37 at 5-7). They contend that Count VI must be dismissed because it covers the same subject matter as the breach-of-contract claim asserted in Count III. (Doc. 37 at 6). Spears argues without reference to any precedent that Counts VI and III are sufficiently distinct, despite reliance on \"similar allegations,\" because they seek different remedies. (Doc. 47 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants correctly state, \"Florida courts have held that a plaintiff cannot pursue a quasi-contract claim for unjust enrichment if an express contract exists concerning the same subject matter.\" (Doc. 37 at 5 (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diamond \"S\" Dev.

Both are based on an alleged breach of SHK's agreement that Spears would be the owner of all new embodiments to his invention. (Doc. 1 at 13-14, 16). The unjust-enrichment claim must therefore be dismissed as to SHK. Nirenberg, on the other hand, is not a party to the Licensing Agreement.

Here, the factual allegations underlying Spears' constructive-fraud claim and breach-of-contract claims are the same: Nirenberg filed the '145 Application and assigned it to SHK, SHK exercised ownership over the '940 Patent by assigning it to Lake Red Rock, and SHK refused to pay royalties to Spears, all in violation of the Licensing Agreement. (Doc. 31 at 14, 21). And Spears alleged no conduct separate from the Licensing Agreement upon which a constructive-fraud claim could be based. Count X is therefore barred as to SHK under the independent tort doctrine.
