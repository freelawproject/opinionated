Stat., pp. </em>1863 et seq. But we find no such certificate. All that appears is a certificate by the county clerk of the \u201cindictment and proceedings\u201d as on file in his office. This is not sufficient. The practice pointed out in such cases as <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>75 <em>N. J. L. </em>473; <em>State </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>88 <em>Id. </em>280; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramage, </em>91 <em>Id. </em>435, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Chiaccio, </em>4 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>63, has not been followed. Hence the ease is before us, if at all, on strict writ of error and bill of exceptions. It follows that the rather extended argument that the verdict is against the weight of evidence, based on chapter 349 of the laws of 1921 <em>(P amph. L., p. </em>951) is not available for reversal, as that act applies only to cases brought up under sections 136 and 137. It follows, further, that the assignments of error, to be available, must be supported by exceptions authenticated by the signature and seal of the trial court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>90 <em>N. J. L. </em>261; <em>State </em>v. Fearce, 113 <em>Id. </em>155; 172 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>575; <em>Lowenstein </em>v. <em>Lohman, </em>109 W. <em>J. L. </em>215; <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Fabricant, </em>113 <em>Id. </em>62; 172 <em>Atl. Rep. Rep. </em>567; <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>State, </em>26 <em>N. J. L. </em>463, 511; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>85 <em>Id. </em>387.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">There are forty-four \u201creasons or specifications of error\u201d (so entitled in the printed book) which may be assumed to be cognizable as assignments of error. Of these, something over half are argued, <em>c\u00farrente calamo </em>for the most part, as though exceptions had been duly prayed and sealed. But a careful examination of the transcript discloses that in many cases an exception was not prayed, and that in not one of them was any exception signed and sealed as required by the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">When there is a \u201ccertificate of the entire record of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>ceedings at the trial\u201d the reviewing court has before it a blanket certificate by the trial court of all rulings at the trial. Railing this, there is nothing on which the reviewing court may proceed unless there is a bill of exceptions. Railing both of these, there is nothing to review. That is the situation here. No error is properly exhibited, and the conviction is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
