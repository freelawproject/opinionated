He argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion solely on the basis that the new guidelines range overlapped with his original sentence and despite his exemplary post-sentencing conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">A proceeding under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not a full resentencing. <em>United, States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 671 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939). Consequently, the bifurcated reasonableness review standard afforded sentencing decisions is inapplicable in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context. <em>Id. </em>at 672. Rather, we review the district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>Colburn\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence relied on the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and the district court\u2019s decision indicates that it considered the amended guidelines range but determined that no reduction in sentence was warranted. Where, as here, the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a), there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>see also Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
