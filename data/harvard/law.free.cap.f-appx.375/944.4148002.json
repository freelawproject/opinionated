After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-22\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>\u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l)-(2). Green\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is based on Amendment 706 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which lowered the base offense levels applicable to most crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 706, 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Here, the district court correctly concluded that it lacked authority to reduce Green\u2019s sentence. At Green\u2019s original sentencing, the district court held Green responsible for more than 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base, which set his base offense level at 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (1998). However, after offense level adjustments for his leadership role and obstruction of justice, Green\u2019s total offense level was 46.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because the highest offense level in the Sentencing Table is 43, the guidelines instruct that any offense level above 43 is treated as an offense level 43. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, ch. 5, pt. A, cmt. n. 2. With a criminal history category of VI and total offense level of 43, Green\u2019s guidelines range was life imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Sentencing Table, ch. 5, pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">After Amendment 706, Green\u2019s applicable offense level was lowered by two to 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) (2009). Leaving all of Green\u2019s other guidelines calculations intact, his total offense level was lowered to 44, which is treated as level 43, and yields the same guidelines range of life imprisonment. Because Green\u2019s amended guidelines range would be the same as his original guidelines range, the district court correctly concluded that it had no authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce Green\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B) (providing that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction is not authorized if an amendment does not lower the applicable guidelines range); <em>see also United States v. Webb, </em>565 F.3d 789, 793 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b970-25\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-6\">. Although Green qualified as a career offender, the district court did not use his career offender offense level of 37 to calculate the guidelines range because it was lower than level 46. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (providing that the career offender offense level applies only if it is greater than the otherwise applicable offense level).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
