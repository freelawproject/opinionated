Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED in part as frivolous, <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2, and in part as moot. <em>See United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
