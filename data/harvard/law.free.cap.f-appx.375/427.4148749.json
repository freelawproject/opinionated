Hunter argues that the retroactive application of Tex. Gov\u2019t Code Ann. \u00a7 508.046 to his case violates the Ex Post Facto Clause because it creates a substantial risk of increased punishment. Hunter seeks prospective in-junctive relief placing him under the prior parole statute requiring a three-member panel and requiring Texas to grant him a special parole review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The district court dismissed Hunter\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim, holding that Hunter\u2019s claim was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because it determined that granting relief would necessarily imply the invalidity of the prior parole decision. A district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.CivP. 12(b)(6) is subject to de novo review. <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007). To avoid dismissal for failure to state a claim, a plaintiffs complaint must plead enough facts to \u201cstate a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) <em>(quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). The factual allegations must \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">In <em>Wallace v. Quarterman, </em>516 F.3d 351, 354-56 (5th Cir.2008), we held generally that the new Texas parole statute did not facially violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because it changed only the discretionary determination and not eligibility for parole. Therefore, Hunter\u2019s fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>cial challenge to Tex. Gov\u2019t Code ANN. \u00a7 508.046 is foreclosed by <em>Wallace.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Hunter has shown that the district court erred in dismissing his \u201cas applied\u201d claim as barred by <em>Heck. </em>In <em>Wilkinson v. Dotson, </em>544 U.S. 74, 81-82, 125 S.Ct. 1242, 161 L.Ed.2d 253 (2005), the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1983 relief \u201cremains available for procedural challenges where success in the action would not necessarily spell immediate or speedier release for the prisoner.\u201d In <em>Kyles v. Gamtt, </em>353 Fed. Appx. 942 (5th Cir.2009), we held that a state prisoner was not precluded by <em>Heck </em>from bringing a \u00a7 1983 action challenging the retroactive application of Tex. Gov\u2019t Code ANN. \u00a7 508.046 as a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. We found that success for Kyles meant \u201c \u2018at most a new parole hearing at whieh [Texas] parole authorities may, in their discretion, decline to shorten his prison term.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946 <em>(quoting Dotson, </em>544 U.S. at 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242). Under <em>Dotson </em>and <em>Kyles, </em>Hunter is not precluded by <em>Heck </em>from bringing a \u00a7 1983 claim challenging the retroactive application of Tex. Gov\u2019t Code ANN. \u00a7 508.046 as a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See Dotson, </em>544 U.S. at 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242; <em>see also Kyles, </em>353 Fed.Appx. at 945-46. Hunter seeks only prospective injunctive relief requiring that the Parole Board apply the prior parole law of review by a three-member panel to his future parole hearings and requiring Texas to grant him a special parole review. Because the parole board has the discretion to deny parole, the relief Hunter seeks would not necessarily require immediate or speedier release for Hunter. Therefore, the district court erred in holding that Hunter\u2019s claim was precluded by <em>Heck. See Dotson, </em>544 U.S. at 82, 125 S.Ct. 1242; see <em>also Kyles, </em>353 Fed.Appx. at 945-46. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment as to Hunter\u2019s ex post facto claim and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Consistent with this opinion, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Hunter\u2019s state law claims. On remand, the district court should determine whether it should exercise such jurisdiction. <em>See Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Co-hill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b454-17\">. Hunter does not identify any error in the district court\u2019s dismissal of his due process and equal protection claims. Therefore, he has abandoned these issues on appeal. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
