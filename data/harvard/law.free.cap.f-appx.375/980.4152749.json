On appeal, White argues that the sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable for the following reasons: (1) the court improperly applied the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (2) a 21-month sentence is excessive because White committed relatively minor violations of supervised release, (3) and the sentence is higher than necessary to achieve the statutory goals of sentencing. Upon careful review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we find that these arguments are unpersuasive, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-16\">We review a sentence imposed following the revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). A reasonableness review is synonymous with the abuse of discretion standard and uses a two-step process. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). First, we consider whether the district court committed a significant procedural error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. Next, we examine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T)he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>\u201cUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court may, upon a finding by a prepondei'ance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of supervised release, revoke the term of the supervised release and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107. These factors include: (1) \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\u201d \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and\u201d \u201cto provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment;\u201d (3) the sentencing range established by the Guidelines; (4) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, (5) \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities;\u201d and (6) \u201cthe need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), <em>cross referencing </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">\u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the distinct court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (citation and alterations omitted). We will only remand a sentence when the district court commits \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">In <em>Rita v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that in reviewing sentences for reasonableness under \u00a7 3553(a), a federal appellate court \u201cmay apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence\u201d imposed within the guideline range. 551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the [guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (alteration in original) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Here, White has failed to show that his 21-month sentence was unreasonable. White\u2019s sentence was within the guidelines range, and a review of the record indicates that the district court expressly acknowledged that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court explained that White\u2019s sentence was to provide an adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and give him a chance to get educational or vocational training, and other corrective treatment. Moreover, the district court also determined that White\u2019s sentence was \u201ccom-par[able] with the kind of other sentences available, and [that] it t[ook] into consideration the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d Tr. 11. Although White would have liked the court to weigh those factors differently, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing White to 21-months\u2019 imprisonment. Accordingly, White has not met his burden, and we therefore affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-12\">. White does not assert that the district court procedurally erred. In any event, the district court correctly calculated White's sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
