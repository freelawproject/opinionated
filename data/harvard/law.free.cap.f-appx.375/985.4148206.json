Sandoval, </em>325 Fed.Appx. 828 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Sandoval now appeals the sentence imposed at re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-18\">Sandoval was a member of the street gang \u201cSur-13.\u201d He and sixteen others were charged with conspiracy to violate the Racketeer and Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), and various drug-related offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment alleged numerous overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy including a 1999 drive-by shooting targeting a rival gang member (\u201covert act 8\u201d). Specifically, the indictment alleged that Sandoval and another member of Sur-13 went to the rival\u2019s apartment and shot multiple times into the apartment\u2019s living room window and a nearby car. For his participation, Sandoval was charged under state law with aggravated assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-19\">On remand, the district court recalculated the range and imposed a sentence of 168 months, which was within the new guidelines range. On appeal, Sandoval argues that the district court erred by including the drive-by shooting in overt act 8 when it calculated his offense level because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>aggravated assault is not a RICO predicate act under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>432 F.3d 1189, 1253 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>issues involving statutory interpretation. <em>United States v. Ambert, </em>561 F.3d 1202, 1205 (11th Cir.2009). At sentencing, a district court may base its factual findings on undisputed statements in the presentence investigation report. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2El.l(a), a defendant\u2019s base offense level for a RICO offense is the greater of 19 or the offense level applicable to the underlying racketeering activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2El.l(a); <em>United States v. Farese, </em>248 F.3d 1056, 1059 (11th Cir.2001). The RICO statute sets forth an exclusive list of racketeering activities, which includes \u201cany act or threat involving murder\u201d chargeable under state law and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). An offense that does not constitute a RICO predicate offense cannot be the basis for the determination of a defendant\u2019s base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2El.l(a)(2). Assault is not listed as a racketeering activity in \u00a7 1961(1). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). But we have recognized that attempted murder is a predicate activity for RICO purposes. <em>See e.g., United States v. Watchmaker, </em>761 F.2d 1459, 1475 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Here, we conclude that the district court properly determined Sandoval\u2019s guideline offense level. There was no error in the court\u2019s finding that overt act 8 \u2014 shooting into an occupied apartment at a rival gang leader \u2014 was attempted murder and thus involved the threat of murder for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1). Moreover, aggravated assault under state law can involve intent to murder, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-21(a)(1), and thus would constitute a predicate offense under \u00a7 1961. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">. We discussed the activities of the Sur-13 members more fully in <em>United States v.
