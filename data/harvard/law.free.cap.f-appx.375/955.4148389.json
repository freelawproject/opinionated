On appeal, he argues that his upward-variant sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. He also argues, and the government concedes, that the judgment improperly reflects that he was convicted of illegal reentry after deportation for an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">I. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">Cooper argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court expressly refused to consider some potentially mitigating \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He asserts the court placed sole weight on one factor: his previous illegal reentry conviction. He argues that the guideline enhancement he received under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), for deportation subsequent to a felony conviction, accounted for his previous illegal entries. He also argues that the court failed to provide an adequate explanation for the upward variance. He further argues that our precedent, in which we held that a district court need only acknowledge consideration of the defendant\u2019s arguments and the 3553(a) factors, conflicts with other circuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must \u201cfirst ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">The sentencing court shall impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to comply with the purposes of sentencing listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), namely to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, protect the public from future criminal conduct by the defendant, and provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). The sentencing court must also consider the following factors in determining a particular sentence: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7). The district court need not discuss each factor; rather an acknowledgment \u201cthat it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>.\u201d United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Not every case requires a full opinion or a response to every argument. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356-57, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">In determining a reasonable sentence, the district court may consider facts that have already been taken into account in calculating the defendant\u2019s guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>range. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2008) (as part of history and characteristics of the defendant, district court could consider defendant\u2019s prior offenses in deciding to impose an upward variance, even though those offenses were already included in the defendant\u2019s criminal history score); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (\u201cNo limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The record belies Cooper\u2019s contention that the court failed to adequately consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and did not explain its rationale for the variance. The court specifically noted its consideration of all the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Additionally, the court\u2019s comments at sentencing, as well as the arguments that it heard, demonstrate the court\u2019s consideration of many pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Although the court\u2019s nine-month variance above the high end of Cooper\u2019s guideline range was significant, the district court\u2019s consideration of many of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its statements that the sentence was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, serve as sufficient justification. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597 (holding that if a court \u201cdecides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, [it] must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance\u201d). The record also demonstrates that the court considered the 3553(a) factors, \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>see also Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786 (holding that it is sufficient for a court to acknowledge its consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments and the 3553(a) factors). Regarding Cooper\u2019s argument that the court considered facts that were taken into account when calculating his guideline range, we have held that a court may properly do so. <em>See Williams, </em>526 F.3d at 1324. Thus, we conclude from the record that Cooper\u2019s sentence is not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">II. Substantive Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Cooper also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because (1) the sentence was greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing; and (2) the court engaged in \u201cquintuple counting\u201d in determining his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">The reasonableness standard of review announced in <em>Booker </em>requires appellate courts to review the ultimate sentence imposed under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-diseretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 41, 128 S.Ct. at 591. In reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the sentence in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006). The district court has discretion to determine the weight that should be given to each factor. <em>United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). However, we may find that the district court has abused its discretion if the weight it gives to the factors yields an unreasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008). The burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">We conclude from the record that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Cooper to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was well within his total statutory range of 0 to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>(concluding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 (2009). Although the district court imposed an upward variance, the court provided a thorough rationale for which such a sentence was necessary and found that the 60-month total sentence was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary to comply with the statutory purposes of the sentencing.\u201d Given the facts of this case, which includes the failure of a previous short sentence to deter him, Cooper has not provided any compelling argument that the court abused its discretion when weighing the sentencing factors. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 743 (district court has discretion to determine weight given to each factor). Thus, we conclude that Cooper has failed to show that the court abused its discretion when sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">III. Clerical Error in the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Cooper argues that the judgment improperly reflects that he was convicted of illegal reentry after deportation for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2), when he was actually convicted of illegal reentry after deportation for a felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">\u201cWe may <em>sua sponte </em>raise the issue of clerical errors in the judgment and remand with instructions that the district court correct the errors.\u201d <em>United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">While we affirm the district court\u2019s 60-month sentence, the order of judgment erroneously references 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which criminalizes illegal reentry after deportation for an <em>aggravated </em>felony and carries a 20-year statutory maximum, rather than \u00a7 1326(b)(1), which carries a 10-year statutory maximum. Thus, we vacate and remand for the limited purpose of correcting this clerical error. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-8\">. <em>United States v.
