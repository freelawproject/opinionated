He contends that his sentence, which was within the Guidelines range, was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-13\">\u201cWe review sentencing decisions only for abuse of discretion, and we use a two-step process.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). If we find the sentence to be procedurally sound, the second step is to review the \u201csubstantive reasonableness\u201d of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, \u201cincluding the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cAfter <em>Booker, </em>our ordinary expectation [of reasonableness] still has to be measured against the record, and the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>ty who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both that record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">As for procedural error, Green does not contend that the district court improperly calculated the sentencing guidelines or treated them as mandatory. Instead, he argues that the district court improperly presumed that a sentence within the Guidelines range was reasonable. <em>See Nelson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 890, 892, 172 L.Ed.2d 719 (2009) (\u201c[A] sentencing court [may not] presume that a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range is reasonable.\u201d). We disagree. Before imposing its sentence, the district court stated: \u201cI think the guidelines result in a guideline range that is fair and reasonable considering all the circumstances of the case, including Mr. Green\u2019s relative culpability with his co-Defendants....\u201d It is clear, based on that statement, that the district court did not presume that a sentence within the guidelines range was reasonable but instead calculated Green\u2019s Guidelines range and then considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to determine an appropriate sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (court must consider \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d); 3553(a)(6) (court must consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct\u201d); <em>see also Nelson, </em>129 S.Ct. at 891-92. Nor did the district court base its sentencing decision on clearly erroneous facts or fail to adequately explain its sentence. Accordingly, we conclude that no procedural error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">Green also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He argues that an unwarranted disparity exists between his 175 month sentence and the sentences of his co-defendants. We disagree. Green had a more extensive criminal history than his co-defendants and, unlike many of his co-defendants, did not enter into a plea agreement with the government. He has not shown that the difference between his sentence and the sentences of his co-defendants was unwarranted. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312,1323 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
