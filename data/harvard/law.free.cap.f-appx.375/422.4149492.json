Rodriguez argues that the Immigration Judge (IJ) breached his duty to develop the record in this case, especially because Rodriguez was not represented at the merits hearing. He also argues that the BIA erred by denying his motion to remand the case to the IJ so that he could apply for adjustment of status under the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">\u201cFailure to exhaust an issue creates a jurisdictional bar as to that issue.\u201d <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cAn alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to an issue when the issue is not raised in the first instance before the BIA \u2014 either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cWhen a petitioner seeks to raise a claim not presented to the BIA and the claim is one that the BIA has adequate mechanisms to address and remedy, the petitioner must raise the issue in a motion to reopen prior to resorting to review by the courts.\u201d <em>Goonsuwan v. Ashcroft, </em>252 F.3d 383, 390 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">In his brief before the BIA, Rodriguez asserted that the IJ \u201cabused his discretion when he failed to make further inquiry into [Rodriguez\u2019s] claims of past persecution and/or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d However, he went on to argue only the merits of the IJ\u2019s determination that he was not eligible for asylum and withholding of removal in light of the record. Rodriguez\u2019s assertion that the IJ abused his discretion by failing to make a more detailed inquiry into the underlying facts, without inclusion of any argument or analysis relevant to this contention in his BIA brief, does not amount to exhaustion of the issue of whether the IJ breached his duties with respect to the development of the record. <em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 319, 321 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">A motion to reopen or remand proceedings for the pui*pose of submitting an application for relief \u201cmust be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documentation.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Rodriguez did not provide the BIA with a copy of his application for adjustment of status under the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion to remand. <em>See Waggoner v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 632, 639 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">DISMISSED IN PART FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5tii Cir.
