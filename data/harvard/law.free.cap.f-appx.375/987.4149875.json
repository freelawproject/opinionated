Because Davis had numerous felony convictions prior to the firearm conviction, he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">On appeal, Davis argues that sentences imposed under the Act constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Davis also argues that, in establishing mandatory sentences, the Act conflicts with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and is inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United, States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005);</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-14\">We review constitutional challenges to a sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.2005). Questions of statutory interpretation are likewise reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">In <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>528 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2008), <em>cert. granted on other grounds, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 1315, 173 L.Ed.2d 583 (2009), we reiterated that minimum mandatory sentences for armed career criminals do not violate the Eighth Amendment. <em>Accord United States v. Lyons, </em>403 F.3d 1248, 1256-57 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that because the minimum mandatory sentences are based on recidivism, there is no necessary constitutional violation, even where the count of conviction itself may be relatively minor); <em>United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-18\">We have also previously held that district courts are not empowered to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Castaing-Sosa, </em>530 F.3d 1358, 1361-62 (11th Cir.2008). Moreover, \u201cthe district court remains bound by statutes designating mandatory minimum sentences even after the holding of <em>[Booker </em>]\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1014-19\">To avoid infringing a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial, <em>Booker </em>made advisory the Sentencing Guidelines, not statutory mandatory minimums enacted by Congress. Thus, <em>Booker\u2019s </em>instruction to district courts to consider the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in fashioning a reasonable sentence cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>read to authorize using the \u00a7 3553(a) factors to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1362 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"A_en\">Davis concedes that our precedent forecloses his constitutional argument, as he must. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t is the firmly established rule of this Circuit that each succeeding panel is bound by the holding of the first panel to address an issue of law, unless and until that holding is overruled en bane, or by the Supreme Court.\u201d). Similarly, Davis\u2019s arguments regarding the possible effect of <em>Booker </em>and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors on mandatory minimum sentences are foreclosed by binding precedent, and must be rejected. <em>Hogan, </em>986 F.2d at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1015-26\">.
