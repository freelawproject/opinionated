Robles challenges the district court\u2019s application of a four-level enhancement based upon his earlier possession of a firearm, a Smith and Wesson pistol, in connection with another felony offense, possession of marijuana. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-21\">Robles\u2019s challenge is without merit. The two firearms offenses occurred within four months of each other. In each instance, the discovery of the firearm resulted from an investigation into suspected drug and/or gang activity by Robles. Additionally, Robles possessed similar firearms (pistols), and he possessed both firearms after a felony conviction. As in <em>United States v. Brummett, </em>355 F.3d 343, 345 (5th Cir.2003), the \u201cpattern of behavior of possessing firearms was similar and regular, and the time period between the offenses permits a conclusion that the firearms possessions were part of an ongoing series of offenses.\u201d The district court therefore did not err in applying the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement. <em>See Brummett, </em>355 F.3d at 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b392-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
