Tapp argues that his offense did not involve the egregious conduct feared by Congress when it enacted the 100-to-l ratio for crack cocaine offenses and therefore a sentence reduction was warranted. He further argues that the district court\u2019s use of general language in its order suggests that the district court was influenced by improper factors, such as his efforts to secure post-conviction review of his conviction. Tapp\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar this appeal. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 296-97 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-23\">The district court\u2019s reasons do not suggest that it considered Tapp\u2019s post-conviction efforts to obtain review of his conviction in its \u00a7 3582(c)(2) determination. The district court was provided information regarding Tapp\u2019s personal circumstances and offense conduct, public safety considerations, and post-sentencing conduct, which are relevant factors in the district court\u2019s consideration of whether to grant a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672-73 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We may assume that the district court considered all arguments that were presented to it and thus considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 672-73; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Finally, reductions under the crack cocaine amendments and \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are not mandatory. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-38 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Tapp\u2019s arguments thus fail to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
