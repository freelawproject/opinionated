The district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous because it was time barred and, alternatively, barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith for these reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In his IFP motion, Palmer does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for denying IFP. By failing to discuss the district court\u2019s rationale for denying his IFP motion, Palmer has abandoned those issues, and it is the same as if he had not appealed the district court\u2019s order. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Accordingly, Palmer\u2019s IFP motion is denied and his appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Palmer is cautioned that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint as frivolous and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Palmer is further cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
