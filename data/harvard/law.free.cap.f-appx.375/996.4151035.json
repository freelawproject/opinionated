This appeal follows our denial of counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from further representation of Juwara on appeal pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our initial review of the record revealed at least one issue of arguable merit: \u201cwhether the oral sentence pronounced by the district court or the written judgment controls.\u201d The parties have now briefed that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">We have held that \u201c[w]hen a sentence pronounced orally and unambiguously conflicts with the written order of judgment, the oral pronouncement governs.\u201d <em>United States v. Bates, </em>213 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Chavez, </em>204 F.3d 1305, 1316 (11th Cir.2000) (same). <em>Cf. United States v. Purcell, </em>715 F.2d 561, 563 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cWhen there is an ambiguity in the oral sentencing, as opposed to a conflict between the oral pronouncement and the written judgment, it is proper to look to the written judgment to ascertain the court\u2019s intention.\u201d). The remedy in such a situation is a limited remand with instructions for the district court to enter an amended judgment that conforms to its earlier oral pronouncement. <em>See Chavez, </em>204 F.3d at 1316.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">The parties agree that the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court specifically and unambiguously stated that it was imposing a sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, while the subsequent written judgment does not conform to that oral pronouncement. Based on our precedent, the oral pronouncement of a 12-month term of imprisonment controls. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand with instructions for the district comb to amend the written judgment to conform to the earlier oral sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
