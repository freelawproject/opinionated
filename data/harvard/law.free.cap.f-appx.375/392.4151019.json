Ruiz-Guifar-ro was sentenced within his advisory guidelines range to 77 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Ruiz-Guifarro contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, is not empirically based and double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. As acknowledged by Ruiz-Guifar-ro, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Ruiz-Guifarro also contends that his sentence should be vacated as substantively unreasonable because it was based in part on \u00a7 2L1.2 and was greater than necessary to meet the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Regarding \u00a7 3553(a), Ruiz-Guifarro contends that his sentence overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense and failed to properly reflect his personal history and characteristics. The substantive reasonableness of Ruiz-Guifarro\u2019s sentence is reviewed for plain error because he did not object on that ground in the district court. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Ruiz-Guifarro\u2019s appellate arguments fail to establish that his sentence was the result of error, much less plain error. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31 &amp; n. 11; <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
