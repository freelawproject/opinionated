On appeal, Williams\u2019s sole argument is that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of the crime as charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">Williams has preserved for review his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence because he moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case and presented no evidence of his own. <em>United States v. Resio-Trejo, </em>45 F.3d 907, 911 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny the motion. <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir.2007). We view all of the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict and will affirm the conviction if a rational juror could have found the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>567 F.3d 721, 731 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 303, 175 L.Ed.2d 201 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">Williams was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2073 by making a \u201cfalse and fictitious entry of a matter relating to his duties, to wit: by making a false entry of stamp purchases.\u201d To secure a conviction, the Government must prove the specific allegations set forth in the indictment. <em>Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 217-19, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960); <em>United States v. Hoover, </em>467 F.3d 496, 502 (5th Cir.2006). If instead the Government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>proves that the defendant committed the crime in a manner that was not charged, then the indictment has been constructively amended and the defendant is entitled to a new trial. <em>Hoover, </em>467 F.3d at 502; <em>United States v. Chambers, </em>408 F.3d 237, 247 n. 6 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Here, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. The Government submitted video recordings showing Williams making sales to customers and the corresponding daily reports of Williams\u2019s transactions. An investigator testified based on the recordings and reports that when customers paid for stamps in cash, Williams often failed to scan the stamps into the point-of-service (POS) system as required and instead used the \u201cno sale\u201d key to open the cash drawer and complete the transactions. In other words, according to her testimony, he falsely entered stamp purchases as \u201cno sale\u201d or non-revenue transactions. Based on this evidence, a rational juror could conclude that the Government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Williams made a false entry of stamp purchases.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Williams contends that the specific charge required the Government to establish that he actually made an entry of stamp purchases, i.e., revenue transactions, in the POS system. Williams parses the language in the indictment too narrowly. It was sufficient, and consistent with the charge in the indictment, for the Government to prove that Williams made a false entry of stamp purchases by recording a \u201cno sale\u201d or non-revenue entry into the POS system when, in fact, a customer had made a cash purchase (i.e., a revenue transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
