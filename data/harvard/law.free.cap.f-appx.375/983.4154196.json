On appeal, Juan argues (1) the BIA and IJ erred in denying his application for cancellation of removal, and (2) he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the IJ. After review, we dismiss Juan\u2019s petition in part and deny in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Juan argues the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision finding his children would not suffer exceptional and unusually extreme hardship by returning to Guatemala or being left in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-8\">The Attorney General may cancel removal of an alien if the alien establishes \u201cremoval would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), which specifies matters not subject to judicial review concerning discretionary relief, \u201cno court shall have jurisdiction to review ... (i) any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1229b.... \u201d Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d determinations. <em>Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1222 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"ASE\">Subsequent to our holding in <em>Martinez, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether federal courts retained jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions by the BIA in denying motions to reopen, and noted judicial review was barred on matters where the Attorney General was given discretion under statute. <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 827, 837, - L.Ed.2d - (2010). The Supreme Court stated courts retained jurisdiction where discretion was granted by regulation, distin-guishirtg between \u201cdecisions specified by statute \u2018to be in the discretion of the Attorney General,\u2019 and therefore shielded from court oversight,\u201d and those \u201cmade discretionary by regulation,\u201d including motions to reopen. <em>Id. </em>Notably, the Court referenced \u00a7 1229b as one of the statutory provisions entrusted by statute to the discretion of the Attorney General. <em>Id. </em>at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">We lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Juan\u2019s application for cancellation of removal. <em>Martinez, </em>446 F.3d at 1222; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Kucana </em>does not change this result, but rather affirms our interpretation by noting \u00a7 1229b is one provision explicitly entrusted to the discretion of the Attorney General by statute and barred from judicial review. <em>Kucana, </em>130 S.Ct. at 829, 832, 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-17\">Juan contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel before the IJ because his attorney failed to present evidence to support his arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">Where represented by counsel, aliens are entitled to effective assistance of counsel under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due process clause. <em>See Mejia Rodriguez v. Reno, </em>178 F.3d 1139, 1146 (11th Cir.1999) (deportation). \u201c[A]n alien must establish that his or her counsel\u2019s performance was deficient to the point that it impinged the \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 of the hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201can attorney\u2019s deficient representation does not deprive an alien of due process if the deficient representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>merely prevents the alien from being eligible for suspension of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148. We have held the same rationale applied in precluding relief in applications for cancellation of removal. <em>Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1250-51 (11th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Because cancellation of removal is discretionary by statute, we cannot grant relief for ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Mejia Rodriguez, </em>178 F.3d at 1148; <em>Mohammed, </em>261 F.3d at 1250-51. Even assuming Juan had a constitutional right to discretionary relief from removal, he cannot establish his counsel\u2019s performance prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
