Handy argues that the district court erred by failing to grant a larger reduction of his sentence and failing to specify its reasons for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>sentence imposed. Handy\u2019s appeal waiver does not bar this appeal. <em>See United States v. Cooley, </em>590 F.3d 293, 297 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in certain cases where the sentencing range has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the applicable guidelines policy statements. \u00a7 3582(e)(2). The district court\u2019s determination of whether to reduce a sentence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>petition for cent, filed </em>(Jan. 28, 2010) (No. 09-8939).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In the instant case, the district court had before it the original presentence report, the statements of reasons for imposing sentence, the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, the amendment eligibility worksheet, Handy\u2019s inmate profile, the plea agreement, and the factual basis supporting Handy\u2019s plea, all of which spoke to a number of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Under these circumstances, the district court gave due consideration to the motion to reduce Handy\u2019s sentence and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Additionally, the district court is \u201cnot required to state findings of facts and conclusions of law\u201d when granting or denying a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 674 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Moreover, a defendant cannot successfully challenge a district court\u2019s failure to provide reasons \u201cfor <em>granting </em>his [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] motion but not providing a satisfactorily low enough sentence within the recalculated range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, on this record, Handy has not shown that the district court abused its discretion when it reduced Handy\u2019s sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010; <em>Shaw, </em>30 F.3d at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
