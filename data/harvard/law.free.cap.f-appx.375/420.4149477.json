Blount asserts that he was eligible for a sentence reduction because his sentence was based on a guidelines range that was subsequently lowered since his guidelines sentence range was calculated based upon U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and the offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1 were lowered by the crack cocaine amendments to the Guidelines. He contends that his mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(b) was improper under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its antecedents because the jury did not make the factual finding that his offense involved the amount of drugs necessary to trigger the statutorily mandated life sentence. He maintains that if his Guidelines sentence range were based on the amount of cocaine base found by the jury, it would be significantly lowered by the crack cocaine amendments, making the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion erroneous. Blount further argues that the district court erred by relying on the probation officer\u2019s determination that his Guidelines sentence range was not lowered by the crack cocaine amendments because the probation officer\u2019s determination was based upon erroneous drug quantity findings set forth in the PSR. He contends that challenges to the calculation of a base offense level may be raised in a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) motion. Blount asserts that the district court should have held a hearing on his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to consider his challenges to the drug quantity determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">Blount may not use a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to re-litigate whether he was subject to a statutory minimum life sentence under \u00a7 848(b). <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). As Blount was sentenced to a statutory minimum life sentence, the crack cocaine amendments did not lower his guidelines sentence range, and he was not eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. (n.l); 5Gl.l(b), (c)(2); <em>United States v. Pardue, </em>36 F.3d 429, 431 (5th Cir.1994). Blount has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion without holding an evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CRIm.P. 43(b)(4); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>42 F.3d 246, 248-49 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">AFFIRMED; MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT RECORD DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
