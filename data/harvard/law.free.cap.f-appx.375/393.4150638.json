He argues that the advisory guidelines range of 77-96 months of imprisonment was too severe, the illegal reentry Guideline is not empirically based and double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal record, and the presumption of reasonableness of a within guidelines sentence should not apply. Flores-Cruz asserts that because his prior drug conviction was used to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>increase his criminal history score and to increase his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the resulting guidelines range was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly with respect to deterring future crime and protecting the public, and that this affects the fairness and integrity of the criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\">We review for plain error because Flores-Cruz did not raise these issues in the district court. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009), cert. <em>denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). As Flores-Cruz concedes, this court has rejected the argument that there is no empirical support for the illegal reentry Guideline in \u00a7 2L1.2 and, therefore, that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to a within guidelines sentence under this provision. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. --, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67. Likewise, this court has rejected the assertion that using a prior conviction to determine the applicable offense level as well as a defendant\u2019s criminal history score results in impermissible double-counting. <em>Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Because the district court imposed a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir. 2008), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 346-47, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court determined that, although many of Flores-Cruz\u2019s convictions were remote in time, his recent DWI offenses indicated that he was still having problems with alcohol and that his criminal behavior had not stopped. Accordingly, Flores-Cruz\u2019s assertion that the sentence imposed was greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals of deterring future crime and protecting the public is without merit and is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339; <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008). He has failed to establish that his sentence was the result of error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
