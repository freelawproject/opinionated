California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Ball has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no <em>non-</em>frivolous issue for appeal. Because Ball is \u201csubject to a statutory minimum sentence above the upper end of his guideline range,\u201d the district had no authority pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to reduce his sentence based on the amendments to the crack cocaine Guidelines. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 581 (5th Cir.2010). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th CiR. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-11\"> Pursuant to 5tii Cut. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
