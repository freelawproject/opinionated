At the time of the casualty, the vessel was insured by ACE, which denied coverage because the vessel was not equipped with an automatic fire extinguishing system in the engine pursuant to the following policy provision:</p>\n<p id=\"AKW\">FIRE EXTINGUISHING AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">You agree that your yacht is equipped with a built-in and automatic system of fire extinguishing apparatus, properly installed in the engine room and maintained in good and efficient working order.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">On appeal, Stammel argues: (1) that ACE is precluded from applying this provision because the parties previously agreed that the Vessel was equipped with an automatic system of fire extinguishing apparatus; (2) that the phrase \u201cautomatic system of fire extinguishing apparatus\u201d is ambiguous; and (3) ACE is estopped from denying coverage because ACE knew the specific type of fire equipment on board prior to binding coverage, never objected, and issued insurance nevertheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">Having reviewed the record and considered the argument of the parties, we find no reversible error in the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Fire Extinguishing Agreement was not ambiguous, reasoning that the word \u201cautomatic\u201d means \u201cwithout human intervention\u201d and Stammel did not comply with the condition of the policy as the system on his yacht required human activation.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
