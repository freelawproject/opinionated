J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa_\">The plaintiff, Karen Bergin, appeals from the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board (board) affirming the decision of the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) denying her motion, filed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-315, to open the commissioner\u2019s decision denying her claim for benefits. We affirm the decision of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the plaintiffs appeal. The plaintiffs late husband, Donald Bergin, Jr. (Bergin), began working for the defendant state of Connecticut in the department of correction in 1974. He initially was employed as a correction officer and subsequently was promoted to lieutenant and then captain. He maintained an active lifestyle and exercised regularly. On June 30, 1997, he voluntarily retired and accepted an enhanced pension package offered by the defendant. At the time of his retirement, Bergin was forty-five years old. On September 16, 1997, he suffered a heart attack while jogging. He died shortly thereafter. At the time of his death, he was survived by the plaintiff and their four children.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">The plaintiff filed a claim with the commissioner seeking benefits under four different theories. The plaintiff sought benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 5-145a<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>31-306<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 31-284.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff also filed a claim for benefits on the basis of repetitive trauma. The essence of the repetitive trauma claim was that the daily stress caused by Bergin\u2019s employment duties caused him to suffer from hypertension, which was a substantial factor in his subsequent heart attack.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On December 3, 1999, the commissioner issued his findings. The com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>missioner concluded that Bergin was not an employee at the time of his death and, therefore, not eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The commissioner therefore dismissed the plaintiffs claim and declared that the other issues she had raised were moot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">On February 4, 2000, the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 31-315,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> filed a motion to open the December 3, 1999 decision. She argued that the commissioner addressed only her \u00a7 5-145a claim and failed to address the remaining claims. The defendant filed a motion in opposition, and the commissioner denied the plaintiffs motion to open on March 8, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The plaintiff appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s denial of the motion to open. At the hearing, the plaintiff conceded that she could not prevail on the \u00a7 5-145a claim because Bergin died after he retired from his employment with the state. See <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>4 Conn. App. 226, 231-32, 493 A.2d 286 (1985). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>board issued its written decision, denying the plaintiffs appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The board limited its review to the commissioner\u2019s denial of the motion to open. The board concluded that the commissioner did not abuse his discretion in denying the plaintiffs motion because the commissioner addressed all of the plaintiffs claims for benefits. The board also stated that the plaintiff had failed to provide any medical evidence to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the decedent\u2019s employment activities caused his hypertension and subsequent fatal heart attack. The plaintiff now appeals from the board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">At the outset, we note the limited scope of review that the procedural posture of this case affords us. The plaintiff never filed a motion to correct the findings of the commissioner; therefore, she is unable to challenge those findings now.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Krevis </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>63 Conn. App. 328, 334-35, 777 A.2d 196 (2001). Moreover, the plaintiff never directly appealed to the board from the commissioner\u2019s dismissal pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 31-301.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Our review, therefore, is limited to the issue of whether the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs motion to open.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The defendant argues that the board\u2019s decision should be affirmed because \u00a7 31-315 is not applicable to this case. Specifically, the defendant contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>the plain language of \u00a7 31-315 limits its applicability to cases in which there is an \u201caward\u201d or \u201cvoluntary agreement\u201d and, in the present case, the commissioner dismissed the plaintiffs claims. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">We note that \u201c[i]t is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . Where ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 798, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Slotnik </em>v. <em>Considine, </em>525 U.S. 1017, 119 S. Ct. 542, 142 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Although the issue of whether \u00a7 31-315 applies in situations where the commissioner has denied the claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits has not been subjected to judicial review, we recognize that it has been addressed by the board. In <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Black Tie Limousine, </em>No. 3306 CRB-3-96-3 (August 21, 1997), the commissioner dismissed a claim for benefits after the claimant\u2019s attorney failed to appear at the formal hearing. The attorney subsequently filed a motion to open pursuant to \u00a7 31-315, which the commissioner granted. The respondent employer and insurer appealed to the board, arguing that \u00a7 31-315 applies only in those cases involving an award of compensation or a voluntary agreement, not those in which an order of dismissal was entered. The board disagreed with the respondents\u2019 interpretation for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">First, the board noted that the plain language of the statute grants the commissioner the same power as any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>court to open or to modify a judgment in addition to the authority to open an award or voluntary agreement. Furthermore, the board relied on the last sentence of \u00a7 31-315, which provides that the commissioner shall retain jurisdiction over \u201cclaims for compensation, awards and voluntary agreements\u201d during the entire compensation period. Last, the board observed that \u00a7 31-301, which provides an avenue for the direct appeal from an award by the commissioner, does not mention dismissal orders. If the board accepted the respondents\u2019 argument, the bizarre result of leaving the claimant without any right to appeal would occur. The board concluded that \u201cit is apparent from a common-sense reading of the statute that \u2018award\u2019 encompasses dismissal orders as well as orders to pay compensation.\u201d <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Black Tie Limousine, </em>supra, No. 3306 CRB-3-96-3. The board reached a similar result in <em>Aubin </em>v. <em>Union City </em>Steel, No. 03463 CRB-07-96-11 (May 14, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Although we are not bound by the board\u2019s intexpretation of \u00a7 31-315, we agree with its decisions in <em>Murray </em>and <em>Aubin. </em>We are mindful of the \u201cprinciples underlying Connecticut practice in [workers\u2019] compensation cases: that the legislation is remedial in nature . . . and that it should be broadly construed to accomplish its humanitarian purpose. . . . The humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Daubert v. Naugatuck, </em>71 Conn. App. 600, 608, 803 A.2d 343, cert. granted on other grounds, 261 Conn. 942, 808 A.2d 1135 (2002). We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 31-315 is applicable in cases in which the commissioner has denied benefits to a claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">We now address the issue of whether the board properly affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision to deny the plaintiffs motion to open. As a preliminary matter, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>identify the apphcable standard of review. The decision to open an award is within the discretion of the commissioner. <em>Tutsky </em>v. <em>YMCA of Greenwich, </em>28 Conn. App. 536, 541, 612 A.2d 1222 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[although the commission may modify awards under certain circumstances, its power to do so is strictly limited by statute.\u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>244 Conn. 1, 15, 707 A.2d 725 (1998). \u201cSection 31-315 allows the commission to modify an award in three situations. First, modification is permitted where the incapacity of an injured employee has increased, decreased or ceased, or . . . the measure of dependence on account of which the compensation is paid has changed .... The plaintiff has not alleged that either of these contingencies has occurred. Second, the award may be modified when changed conditions of fact have arisen which necessitate a change of [the award]. The plaintiff has pointed to no change of fact necessitating a change in the original award. Third, [t]he commissioner shall also have the same power to open and modify an award as any court of the state has to open and modify a judgment of such court. This provision extends the commission\u2019s power to open and modify judgments to cases of accident . . . to mistakes of fact . . . and to fraud . . . but not to mistakes of law. . . . This provision, however, does not independently confer authority to modify awards for reasons not otherwise enumerated in \u00a7 31-315.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In the present case, the first two situations for which the commissioner has the authority to modify an award are inapplicable. The issue, therefore, is whether the commissioner had the authority under the third ground to open the order of dismissal. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201c[t]his provision extends the commission\u2019s power to open and modify judgments to cases of acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>dent; <em>Hayden </em>v. <em>Wallace &amp; Sons Mfg. Co., </em>100 Conn. 180, 188, 123 A. 9 (1923); to mistakes of fact; <em>Fair </em>v. <em>Hartford Rubber Works Co., </em>95 Conn. 350, 355, 111 A. 193 (1920); and to fraud; <em>Grabowski </em>v. <em>Miskell, </em>97 Conn. 76, 84, 115 A. 691 (1921); but not to mistakes of law.\u201d <em>Marone </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 17. Our review of the record does not reveal any accident, mistake of fact or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The plaintiff also argues that the principles of equity require the reversal of the board\u2019s decision. \u201cIn discussing the power to grant equitable relief, our Supreme Court has stated that [c]ourts of equity may grant relief from the operation of a judgment when to enforce it is against conscience, and where the appellant had no opportunity to make defense, or was prevented from so doing by accident, or the fraud or improper management of the opposite party, and without fault on his [or her] own part. . . . Fraud, accident, mistake, and surprise are recognized grounds for equitable interference, when one, without his [or her] own negligence, has lost an opportunity to present a meritorious defense to an action, and the enforcement of the judgment so obtained against him [or her] would be against equity and good conscience, and there is no adequate remedy at law. . . . Equity will not, save in rare and extreme cases, relieve against a judgment rendered as the result of a mistake on the part of a party or his [or her] counsel, unless the mistake is unmixed with negligence .... [T]he rule is founded on the necessity of the case; for if it was otherwise, petitions to set aside or enjoin judgments at law would become too common, and a court of equity be compelled generally to revise decisions at law which on legal principles should be final.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Honeywell, Inc., </em>66 Conn. App. 332, 338-39, 784 A.2d 428 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 914, 792 A.2d 852 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In the present case, the plaintiff failed to file a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s findings or to file a direct appeal from the commissioner\u2019s dismissal of the claim for benefits. It appears that the board\u2019s decision was a result of the plaintiffs failure to utilize her available procedural options. We conclude, therefore, that the plaintiff is not entitled to equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The decision of the workers\u2019 compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 5-145a provides in relevant part: \u201cAny condition of impairment of health caused by hypertension or heart disease resulting in total or partial disability or death to a member of . . . state personnel engaged in guard or instructional duties in the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers, Connecticut Correctional Institution, Enfield-Medium, the Carl Robinson Correctional Institution, Enfield, John R.

Grossman testified that protracted periods of stress from employment could cause hypertension.
