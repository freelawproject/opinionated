J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGD\">In this marital dissolution action, the defendant, Dennis R. Sweeney, appeals from the trial court\u2019s pendente lite order granting the motion of the plaintiff, Dale M. Sweeney, for permission to enroll the parties\u2019 minor child in parochial school. We raised the question on the court\u2019s own motion of whether the appeal should be dismissed for lack of a final judgment. After hearing oral argument on the matter, we conclude that the order is not immediately appealable as a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">On November 27, 2001, the plaintiff brought this action for a legal separation from the defendant. The defendant filed a cross complaint for dissolution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>marriage and for sole legal custody of the parties\u2019 minor child. The plaintiff responded with an amended complaint also seeking dissolution of the marriage and sole legal custody of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The court ordered joint legal custody, with the plaintiff as the \u201ccustodial parent.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The child had been baptized in the Roman Catholic faith and was scheduled to commence kindergarten in the 2002-2003 school year. On May 17, 2002, the defendant filed a motion stating that the parties did not agree on whether the child should attend public or parochial school and requesting \u201can Order of [the] Court setting the school that the minor child shall attend\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the fall of 2002. Three weeks later, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking the court\u2019s permission to enroll the child in parochial school.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The plaintiff argued that her motion should be granted because the defendant had fully participated in the child\u2019s baptism ceremony and had agreed on at least two separate occasions to enroll the child in parochial school. The defendant argued that the parties had not agreed to send the child to parochial school, and that the school the plaintiff had selected was small, underfunded, lacked certification and had not provided the parties with information on standardized testing. The defendant further argued that an order permitting the plaintiff to enroll the child in parochial school would be in violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On August 6, 2002, the court held an evidentiary hearing on the matter and granted the plaintiffs motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The court also ordered that the defendant pay for the child\u2019s tuition on a pendente lite basis, with credit to be received for any sums expended when the parties\u2019 assets were divided at the time of final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">The defendant appealed from the court\u2019s orders on August 19, 2002. On August 23, 2002, the court held a hearing to consider the defendant\u2019s motion for an automatic stay pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11. The court rejected the notion that the orders would have a \u201cspillover effect\u201d on future permanent orders regarding the child\u2019s education, but \u201creluctantly\u201d concluded that the orders should be stayed because they did not involve a custody matter. The plaintiff orally moved to terminate the stay pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-11 (c) and (d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court granted the motion and, upon further reflection, modified the order regarding payment of tuition by requiring that the <em>plaintiff </em>umake the tuition payments without coming out of the assets because I don\u2019t think I can order them out of the assets.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The defendant timely moved for review of the trial court\u2019s order terminating the stay. This court denied the motion for review. Thereafter, we placed the appeal on this court\u2019s own motion calendar. Counsel and pro se parties were ordered to appear and to give reasons, if any, why the defendant\u2019s appeal from the temporary order permitting the plaintiff to enroll the child in parochial school should not be dismissed for lack of a final judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>On October 16, 2002, counsel for the parties and the minor child appeared before this court for oral argument. The defendant argued that the temporary order should be considered a final judgment because it concluded his joint custodial right to make an educational decision on behalf of the child. The defendant also argued that enrollment of the child in parochial school would result in irreparable harm because he would not be able to \u201cundo\u201d the religious teachings and practices to which the child would be exposed. The plaintiff responded that the order was not a final judgment because the trial court had determined that it did not involve a custody matter. Counsel for the child argued that the order involved a custody matter and, thus, was immediately appealable. He also urged this court to take the appeal because a final decision regarding the child\u2019s education would be in the child\u2019s best interest. We conclude that the order is not immediately appeal-able as a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We begin our analysis by noting the well established rule that, with certain statutory exceptions, appeals shall be taken only from final judgments. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-197a and 52-263; see also Practice Book \u00a7 61-1. \u201cAn otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: (1) where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or (2) where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Connecticut courts in family cases have permitted the immediate appeal of temporary orders of alimony and support; <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Hiss, </em>135 Conn. 333, 336, 64 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>173 (1949); temporary custody orders; <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>224 Conn. 749, 757, 620 A.2d 1276 (1993); and temporary visitation orders.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Taffy. Bettcher, </em>35 Conn. App. 421,424 n.2,646 A.2d 875 (1994). Temporary orders of alimony and support are considered final because, once paid by one spouse to another, such sums subsequently cannot be recovered on appeal from the final dissolution judgment. <em>Hiss </em>v. <em>Hiss, </em>supra, 336; <em>see Madigan v. Madigan, </em>supra, 755. Similar logic applies to temporary custody orders because they affect the \u201cirreplaceable time and relationship shared between parent and child. It would be anomalous, therefore, to permit the appealability of otherwise nonreviewable orders relating to financial matters and to deny the appealability of orders relating to the personal interaction between a parent and a child.\u201d <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 755. We also have stated that temporary visitation orders are \u201cso related to the custody orders as to render them immediately appealable.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Taff </em>v. <em>Bettcher, </em>supra, 424 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Here, the court\u2019s temporary order permitting the plaintiff to enroll the parties\u2019 child in parochial school does not appear to fall within any of the established categories of appealable interlocutory orders in family cases. Nevertheless, we turn for guidance to the rele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>vant statutory provision on joint custody to determine whether the order may be immediately appealable as a custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56a (a) defines joint custody as \u201can order awarding legal custody of the minor child to both parents, providing for joint decision-making by the parents and providing that physical custody shall be shared by the parents .... The court may award joint legal custody without awarding joint physical custody where the parents have agreed to merely joint legal custody.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>5 Conn. App. 649, 656-57, 502 A.2d 933 (1985), cert. dismissed, 200 Conn. 804, 510 A.2d 192 (1986), we noted that under \u00a7 46b-56a (a), \u201cjoint physical custody is severable from joint legal custody.\u201d We also indicated that an order regarding education involves legal as opposed to physical custody when we explained that \u201c[t]he difference between a sole custodian and a joint legal custodian is that the sole custodian has the ultimate authority to make all decisions regarding a child\u2019s welfare, such as education, religious instruction and medical care whereas a joint legal custodian shares the responsibility for those decisions.\u201d Id., 657 n.9; see also <em>Barzetti </em>v. <em>Marucci, </em>66 Conn. App. 802, 803, 786 A.2d 432 (2001) (court\u2019s final orders awarded parties joint physical and legal custody, but granted plaintiff final decision-making authority on all medical decisions and granted defendant final decision-making authority on all other matters involving education and care of minor child).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Connecticut courts first considered the immediate appealability of temporary orders of custody in the <em>Madigan </em>case. See <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 749. In <em>Madigan, </em>the plaintiff asked for joint custody of two of the parties\u2019 minor children, with each parent having the children for three day periods. Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>751-52. The defendant asked for sole custody, with visitation rights for the plaintiff. Id., 752. The trial court ordered joint custody, the children\u2019s primary residence to be with the defendant, and visitation rights for the plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id. Our Supreme Court subsequently determined that the trial court\u2019s \u201ctemporary custody orders\u201d were immediately appealable. Id., 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In the present case, we conclude that the court\u2019s temporary order of legal custody is not governed by the ruling in <em>Madigan </em>because the substantive right at issue is the parent\u2019s authority to make decisions on behalf of the child, not the \u201cirreplaceable time and relationship shared between parent and child.\u201d Id., 755. Furthermore, were <em>Madigan </em>to be construed so broadly, we would be in danger of \u201copening the floodgates\u201d to a wave of appeals from temporary orders regarding education, religious instruction, medical care and a host of other issues, both trivial and significant, affecting a child\u2019s welfare. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>2 Conn. App. 179, 196, 478 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 194 Conn. 805, 482 A.2d 710 (1984); see also <em>Emerick </em>v. <em>Emerick, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 657 n.9. Such a result would not promote judicial economy and the important public policy of minimizing delay in trial court proceedings. <em>Madigan </em>v. <em>Madigan, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 752-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">We nonetheless decline to adopt a bright line rule that would preclude appeals from all temporary orders of legal custody, preferring instead to consider such appeals on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the case before us presents an issue of first impression that requires our careful review.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>We look to the arguments found persuasive in <em>Madigan </em>as a useful guide in our analysis. The <em>Madigan </em>court determined that temporary custody orders are immediately appealable because (1) they have irreparable consequences that cannot be repaired by the issuance of a subsequent order as part of the final dissolution judgment; (2) contested custody cases are often lengthy, which may delay resolution of the issues in dispute and interfere with the parent\u2019s substantive right over a significant period of time; (3) modification of a temporary order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 is not an adequate substitute for the right to appeal from the parent\u2019s loss of a substantive right; and (4) such orders are likely to have an adverse spillover effect on a subsequent permanent custody decision. Id., 756-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We first examine whether the court\u2019s temporary order regarding parochial education caused the defendant to suffer \u201cirreparable consequences.\u201d In making such a finding, the key elements to be considered are the nature of the consequences suffered by the defendant<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and whether those consequences can be repaired by the issuance of a subsequent order as part of the final dissolution judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Our Supreme Court has stated that the parents\u2019 interest in the care, custody and control of their children is \u201cperhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests . . . (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 216, 789 A.2d 431 (2002). The court also has spoken of the \u201cright of the custodial parent to make educational decisions in the best interests of the child . . . .\u201d <em>Hardisty </em>v. <em>Hardasty, </em>183 Conn. 253, 263, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>439 A.2d 307 (1981). The importance of that right cannot be underestimated. Education exposes a child to cultural values and, in the case of parochial schools, religious influences. We conclude, however, that to the extent the defendant has a joint custodial right to decide whether his child shall attend public or parochial school, he freely relinquished that right when he requested the court to settle the parties\u2019 dispute by \u201csetting the school that the minor child shall attend.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In seeking the court\u2019s intervention, both parties had the opportunity to express their views during a full evidentiary hearing on the matter. Moreover, the wording of the defendant\u2019s motion indicates, without question, that he was fully aware his viewpoint might not prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Furthermore, the court\u2019s temporary order did not subject the defendant to a permanent deprivation that cannot be remedied by a subsequent order. The defendant is not precluded from expressing his views when the issue of parochial education is raised again prior to the conclusion of the dissolution proceedings. In addition, the temporary order did not give to the plaintiff sole decision-making authority regarding other aspects of the child\u2019s education, nor did it prevent the defendant from participating in future educational decisions affecting the child. The order merely resolved the parties\u2019 disagreement over a single, isolated issue, namely, whether the child shall attend public or parochial school in the fall of 2002.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In light of our conclusion, the remaining arguments in <em>Madigan </em>are either unpersuasive or irrelevant. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the defendant has not suffered an irreparable loss, any delay in the dissolution proceedings will not subject him to a further deprivation. The argument that an appeal is the best means available to vindicate the loss also is unavailing because no such loss occurred. Finally, it cannot be assumed that the child\u2019s enrollment in parochial school for the current school year necessarily will influence the court\u2019s future orders regarding the child\u2019s education. The court considers many factors when making a permanent decision, including the availability and adequacy of the public schools, and the child\u2019s special needs and general welfare. <em>Hardisty </em>v. <em>Hardisty, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 262; see also <em>Carroll </em>v. Carroll, 55 Conn. App. 18, 24, 737 A.2d 963 (1999). Indeed, at the hearing on the automatic stay, the court considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that permitting enrollment of the child in parochial school would have a \u201cspillover effect\u201d on any future orders regarding the child\u2019s education. Moreover, should there be any \u201cspillover effect,\u201d the defendant may appeal from the court\u2019s final orders. Accordingly, the court\u2019s pendente lite order is not immediately appealable under the second prong of <em>Curdo. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Curdo, </em>supra, 191 Conn. 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> That term apparently referred to physical custody of the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> The defendant\u2019s motion specifically stated in relevant part that \u201cthe parties share joint legal custody of their minor child ....
