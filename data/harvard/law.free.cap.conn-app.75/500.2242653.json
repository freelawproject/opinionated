We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The jury reasonably could have found that following facts. On a Thursday evening in late July, 1999, the defendant went to Gecko\u2019s, a nightclub in New Haven. While at Gecko\u2019s, the defendant was having a conversation with a woman, Adrienne DeLeon. At some point during their conversation, the defendant and DeLeon were approached by DeLeon\u2019s then boyfriend, Joseph Martinez. Martinez, who believed that the defendant was flirting with DeLeon, threw a drink in her face and began screaming at DeLeon and at the defendant. Martinez and the defendant engaged in a verbal dispute, but no physical altercation occurred between the two men that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">On the following Sunday night, August 1, 1999, the defendant was at Humphrey\u2019s restaurant in New Haven. Martinez also was at Humphrey\u2019s that night with his friend, Peter Gaudioso. After seeing the defendant from across the room, Martinez pointed out the defendant to Gaudioso and informed him of the verbal altercation that he had had with the defendant only a few nights before. Gaudioso suggested that he and Martinez leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>the restaurant to avoid another altercation. Shortly thereafter, Gaudioso and Martinez exited the front door of the restaurant where they encountered the defendant, who was standing outside talking on his cellular telephone. Martinez approached the defendant because he thought he heard the defendant call him a derogatory name. The two men began to argue. The defendant told Martinez: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d Shortly thereafter, punches began to be thrown by both men. The fight spilled over into the parking lot of the restaurant, between two parked cars. At some point during the fight, the defendant took a knife out of his pocket, stabbed Martinez once in the stomach and then ran away. The fight had lasted only a matter of minutes. At that time, the defendant was twenty-five years old, six feet, one inch tall and weighed 190 pounds. Martinez was twenty years old, six feet, two inches tall and weighed approximately 240 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Martinez was taken to a hospital by ambulance where doctors performed emergency surgery to repair a stab wound to his abdominal area. On the surface, his wound measured about four inches wide and was approximately six to eight inches deep. The wound, which exposed Martinez\u2019s intestines, could have been fatal had it not been treated immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The defendant subsequently was arrested and charged with one count of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (l)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, in the alternative, one count of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Months after his arrest, during the spring of 2001, the defendant surrendered a knife, which he claimed was the knife he had used to stab Martinez, to an investigator who was employed by the defendant\u2019s attorney. That knife, which had a two inch blade, eventually was turned over to the police and was introduced at trial. The state, however, disputed that the knife with the two inch blade was the knife the defendant had used to stab Martinez. During its case-in-chief, the state offered the testimony of Edward T. McDonough, deputy chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut. McDonough testified that Martinez\u2019s injuries were consistent with a stabbing by a knife or other sharp object that would have to have been, at a minimum, about six inches in length. During cross-examination, the defendant admitted that he had, in the past, carried knives with much larger blades.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">At trial, the defendant claimed that he was acting in self-defense when he stabbed Martinez and, therefore, his use of force was justified. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant testified that he stabbed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>victim, but that he believed that his use of force was necessary to defend himself from the victim\u2019s attack. During its deliberations, the jury asked to hear the legal definition of self-defense again. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the charge of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (1) and a verdict of not guilty on the charge of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3). After the jury\u2019s verdict, defense counsel filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal in which he claimed that the evidence adduced at trial established that the defendant had acted in self-defense and that the state had failed to adduce evidence sufficient to disprove self-defense. In denying the defendant\u2019s motion, the court determined that if the jury had accepted the testimony of Martinez, the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim was disproved beyond a reasonable doubt. Additional facts will be set forth where necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly instructed the jury on the issue of self-defense. He advances three arguments in support of his claim. He argues that the court\u2019s instruction on self-defense improperly (1) limited the jury\u2019s inquiry to determining whether he was justified in using deadly physical force, (2) advised the jury as to how to evaluate his use of force and (3) advised the jury that its duty was to determine whether the victim was about to use force or was inflicting injury against the defendant prior to determining whether the defendant reasonably believed the victim was doing so. The defendant asserts that the court\u2019s improper instructions on self-defense deprived him of his constitutionally guaranteed rights to present a defense, to due process and to a fair trial under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>At the outset, we note that the defendant did not properly preserve the claims of improper jury instruction that he now raises on appeal. Moreover, the defendant has conceded in his brief that he induced two of the alleged errors by requesting the very instructions that he now claims were constitutionally infirm. He maintains that all three of his claims are, nonetheless, reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or, in the alternative, under the plain error doctrine. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We agree that the defendant\u2019s claims, including those that are the product of induced error, are reviewable under Golding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Although it is the general rule that a party who induces an error cannot be heard to complain about that error, unpreserved claims of constitutional magnitude, even when induced by the appellant, may be reviewed pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 295 n.31, 780 A.2d 53 (2001). Thus, as a threshold matter, we must determine whether the defendant has raised claims that meet the <em>Golding </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In the present case, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claims, alleging that the court improperly charged on the issue of self-defense, are reviewable under the first two <em>Golding </em>criteria because the record is adequate for review and because the right to establish a defense is constitutional in nature. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Texas, 388 </em>U.S. 14, 19, 87 S. Ct. 1920, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1019 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">We must now determine whether the defendant has satisfied the second two <em>Golding </em>criteria by demonstrating that there was constitutional error requiring a new trial. \u201cWe preface our analysis of the defendant\u2019s individual claims by once again stating, albeit briefly, the fundamental precepts that govern our review of these claims. An improper instruction on a defense, like an improper instruction on an element of an offense, is of constitutional dimension. ... In either instance, [t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>standard of review to be applied to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claim is whether it is reasonably possible that the jury was misled. ... In determining whether it was indeed reasonably possible that the jury was misled by the trial court\u2019s instructions, the charge to the jury is not to be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statement, but it is to be considered rather as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding [it] to a correct verdict in the case. . . . The charge is to be read as a whole and individual instructions are not to be judged in artificial isolation from the overall charge. . . . The test to be applied to any part of a charge is whether the charge, considered as a whole, presents the case to the jury so that no injustice will result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>40 Conn. App. 805, 809, 673 A.2d 1158, cert. denied, 237 Conn. 925, 677 A.2d 949 (1996). With those principles in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s individual jury instruction claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The defendant first argues that the court\u2019s charge on self-defense improperly limited the jury\u2019s self-defense inquiry to determining whether he was justified in using <em>deadly </em>force and thereby removed from the jury\u2019s consideration the option of determining whether he was justified in using <em>nondeadly </em>force. Specifically, he argues that in instructing the jury that this case involved deadly force, the court improperly resolved on its own an issue of fact for the jury, namely, whether the defendant had exercised deadly as opposed to nondeadly force, which played a significant role in the jury\u2019s rejection of his claim of self-defense and violated his right to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The following additional facts are necessary to our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant submitted a request to charge on the issue of self-defense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The defendant requested that the court\u2019s charge to the jury include the following: \u201cA defendant claiming justification of self-defense is permitted to use deadly force in two broad circumstances. He may justifiably use deadly force only if he reasonably believed that the other person was either using, or about to use, deadly physical force, or inflicting, or about to inflict great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\"><em>\u201cIn this case, we are talking about the use of deadly physical force by the defendant. </em>It is therefore the last portion of that section of the statute on self-defense that is implicated in this case, and I\u2019m going to read it to you.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">The court held a charging conference with counsel. Just prior to closing argument, the court asked counsel if there was anything either of them wanted to put on the record concerning their jury charge conference. Defense counsel responded that there was not. After closing arguments, the court stated to counsel: \u201cYou have the self-defense charge that we discussed, and I gather you both read it and agree that it comports with our \u2014 the content of our charge conference.\u201d Defense counsel responded: \u201cThe defense agrees, Your Honor.\u201d Thereafter, the court instructed on the applicable law. In its self-defense charge, the court included the exact language that the defendant had requested and now challenges on appeal. After the court excused the jury to begin its deliberations, the court asked counsel if there were any objections to the jury charge. Defense counsel indicated that he had no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">\u201cEven though we review this claim under the third prong of <em>Golding, </em>we note that [w]hen the principal participant in the trial whose function it is to protect the rights of his client does not deem an issue harmful enough to press in the trial court, the appellate claim that the same issue clearly deprived the defendant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial . . . is seriously undercut.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>55 Conn. App. 630, 650, 739 A.2d 751 (1999), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 257 Conn. 797, 778 A.2d 159 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The defendant now argues, for the first time, that the court should have charged the jury on the issue of nondeadly force because he adduced sufficient evidence at trial to raise a question as to whether he had used nondeadly or deadly force. He advances his argument despite the fact that it was he who had requested that the court confine its self-defense charge to whether he was justified in using deadly force. In essence, what the defendant claims is that the court should have, sua sponte, charged the jury on the issue of nondeadly force. The defendant, however, offers us no authority for imposing such a duty on the court, and we decline to do so on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">It is true that \u201c[i]f the defendant asserts a recognized legal defense and the evidence indicates the availability of that defense, such a charge is obligatory and the defendant is entitled, as a matter of law, to a theory of defense instruction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>209 Conn. 322, 340, 551 A.2d 1206 (1988). With regard to a claim of self-defense, that is so even where the defendant has not submitted a request to charge on a particular aspect of his defense and has not objected to its omission from the charge after the charge has been given. See id. (defendant entitled to charge on exception of \u00a7 53a-19 (b) (1) where evidence adduced at trial warranted such charge, despite fact that defendant did not request court to charge on exception or object to charge given at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">In the present case, we do not have a situation in which the defendant adduced sufficient evidence at trial to warrant a charge on a particular aspect of a defense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>did not file a request to charge and, therefore, relied on the court to fashion an appropriate charge as to that aspect of his defense. See id. Instead, we have a situation in which the defendant drafted and submitted his own request to charge, in which he essentially conceded that his theory of self-defense was limited to whether he was justified in using deadly force,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and now argues that he was, nonetheless, entitled to a charge on whether he was justified in using nondeadly force because he adduced evidence at trial that <em>would have </em>entitled him to such a charge. A defendant is allowed to make concessions; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>38 Conn. App. 661, 669, 664 A.2d 773 (even element of crime may be conceded by defendant), cert. denied, 235 Conn. 908, 665 A.2d 903 (1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1214, 116 S. Ct. 1837, 134 L. Ed. 2d 940 (1996); and when he does so, he cannot be allowed later to complain that those concessions have rendered his trial unfair. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitford, </em>260 Conn. 610, 632-33, 799 A.2d 1034 (2002) (\u201c \u2018when viewed in the context of defense counsel\u2019s participation in fashioning the supplemental] charge, [his] failure to except supports the . . . conclusion that the defendant accepted the supplemental] charge as correct\u2019 \u201d). \u201cDue process of law requires that the proceedings shall be fair, but fairness is a relative, not an absolute concept. It is fairness with reference to particular conditions or particular results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>supra, 670. Under the conditions present here, the defendant cannot complain that he has been deprived of his right to a fair trial. \u201cTo allow the defendant to seek reversal now that his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>then ambush the state with that claim on appeal. \u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. We refuse to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that with respect to this claim, the defendant has failed to satisfy the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he has failed to establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived him of a fair trial. Similarly, we conclude, on the basis of our review of the record, that the claimed error did not affect the fairness and integrity of, nor the public confidence in, the judicial proceedings, and, therefore, did not constitute plain error. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 687, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1125, 119 S. Ct. 911, 142 L. Ed. 2d 909 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly instructed the jury as to how to evaluate his use of force. The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of his claim. During its self-defense charge, the court instructed the jury that: \u201cA defendant claiming justification of self-defense may only use reasonable force to defend himself. Reasonable force is the amount of force that would be used by an average person of ordinary intelligence acting under the same circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">The defendant argues that this portion of the court\u2019s self-defense instruction was incorrect as a matter of law because it advised the jury to evaluate his use of force by a solely objective standard. He claims that it is well established that \u00a7 53a-19 incorporates a subjective-objective standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Corchado, </em>188 Conn. 653, 663, 453 A.2d 427 (1982).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Consequently, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>that the jury was misled as to how it should evaluate his subjective belief as to the amount of force necessary under the circumstances. That claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We agree with the defendant that the challenged portion of the instruction previously quoted seems to employ a purely objective standard and that use of that particular language has been discouraged by our Supreme Court. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>227 Conn. 518, 533, 631 A.2d 1149 (1993) (nothing in subjective-objective test refers to \u201c \u2018person of ordinary intelligence\u2019 \u201d). When viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, however, we are satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that this one, isolated statement misled the jury to arrive at an improper verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>32 Conn. App. 687, 699, 631 A.2d 324, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 932, 632 A.2d 708 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Although the trial court made such a statement, that does not end our inquiry. \u201cIt is well settled that a jury\u2019s evaluation of a claim of self-defense has both subjective and objective elements. ... In evaluating a claim of self-defense, a trier of fact must first examine the danger that a defendant claims he faced. It is clear that here [t]he statute focuses on the [defendant] claiming self-defense. It focuses on what <em>he </em>reasonably believes under the circumstances .... The jury must view the situation from the perspective of the defendant. . . . [T]he defendant\u2019s belief [however] ultimately must be found to be reasonable.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>supra, 40 Conn. App. 816.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>On the basis of our review of the charge as a whole, we conclude that the court in the present case clearly instructed the jury that in analyzing the defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, it was required to apply a subjective-objective standard. Here, prior to making the statement that the defendant now challenges on appeal, the court charged the jury that a \u201cperson is justified in the use of reasonable force upon another when he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to protect himself from the use of or impending use of force by another.\u201d A little later in the charge, the court explained that \u201cthe statute focuses on the person claiming self-defense. <em>It focuses on what he reasonably believed under the circumstances and presents a question of fact for the jury. </em>In other words, <em>what is important is what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u201cThe test for the degree of force in self-defense is a subjective-objective test, meaning it has some subjective aspects and some objective aspects. Self-defense thus requires the jury to measure the justifiability of the defendant\u2019s actions from a subjective perspective, that is, what the defendant reasonably believed under the circumstances presented in this case and on the basis of what the defendant perceived the circumstances to be. Now, the danger or apparent danger claimed by the defendant is to be determined from his standpoint at the time of the attack and under all of the circumstances.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Immediately following the statement that the defendant challenges on appeal, the court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cNow, \u00a7 53a-19 (a) requires, however, that the defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and not irrational or unreasonable under the circumstances as he was presented with them; that is, would a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s circumstances have reached that belief, that is the objective aspect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>test. <em>It is both a question of what his belief was and whether it was reasonable.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Although the challenged instruction, when viewed in isolation, could be construed as dictating a purely objective standard, when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, we conclude that the court adequately instructed the jury as to both the subjective and objective aspects of the test involved in a self-defense analysis. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary is without merit and, therefore, the defendant cannot meet the third prong of <em>Golding. </em>We also conclude that his claim does not merit plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly instructed the jury that it must first determine whether the victim was about to use force or was inflicting injury against the defendant before it determined whether the defendant reasonably believed that the victim was doing so. The challenged portion of the court\u2019s self-defense instruction states as follows: \u201cIn this case, <em>if you find the victim was about to use deadly physical force or inflict great bodily harm, upon the defendant, </em>and if you further find that the defendant had a reasonable belief that the victim was about to use deadly physical force or inflict great bodily harm upon the defendant, <em>then </em>the defendant would be justified in using deadly physical force upon the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">\u201cOn the other hand, <em>if you find proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim was not using or about to use deadly physical force or inflict greal bodily harm upon the defendant, </em>and if you further find proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had no reasonable belief that the victim was using or about to use deadly physical force or about to inflict great bodily harm upon the defendant, <em>then </em>the defendant would not be justified in using deadly physical force upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>victim. You would, under those circumstances, reject the defense of self-defense.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We note that this portion of the charge essentially mirrors the defendant\u2019s request to charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The defendant argues that the challenged portion of the charge misled the jury because it imposed a requirement that the jury first make a determination of whether the victim was using or about to use physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm. He further argues that that portion of the instruction diminished the subjective-objective inquiry required by \u00a7 53a-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We agree with the defendant that the previously quoted portion of the court\u2019s self-defense instruction, when viewed in isolation, was improper.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19. Whether the victim was, <em>in fact, </em>using or about to use physical force or inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm on the defendant is not a factor necessary to the jury\u2019s analysis of a self-defense claim because the focus of the statute is clearly on what the defendant reasonably believed. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19. We disagree, however, that, when viewed in the context of the jury instruction as a whole, it was reasonably possible that the jury was misled in reaching its verdict or that the challenged portion of the instruction diminished the subjective-objective inquiry required by \u00a7 53a-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Shortly before giving the challenged portion of the charge quoted above, the court instructed the jury: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>\u201cNow, the danger or apparent danger claimed by the defendant is to be determined from his standpoint at the time of the attack and under all of the circumstances. <em>The act leading to the defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense need not be an actual threat or assault; the test is not what the other person actually intended, but what the aggressor\u2019s act caused the defendant to reasonably believe was his intent. In other words, the danger need not have been actual if the defendant reasonably believed that the danger was actual, real, imminent or unavoidable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u201cIn judging the danger to himself, the defendant was not required to act with infallible judgment. Ordinarily, one exercising the right of self-defense is required to act instantly and without the time to deliberate or investigate. <em>Under such circumstances, it is often possible to mistake an actual threat when none, in fact, existed. The law does not require the same coolness in judgment in estimating his danger. </em>Note, however, that the defendant\u2019s belief of danger must be honest and sincere. Apparent danger with the knowledge that no real danger exists is not an excuse for using force.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">We also disagree that the challenged portion of the charge diminished the subjective-objective inquiry required by \u00a7 53a-19. The court provided the jury with extensive instructions on the subjective and objective portions of a self-defense claim and, in the course of those instructions, it made clear to the jury that it should focus on what the defendant reasonably believed. See part I A.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">We therefore conclude that when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole, it is not reasonably possible that the jury was misled by that portion of the court\u2019s charge. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the third prong of <em>Golding </em>because he has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>establish that a constitutional violation clearly exists. Likewise, we conclude that the claimed error does not warrant plain error review. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the state\u2019s evidence was insufficient to disprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he acted in self-defense and, therefore, the court should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal. He argues that in considering all of the evidence adduced at trial, the only reasonable and logical determination that the jury could have made was that he reasonably believed that the victim was using or about to use deadly physical force or about to inflict great bodily harm and that the defendant merely took reasonable action to defend himself. Accordingly, he argues that his conviction must be overturned and his case remanded for a judgment of acquittal to enter. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">At trial, the defendant claimed that he was acting in self-defense when he stabbed Martinez. \u201cSelf-defense is raised by way of justification, and when such defense is asserted the state shall have the burden of disproving such defense beyond a reasonable doubt. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u201cA person is justified in using deadly physical force, under the self-defense statute, \u00a7 53a-19 (a), only when he reasonably believes such force to be necessary because he reasonably believes that [another] person is (1) using or about to use deadly physical force, or (2) inflicting or about to inflict great bodily harm. Even then, under \u00a7 53a-19 (b) and (c), aperson is not justified in using deadly physical force on another person if (1) he knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force with complete safety by retreating, (2) with intent to cause physical injury or death to another person, he provokes the use of physical force by such other person [or] (3) he is the initial aggressor .... Section 53a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>19 presents a question of fact about what the defendant himself reasonably believed about his exposure to jeopardy under the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>33 Conn. App. 782, 789, 638 A.2d 633, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 231 Conn. 484, 651 A.2d 247 (1994); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>203 Conn. 466, 470, 525 A.2d 498 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In the present case, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence focuses primarily on the contradictory evidence that was presented at trial and his claim that the jury reasonably could have concluded that he reasonably believed that he was justified in using deadly force to defend himself against Martinez, who he emphasizes was some fifty pounds heavier. He asserts, mostly on the basis of his own testimony, that the only reasonable conclusion the jury could have reached was that he acted in self-defense. Such an argument, however, relates to witness credibility, not sufficiency of the evidence. See <em>Aksomitas </em>v. <em>Aksomitas, </em>205 Conn. 93, 101, 529 A.2d 1314 (1987), and cases cited therein; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>200 Conn. 664, 672-73, 513 A.2d 646 (1986). \u201cThe jury is the final arbiter of credibility . . . and it was free to believe the testimony given by [Martinez] and disbelieve the defendant\u2019s testimony.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Aksomitas </em>v. <em>Aksomitas, </em>supra, 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u201cOn appeal, we do not attempt to weigh the credibility of evidence offered at trial, nor do we purport to substitute our judgment for that of the jury. Instead, our review consists of a two-step process in which we construe the evidence presented at trial in a light most favorable to sustaining the verdict . . . and then determine whether the jury could reasonably have found, upon the facts established and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>(Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cavallo, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Despite the defendant\u2019s claim to the contrary, our review of the record reveals that the jury was free to disbelieve his claim of self-defense and to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he did not believe that Martinez was inflicting or about to inflict deadly force or great bodily harm or that the defendant reasonably believed that the degree of force that he used was necessary to defend himself. \u201c[W]e give deference not to the hypothesis of innocence posed by the defendant, but to the evidence and the reasonably inferences drawn therefrom that support the jury\u2019s determination of guilt.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>50 Conn. App. 109, 113, 717 A.2d 274 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">At the time of the altercation, Martinez was unarmed. The defendant, however, was armed with a knife. The defendant testified that he had used a small knife with a two inch blade. The state, however, offered evidence that Martinez\u2019s wound was consistent with a knife that had a blade exceeding six inches. The state also offered evidence that Martinez\u2019s wound was six to eight inches deep, four inches wide, and that the wound had exposed his intestines. Furthermore, the defendant testified at trial that he used the knife only because he was being severely beaten by Martinez. At the time of his arrest, however, he denied stabbing Martinez and claimed, instead, that the two had merely had a fistfight. The defendant also testified that initially, he washed and hid the two inch knife that he now claims he used to stab Martinez. It was not until some two months after his arrest that he turned that knife over to an investigator from his attorney\u2019s office. Also, photographs in evidence of the defendant\u2019s face and chest, taken just hours after the altercation, did not indicate any cuts or bruises or that he had sustained any serious injury from Martinez\u2019s punches. The photographs indicated only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that the defendant had a small lump behind one ear and some minor scrapes on his chest and arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In addition, Martinez and Gaudioso testified that Martinez landed very few punches and that the fight had lasted only a couple of minutes when the defendant pulled out his knife and stabbed Martinez. Despite the defendant\u2019s claim that the fight was dominated by Martinez, another witness, Roger Robinson, a bouncer at Humphrey\u2019s, testified that from what he observed, it looked like the fight between the two men was an even match. The defendant also had warned Martinez before the fight began: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to do this, you will regret it for the rest of your life.\u201d The jury was entitled to infer from that statement that the defendant intended to use his knife before the physical altercation even began and that use of the knife was not due to his belief that he was, or about to become, the target of deadly force or great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim that the state failed to produce sufficient evidence to disprove his claim of self-defense is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when: (1) With intent to cause serious physical injury to another person, he causes such injury to such person or to a third person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-8\"> See footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of assault in the first degree when ...
