On appeal, the respondent claims that the court improperly (1) violated her right to due process of law pursuant to the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10, of the constitution of Connecticut by failing to consider, in the adjudicatory phase of the termination proceedings, her actions after the petitions were filed and (2) determined that she had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of rehabilitation pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 17a-112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(c) (3) (B), as amended by Public Acts 2000, No. GO-137, \u00a7 1, and No. 00-196, \u00a7 15, now \u00a7 17a-112 Q) (3) (B),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, therefore, terminated her parental rights. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the respondent\u2019s appeal. The respondent\u2019s first child, a daughter, was bom on December 5, 1997. The respondent did not receive prenatal care until two months before the child\u2019s birth. The child was born premature and is medically fragile due to bronchial pulmonary disease. The hospital was concerned for the child\u2019s well-being as a result of her special needs, the respondent\u2019s history of drug use and the possibility that the respondent could not accommodate the child\u2019s needs. The family was referred to the newborn high risk unit in the department of children and families (department) in January, 1998, which closely monitors babies who are bom to dmg addicted parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">At the time of the department\u2019s initial involvement with the family, both parents were referred for substance abuse evaluations, but they resisted. The child was enrolled in a \u201cbirth-to-three\u201d program,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the parents were offered parent aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>In July, 1998, the child was referred to the department by her treating physician because she had a vaginal discharge. The department monitored the family and found that there was ongoing domestic violence in the home and that the respondent continued to use drugs. The respondent was offered treatment for her mental health, domestic violence and substance abuse issues, but she refused to participate. In addition, the respondent was hospitalized for depression and refused treatment services. In April, 1999, another incident of domestic violence occurred, and a restraining order was issued against the child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The respondent\u2019s second child, a son, T, was bom on July 2, 1999, by the same father while the parents were involved with continuing domestic violence concerns. In August, 1999, T suffered a skull fracture while in the respondent\u2019s care. According to a physician\u2019s report, the injury was inconsistent with the respondent\u2019s account of how it occurred. A report from the treating physician, Frederick B. Berrien, stated: \u201cMy major concern is in regard to possible negligence [toward T], If the child was being appropriately supervised, the [respondent] should have been able to protect the child from the fall or provided a more coherent explanation of the fall.\u201d At that time, the respondent again declined support services from the department to address her substance abuse problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The respondent\u2019s daughter was admitted to a hospital on November 9, 1999, with inflammation and bleeding from the genital region that <em>could </em>have resulted from trauma. Following another report from Berrien stating that a \u201ccomplete investigation of the possibility of sexual abuse must be undertaken,\u201d neglect petitions were filed for both children on November 19, 1999. The children were removed from the respondent\u2019s home under an order of temporary custody and, after a hearing, were placed in foster care. The department\u2019s petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>stated, inter alia, that both children were neglected in that they were being denied proper care and attention, physically, educationally, emotionally or morally. The petitions also alleged that the children were being permitted to live under conditions, circumstances or associations that were injurious to their well-being and that the children were uncared for in that their home could not provide the specialized care that the physical, emotional or mental condition of the children required. On March 16, 2000, the court found that the children were neglected and uncared for, and committed them to custody of the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">During the period of commitment to the department, the respondent, despite the department\u2019s offer of assistance, continued to refuse to address her mental health, domestic violence and substance abuse problems. On November 7, 2000, the department filed petitions for the termination of the respondent\u2019s parental rights with respect to both children. The reasons stated in the department\u2019s social study that was filed concurrently with the petitions included the assertion that the \u201c[parents have substance abuse, domestic violence, criminal behavior, homelessness, sexual abuse and mental health issues, which they failed to address in order to care lor their children\u201d and that the respondent had failed to achieve a sufficient degree of rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">In May 2001, the respondent\u2019s daughter was placed with a preadoptive foster family that wants to adopt her permanently. She has numerous behavioral problems, including being very oppositional, having tantrums and repeated nightmares, and exhibiting inappropriate sexual behavior. Her preadoptive family has made remarkable progress with the child, but she regresses after visits with the respondent. The court found that the respondent\u2019s daughter has bonded with her preadoptive parents and looks to them for support and guidance. T\u2019s current placement is with the same preadoptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>family, and the family also wants to adopt T. The court found that T has established a strong bond with his preadoptive family.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">According to a report prepared by Kelly Rogers, a licensed psychologist, the respondent superficially interacts with her children. Stephen Humphrey, a licensed clinical psychologist, concurred in that assessment of the respondent\u2019s relationship with her children and stated that she may have a problem setting appropriate boundaries for her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The respondent had a chaotic upbringing due to significant substance abuse issues in her family. She began drinking at an early age and began using illicit drugs at the age of thirteen. She is a polysubstance abuser and her relationship with her children\u2019s father is extremely volatile, which has led to numerous domestic violence arrests. According to Rogers, the respondent\u2019s \u201cembitterment is sometimes sufficient to generate clinically significant depression and anxiety, and a diagnosis of depressive disorder, [not otherwise specified], appears appropriate. Borderline and antisocial personality disorders were also indicated.\u201d According to a report by Robert Fox, a psychiatrist who treated the respondent following a suicide attempt, she suffers from bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">The court found that the respondent has not significantly addressed the severity of her personality disorder and drops out of rehabilitative programs before completion. Her visitation with her children is inconsistent, and she threatened to kill a department worker if her parental rights were terminated. She also has been arrested on numerous criminal charges, including burglary, robbery, larceny, assault and possession of narcotics. The respondent minimizes her failures by blaming the department for her stress and characterizes the department as unreasonable in its demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>On August 6, 2001, the hearing on the termination of parental rights began, and testimony was heard over a period of three days. On December 7, 2001, the court filed its memorandum of decision in which it found by clear and convincing evidence that the department had made reasonable efforts to reunify the respondent with her children pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c), now Q). The court also found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent had \u201cfailed to rehabilitate to such degree as would encourage the belief, that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of [the children], that she could assume a responsible position in [her children\u2019s lives]\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B), now 0) (3) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The court found that the respondent did not fully participate in counseling and, according to Humphrey, her \u201cinvolvement with her children seemed largely superficial and contrived.\u201d According to the court, the respondent\u2019s primary problems are her impulsivity, poor judgment, oppositional behavior, drug use and her tendency to blame others for her problems. The court also found that \u201cthere is a clear risk that her impulsive, oppositional functioning will continue to prolong her chaotic lifestyle and to delay indefinitely the return of the children to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">After finding that the allegations of the petitions were proven by clear and convincing evidence, the court then determined whether termination was in the best interests of the children. See <em>In re Roshawn R., </em>51 Conn. App. 44, 52, 720 A.2d 1112 (1998). The court then considered the seven statutory factors and made written findings. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 17a-112 (d), as amended by Public Acts 2000, No. 00-137, \u00a7 1, now \u00a7 17a-112 (k);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> see also <em>In re Tabitha P., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>39 Conn. App. 353, 360, 664 A.2d 1168 (1995). Included in those findings, the court wrote that the respondent failed to engage in the services provided by the department and did not fulfill the specific steps requested to regain custody of her children. The court also stated that the respondent \u201chas not adjusted her circumstances to make it in the best interest of either child to return to her home in the foreseeable future.\u201d The court then concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that it was in the children\u2019s best interests to terminate the respondent\u2019s parental rights. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cThe standard of review on appeal [from a termination of parental rights] is whether the challenged findings are clearly erroneous. . . . The determinations reached by the trial court that the evidence is clear and convincing will be disturbed only if [any challenged] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>finding is not supported by the evidence and [is], in light of the evidence in the whole record, clearly erroneous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Clark K., </em>70 Conn. App. 665, 668, 799 A.2d 1099, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 925, 806 A.2d 1059 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The respondent\u2019s first claim is that her right to due process, as protected by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 10,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was violated by the court\u2019s failure to consider, in the adjudicatory phase of the hearing, events that took place after the petitions were filed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u201cA hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases, adjudication and disposition. In the adjudicatory phase of the proceeding, the court must decide whether there is clear and convincing evidence that a statutory ground for the termination of parental rights exists.\u201d <em>In re Stanley D., </em>61 Conn. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>224, 229-30, 763 A.2d 83 (2000). According to Practice Book \u00a7 33-3 (b), now \u00a7 35a-7 (b), \u201c[i]n the discretion of the judicial authority, evidence on adjudication and disposition may be heard in a non-bifurcated hearing, provided disposition may not be considered until the adjudicatory phase has concluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In the case before us, the court determined that there was a statutory basis for terminating the respondent\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B), now (j) (3) (B), because the respondent had failed to achieve rehabilitation to such a degree as to be able to assume a responsible position in each of her children\u2019s lives. \u201cPersonal rehabilitation refers to the reasonable foreseeability of the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent, not merely the ability to manage his or her own life.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Stanley D., </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">According to Practice Book \u00a7 33-3 (a), now \u00a7 35a-7 (a), \u201cin the adjudicatory phase [of termination proceedings], the judicial authority is limited to events preceding the filing of the petition or the latest amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This court has expanded that rule to <em>allow </em>courts to consider events subsequent to the filing date of the petitions in the adjudicatory phase of termination proceedings. \u201cPractice Book \u00a7 33-3 (a) [now \u00a7 35a-7] limits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>the time period reviewable by the court in the adjudicatory phase to the events preceding the filing of the petition or the latest amendment. ... In the adjudicatory phase, the court <em>may </em>rely on events occurring after the date of the filing of the petition to terminate parental rights when considering the issue of whether the degree of rehabilitation is sufficient to foresee that the parent may resume a useful role in the child\u2019s life within a reasonable time.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Stanley D., </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 230; see <em>In re Amber B., </em>56 Conn. App. 776, 785, 746 A.2d 222 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The respondent\u2019s appeal challenges the evidence that a court <em>must </em>consider during the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings. The respondent argues that because this court has stated that trial courts may, in their discretion, consider such evidence, fundamental fairness requires the trial court to consider those events that take place up until the hearing. We do not agree with the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">\u201c [Our Supreme Court has] consistently held that \u2018may\u2019 is directory rather than mandatory. . . . The word \u2018may,\u2019 unless the context in which it is employed requires otherwise, ordinarily does not connote a command. Rather, the word generally imports permissive conduct and the conferral of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shiffrin </em>v. <em>I.V. Services of America, Inc., </em>53 Conn. App. 129, 136, 729 A.2d 784 (1999); see also <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Truelove &amp; Maclean, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 337, 349, 680 A.2d 1261 (1996). We conclude that the court had discretion concerning whether to consider events and behavior that occurred after the filing of the petition to determine if the respondent had failed to achieve sufficient personal rehabilitation to allow her to assume a responsible position in her children\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>A claim similar to the one before us was raised recently in which a respondent argued that the court did not consider events subsequent to the filing of the petition and improperly denied the respondent\u2019s motion to amend the termination petitions. See <em>In re Latifa K., </em>67 Conn. App. 742, 749-50, 789 A.2d 1024 (2002). In that case, this court cited events described in the trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision that demonstrated that the trial court, in fact, had considered events that occurred subsequent to the filing date. Id., 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The record in this appeal shows that the respondent was permitted, without objection, to present evidence that she had achieved rehabilitation after the petitions for termination were filed. The court heard that evidence and, in its memorandum of decision, referred to those events. The court\u2019s memorandum of decision is divided into two sections, one dealing with adjudication, the other with disposition. In the adjudicatory section, the court stated that \u201cthe [respondent] was, at best, erratic in both securing housing and employment and did not consider the impact of her choices in these areas or [their] effects on either of her children. [The respondent] showed poor judgment, impulsivity and oppositional behavior. All of these characteristics were demonstrated <em>throughout the pending matter regarding </em>[her children]. In fact, <em>despite her knowledge of the pending </em>proceedings, she continued to abuse illicit narcotics and accumulate new criminal arrests and convictions. [The respondent] continued to demonstrate poor judgment in failing to attend visitations with her children, failing to attend counseling sessions, getting fired from her employment and maintaining a relationship that resulted in domestic violence and the presence of illegal drugs in the home.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition to concluding that the court was not under an obligation to consider events after the filing of the termination petitions in the adjudicatory phase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>proceedings, we conclude that the court did, in fact, consider events subsequent to the filing of the petition and that the respondent\u2019s rights were not abridged. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In the alternative, the respondent argues that the court deprived her of her due process rights by not having an evidentiary hearing that focused solely on her current status and ability to achieve rehabilitation. Although it appears that her claim was not preserved at trial, we can address the respondent\u2019s argument easily, as it previously was addressed by this court. See <em>In re Deana E., </em>61 Conn. App. 197, 204\u2014207, 763 A.2d 45 (2000), cert. denied, 255 Conn. 941, 768 A.2d 949 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The respondent argues that a separate hearing is essential to due process and fair treatment under the standards set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976). Accord <em>In re Jonathan M., 255 </em>Conn. 208, 226 n.20, 764 A.2d 739 (2001); <em>Scinto </em>v. <em>Stamm, </em>224 Conn. 524, 535, 620 A.2d 99, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 861, 114 S. Ct. 176, 126 L. Ed. 2d 136 (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">This court has stated that \u201c[a] petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases .... It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>necessary, however, that the two phases be the subject of separate hearings. One unified trial ... is permissible.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>In re Eden F., </em>48 Conn. App. 290, 305-306, 710 A.2d 771 (1998), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 250 Conn. 674, 741 A.2d 873 (1999). In <em>In re Deana E., </em>this court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to apply the <em>Mathews </em>balancing test in denying the respondent\u2019s motion to bifurcate the termination of parental rights hearing. <em>In re Deana E., </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 204-207.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe statute [\u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B), now (j) (3) (B)] protects the due process rights of the respondent by requiring clear and convincing evidence in the adjudicatory phase. Using the balancing test of Mathews, therefore, is unnecessary and superfluous. In addition, Practice Book \u00a7 33-3 [now \u00a7 35a-7] specifically allows the court, at its discretion, to combine both phases into one hearing. We find that it was reasonable for the court to conclude that another court would not consider evidence inappropriately.\u201d <em>In re Deana E., </em>supra, 207. We conclude that the respondent\u2019s rights were adequately protected under the statute and that a separate hearing was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The respondent\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly found that the petitioner had proved by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent failed to achieve a sufficient degree of personal rehabilitation within the meaning of \u00a7 17a-112 (c) (3) (B), now (j) (3) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u201cOn appeal, we review a trial court\u2019s finding that a parent has failed to rehabilitate herself in accordance with the rules that apply generally to a trier\u2019s finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of fact. We will overturn such a finding of fact only if it is clearly erroneous in light of the evidence in the whole record. . . . We do not examine the record to determine whether the trier of fact could have reached a conclusion other than the one reached. . . . [0]n review by this court every reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Vincent D., </em>65 Conn. App. 658, 669, 783 A.2d 534 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The respondent correctly asserts that rehabilitation does not require that a parent be able to assume the full responsibility for a child without the use of available support programs such as those provided by the petitioner. See <em>In re Luis C., </em>210 Conn. 157, 167, 554 A.2d 722 (1989); see also <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>6 Conn. App. 194, 203, 504 A.2d 533, cert. denied, 199 Conn. 809, 508 A.2d 770 (1986). The respondent argues that the court ignored the significant strides that she has made in her drug rehabilitation efforts in the year prior to the termination proceedings and the positive interactions she had with her children during supervised visits. The court, however, makes an inquiry into the <em>full </em>history of the respondent\u2019s parenting abilities. <em>In re Galen F., </em>54 Conn. App. 590, 594, 737 A.2d 499 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u201c[T]he adjudicatory determination to be made by the trial court is whether the parent of a child who has been found by the [Sjuperior [Cjourt to have been neglected and uncared for in a prior proceeding has failed to achieve such degree of personal rehabilitation as would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and needs of the child, such parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child. . . . \u2018Personal rehabilitation\u2019 as used in the statute refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent. ... In conducting this inquiry, the trial court must analyze the respondent\u2019s rehabilitative status as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>relates to the needs of the particular child .... The trial court must also determine whether the prospects for rehabilitation can be realized \u2018within a reasonable time\u2019 given the age and needs of the child.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Tabitha P., </em>supra, 39 Conn. App. 360-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Although the standard is not full rehabilitation, the parent must show more than \u201cany\u201d rehabilitation. See <em>In re Stanley D., </em>supra, 61 Conn. App. 233; <em>In re Migdalia M., </em>supra, 6 Conn. App. 203. Successful completion of the petitioner\u2019s expressly articulated expectations is not sufficient to defeat the petitioner\u2019s claim that the parent has not achieved sufficient rehabilitation. <em>In re Vincent D., </em>supra, 65 Conn. App. 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Although the respondent has made successful strides in her ability to manage her life, the court had reasonable concerns that such rehabilitation was not enough to assume a responsible position in her children\u2019s lives, especially given the special needs of her children. The court\u2019s finding that the respondent had failed to achieve rehabilitation to that degree was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-12\"> The parental rights of the children\u2019s father also were terminated.

She provides no separate analysis under the Connecticut constitution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>254 Conn. 540, 553 n.6, 757 A.2d 482 (2000). We further note that our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cthe due process provisions of the United States and Connecticut constitutions generally have the same meaning and impose similar constitutional limitations.\u201d <em>In re Dodson, </em>214 Conn. 344, 362 n.15, 572 A.2d 328, cert. denied sub <em>nom.

She is not claiming, however, that she was unaware of the proceedings or that notice of the proceedings was defective. Her claim is more accurately described as a denial of her due process rights because events occurring after the filing of the petitions could be better and more accur ate indications of personal rehabilitation and, therefore, should have been considered in the adjudicatory phase of the termination of parental rights hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> We note that Practice Book \u00a7 33-3 was repealed effective January 1, 2003. Practice Book \u00a7 35a-7 (a) provides: \u201cIn the adjudicatory phase, the judicial authority is limited to evidence of events preceding the filing of the petition or the latest amendment, <em>except where the judicial authority must consider subsequent events as part of its determination as to the existence of a ground for termination of parental rights.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) That revision has no bearing on the appeal before us. We further note that under the facts before us, this case would not fall under the exception where a court <em>must </em>consider subsequent events. The events occurring after the filing of the petitions were introduced as evidence by the respondent and concerned her rehabilitative efforts. Those events were considered by the corut during the dispositional phase of the termination hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> \u201cWe have acknowledged that [t]he United States Supreme Court [has] set forth three factors to consider when analyzing whether an individual is constitutionally entitled to a particular judicial or administrative procedure: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Jonathan M., </em>supra, 255 Conn. 226 n.20. We note that the risk of erroneous deprivation would be minimal due to the presentation of events and behavior after the petition filing date for consideration during the dispositional phase of the hearing. The respondent would be allowed to present such evidence, and <em>any </em>recent rehabilitative efforts would be considered when the court determines if termination is in the best interests of the children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> We note that there is no evidence that the respondent in this case raised this issue previously either orally or in a written motion during the termination hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
