On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree, (2) the trial court improperly failed to disclose exculpatory and relevant material for cross-examination of the victim after performing an in camera review of the victim\u2019s confidential records, (3) the court improperly denied his motion for his appellate counsel to review the sealed, confidential records of the victim for purposes of preparing his appeal and (4) the court improperly failed to order a psychiatric examination of the victim. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. The defendant had been residing with the victim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in her apartment in New Haven, and paid her a weekly rent of $40, in the form of either money or drugs. The victim slept alone in her bedroom while the defendant slept on a couch in the living room. There was a door that separated the two rooms. On July 23, 1999, the victim, the defendant and Calvin Bromell collectively smoked between twenty to thirty bags of cocaine at the victim\u2019s apartment beginning at approximately 6 p.m. and continuing for several horas. Bromell eventually left the victim\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Sometime after 2 p.m. on July 24,1999, the defendant entered the victim\u2019s bedroom and asked her to have sex. The victim told the defendant \u201cno\u201d and walked the defendant to the door. She closed the door and laid back down on her bed. Shortly thereafter, the defendant entered the bedroom again in a rage, brandishing a switchblade knife, and yelled, \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna do it?\u201d The defendant then grabbed the victim\u2019s pants and attempted to take them off. A struggle ensued and both fell to the floor. While on the floor, the defendant began choking the victim. The victim eventually passed out, and the defendant left. The victim was transported to the Hospital of Saint Raphael for her injuries, which included abrasions on the front part of her neck and red marks on her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 53a-70 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the intent to assault the victim sexually or that his conduct constituted a substantial step toward the commission of sexual assault in the first degree. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">\u201cThe standard of review employed in a sufficiency of the evidence claim is well settled. [W]e apply a two-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [finder of fact] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In this process of review, it does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Padua, </em>73 Conn. App. 386, 392, 808 A.2d 361 (2002), cert. granted on other grounds, 262 Conn. 941, 815 A.2d 672 (2003). \u201cIn evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>73 Conn. App. 173, 179, 807 A.2d 500, cert. denied, 262 Conn. 923, 812 A.2d 865 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u201cTo convict the defendant of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-70 and 53a-49 (a) (2), the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the specific intent to commit sexual assault in the first degree, which, in turn, included the intent to have sexual intercourse and that the defendant took a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime. Intent may be inferred from the conduct of the accused and is a determination for the trier of fact. . . . Likewise, [w]hat constitutes a substantial step in any given case is a matter of degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>and a question of fact for the [trier].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>57 Conn. App. 463, 469, 749 A.2d 83 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The jury\u2019s determination that the defendant possessed the intent to commit sexual assault in the first degree is supported by substantial evidence. We note that \u201cthe actor\u2019s intent can be inferred from his or her verbal or physical conduct and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. Wilcox, </em>254 Conn. 441, 468, 758 A.2d 824 (2000). Here, the defendant had entered the victim\u2019s bedroom and asked for sex, which the victim refused. Moments later, the defendant entered the bedroom again in a rage, while brandishing a knife, and demanded, \u201cYou ain\u2019t gonna do it?\u201d A struggle ensued during which the defendant grabbed the victim\u2019s pants and tried to remove them. On the basis of that evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant intended to force the victim to have sexual intercourse with him due to his initial request for sex, his angry demand again for sex after she refused and his attempt to pull down her pants. The jury also reasonably could have concluded that the defendant intended to compel sexual intercourse by the use of force or the threat of the use of force based on the struggle between the victim and the defendant and his having been armed with a switchblade knife when he made his second demand for sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">There also was sufficient evidence for the jury to reasonably conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a substantial step in the commission of sexual assault in the first degree. \u201cThe act or acts must be something more than mere preparation for committing the intended crime; they must be at least the start of a line of conduct which will lead naturally to the commission of a crime which appears to the actor at least to be possible of commission by the means adopted.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>(Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. The defendant entered the victim\u2019s bedroom in a rage with a knife and then proceeded to engage in a struggle with the victim in an attempt to remove her pants. The jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s grabbing the victim\u2019s pants in an attempt to remove them while wielding a knife and demanding sex was a substantial step in forcing her to have sexual intercourse with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the court improperly failed to disclose relevant material for cross-examination after performing an in camera review of the victim\u2019s confidential records. The defendant argues that the failure to disclose those materials violated his rights under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant subpoenaed numerous confidential records of the victim from various organizations prior to trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each organization\u2019s file was made into a court exhibit as follows: (1) department of children and families, (2) Connections, (3) Hospital of Saint Raphael records concerning the events of July 24,1999, (4) American Medical Response, (5) Yale-New Haven Hospital, (6) office of adult probation, (7) the APT Foundation, (8) the Connecticut Men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tal Health Center, (9) Connecticut Valley Hospital, (10) Hospital of Saint Raphael records concerning the victim, (11) New Haven police department records concerning a fire at 1476 Chapel Street from October through December, 1999, (12) United States Department of Veterans Affairs, (13) New Haven police department records concerning the victim, (14) American Medical Response records concerning the victim on January 20, 1997, (15) New Haven fire department records for the attack at 1476 Chapel Street on July 24, 1999, (16) Gaylord Hospital, (17) New Haven police department dispatch tapes, recordings and calls concerning the attack on the victim on July 24, 1999, and (18) New Haven police department records concerning the victim on January 20, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Pursuant to the procedure set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990), the court conducted an in camera inspection of all the subpoenaed records. The defendant informed the court that he was seeking \u201canything dealing with prostitution, drugs, alcohol, lying and any psychiatric matters.\u201d After the court\u2019s in camera review of all the subpoenaed records, several documents were deemed to be material to the credibility of the victim as a witness. The victim consented to the disclosure of those records to the defendant and they were given to him on December 1 and 5, 2000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Records from the Connecticut Mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Health Center, the Dutcher Treatment Center and the APT Foundation revealed that the victim has been a consistent drag user for more than a decade, has demonstrated paranoid and psychotic symptoms, has been diagnosed pursuant to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed. 1994) (DSM-IV) as being \u201ccocaine dependent\u201d and having a \u201crecurrent major depressive disorder with psychotic features,\u201d and has a history of visual and auditory hallucinations stemming from her cocaine use.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On direct examination, the victim admitted to being a drag addict for eleven years. She also stated that she engages in prostitution to obtain drags or money to purchase drags. The victim also described her hallucinations. According to the victim, she would have visual and auditory hallucinations after smoking ten to fifteen bags of cocaine. She indicated, however, that she can differentiate between reality and a hallucination. The defendant extensively cross-examined the victim concerning her engaging in prostitution for drugs, and also made use of the disclosed records relating to her hallucinations and treatment for drag use in 1992, 1994 and 2000. Several of the disclosed documents were entered into evidence as full exhibits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, in closing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ment, the defendant drew the jury\u2019s attention to the victim\u2019s hallucinations and how those hallucinations affected her credibility as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u201cA criminal defendant has a constitutional right to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses, which may include impeaching or discrediting them by attempting to reveal to the jury the witnesses\u2019 biases, prejudices or ulterior motives, or facts bearing on the witnesses\u2019 reliability, credibility, or sense of perception. . . . Thus, in some instances, otherwise privileged records . . . must give way to a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional right to reveal to the jury facts about a witness\u2019 mental condition that may reasonably affect that witness\u2019 credibility.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Slimskey, 257 Conn. 842, 853-54, 779 A.2d 723 (2001). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination does not, however, allow him to discredit and impeach in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defendant might wish.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>52 Conn. App. 408, 415, 726 A.2d 1177 (1999). \u201c[T]he right to cross-examine witnesses does not include the power to <em>require </em>the pretrial disclosure of any and all information that <em>might </em>be useful in contradicting unfavorable testimony.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Our Supreme Court has set forth a specific procedure to accommodate the tension between the defendant\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination and the privacy interest of a witness in her confidential records. \u201cIf, for the purposes of cross-examination, a defendant believes that certain privileged records would disclose information especially probative of a witness\u2019 ability to comprehend, know or correctly relate the truth, he may, out of the jury\u2019s presence, attempt to make a preliminary showing that there is a reasonable ground to believe that the failure to produce the records would likely impair his right to impeach the witness. ... If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>in the trial court\u2019s judgment the defendant successfully makes this showing, the state must then obtain the witness\u2019 permission for the court to inspect the records in camera. A witness\u2019 refusal to consent to such an in camera inspection entitles the defendant to have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u201cUpon inspecting the records in camera, the trial court must determine whether the records are especially probative of the witness\u2019 capacity to relate the truth or to observe, recollect and narrate relevant occurrences. ... If the court determines that the records are probative, the state must obtain the witness\u2019 further waiver of his privilege concerning the relevant portions of the records for release to the defendant, or have the witness\u2019 testimony stricken. If the court discovers no probative and impeaching material, the entire record of the proceeding must be sealed and preserved for possible appellate review.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Ambrosio, </em>supra, 212 Conn. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Our standard of review of a challenge to a court\u2019s refusal to disclose privileged records is whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Olah, </em>60 Conn. App. 350, 354, 759 A.2d 548 (2000). \u201cDiscretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subseive and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. . . . It goes without saying that the term abuse of discretion . . . means that the ruling appears to have been made on untenable grounds. ... In determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. \u201cAccess to confidential records should be left to the discretion of the trial court which is better able to assess the probative value of such evidence as it relates to the particular case before it . . . and to weigh that value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>against the interest in confidentiality of the records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 856. \u201cOn appeal, this court has the responsibility of conducting its own in camera inspection of the sealed records to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to release those records to the defendant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>52 Conn. App. 708, 722, 728 A.2d 15, cert denied, 249 Conn. 911, 733 A.2d 233 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Our in camera review of the confidential records demonstrates that the court did abuse its discretion. We will not reveal specific details of the result of our in camera review because the victim may withhold her consent to the disclosure of that additional material. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Olah, </em>supra, 60 Conn. App. 355. We need only to identify sufficiently the documents in case of further review by our Supreme Court. Id. Succinctly stated, our review reveals several documents that are \u201cespecially probative of the [victim\u2019s] ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>261 Conn. 708, 718-19, 805 A.2d 705 (2002). The documents pertain to the victim\u2019s extensive drug use and psychiatric conditions, including the presence of auditory and visual hallucinations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cThe capacity of a witness to observe, recollect and narrate an occurrence is a proper subject of inquiry on cross-examination. If as a result of a mental condition such capacity has been substantially diminished, evidence of that condition before, at and after the occurrence and at the time of the trial, is ordinarily admissible for use by the trier in passing of the credibility of the witness.\u201d <em>State v. Esposito, </em>192 Conn. 166, 176, 471 A.2d 949 (1984). Here, the victim\u2019s testimony at trial and the disclosed records from the court\u2019s <em>D Ambrosio </em>review demonstrate that the victim suffers from hallucinations when she smokes cocaine. Material that documents that condition of the victim, therefore, would be relevant to cross-examination of her concerning her ability to observe and to recall the attack on July 24, 1999. The fact that the court found extremely similar documents especially probative of the victim\u2019s credibility and disclosed those documents to the defendant after receiving the victim\u2019s consent further supports our conclusion that it was an abuse of discretion not to disclose those additional documents we have found from our in camera review of the sealed records.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">We must next determine whether the court\u2019s decision in failing to disclose all probative documents affecting the victim\u2019s credibility was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Slimskey, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 859. \u201cThe correct inquiry for identifying harmless constitutional error is to ask whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . Whether such error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Upon review of the entire record, we conclude that the court\u2019s impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, the court disclosed to the defendant several documents from the victim\u2019s confidential files concerning her drug use, DSM-IV diagnoses and her extensive history of hallucinations dating from 1992 until 2000. The undisclosed documents would be merely cumulative of the documents in the defendant\u2019s possession. In addition, the defendant performed an extensive cross-examination of the victim concerning her hallucinations and drug use. The undisclosed documents would not have added substantively to the cross-examination of the victim relating to her ability to recall, recollect or narrate the events of July 24, 1999, due to her drug use and possible hallucinations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the court did not limit in any way the defendant\u2019s inquiry into the victim\u2019s hallucinations and drug use on cross-examination. There also was corroborating evidence to support the victim\u2019s testimony on material points, including the victim identifying the defendant in a photographic array on July 27,1999, her in-court identification of the defendant as her assailant, and photographs of injuries to her neck and face that were consistent with being strangled. There also was testimony and exhibits noting that the victim was alert and oriented, as opposed to high on cocaine, when she was treated for her injuries immediately after the attack. Upon review of the entire record, we conclude that the court\u2019s abuse of discretion in failing to disclose additional, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>cumulative material was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that the trial court improperly denied his request for his appellate counsel to review the sealed, confidential records of the victim for purposes of preparing his appeal. The defendant argues that both his federal and state constitutional rights to compulsory process, confrontation and due process require that records sealed pursuant to the <em>D Ambrosio </em>procedure be unsealed for appellate counsel to review in preparation of the defendant\u2019s appeal. We decline to review the claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">On October 9,2001, the defendant\u2019s appellate counsel filed a motion with the court seeking an order unsealing all court exhibits reviewed in camera and sealed by the court. The court denied the motion on October 17,2001. The defendant then filed a timely motion for review of the court\u2019s decision on October 29, 2001, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-6. In his motion to this court, the defendant puts forward the same argument included in his appellate brief on the issue. We granted review, but denied the relief requested on January 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">The defendant\u2019s claim, in which he essentially is requesting that we again review his motion to unseal the confidential records for appellate counsel\u2019s review, is dismissed as having been presented to us improperly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>See <em>Weber\u2019s Nursery, Inc. </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>71 Corm. App. 433, 438, 802 A.2d 206 (2002). Permitting the defendant to raise the issue again on appeal would be to provide two appellate reviews of the same issue and, therefore, we will not review the claim. See <em>Andrews </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>45 Conn. App. 242, 246, 695 A.2d 20, cert. denied, 242 Conn. 910, 697 A.2d 364 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly failed to order a psychiatric examination of the victim.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that a psychiatric examination would aid the court in determining whether the victim was competent to testify. In addition, the defendant argues that the failure to order a psychiatric examination impaired his constitutional right to confront and to cross-examine the victim. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\u201cThe competency of a witness is a matter peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and its ruling will be disturbed only in a clear case of abuse or some error in law. . . . [I]n determining the competency of a proposed witness the trial court should consider the capacity of the witness to receive correct sense impressions, to comprehend the facts to be developed, to recollect and narrate facts intelligently, and to appreciate the moral duty to tell the truth.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 677, 701 A.2d 1 (1997). \u201c[W]here the competency of a witness is challenged, the threshold question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>to be answered by the court is whether the testimony of that witness is minimally credible. If the testimony of a witness passes the test of minimum credibility, and is otherwise relevant, the testimony is admissible and the weight to be accorded it, in light of the witness\u2019 incapacity, is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 243-44, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u201cOur case law demonstrates that the drastic measure of ordering a psychiatric examination . . . should be taken only upon compelling reasons. . . . Such an examination should not be ordered if the trial court, after hearing the testimony of the witness, has no doubt of [the witness\u2019] mental soundness. ... In making such a determination, the trial court may make use of its own observations of the witness.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Here, the court performed an extensive in camera review of the victim\u2019s confidential records, including a review of documents pertaining to the victim\u2019s drug addiction and mental problems, specifically with regard to her hallucinations. The court also had an opportunity to observe the victim\u2019s demeanor and ability to testify, as well as to hear the substance of her testimony, all against the backdrop of the court\u2019s review of her mental health records. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the court abused its discretion in declining to order a psychiatric examination. The victim was able to understand the questions asked of her, to respond in a coherent manner and was able to clearly recollect the events of July 24, 1999. The court stated, after ruling on the pretrial motion for a psychiatric examination, that \u201c[n]othing in the records that I have reviewed . . . nothing in those records suggests that the [victim] does not possess the sufficient mental capacity and sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>testimonial capacity to make her competent in this case.\u201d Upon the defendant\u2019s renewal of his motion for a psychiatric examination of the victim, the court stated that after observing the victim testify, there was \u201ceven less basis now\u201d for a psychiatric examination to be ordered. On the basis of our own review of the confidential records of the victim and the testimony and evidence produced at trial, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a psychiatric examination of the victim to determine whether she was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The defendant further argues that the court improperly refused to order the victim to undergo a psychiatric examination to provide material for his cross-examination of her. \u201cThe defendant does have a right under the confrontation clause to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of [fact] and credibility, [can] appropriately draw inferences relating to the [reliability of the [state\u2019s witness]. . . . The confrontation clause requires that [if] the testimony of such a witness is to remain in the case as a basis for conviction, the defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to discover any infirmities that may cast serious doubt upon its truthfulness. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cWhile the competency of a witness is for the trial court to evaluate, the credibility of a witness is for the jury to determine. . . . The trial court may, in its discretion, limit the cross-examination of a witness so long as the defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not impaired. . . . This discretion includes matter[s] of discovery [concerning mental capacity] where material is sought for impeachment purposes. . . . We have held that the trial court has broad discretion in deciding whether to order the psychiatric examination of a witness for the purposes of impeachment. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">\u201cAgain, it has been emphasized that the discretion to condition a witness\u2019 testimony on the witness\u2019 submis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>sion to a psychiatric examination should be exercised sparingly. . . . The [trial] court [is] entitled to be leery of both psychiatric examinations of witnesses and psychiatric testimony about witnesses, because the jury can observe for itself . . . the witness\u2019s behavior. Criminal trials are complex enough without turning them into collateral investigations of the witnesses\u2014 investigations that would not only drag out trials and confuse jurors but also discourage people from serving as witnesses.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Here, the court disclosed to the defendant several documents concerning the victim\u2019s drug addiction and mental health issues, including her hallucinations. The defendant extensively cross-examined the victim on her drug habit and her hallucinations while utilizing those documents, and the court did not limit this area of inquiry in any way. When ruling on the pretrial motion for a psychiatric examination, the court stated that the defendant has \u201calready indicated to the court that [he] is in the process of arranging to have a medical expert look at [the disclosed documents].\u201d The defendant, however, failed to procure his own expert to analyze the records of the victim that were disclosed to present his own opinion. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s right [of cross-examination] is not infringed if the defendant fails to pursue a line of inquiry open to him. . . . The test is whether the opportunity to cross-examine existed, not whether full use of such opportunity was made.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Bruno, 236 Conn. 514, 533, 673 A.2d 1117 (1996). Because a compelled psychiatric examination of a witness can be a tool of harassment and the discretion to order such an examination should be exercised sparingly, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s request. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>supra, 242 Conn. 685. The defendant has failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation that deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>him of a fair trial, given that several of the victim\u2019s confidential records were disclosed and he had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim extensively on both the effects cocaine had on her ability to recollect and her past history of hallucinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> The identity of the victim remains confidential pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e, which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe name and address of the victim of a sexual assault under section 53a-70 . . . or of an attempt thereof, shall be confidential and shall be disclosed only upon order of the Superior Court . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the land of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .
