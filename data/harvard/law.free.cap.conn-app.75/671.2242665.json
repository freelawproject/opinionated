Samuels, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of four counts of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and four counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 (2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>He claims that the trial court improperly replaced a juror with an alternate by using a nonstatutorily sanctioned selection method, that it abused its discretion by allowing the state to amend its long form information after the jury had been impaneled and that the court improperly allowed the state to call multiple constancy of accusation witnesses. We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. During the 1998-1999 school year, the victim,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> who was then thirteen years old, lived with her grandmother. In the basement apartment of the grandmother\u2019s house lived the defendant, who was twenty-four years old at the time. The victim met the defendant shortly after she moved into her grandmother\u2019s house in September, 1998. The defendant would frequently spend time with the grandmother, who was partially blind, and the victim, and occasionally would drive them to go shopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In the summer of 1999, a dispute arose between the defendant and the grandmother, ostensibly over an unpaid loan to the defendant by the grandmother. The defendant was asked to move out of the basement apartment, which he did in late June, 1999. Soon after, the grandmother asked the victim\u2019s uncle, a friend of the defendant, to ask the victim if anything \u201cwas going on between [the defendant] and [the victim].\u201d When the uncle asked the victim about her relationship with the defendant, she alleged that on four separate occasions, she had had sexual intercourse with the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The police were notified shortly thereafter, and a report was filed on July 2, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">At the trial, which took place from July 17 through 20, 2000, the state called fourteen witnesses, seven of whom were constancy of accusation witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>defense called the defendant as its sole witness. The jury found the defendant guilty on all counts. On September 29, 2000, he was sentenced to thirty years incarceration, execution suspended after fifteen years, with twenty-seven months as a mandatory minimum sentence. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">On appeal, the defendant advances the following claims. When a juror needed to be replaced by an alternate, the court did not select the new juror by lot, as was prescribed by statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, the defendant claims that the state amended its long form information at such a late date in the trial as to violate his constitutional right to due process. Last, the defendant claims that four of the constancy of accusation witnesses improperly were allowed to give testimony and that the admission of their impermissible hearsay testimony denied him a fair trial. Because we agree with the defendant as to the last claim, we need not reach the first two claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The constancy of accusation doctrine has a long history in Connecticut, but its underlying rationale, questionable from the outset, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 294, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (en banc). The rationale stems from the ancient belief that a victim of a violent crime would naturally cry out immediately after an assault and that, by implication, if such a victim did cry out, her complaint was more likely true. Id., 295. That belief led to the corresponding supposition that a jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>would treat with skepticism one who did not cry out soon after she was attacked. Id., 294. So profound was the belief in that sociological phenomenon, and so entrenched was the distrust in a victim\u2019s delayed complaint, that proof of \u201chue and cry\u201d became a formal prerequisite for the prosecution of any rape case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id., 294-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">With the advent of the hearsay rule in the early 1800s, an exception was carved out for those fresh complaints, partially as a means to dispel the jury\u2019s inclination to distrust the victim if there were a delay in reporting. Id., 296. \u201cIts use thereby forestalled the inference that the victim\u2019s silence was inconsistent with her present formal complaint of rape.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In effect, the fresh complaint rule allowed a victim to testify that she had told others about an alleged sexual assault as anticipatory rebuttal against an attack on her credibility, either by the defendant or by the unspoken bias of jurors who, it was presumed, would tend to discredit a victim\u2019s claims unless she offered testimony that she had complained soon after the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The fresh complaint rule, in turn, spawned our current constancy of accusation doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, those to whom a victim purportedly made a complaint are permitted to testify that such a complaint was, in fact, made to them. That testimony is permitted to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony that she made such a complaint. Unlike courts in the majority of states, Connecticut courts had, historically, allowed constancy testimony for both the fact that a victim reported an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>assault and the details of what was said by the victim to the witness. Id., 297-99. Thus, the witness to whom the victim purportedly complained was permitted to testify as to the details of the victim\u2019s complaint to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony that she did, in fact, complain as stated. Recently, however, our courts\u2019 attitude to such testimony has become more circumspect, and, although the central element of the doctrine has been maintained, the scope of it has been consciously restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In <em>Troupe, </em>our Supreme Court expressly modified the doctrine to allow constancy of accusation testimony for the limited purpose of showing only that a complaint was made. Id., 304. Testimony is to be restricted to such facts as the identity of the alleged perpetrator and the timing of the victim\u2019s complaint, details to be \u201climited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge .... Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons <em>to whom the incident was </em>reported.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 304-305. The court\u2019s modification of the constancy of accusation rule was codified in \u00a7 6-11 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In <em>Troupe, </em>our Supreme Court held that \u201c[although we agree that the assumptions underlying the constancy of accusation doctrine are unfounded, we are also cog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>nizant of the fact that those misconceptions are not uncommon. . . . Hence, we hesitate to discard the benefit of this rule to a woman who does complain without a clearer understanding of the burdens the rule may impose on the woman who does not complain.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 301-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Through that prism of history, we now review the defendant\u2019s claims. The defendant claims, for two different reasons, that the court improperly allowed the testimony of four different constancy of accusation witnesses and requests that we review those claims. To the extent that the defendant raises claims not raised at trial, he requests review under the guidelines set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), and, additionally, he requests plain error review. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The first reason, the defendant argues, is that the victim did not testify that she actually had complained of the incident(s) to the witnesses and, therefore, the witnesses\u2019 testimony was not corroborative of the victim\u2019s testimony. The second reason offered by the defendant is that the alleged complaints to three of the witnesses occurred after the formal report to the police and that this should preclude the witnesses from being called under the constancy of accusation doctrine. Over the defendant\u2019s objection, all of those witnesses were, nevertheless, called on by the state as constancy of accusation witnesses and all testified. We will examine the testimony of the victim and the witnesses in regard to each of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">We note at this point that evidentiary claims are reviewed pursuant to an abuse of discretion standard. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pereira, </em>72 Conn. App. 107, 117, 806 A.2d 51 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 931, 815 A.2d 135 (2003). Moreover, \u201c[e]videntiary rulings will be overturned on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion <em>and </em>a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>216 Conn. 301, 306, 579 A.2d 515 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Constancy Witness T</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The victim testified that while at a Valentine\u2019s Day party in February, 1999, she spoke about the defendant to two friends, one of whom, T, later was called as a constancy of accusation witness. The following colloquy took place between the prosecutor and the victim:</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Did you tell anyone during the time that he was having sex with you? Did you tell anybody about him?</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: I told two people that \u2014 how he said that he considers me as his girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Did you tell them anything else?</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Are you sure?</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Could you be mistaken?</p>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">\u201c[The Witness]: I might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-17\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Who did you \u2014 who did you talk to?</p>\n<p id=\"b698-18\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b698-19\">\u201c[The Witness]: [A relative, C] and the other girl was [T],</p>\n<p id=\"b698-20\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b698-21\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Other than [C] and [T], while you thought the defendant was your boyfriend, did you tell anyone else?</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u201c[The Witness]: No.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Actually, did you tell someone else what had happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Who did you tell?</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: My uncle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">At several other points in the trial, the victim largely reiterated that same testimony,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> i.e., that she had told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>T and C that she and the defendant had a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">As the court held in <em>Troupe, </em>the prerequisites for the admission of constancy of accusation testimony are (1) that the victim testify that an assault took place and (2) that she testify as to the identity of the person to whom she reported the assault. Although it is uncontroverted that the victim testified that an assault took place, her testimony shows that she did not ever claim that she reported it to her friends, T and C. The premise of admitting constancy of accusation witnesses is to show a reciprocity between a victim\u2019s testimony concerning a complaint made to a witness and the witness\u2019s testimony concerning the complaint made by the victim. For there to be a comparison, the victim must testify that she actually complained of the incident to the witness. That the victim said the defendant considered her to be his girlfriend \u2014 whatever meaning may be attached to that statement \u2014 plainly falls short of a report of an incident (or incidents) of sexual assault.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Although we agree that testimony that qualifies as \u201ca report of the incident\u201d need not contain magic words, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>or, even necessarily be a precise statement,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> it should, minimally, be a statement that a reasonable person would find to be relating an incident of sexual assault. The victim\u2019s testimony regarding her conversation with T, we believe, cannot accurately be characterized as a complaint or a \u201creport of the incident\u201d as required by <em>Troupe </em>and \u00a7 6-11 (c) of the Connecticut Code of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Although we determine that the victim testified that she had not reported the incident to T, T nevertheless was called as a constancy of accusation witness, and, when called, testified that the victim had, in fact, reported that she had intercourse with the defendant:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Did [the victim] talk to you about anything about [the defendant] the night of the party? . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: She told me that [the defendant] was her boyfriend and that she had sex with him. And that was it.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Did she say when she would have sex with him?</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: No, she did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Did she say where she would have sex with him?</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: At his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: And did she say when she would go down there?</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: When [her grandmother]\u2019s not home . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">The defendant specifically objected to the testimony of T on the ground that the testimony of the victim did not indicate that she had reported the incident to T. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>That objection was timely made and was adequate to perfect the matter for review. As such, we agree with the defendant that the testimony of T as a constancy of accusation witness was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The Constancy Witness Teachers</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">We turn next to the testimony of the victim regarding her interaction with two of her schoolteachers who were permitted to testify as constancy of accusation witnesses. At trial, the defendant objected to the testimony of the two teachers on the ground that the alleged complaint to them occurred after the victim had filed her official police report, and, thus, was outside the ambit of the constancy of accusation doctrine. On appeal, the defendant additionally objects to the teachers\u2019 testimony on the ground that the victim did not testify that she had complained of the incident to either of those witnesses and that she had, in fact, never actually complained of the incident to the witnesses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The defendant requests <em>Golding </em>review of his additional ground. Because we agree with the first claim, we need not reach the second.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Specifically, the defendant claims that complaints made after the official charge do not fall under the constancy of accusation doctrine, and, as those complaints were made after that had occurred,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> they are not proper subjects of constancy testimony. In light of the stated purpose of the constancy exception, we agree that the objection has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Returning to the roots of the doctrine, the point of allowing the testimony of witnesses, whose sole function is to coixoborate the testimony of the victim that a complaint was made, is to act preemptively to rebut a jury\u2019s potential residual prejudice against the failure of a victim to complain promptly. <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 296. The constancy of accusation doctrine was originally meant, and has continued to serve, as a method of counterbalancing a supposed societal bias against late complaining assault victims: Practically speaking, it provided a means to verify complaints made between the time of the assault and the time of the official complaint.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Once the complaint has been for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>mally and officially lodged, the defense argues, any subsequent complaints cannot reasonably be the subject of an inquiry regarding their timeliness.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">We review that newly framed claim in light of the reasoning of <em>Troupe. Troupe </em>had the effect of narrowing the scope of the constancy of accusation doctrine as used in Connecticut. Most notably, it restricted the use of constancy testimony, allowing it for the sole purpose of corroborating the victim\u2019s testimony that a complaint had been made. Id., 304. The court also narrowed the reasoning behind the doctrine, rationalizing that it now serves only to counteract a lingering, false assumption. \u201c[T]he scope of our current doctrine is broader than necessary to protect against the unwarranted, but nonetheless persistent, view that a sexual assault victim who does not report the crime cannot be trusted to testify truthfully about the incident.\u201d Id., 303. If the purpose of the doctrine is to combat stereotypes held by jurors regarding nonreporting victims, once a victim has offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>cially reported the crime to the police, we do not believe any reasonable function can be further served by the admission of postcharge constancy testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">As the defense argues, once the formal complaint has been lodged, according to the doctrine\u2019s rationale, there should be no more constancy of accusation witnesses. Not only does the admission of that postofficial complaint constancy testimony <em>not </em>contribute to the rebuttal of any sexist bias, but it provides an unwarranted opportunity for the accumulation of redundant testimony prejudicial to the defendant. The defendant argues that the court improperly admitted the testimony of the two teachers because the alleged complaints that were made to them by the victim occurred after the official complaint was lodged and that the timing of such complaints places them outside the scope of permissible constancy of accusation testimony. We agree with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">At first glance, <em>State </em>v. <em>Romero, </em>59 Conn. App. 469, 757 A.2d 643, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 919, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000), appears to control. We believe that it does not and that this case is distinguishable. The defendant in <em>Romero </em>claimed that the trial court improperly allowed the testimony of a constancy of accusation witness to whom the victim had made statements long after the crime and after the defendant had been charged with the offense. Id., 471. This court concluded that the timing of a complaint does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, but merely affects the weight to be given to that evidence. Id., 475. We remain true to that view. \u201cThe delay ... in the victim\u2019s statements to [a friend] does not make [the friend\u2019s] testimony inadmissible, but rather, is a factor to be considered by the trier of fact.\u201d Id. The defendant in <em>Romero </em>did not make the claim, as does the defendant here, that the admission of postcharge constancy of accusation testimony itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>is contrary to the underlying doctrine, and the court\u2019s holding in <em>Romero </em>did not reach that question.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We believe that the testimony of the teachers, as constancy of accusation witnesses, was admitted improperly. Both teachers, in turn, testified, substantially, that the victim had reported the incident(s) of sexual assault to them.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The Constancy Witness Therapist</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The last constancy of accusation witness to which the defendant objects was the victim\u2019s therapist.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>defendant argues, and timely objected at trial, that the testimony of the therapist was likewise inadmissible because any alleged report of the incident to the therapist would have come after the formal charge had been made.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant argues, in the alternative, on appeal, that the victim never testified that she had reported the incident to the therapist.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Because that objection was not raised at trial, we do not reach the issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">For the same reasons discussed in part II B, we believe that the therapist\u2019s testimony also was admitted improperly. The therapist subsequently testified that the victim had told her that she was sexually abused by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Returning to the standard by which this court reviews evidentiary claims, we believe that the admission of the previously discussed testimony; see part II A, B and C; represents an abuse of discretion. We do not believe, however, that the defendant has shown that the admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>sion of any one constancy of accusation witness, alone, constitutes harmful error, given that seven constancy of accusation witnesses were presented, all of whom testified, improperly or not, to the same effect. Though that undoubtedly was prejudicial to the defendant, we do not believe that he has shown that the admission of the testimony of any individual witness rises to the level of substantial prejudice or injustice, the requisite standard for reversal on purely evidentiary claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The defendant makes the claim on appeal that the cumulative effect of all the improperly admitted constancy of accusation testimony rose to the level of a constitutional violation by depriving him of a fair trial. We agree. As that claim was not raised at trial, the defendant requests that we review the matter pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\u201c [A] defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>We conclude that the record is adequate to review the claim of error. See part II A, B and C. The defendant raises constitutional claims under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, as well as article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In particular, the defendant claims that the admission of the witnesses\u2019 testimony deprived him of a fair trial, and that his right to confront the witnesses against him and to subject them to a full and complete cross-examination was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Although we do not believe that the defendant was deprived of his right to confront the witnesses against him,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we do believe that the improper admission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>testimony of the four constancy of accusation witnesses nevertheless deprived him of a fair trial. The improper admission of the testimony of each constancy of accusation witness, we conclude, was harmless and did not, alone, create such substantial prejudice to the defendant as to warrant a reversal of the judgment. As noted previously, however, the testimony is part of a mosaic of improperly admitted evidence that, in the aggregate, served to deny the defendant a fair trial. \u201c[T]he trial court as well as the court of review must insist that fairness in the trial and in the argument shall be observed. Otherwise justice cannot be done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>10 Conn. App. 361, 390, 523 A.2d 1323 <em>(Bieluch, J., </em>dissenting), cert. denied, 203 Conn. 809, 525 A.2d 523, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 859, 108 S. Ct. 172, 98 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u201cIt is well settled that a violation of constitutional magnitude may be established even though there has not been a complete abridgement or deprivation of the right. A constitutional violation may result, therefore, when a constitutional right has been impermissibly burdened or impaired by virtue of state action that unnecessarily chills or penalizes the free exercise of the right. . . . Thus, [w]hatever might be said of [the state\u2019s] objectives, they cannot be pursued by means that needlessly chill the exercise of basic constitutional rights. . . . The question is not whether the chilling effect is incidental rather than intentional; the question is whether that effect is unnecessary and therefore excessive.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>50 Conn.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>73 Conn. App. 205, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>807 A.2d 1048 (2002), cert. granted on other grounds, 262 Conn. 939, 815 A.2d 673 (2003); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>supra, 50 Conn. App. 242; <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>supra, 10 Conn. App. 361. \u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>supra, 383 <em>(Bieluch J., </em>dissenting). That misconduct can range from failure to provide exculpatory evidence to the defense; <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963); to improper comments by the prosecutor made in closing arguments. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>236 Conn. 112, 115, 672 A.2d 899, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 910, 117 S. Ct. 273, 136 L. Ed. 2d 196 (1996), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>254 Conn. 290, 296, 755 A.2d 868 (2000). The right to a fair trial has, additionally, been found to have been abridged by improper jury instructions; <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>261 Conn. 553, 562, 804 A.2d 781 (2002); and by failure to allow evidence of a victim\u2019s prior sexual abuse. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rolon, </em>257 Conn. 156, 160, 777 A.2d 604 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">The common thread in those situations is the prejudicial impact on the parties\u2019 due process rights, generally implicating the parties\u2019 right to be tried before an impartial fact finder. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>27 Conn. App. 171, 177, 605 A.2d 563, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 907, 608 A.2d 693 (1992). \u201cThe appearance and existence of impartiality are both essential elements of a fair trial.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Santangelo, </em>205 Conn. 578, 602, 534 A.2d 1175 (1987). Whether the claim of a denial of a fair trial is of constitutional dimension is guided by whether the claim rests on a factual matrix that is within the mainstream of due process adjudication. <em>Daye </em>v. <em>Attorney General of State of New York, </em>supra, 696 F.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">We cannot overlook the fact that the improper admission of the testimony of the multiple constancy wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>nesses constituted a significant amount of prejudicial hearsay. Although any one of the hearsay statements, alone, would not have substantially prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, the cumulative effect of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, we believe, escalated the harm to a constitutional level. The aggregation of missteps at trial has frequently led to such results. See <em>Floyd </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>907 F.2d 347 (2d Cir. 1990) (cumulative effect of prosecutor\u2019s comments denied defendant fundamentally fair trial); <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 793 A.2d 226 (2002); (cumulative effect of four instances of improper conduct by prosecutor deprived defendant of fair trial); <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>supra, 73 Conn. App. 228-29 (numerous acts of misconduct so infected proceedings as to deprive defendant of fair trial). Again, the gauge of the constitutional violation is the overall fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">As a result, we find that the defendant has made a claim of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of his fundamental right to a fair trial. Thus, the second prong of <em>Golding </em>has been satisfied. \u201cThe first two requirements [of <em>Golding] </em>involve a determination of whether the claim is reviewable; the second two requirements involve a determination of whether the defendant may prevail.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>250 Conn. 807, 815, 740 A.2d 371 (1999). We find that the third and fourth prongs of <em>Golding </em>are satisfied as well. For reasons we will discuss, we believe that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and that the state has not shown the error to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In short, the improper admission of multiple constancy of accusation witnesses deprived the defendant of a fair trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">Here, the four of the seven constancy of accusation witnesses whose testimony improperly was admitted included a friend of the victim, the victim\u2019s therapist and two schoolteachers. Without the umbrage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>constancy doctrine, their testimony is simple hearsay, the unreliability of which is manifest by a significant discrepancy in the testimony of the victim and three of the witnesses. Although the court in <em>Troupe </em>held that all other evidentiary rules remain in effect; <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 304; here, the state explicitly relied on the constancy of accusation doctrine for the admission of that testimony. The testimony in question was a significant part of the state\u2019s evidentiary presentation argued to the jury. The state relied prominently on the improperly admitted testimony of the victim\u2019s friend, T, in closing argument,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and referred to the therapist\u2019s and the teachers\u2019 testimony as well. The potential damage caused by the testimony of the teachers was increased by the fact that no constancy of accusation limiting instruction was given to the jury regarding their testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">Although it is established that if erroneously admitted evidence merely is cumulative of other evidence, that alone does not constitute reversible error; <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>215 Conn. 148, 155, 575 A.2d 206 (1990); it is clear that repeatedly allowing such testimony \u201cleave[s] the jury with the impression that the State has gathered a greater number of witnesses than the defense . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 320 <em>(Berdon, J., </em>concurring). \u201cLater multiple accusations . . . [can serve] no purpose but to \u2018pile on\u2019 statement upon statement to impress the jury that if repeated often enough it must be true.\u201d C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. Sup. 2002) \u00a7 6.37.5, p. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Given the weight and volume of the improperly admitted testimony and its relative importance to the state\u2019s case, we believe that the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial before an impartial jury clearly and impermissibly was burdened, that the admission of the testimony of those four witnesses was substantially prejudicial to the defendant and that the state has not shown the cumulative effect of the improperly admitted testimony to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To conclude otherwise would provide prosecutors and trial courts no governance on the admission of the testimony of constancy of accusation witnesses, thereby allowing the state to accumulate witnesses with impunity, a result pernicious to justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">This case highlights the mischief that unfettered application of the constancy of accusation doctrine can generate.

In contrast to the victim\u2019s conversations with T and the two teachers, however, here, at least, she affirmatively testified that she had told the witness \u201cwhat happened.\u201d We conclude that insofar as that inquiry goes, that testimony suffices to trigger the witness\u2019 availability as a constancy of accusation witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\"> The defendant additionally requests that we review the matter for plain error.

The reasoning is that the clause is not violated by admitting declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements \u201cas long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 292. \u201cBecause constancy of accusation evidence is not admissible unless the victim has testified, and is subject to cross-examination, concerning the crime and the identity of the person or persons to whom the victim has reported the crime\u201d; id., 293; there is no constitutional violation. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>The facts here are different from those in <em>Troupe. </em>Here, the issue is not whether the defense was allowed adequate cross-examination of the victim on the identity of the person(s) to whom she had reported the crime, but whether the defense was allowed to cross-examine the victim fully and effectively on the identity of witnesses who <em>later claimed </em>that she had reported the crime to them. Here, in contrast to <em>Troupe, </em>it would appear that three of the four constancy of accusation witnesses in question should not have testified at all, given that the victim had not identified them as people to whom she had reported the incident and, thus, their testimony, which contradicted the victim\u2019s own testimony, provided a crucial basis on which the defense would have reason to cross-examine the victim, but could not. Once those witnesses had testified, and the defense was on notice as to the nature of their statements, the defendant argues, the opportunity to cross-examine the victim had passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">We are mindful that whenever hearsay is admitted and is safeguarded properly by the presence of the declarant, our courts, generally, have not found any constitutional violation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 292-93; see also <em>California </em>v. <em>Green, </em>399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S. Ct. 1930, 26 L. Ed. 2d 489 (1970). In the instances in which we have found such a violation, it was because the court impermissibly restricted the defendant\u2019s lines of inquiry when cross-examining the declarant. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 331-32, 618 A.2d 32 (1992). Here, the declarant was available, and no line of questioning was restricted. We therefore do not find that this situation satisfactorily implicates the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront his accuser. It does, however, implicate the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\"> \u201cThe defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is implicated by the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and by article first, \u00a7 8, of the Conned icut constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>supra, 10 Conn.

The overwhelming body of current empirical studies, data, and other information establishes that it is not inherently \u2018natural\u2019 for the victim to confide in someone or to disclose, immediately following commission of the offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>that he or she was sexually assaulted.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>8 Cal. 4th 746, 758, 883 P.2d 949, 35 Cal.

As one commentator asked: \u201cIs the value of what is left of the rule for credibility purposes outweighed by the rule\u2019s potential to prejudice the accused, when further viewed in the context of the legal complexities and niceties it generates for trials and appeals?\u201d C.

In <em>Kelly, </em>the defendant did not complain that the individual testimony of any of the constancy witnesses was inadmissible. Rather, he complained that the state was permitted to \u201cpile on\u201d by offering cumulative testimony from eight constancy witnesses. While acknowledging that, to some extent, the constancy testimony was cumulative, the Supreme Court declined to adopt a rule prohibiting multiple constancy witnesses whose individual testimony fits the parameters set by <em>Troupe. </em>Unlike the situation in <em>Kelly, </em>in the present case, the defendant has argued, and we agree, that the individual testimony of four of the witnesses offered for constancy of accusation was, in each case, improperly admitted for differing reasons and that the prejudice caused by the aggregation of these evidentiary missteps denied the defendant a fair trial. In sum, contrary to my dissenting colleague\u2019s assertion, this appeal is not about the \u201cpiling on\u201d of otherwise admissible testimony, but rather the prejudicial result of the aggregation of improperly admitted evidence. <em>Kelly </em>is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b716-8\">DRANGINIS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2G\">dissenting.

It is about a \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual relationship between a thirteen year old girl and a twenty-four year old man. Such crimes are commonly referred to as statutory rape, a situation in which the minor consents to the sexual act, but the consent is ineffective due to the minor\u2019s age and immaturity. See <em>United National Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Waterfront New York Realty Corp., </em>994 F.2d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 1993). Here, the victim never <em>complained to </em>anyone about her sexual relationship with the defendant. In fact, outside of bragging to her cousins that the defendant was her boyfriend, the victim never told anyone voluntarily or wanted anyone to know about the relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is an instance in which the victim\u2019s family and the state had to intercede to protect the victim from a man who took advantage of her. After the victim was specifically questioned by her uncle, she admitted that she and the defendant had had sexual intercourse. When her mother learned of the fact, she sought medical care for the victim and was told to inform the police, which she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The majority cites the policy and history of the hue and cry, the fresh complaint rule and the constancy of accusation doctrine, as they apply to violent, nonconsensuai sexual assault. In my opinion, that policy and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>history are inapplicable in a case of statutory rape where there is \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual intercourse between an adolescent who is younger than sixteen and an adult. In this case, the burden was on the state to prove the elements of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, the state had to prove that the defendant was more than two years older than the victim, that the victim was thirteen but not older than sixteen, and that the two had engaged in sexual intercourse. In proving its case against the defendant, the state had to overcome the inconsistencies between the victim\u2019s written statement and her various oral statements, and to contend with the defendant\u2019s defense that the victim had fabricated the sexual assault claim in response to the controversy between the defendant and the victim\u2019s grandmother. This court has \u201cheld that [u]nder <em>[State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>237 Conn. 284, 677 A.2d 917 (1996) (en banc)], the state is allowed to introduce any constancy of accusation testimony found necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charges.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vumback, </em>68 Conn.

Our case law is replete with teaching that appellate courts cannot discern the mood of the courtroom, the interaction between counsel and witnesses, and jury reaction from the cold, nonhuman pages of a transcript. See <em>Adams </em>v. <em>State, </em>259 Conn. 831, 844, 792 A.2d 809 (2002); <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>35 Conn. App. 160, 165, 644 A.2d 951 (\u201cWe were not there and the flavor of the court\u2019s remarks cannot be appreciated from reading the cold black and white lines of a transcript.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>244 Conn. 640, 653, 712 A.2d 919 (1998) (\u201c \u2018[Tjrial court has wide discretion to determine the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination.

Consequently, I am troubled by what I perceive as the majority\u2019s micromanaging the flow of evidence in the trial of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Before I address the defendant\u2019s claims, I want to make clear the context in which the charges were brought against the defendant. The defendant was charged, in part, with four counts of sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). Section 53a-71 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Statutory rape is a crime with a long history. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>81 Conn. 1, 69 A. 1054 (1908). In <em>Sebastian, </em>the defendant was a music teacher convicted of carnally knowing and abusing one of his students, a fifteen year old girl. Id., 2. \u201cWhile the offense of which the accused stood charged was not rape, it was a crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>essentially similar in character. It is not necessary to prove a want of consent on the part of the female; but this is simply because the law declares her incapable of consenting. Being thus incapable, there must always be a want of consent. Her tender years both render her peculiarly susceptible to the influence of others, and make it imperative that she should be protected against herself. Whether she yield to the solicitations of a seducer, or be the one to propose the guilty act, the law, therefore, declares to be immaterial.\u201d Id., 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">The statutory rape law, now \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), has been amended by our legislature, as recently as 1993. The legislative history of that amendment is instructive and has been relied on by this court and our Supreme Court since its enactment. \u201cThe general purpose of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) is to protect victims who are thirteen, fourteen or fifteen years of age, and thus may not have the full measure of maturity to make an intelligent choice regarding sexual intercourse, from being taken advantage of by someone who, because he or she is significantly older, may be able to persuade the victim to engage in physically consensual sexual intercourse.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Com. 543, 553-54, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967,120 S. Ct. 406,145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999). \u201cThere are many considerations that support the conclusion that the state has a compelling interest in restricting teenage sexual activity, some of which were mentioned by the legislators who approved the statute. The prevention of pregnancy, reduction of sexually transmitted diseases, and limitation of the opportunity of more sexually experienced persons to take advantage of those substantially younger are concerns of significant importance to society.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>47 Com. App. 68, 80-81, 702 A.2d 895 (1997), aff'd, 248 Com. 543, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>To demonstrate the manner in which this case falls within the ambit of the state\u2019s compelling interest in protecting the sexually vulnerable youth of our society, a fuller recitation of the facts reasonably found by the jury is required. The victim\u2019s grandmother owned a three-family residence, where she lived on the first floor. The defendant, a friend of the victim\u2019s uncle, rented the basement apartment beginning in December, 1997. The grandmother suffered extremely poor eyesight, and the defendant assisted her by providing transportation when she needed to shop. The defendant was treated as a member of the grandmother\u2019s family.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Due to her grandmother\u2019s poor vision, the victim went to live with her in September, 1998, to provide assistance. The victim was thirteen and the defendant was twenty-four at the time. The victim developed a romantic interest in the defendant and sent him letters. The victim and the defendant frequently spoke on the telephone. The defendant often visited the grandmother\u2019s apartment to visit with the victim. While he was there, at times, he gave hand signals to the victim for her to telephone him or for her to lift up her blouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">On occasion, the defendant telephoned the victim, asking her to come to his apartment to get something. The defendant, however, never had anything for her to retrieve. Instead, he took the victim to his bedroom where he removed her clothing. The defendant then instructed the victim to lie on his bed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant leaned over the victim and inserted his penis into her vagina. The defendant withdrew and ejaculated onto the victim\u2019s thigh. The defendant then instructed the victim to go to the bathroom and clean herself. The defendant also instructed the victim not to tell her mother or grandmother about their sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Intercourse was sometimes painful for the victim. Once after she had had intercourse with the defendant, the victim noticed that she was bleeding. At one time, the victim was afraid that she was pregnant. The victim discussed her fear with the defendant, who told her that everything would be all right. He gave her two white pills that he had obtained from a clinic, and the victim got her menstrual period two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The defendant first had sexual intercourse with the victim prior to Christmas, 1998. Initially, the victim reported that she had intercourse with the defendant four times during December, 1998, and January, 1999. At trial, the victim testified that she had sexual relations with the defendant ten to twenty times between December, 1998, and June, 1999. The two always had sexual intercourse on a Saturday morning in the defendant\u2019s apartment while the grandmother was out shopping. The victim previously had provided inconsistent statements as to whether the two always had intercourse in the defendant\u2019s apartment or whether they had intercourse there twice and twice in the grandmother\u2019s apartment. The victim and the defendant told one another that they liked one another. The victim thought the defendant cared for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">On or about Valentine\u2019s Day, 1999, the victim told her second cousins, C and T, that the defendant and she were boyfriend and girlfriend. Until her uncle confronted her, the victim had no intention of telling any member of her family about her sexual relationship with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">By June, 1999, the defendant\u2019s relationship with the grandmother had deteriorated. The grandmother brought a small claims action against the defendant to recover moneys she had lent to him. The grandmother paid the utility bill and complained to the defendant about his failure to turn off lights and water. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>was an altercation between the grandmother and the defendant, and the victim consequently telephoned 911 for police assistance. Thereafter, the defendant was asked to move out of the basement apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">The day the defendant moved out of the apartment, Jane Ruiz, a former girlfriend of the defendant, approached the grandmother and told her to be careful because the victim had written letters to the defendant. The defendant had told Ruiz that in one letter, the victim wrote that she wanted him \u201cto be her first . . . .\u201d The grandmother asked the victim\u2019s uncle to talk to the victim about what was going on between her and the defendant. When the uncle asked her specific questions, the victim told him of the sexual relationship she had had with the defendant. After the uncle told the victim\u2019s mother and grandmother, the victim told her family and explained why she had not told them about the sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The victim\u2019s mother sought advice from her pediatrician, who advised her to take the victim to Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. The victim\u2019s mother reported the incident to the police on July 2, 1999. The victim spoke with a male police officer, Michael Kot, and, subsequently, a female detective, Naomi Cagianello, observed the victim give a video statement to Linda Murphy, a member of the diagnostic and investigative team at the Aetna Foundation Children\u2019s Center at Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Thereafter, the victim discussed the sexual assault with a therapist at the Institute of Living, and two of her schoolteachers. At the request of her mother and grandmother, the victim prepared a written statement on July 28,1999. In her written and video statements, the victim alleged that she had sexual relations with the defendant four times. The victim\u2019s various statements were inconsistent about where the sexual acts had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>The victim was examined by Elaine Yorden, a physician board certified in pediatrics and adolescent medicine. Yorden\u2019s physical examination of the victim revealed that her hymen had been transected at the six o\u2019clock position, which is consistent with sexual penetration. The victim also had a vaginal infection commonly seen in teenagers who are sexually active.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The defendant testified. He maintained that he had a family like relationship with the grandmother\u2019s family and thought of the victim as a niece. He denied that he had a sexual relationship with the victim; the jury clearly did not believe him.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">I first address the claims on which the majority decided the defendant\u2019s appeal. In his brief, the defendant claims that the court improperly admitted hearsay testimony in violation of the rules of evidence, our case law and the state and federal constitutions. The defendant claims that the court improperly (1) admitted testimony from constancy of accusation witnesses whom the victim did not identify, in violation of <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 284, thus violating his right to confrontation, (2) permitted witnesses to testify, under the guise of constancy of accusation testimony, about statements concerning sexual assault, which the victim made to them after she had complained to the police,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) balanced the probative value of the testimony with its prejudice to him and (4) violated his right to a fair trial by admitting the testimony of too many constancy of accusation witnesses. The defendant had raised his constitutional claims pursuant to the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and his constitutional right to confrontation pursuant to the sixth amendment to the United States constitution. I disagree with all aspects of the defendant\u2019s claims and with portions of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">At trial, the victim testified that she told the following individuals about her relationship with the defendant: her cousins, C and T, her uncle, her mother, her grandmother, Kot, Cagianello, Murphy, her therapist, Yorden, and one of her schoolteachers. Each of those individuals, except C, plus a second teacher testified at trial that the victim had told him or her about her sexual relationship with the defendant. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court should not have permitted her cousin, T, her therapist and the two teachers to testily as constancy witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The defendant claims that the court improperly admitted the testimony of T, the therapist and her two teachers as constancy of accusation testimony. The defendant relies exclusively on <em>State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 284, for his claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>1 am of the opinion that the defendant, and the majority, have misapplied <em>Troupe.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\u201c[A] person to whom a sexual assault victim has reported the assault may testify only with respect to the fact and timing of the victim\u2019s complaint; any testimony by the witness regarding the details surrounding the assault must be strictly limited to those necessary to associate the victim\u2019s complaint with the pending charge, including, for example, the time and place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the attack or the identity of the alleged perpetrator. In all other respects, our current rules remain in effect. Thus, such evidence is admissible only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony and not for substantive purposes. Before the evidence may be admitted, therefore, the victim must first have testified concerning the facts of the sexual assault and the identity of the person or persons to whom the incident was reported. In determining whether to permit such testimony, the trial court must balance the probative value of the evidence against any prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id., 304-305. \u201cOf course, <em>the rule that we adopt today does not affect those cases in which the details of a sexual assault complaint are otherwise admissible, </em>as, for example, in the case of a spontaneous utterance or in the case of a prior consistent statement admitted to rebut a claim of recent fabrication.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 304 n.19.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Although I believe that the court properly admitted the challenged testimony under the constancy of accusation doctrine, the testimony also was admissible pursuant to other exceptions to the hearsay rule. \u201cAlthough [our Supreme Court\u2019s] decision in <em>Troupe </em>restricted the constancy of accusation doctrine, [our Supreme Court] also held that <em>Troupe </em>\u2018does not affect those cases in which the details of a sexual assault complaint axe otherwise admissible . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 40-41, 770 A.2d 908 (2001). Even if the court improperly admitted the evidence as constancy of accusation testimony, \u201c[w]e can sustain a right decision although it may have been placed on a wrong ground.\u201d <em>Stapleton </em>v. <em>Lombardo, </em>151 Conn. 414, 417, 198 A.2d 697 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly admitted the testimony of T because the victim did not testify that she had told T that she and the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>had engaged in sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the victim testified that she had told T only that she and the defendant were boyfriend and girlfriend. When asked by the prosecutor whether she had told T that she and the defendant were having sex, the victim denied having said so, but admitted that she may have been mistaken about whether she told T more than she admitted. On cross-examination, the victim testified that she did not get into any details about the assault with T.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> T, however, testified that the victim had told her that she was having sex with the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>The defendant\u2019s specific argument is that the victim\u2019s having told T that she was the defendant\u2019s girlfriend is not the same as reporting a sexual assault. The defendant overlooks his leading cross-examination about who the victim had told first about \u201cthis incident.\u201d See footnote 6. In response, the victim replied that she had told C and T, but that she did not get into details. We have no way of knowing what defense counsel or the victim meant by \u201cincident\u201d or \u201cdetails,\u201d as there were no follow up questions. Furthermore, the defendant never asked the victim what being boyfriend and girlfriend meant to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">T\u2019s testimony is quite consistent with the victim\u2019s testimony. T reported that the victim had said that she was the defendant\u2019s girlfriend and that they had had sex. \u201c[T]hat was it.\u201d See footnote 7. Again, defense counsel did not pursue his cross-examination to ask T what it meant to be boyfriend and girlfriend. If there was ambiguity about the relationship between the victim and the defendant, defense counsel made no effort to clarify that ambiguity. There is nothing in our case law, as the majority notes, regarding the testimonial talisman of reporting a sexual assault. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lisevick, </em>65 Conn. App. 493, 508, 783 A.2d 73, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 933, 785 A.2d 230 (2001); <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>52 Conn. App. 231, 243, 726 A.2d 629 (1999). A jury, however, may draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>230 Conn. 686, 692, 646 A.2d 147 (1994). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dziob, </em>133 Conn. 167, 170-71, 48 A.2d 377 (1946), the court stated that \u201c[t]he state thereafter offered the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>mother of a talk with the daughter some months before she was taken to the doctor, but the defendant claims that this did not constitute an accusation of the crime. While the daughter did not expressly state to the mother that sexual intercourse had occurred, the conversation was such that the mother could reasonably infer that it had, as she evidently did. The fact that some months intervened between this conversation and the talk with the doctor would not necessarily require the trial court to conclude that there was not a constancy of accusation, particularly when considered in the light of testimony of other witnesses as to accusations made by the daughter to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Regardless of the ambiguity, T\u2019s testimony was admissible for puiposes other than constancy of accusation. T\u2019s testimony was admitted properly under the prior consistent statement exception to the hearsay rule. See <em>State </em>v. <em>William C., </em>71 Conn. App. 47, 71, 801 A.2d 823, cert. granted on other grounds, 262 Conn. 907, 810 A.2d 277 (2002). \u201cThe general rule is that a party cannot strengthen the testimony of his own witness by showing that he made previous statements to the same effect as his testimony . . . .\u201d Id. \u201cIf the credibility of a witness is impeached by (1) a prior inconsistent statement of the witness, (2) a suggestion of bias, interest or improper motive that was not present at the time the witness made the prior consistent statement, or (3) a suggestion of recent contrivance, evidence of a prior consistent statement made by the witness is admissible, in the discretion of the court, to rebut the impeachment.\u201d Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 6-11 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Here, the court properly may have admitted T\u2019s testimony as a prior consistent statement for any of those three reasons. During his cross-examination of the victim, the defendant noted inconsistencies in her statements. He suggested that she had contrived the claim of sexual assault against him due to the conflict between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Mm and the grandmother. The legal difficulties between the grandmother and the defendant occurred subsequent to the victim\u2019s telling T of her relationsMp with the defendant. For those reasons, T\u2019s testimony also was admissible as a prior consistent statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">The defendant claims that the therapist\u2019s testimony was not admissible as constancy of accusation testimony because the victim disclosed to the therapist the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse subsequent to the time she had informed the police.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although I do not think that <em>Troupe </em>or any case stands for the proposition that oMy complaints made prior to telling the authorities are permissible constancy of accusation testimony, the therapist\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is admissible under the residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>exception to the hearsay rule; Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-9;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and under <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The victim testified that as a consequence of her sexual relationship with the defendant, she was receiving therapy. We do not know whether the therapist is a psychiatrist, psychologist or some other member of the mental health care profession. <em>In Kelly, </em>our Supreme Court held that a treating physician may testify as to the identity of the perpetrator and the details of a sexual assault as it is relevant \u201cto facilitate the treatment of <em>psychological </em>and physical injuries.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 45, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>228 Conn. 552, 565, 638 A.2d 578 (1994). <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although <em>Kelly </em>and <em>DePastino </em>address the physician-patient exception to the hearsay rule, I see no reason not to permit any other qualified, mental health professional from testifying about allegations of sexual abuse made by a patient. \u201c[I]n cases of sexual abuse . . . hearsay statements made in the course of medical treatment which reveal the identity of the abuser, are reasonably pertinent to treatment and are admissible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DePastino, </em>supra, 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">For those reasons, the therapist\u2019s testimony was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly admitted testimony from two of the victim\u2019s school<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>teachers as constancy of accusation witnesses and compounded the prejudice against him by failing to include their names in the list of constancy of accusation witnesses it read to the jury during its charge on constancy of accusation. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">During her testimony, the victim did not identify her teachers as individuals to whom she had reported the defendant\u2019s sexual abuse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> She testified in response to a question from the prosecutor, however, that she had a discussion with a teacher that led the teacher to believe that she had been sexually abused. One of the victim\u2019s teachers was teaching a civics class in which the students were watching a film concerning a girl who had been kidnapped and raped. The victim asked to leave the classroom. The other teacher saw the victim standing in the hall, crying. She approached the victim, who explained why she was not in class.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One week <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>or so later, the victim told her civics teacher why she had asked to leave the class.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The testimony of both teachers was admissible to show the victim\u2019s state of mind at the time she was asked why she was crying and why she had left class. State of mind is an exception to the hearsay rule, referred to in our code of evidence as then existing mental condition. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (4).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c[A]n out-of court statement that is offered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>establish the truth of the matter asserted is inadmissible hearsay unless the statement falls within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule. ... An out-of-court statement is not hearsay, however, if it is offered to illustrate circumstantially the declarant\u2019s then present state of mind, rather than to prove the truth of the matter asserted. ... Of course, for any such out-of court statement to be admissible, it must be relevant to an issue in the case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wargo, </em>255 Conn. 113, 137-38, 763 A.2d 1 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Here, the statements the victim made to her teachers were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to explain to each of the teachers the reason for her distress.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> For those reasons, the testimony of the teachers was not admitted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The testimony of the victim\u2019s teachers also was proper constancy of accusation testimony. \u201cThis court . . . has reviewed numerous trial court decisions in light of <em>Troupe. </em>In <em>State </em>v. <em>Orhan, </em>[supra, 52 Conn. App. 243], we held that [t]he controlling language from <em>Troupe </em>does not limit the identifying information that may be provided. It limits only the extent of the information provided. Our Supreme Court merely gave examples of how a sexual assault might be identified; it did not hold that that was the only testimony that could be provided.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vumback, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Regardless of whether the challenged testimony was admitted under the constancy of accusation doctrine or another exception to the hearsay rule, I agree with the majority that the testimony of each of them alone does not rise to the level of substantial prejudice or injustice to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Beliveau, </em>237 Conn. 576, 592, 678 A.2d 924 (1996). I also conclude that the testimony of those individuals together did not substantially prejudice the defendant. If anything, the testimony was cumulative, but not harmfully so.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">\u201cAlthough the defendant frames the appellate issue as one of a constitutional violation, [the] ultimate conclusion turns on evidentiary grounds.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>74 Conn. App. 332, 335, 812 A.2d 124 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 953, 818 A.2d 781 (2003); see also footnote 4. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if [the] error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. . . . The relevant inquiry is whether the claimed error of the trial court is likely to have affected the outcome of the trial.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Here, the victim herself testified that the defendant had abused her. Murphy testified in detail about her interview with the victim, and Yorden gave compelling testimony about the evidence of sexual abuse that she found during her physical examination of the victim, including a transected hymen and a sexually transmitted disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">For all of those reasons, I conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimonial evidence of T, the victim\u2019s therapist or her teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">I now turn to the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. The defendant claims that his federal constitutional right to confrontation was denied by the admission of the constancy of accusation testimony that was discussed in part I. The defendant also claims that the plethora of constancy of accusation testimony violated his right to a fair trial. I disagree with both of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">As previously discussed, I concur with the majority that the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of constancy of accusation testimony.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cIn Connecticut, it is well established that the constancy of accusation doctrine does not violate a defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. <em>State </em>v. Romero, 59 Conn. App. 469, 480, 757 A.2d 643, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 919, 763 A.2d 1043 (2000). Our Supreme Court has ruled that this is a fundamental tenet of confrontation clause jurisprudence, namely, that the clause is not violated by admitting a declarant\u2019s out-of-court statements, <em>as long as the declarant is testifying as a witness and subject to full and effective cross-examination. . . . [State </em>v. <em>Troupe, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 292].\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>71 Conn. App. 8, 13, 799 A.2d 1126 (2002). \u201cThe defendant attempts to \u2018put a constitutional tag on a nonconstitutional evidentiary ruling.\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The victim, the state\u2019s first witness, identified everyone to whom she had told of her relationship with the defendant. The defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine the victim and each of the witnesses who testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>fled that the victim had told them about her relationship with him. Although the defendant cross-examined the victim to some extent and cross-examined some of the witnesses, he failed to cross-examine other witnesses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> What is more, the defendant had the option of asking the court\u2019s permission to recall the victim during his case to elicit further testimony from her regarding her revelations to others regarding her relationship with him, which he did not do. See <em>State </em>v. <em>William </em>C., supra, 71 Conn. App. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\u201c[T]he decision whether to cross-examine a witness is almost always a purely tactical one. . . . When a party chooses not to cross-examine a witness in order to avoid the possibility of eliciting harmful testimony, his right to confront and cross-examine that witness as guaranteed by the sixth and fourteenth amendments of the United States constitution is in no way abridged.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>250 Conn. 611, 642, 737 A.2d 404 (1999), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>529 U.S. 1060, 120 S.

I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">The majority concluded, and I agree, that the testimony of the constancy of accusation witnesses individually did not harm the defendant. I part company with the majority, however, where it concludes that the cumulative effect of the constancy of accusation witnesses was harmful. Our Supreme Court repeatedly has \u201cdeclined the invitation to create a new constitutional claim in which the totality of the alleged constitutional error is greater than the sum of its parts; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tillman, </em>220 Conn. 487, 505, 600 A.2d 738 (1991), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1207, 112 S.
