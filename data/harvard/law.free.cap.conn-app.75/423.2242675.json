On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due process by denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence and (2) the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct by misinforming the court of the amount of heroin in the defendant\u2019s possession. Because the prosecutor\u2019s representation regarding the amount of heroin in the defendant\u2019s possession was irrelevant to the charge to which the defendant pleaded guilty, we affirm the judgment of conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The following facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s appeal. In November, 1999, the defendant was arrested subsequent to the execution of a search warrant for his residence at 125 Second Avenue in West Haven. The police seized drug paraphernalia, more than $12,000 in cash and a large quantity of heroin, cocaine and phencyclidine (PCP). In his statement to the police, the defendant admitted that the narcotics belonged to him and that the cash was from the sale of narcotics. The defendant initially was charged with three counts of possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a), three counts of sale of illegal drugs in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 2 la-278 (a) and one count of use of drug paraphernalia in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-267 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">On March 15, 2000, the defendant pleaded guilty, pursuant to the <em>Alford </em>doctrine,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to a substituted information<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> charging him with possession with intent to sell more than one ounce of heroin in violation of \u00a7 21a-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>278 (b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> During the course of the defendant\u2019s plea proceeding, the prosecutor articulated the factual basis for the charges against the defendant, specifically stating that the officers who executed the search warrant found approximately two pounds of heroin in small cylinders in the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The court canvassed the defendant and found that he was making his plea willingly, voluntarily and knowingly, and that he was represented by counsel. The court\u2019s canvass of the defendant included the following inquiry:</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u201cThe Court: And are you also pleading under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine because you recognize that the sentence you are about to receive, eighteen with the nonsuspendable five, the minimum mandatory, is a lesser sentence than you could receive because the maximum sentence is twenty years? Do you understand that, sir, as well?</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u201cDefendant: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The court also found the defendant guilty of having violated \u00a7 2 la-278 (b) and ordered a presentencing investigation. The court sentenced the defendant to eighteen years in prison, five years of the sentence were mandatory. The defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct and his motion for reconsideration. The defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly denied his motion to correct an illegal sentence and, in doing so, violated his right to due process pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut and the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">In his motion and on appeal, the defendant claims that the court relied on inaccurate information at sentencing, specifically the amount of heroin in his possession at the time the search warrant was executed. At sentencing, the prosecutor represented to the court that with the defendant\u2019s arrest, $3 million worth of pure heroin was removed from the streets. The defendant\u2019s counsel took issue with the amount of narcotics involved, stating to the court: \u201cTo my understanding, the amount of narcotics in this particular case was only about 200 grams, not that I am trying to say that that quantity of narcotic is not a considerable amount of narcotics, but it certainly is not anywhere near $3 million worth of narcotics. ... I am not saying that it is not a serious matter because it was 200 grams, not $3 million. I think the record should be clear for whatever future position [the defendant] has with parole, but that is what the case was.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The court responded to defense counsel as follows: \u201cAnd in the presentencing investigation, it is recited that, \u2018Located during the search was $12,310 in United States dollars, 988 grams of a white powdery substance, field tested positive for heroin, thirty-eight grams white powder tested positive [for] cocaine and fourteen grams of white powdery substance, PCP.\u2019 \u201d Defense counsel responded that the presentencing report the defendant received indicated that only 200 grams of heroin were found.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court sentenced the defendant to eighteen years in prison, five of which were mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence and subsequent motion for reconsideration. When articulating its reasoning, the court cited the language of the statute the defendant was charged with violating, i.e., \u00a7 21a-278 (b), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who . . . possesses with the intent to sell or dispense . . . any narcotic substance . . . .\u201d The court noted that the quantity of narcotics is not an issue in the statute. Furthermore, the court found that the substituted information alleged, at the time of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, that the defendant was accused of possession with intent to distribute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>greater than one ounce of heroin. Also, the toxicology report of February 9, 2000, concluded that the weight of the heroin was 47.49 grams, equaling 1.67 ounces. The court concluded that no evidentiary hearing was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We review claims that the court improperly denied the defendant\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Henderson, 8 </em>Conn. App. 342, 344-45, 512 A.2d 974, cert. denied, 201 Conn. 813, 517 A.2d 631 (1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1092, 107 S. Ct. 1304, 94 L. Ed. 2d 159 (1987). \u201cThe jurisdiction of the sentencing court terminates when the sentence is put into effect, and that court may no longer take any action affecting the sentence unless it has been expressly authorized to act.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuszynski, </em>23 Conn. App. 201, 206, 579 A.2d 1100 (1990). \u201cThe judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. \u201cAn illegal sentence is essentially one which either exceeds the relevant statutory maximum limits, violates a defendant\u2019s right against double jeopardy, is ambiguous, or is internally contradictory.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Constantopolous, </em>68 Conn. App. 879, 882, 793 A.2d 278, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 927, 798 A.2d 971 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201cWe recognize the principle that a sentence imposed within statutory limits is generally not subject to review. ... A judgment of conviction must conform to the crime with which the defendant was charged, and the sentence imposed must conform to that crime.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollo, </em>63 Conn. App. 487, 490, 776 A.2d 1176, cert. denied, 257 Conn. 904, 777 A.2d 194 (2001). \u201cSentences imposed in an illegal manner have been defined as being within the relevant statutory limits but . . . imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in a way which violates [the] defendant\u2019s right ... to be addressed personally at sentencing and to speak in mitigation of punishment ... or <em>his right to be sentenced by a judge relying on accurate information </em>or considerations solely in the record, or his right that the government keep its plea agreement promises .... 8A J. Moore, [Federal Practice (2d Ed. 1984) para. 35.03 [2], pp. 35-36 through 35-37].\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>15 Conn. App. 416, 444, 546 A.2d 292, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 809, 548 A.2d 441 (1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the defendant was not illegally sentenced. There was no trial, the defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to sell more than one ounce of heroin under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were not evidence, and the state was not required to prove anything in view of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The amount of heroin in the defendant\u2019s possession was irrelevant and immaterial to his sentence. Defense counsel conceded that the defendant was in possession of more than 200 grams heroin. The defendant was charged under \u00a7 21a-278 (b), which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person who . . . possesses with the intent to sell . . . any narcotic substance . . . for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>nor more than twenty years . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b). \u201cOnly the essential elements of the crime charged need be proved by the state. Therefore, any allegations in the information [that are] not essential to prove the elements of the crime charged need not be proved. Only the essential elements need be proved, and any allegations, any information that is not essential to that does not have to be proved.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>24 Conn. App. 316, 321, 588 A.2d 232, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 911, 591 A.2d 813 (1991). There is no dispute that the defendant was in possession of heroin with intent to sell. He was sentenced to eighteen years in prison, which is a sentence within the parameters of the statute. The court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the prosecutor was guilty of misconduct by misrepresenting the amount of heroin in the defendant\u2019s possession. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The defendant claims that the prosecutor misrepresented to the court that at the time of the arrest, the defendant was in possession of two pounds of heroin valued at approximately $3 million. As we concluded in part I, the amount of heroin and its value were not relevant to the sentence imposed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">It is well known that appellate courts do not make findings of fact. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 535, 680 A.2d 147 (1996). Appellate courts, however, review the whole record and do not overlook material contained in the trial court\u2019s file or the appendix to the defendant\u2019s brief. We may take judicial notice of the contents of the court\u2019s file. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>257 Conn. 695, 705 n.7, 778 A.2d 919 (2001). Here, the court file contains page nine of the final report from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>scientific services toxicology division, which also is in the appendix to the defendant\u2019s brief. See footnote 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The judgment is affirmed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-11\"> William Pagan is an apparent alias, as the defendant\u2019s legal name is Jose Rosario.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b444-12\"> In resolving the defendant\u2019s claims in this manner, we do not imply that the prosecutor\u2019s representation to the court was incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970). \u201cA defendant who pleads guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>62 Conn. App. 805, 807 n.1, 772 A.2d 690 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The defendant elected to plead under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine in return for a recommended sentence of eighteen years in prison, with a mandatory term of five years, rather than the maximum twenty years in prison that he faced if convicted of the crimes alleged in the initial information. The state also agreed to nolle certain other charges that were pending against him in return for the plea. The sentences to be imposed on the defendant for his prior arrests were to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in this case. The defendant also had pending criminal matters in New York that, of course, were not part his plea bargain.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b445-9\">The substituted information alleged in relevant part: \u201cAssisiant State\u2019s Attorney . . . accuses [the defendant] of possession wi1h intent to distribute greater than one ounce of Heroin and charges that at the Town or City of West Haven on or about the 6th day of November 1999, in the early morning hours at 125 Second Avenue, the said [defendant] did possess, with intent to sell to another person, approximately 2 pounds of Heroin in violation of Connecticut General Statutes [section] 21a-278 (b).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 21a-278 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who manufactures, distributes, sells, prescribes, dispenses, compounds, transports with the intent to sell or dispense, possesses with the intent to sell or dispense, offers, gives or administers to another person any narcotic substance, hallucinogenic substance other than marijuana, amphetamine-type substance, or one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance except as authorized in this chapter, and who is not at the time of such action a drug-dependent person, for a first offense shall be imprisoned not less than five years nor more than twenty years; and for each subsequent offense shall be imprisoned not less than ten years nor more than twenty-five years. The execution of the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by the provisions of this subsection shall not be suspended . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> In addressing the court, defense counsel also made the following observations. \u201cThe defendant had two prior felony convictions in New York State. He was on parole in New York State. He has an open A1 felony in New York State and he had a case in New Haven. He had this particular case, and they indicted him on a false representation case; also, that is before the court. I think we also negotiated that. Under the circumstances, I also have been able to work out a plea on the New York case; that he will receive concurrent time on the New York, Bronx, matter with the Connecticut sentence. I have not been able to work out anything with regard to the parole violation because that will be taken up with parole when he gets to the division of parole, since it is impossible at this time to do it. Under those circumstances, those are a very long sentence. To my thinking, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>I don\u2019t want to put myself in the position of the prosecutor, it was my analysis that it was the best that we can do. It is a sentence that gives him latitude to try to get out in time of maybe eight years or maybe half of whatever time parole here decides. He has approximately that much time in a \u2014 looking at that much time in New York to run concurrent with this time. So, under those circumstances, I recommend that [the defendant] take this particular sentence. I saw no real vital defense on the search warrant. There were bail-jumping charges that could have been placed in this particular case. There were bail jumping charges that were potentially open in the Bronx. What happened was that [the defendant] hit the end of the line and it ended here. It is a harsh sentence, but that is just the way it is.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b448-14\"> The presentencing investigation report includes the final report from the scientific services toxicology division of the department of public safety. Page nine of the final report, which is included in the appendix to the defendant\u2019s brief, contains the following summary: \u201cTotal weight of powder containing heroin . . . 902.331 grams = 1 lb., 15.82 ounces. . . . Total weight of Heroin as Free base in items . . . 47.49 grams = 1.67 ounces.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\"> During oral argument, the assistant state\u2019s attorney brought to this panel\u2019s attention, the case of <em>State </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>69 Conn. App. 378, 793 A.2d 1224, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 935, 802 A.2d 88, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1056, 123 S. Ct. 630, 154 L. Ed. 2d 536 (2002). In <em>Francis, </em>the panel held that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s claim under Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 where the motion to correct the illegal sentence did not attack the validity of the sentence as exceeding the maximum statutory limits, did not violate a mandatory minimum sentence, did not violate double jeopardy rights and was neither ambiguous nor internally contradictory. Id., 384. The holding in <em>Francis </em>is not consistent with <em>State </em>v. <em>McNellis, </em>supra, 15 Conn. 444. <em>McNellis </em>has not been overruled by an en banc panel of this court or by our Supreme Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b452-17\"> In his reply brief, the defendant claims that he was illegally sentenced because he is drug-dependent. That claim was not raised in the trial court and, therefore, we will not afford it review. See <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Cordisco, </em>37 Conn. App. 515, 522, 657 A.2d 230, cert. denied, 234 Conn. 907, 659 A.2d 1207 (1995). Even if the defendant had requested review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), which he did not, his claim would fail because the record is inadequate for our review. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>74 Conn. App. 391, 401-402, 812 A.2d 141 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 952, 817 A.2d 110 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
