Defendant abandoned the premises because of gambling in the building, and sent the keys to plaintiff, who refused to accept them, and they were afterwards placed on plaintiff\u2019s desk. Plaintiff re-rented the premises for a short while during the term of the lease, and credited the rent to defendant.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b700-22\">Argued before Barnard, P.

There was testimony given by the plaintiff that he refused to accept the surrender, and told defendant he would hold him for the rent. In view of the charge given, as above quoted, we must understand that the jury believed in the landlord\u2019s evidence. They were entirely justified in so doing. If defendant\u2019s liability was supposed to be of any value, no reason is apparent why the landlord should have been willing to release it. And the fact that the keys were once refused by the landlord, and at a subsequent time were put upon his desk in his absence, was strong corroboration of plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The court fairly left to the jury whether the landlord assented to the surrender. No error was committed, and the verdict must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
