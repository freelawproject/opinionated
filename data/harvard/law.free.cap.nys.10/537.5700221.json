Even if it were not so, there certainly was sufficient testimony to warrant the justice in finding in favor of the plaintiff Lewis, and defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was therefore properly denied, as it was a motion to dismiss the case entirely, and not as to the plaintiff Procha alone. The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
