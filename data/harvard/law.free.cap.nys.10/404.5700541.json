Cranwell, Charles C. Kellogg, Patrick F. Bulger, Benjamin R. Robson, Erastus Z. Wright, George S. Dana, Eliza Ross, and Eliza K. Ross. From a judgment of foreclosure for $15,847.58 the defendant Margaret Cranwell appeals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-14\">In the notice of appeal, it is stated: \u201cThe appellant intends to bring up for review upon such appeal, and also hereby appeals from, the order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>supreme court allowing said judgment, and denying said motion to vacate the order of reference, etc., and granting $200 extra allowance, as in a difficult and extraordinary case.\u201d Appellant and her husband executed and delivered to the plaintiff, on the 10th of January, 1885, a bond in the penal sum of $20,000, and an ordinary real-estate mortgage, collateral thereto, covering premises situated in the city of Utica, particularly described in the complaint. On the 26th day of May, 1885, appellant and her husband executed another bond, in the penal sum of $10,000, conditioned to pay $5,000 and interest, and, as collateral security thereto, they executed another mortgage covering the real estate mentioned in the complaint, and delivered the same to the plaintiff; and, in connection with the usual allegations in the complaint for the foreclosure of mortgages, it is alleged, viz.: \u201cAnd the plaintiff further alleges, on information and belief, that Charles C. Kellogg, Patrick F. Bulger, Benjamin B. Bobson, Erastus Z. Wright, George S. Dana, Eliza Boss, and Eliza K. Boss have, or claim to have, some interest in or lien upon the said mortgaged premises, or some part thereof, which interest in, or lien, if any, has accrued subsequently to the lien of said mortgage.\u201d The only prayer of the complaint for a personal judgment is in the following words: \u201cThat the defendants Margaret Cranwell and George W. Cranwell may be adjudged to pay any deficiency which may remain after applying all said moneys so applicable thereto,\u201d etc. The complaint contains a prayer for the appointment of a receiver, and it was stated in the argument that a receiver had been appointed. On the 21st of May, 1889, the appellant served an answer containing some denials, and \u201cfor a second and separate answer and defense, and as a counter-claim alleged and directed against the said defendants Patrick F. Bulger and Benjamin B. Bobson, and in answer to both counts and cause of action in said complaint set forth, the said defendant Margaret Cranwell, impleaded with said other defendants, alleges that heretofore, and on or about the 19th day of July, 1888, an agreement was made and entered into between said defendant Margaret Cranwell and said defendant Benjamin B. Bobson, and also said defendant Patrick F. Bulger, acting as attorney for said Bob-son, and in his own behalf, and to secure notes held by him, that said Cranwell should convey to said Bobson the property described in said complaint, and also other property belonging to said Cranwell. * * * That, in consideration thereof and therefor, said Bobson should loan to said defendant Cranwell sufficient money to pay certain then pressing debts and obligations due from her to said defendant Kellogg and said Wright and Dana, and said note to said Patrick F. Bulger, and for interest, insurance, and taxes- * * * And the said parties, Cranwell, Bobson, and Bulger, further covenanted and agreed that said Bobson should reconvey the said property to said Margaret Cranwell two years from said date, by a good and sufficient deed, upon the payment to said Bobson or said Bulger of the amount of money advanced or loaned by said Bobson, or either of them, to said Cranwell, or paid out for her or on her account, to pay said specified debts to said Kellogg, Wright, and Dana and Bulger, or to plaintiff, with interest, insurance, and taxes, and also the sum of $500 to said defendant Bulger for his services, and for the said loan or accommodation, and as a bonus thereon. That said Cranwell agreed to retake or repurchase said property, and pay therefor the said amounts so paid out by said Bulger and Bobson, and the said $500, not to exceed the sum of $4,610, over and above said plaintiff mortgages, * * * and pay the same at thef expiration of two years from said date. That said deed to said Bobson was, and was intended to be, only a mortgage upon said terms.\u201d The answer contains numerous other allegations relating to the agreement between Mrs. Cranwell and defendants Bobson and Bulger, alleging divers breaches of the agreement between her and said defendants Bob-son and Bulger; and her answer contains a prayer for relief between her and Bobson and Bulger, and that \u201csaid agreement alleged between said defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>-ants Cranwell, Bulger, and Robson be declared adjudged, and, if necessary, reformed, and thereupon specifically performed, and that said defendants be required to specifically perform, and in all respects to carry out, the provision of said contract, and satisfy said subsequent incumbrances, and that pursuant thereto said defendants Robson and Bulger be directed and required to hold and care for the property described in said complaint, and to keep the same free from the mortgages in said complaint described.\u201d Before the triala \u2022copy of her answer was served upon the defendants Robson and Bulger. At \u25a0the close of the evidence the referee held and decided, viz.: \u201cThere is no defense made out here, and I think the plaintiff is entitled to the ordinary de\u25a0cree of foreclosure and sale in this case. \u201d A report was made and delivered \u25a0by the referee, and in a special finding made by the referee in regard to the prior action of foreclosure commenced in 1886, the referee found \u201cthat such prior action was duly settled and discontinued, and an order to that effect duly entered in said clerk\u2019s office, prior to the commencement of this action.\u201d There were 16 requests to find conclusions of law made to the referee, and he refused. To such refusals, exceptions were taken; and there were 14 exceptions filed to the referee\u2019s report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">William C. Wilcox, a witness for plaintiff, whose testimony is contained in folios 486, 439, 443, 446, 454, 457, of the printed case, referred to in the opinion, testified that he remembered about the prior action of foreclosure commenced in 1886; that he went to New York, and called on plaintiff\u2019s officers, at the request of the Gran wells; that he arranged with the plaintiff for a withdrawal of that action; and that, on paying interest and costs, the action was \u2022discontinued.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad5\">1. We are of the opinion that there'was abundant evidence \u2022before the referee to warrant his finding, as a matter of fact, that the action which was commenced by the plaintiff, in 1886, to foreclose the mortgages \u25a0now in suit, was settled and discontinued prior to the commencement of this notion. See folios 436, 439, 443, 446, 454, 457, and the stipulation signed by Ward Hunt, then plaintiff\u2019s attorney, .dated December 3, 1886, found at page 92J of the appeal-book, and the order entered thereon in the Oneida <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>county clerk\u2019s office in pursuance of the stipulation canceling the notice of the pendency of the action, filed November 13, 1886. <em>Wormer </em>v. <em>Canovan, </em>7 Lans. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">2. Undoubtedly, as between the appellant and Bobson, he was a mortgagee in possession of the premises at the time of the commencement of this action. After a careful examination of the defendant\u2019s answer, and the conveyance made by her to Bobson, and the contract which was entered into by Bobson with her to reconvey the premises to her at the expiration of two years, and after a careful scrutiny of all the evidence that was offered, as well as that which was received by the referee, we are of the opinion that the appellant had no defense to the bonds and the mortgages set out in the complaint as against the plaintiff. She was, therefore, not entitled to delay the foreclosure of the mortgages held by the plaintiff. Appellant has called our attention to section 621 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Substantially the same provision was found in section 274 of the Code of Procedure. The latter section was construed in <em>Institution </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>1 Abb. Pr. 381, where it was held, viz.: The affirmative relief which the court is authorized by section 274 of the Code to grant to a defendant is affirmative relief against the plaintiff only, not against a co-defendant.\u201d Construction was also given to that section of the Code of Procedure in <em>Kay </em>v. Whittaker, 44 N. Y. 565; and it was there held, viz.: \u201cUnder the provision of the Code, \u00a7 274, for determining the ultimate rights of the parties on each side as between themselves, the relief which defendants may have as against each other must be based upon the facts involved in the litigation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and as a part of the adjustment of that claim, and not upon claims with which the plaintiff has nothing to do, and which are properly the subject of an independent litigation between such defendants.\u201d In <em>Lansing </em>v. <em>Hadsall, 26 </em>Hun, 621, which was decided in this department in 1882, we followed <em>Kay </em>v. <em>Whittaker, supra; </em>and in the opinion, delivered by Smith, J., it was further said: \u201cThe provisions of the Code referred to are simply declaratory of the pre-existing practice in chancery. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>10 Paige, 348.\u201d And in referring to the rule in <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Pell, </em>1 Paige, 268, and in stating the exceptional cases in which a decree should be made, the chancellor said it \u201cmust be founded upon, and connected with, the subject-matter in litigation between the complainant and one or more of the defendants.\u201d The rule has recently been reaffirmed in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Hilton, </em>2 N. Y. Supp. 820; <em>Institution </em>v. <em>Burdick, </em>87 N. Y. 40. In the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>10 Paige, 348, parties who were somewhat similarly situated to property affected by foreclosure proceedings sought by petition \u201cfor summary relief,\u201d and the chancellor again asserted the rule, and stated: \u201cNo such decree can be made, between co-defendants, founded upon matters not stated in the bill, nor in litigation between the complainant and the defendants, or either of them.\u201d In that case the petition was dismissed, \u201cbut without prejudice t\u00f3 the rights of the petitioners to proceed either by a suit at law or by a bill in equity founded upon the decree in this cause, and the matters stated in their petition, to recover compensation in damages.\u201d We think it proper that the judgment in this case should be modified so as to contain a protective clause somewhat similar to the one we have just quoted, and as so modified the judgment of foreclosure should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">3. After the order made at the special term held at Borne on the 4th of June, the parties appeared before a justice of this court who designated a suitable person to act as referee, and thereafter an order as of the term commencing the 4tli of June was prepared and entered; and apparently, from the note at the foot of the order, it was entered with the clerk of Oneida on the 27th of June, 1889. The reference was brought on for hearing before the referee named in the order. No motion was made to set the order aside until after the hearing of the referee. While that order stood the referee was fully commissioned by the court to act as such referee. He therefore properly over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ruled the objections that were made before him in respect to his power to determine the issue between the plaintiff and the appellant. After his report was made upon the issue which he was authorized to hear and determine, and after his report was made in pursuance of an order authorizing him to compute the amount due as to the non-answering defendants, which order was made at the Jefferson special term, a motion was made at the Onondaga special term to confirm the referee\u2019s report, and for a judgment. When that motion came on to be heard, the appellant sought to have the order of reference vacated. We think the special term properly denied the motion to vacate the order of reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">4. As to the order granting an extra allowance, we think a case was made calling for the exercise of the discretion of the court, under section 3253 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The language of that section authorizes the court \u201cin its discretion,\u201d to award \u201cin an action of foreclosure a sum not exceeding two and one-half per centum upon the sum due, or claimed to be due, upon the mortgage, nor the aggregate sum of $200.\u201d It was held in <em>Morss </em>v. <em>Hasbrouck, </em>13 Wkly. Dig. 393, (third department,) that such discretion will not be reviewed where there has not been an abuse of it. See, also, <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Railway Co., 8 N. </em>Y. Supp. 546. We think the order granting the extra allowance should stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Judgment modified by inserting a clause therein to the effect that the same shall be \u201cwithout prejudice to the right of the Gran wells to proceed, either by a suit at law or a bill in equity, to enforce the agreement set up in the answer against Robson and Bulger, or to recover compensation in damages,\u201d and, as so modified, judgment affirmed, with costs. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>10 Paige, 351. Orders appealed from affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
