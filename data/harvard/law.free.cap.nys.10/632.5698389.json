There was such a failure; and, upon a tender of the amount thereafter, the insurer accepted it, and gave a receipt which stated that it was accepted upon condition that the insured was of temperate habits, and in as good health as when the policy was issued, otherwise the payment and receipt and the original policy should be void. Such acceptance and receipt were provided for in the constitution and by-laws of the insurance company, which were made a part of the original contract of insurance. <em>Meld, </em>that such payment and receipt constituted a new contract, by which insured was bound, whether he read the receipt or not; and, it appearing that he was not at that time of temperate habits, nor in as good health as when he was originally insured, the receipt was of no effect, and the policy remained void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b652-9\">8.

It is enough to say that those reasons seem to us entirely satisfactory and convincing, and that we fully concur in the conclusion to which they led the learned judge. Judgment affirmed on the opinion of the court below, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
