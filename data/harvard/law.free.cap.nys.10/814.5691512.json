Forney against the Engineering News Publishing Company to restrain defendant from using the words \u201cRailway Journal\u201d in the sub-title of its periodical named \u201cEngineering News and American Railway Journal.\u201d The complaint was dismissed, and the following opinion rendered: \u201cBeach, J. In January, 1887, plaintiff issued the first number of a monthly periodical named \u2018 The Railroad and Engineering Journal.\u2019 In 1886, he had purchased, for five hundred dollars each, two monthly publications called, respectively, \u2022 The American Railroad Journal,\u2019 and \u2018Van Nostrand\u2019s Engineering Magazine.\u2019 The issue of January, 1887, was the result of consolidation. There is slight proof tending to show that the \u2018 American Railroad Journal\u2019 was to a limited extend known, and sometimes spoken of, without the prefix of \u2018 American.\u2019 The defendant publishes a weekly periodical now named \u2018 Engineering News and American Railway Journal.\u2019 It is the outcome of a prior publication first called \u2018 The Engineer and Surveyor; \u2019 then \u2018 The Engineer, Architect, and Surveyor; \u2019 then \u2018 The Engineering News; \u2019 then with an addition of \u2018 American Contract Journal; \u2019 and, lastly, \u2018 Engineering News and American Railway Journal,\u2019 since February, 1888. The defendant\u2019s paper seems to be usually called \u2018 The Engineering News,\u2019 and the letter-heads, stamped envelopes, and subscription orders bear the abbreviated title only. I think it a fair deduction from the evidence that plaintiff\u2019s paper is sometimes called \u2018Forney\u2019s Paper,\u2019 and \u2018Forney\u2019s Railroad Journal.\u2019 Upon these facts the plaintiff prays the court to enjoin the defendant from using the words \u2018 Railway Journal \u2019 in its title. To grant this relief would, in my opinion, extend the exercise of equitable power beyond the limits ever before reached by adjudication. Above and beyond the technical rules regulating the application of equitable relief lies the broad principle, necessitating a living equity in a plaintiff\u2019s case rather than a skeleton only held together by the thin wire of abstruse reasoning. In the case at bar, plaintiff\u2019s publications have but a limited circulation, and there is an utter absence of evidence even tending to show actual confusion in any instance from the claimed similarity in name, while the titles as printed, instead of indicating possibility of error from defendant\u2019s use of the words * Railway Journal,\u2019 rather show probable confusion and mistake from plaintiff\u2019s use of the term \u2018 Engineering.\u2019 Considering the titles in full I cannot see any real similitude. To select therefrom two words which are not the popular appellation of either or both, and enjoin their use by defendant, would unnecessarily extend the boundary line limiting the discreet exercise of equitable power. I should question the propriety of its exercise upon the sole fact that one publication was called \u2018 The Railroad Journal,\u2019 and another \u2018 The American Railway Journal.\u2019 Extrinsic facts, such as resulting confusion, intent to imitate, probable imposition upon subscribers or purchasers, would be needful where resemblance is so slight. The learned counsel for plaintiff relies mainly upon the case of <em>American Grocer Pub. Ass'n </em>v. <em>Grocer Pub. Co., </em>25 Hun, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>398. The proof showed there that the plaintiff\u2019s paper was known and commonly called \u2022 The Grocer.\u2019 One Price was its editor until 1875, when he ceased to act, and began the publication of a new paper called \u2018 The Grocer,\u2019 issued December 11, 1875, published on same side of same street and block as the plaintiff\u2019s, and when plaintiff removed to another locality the defendant followed. In addition there was some evidence of business confusion, united with the marked similarity in name, in fact, and of exactness in common des ignation. The cases cited by the learned justice also show an imitation lacking in this case. In <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Henriques, </em>3 Sandf. 725, the titles were \u2018 Irving House \u2019 and \u2018 Irving Hotel.\u2019 In <em>Clement </em>v. <em>Maddick, </em>5 Jur. (H. S.) 592, the use of words \u2018 Bell\u2019s Life \u2019 in newspaper titles was enjoined because plaintiff\u2019s journal was familiarly known by that name. In <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Stiff, </em>Id. 947, the names were alike. The French adjudications are upon like facts. The * Moniteur Universal \u2019 and * The Moniteur Official,\u2019 because it incontestably appeared that the former was always known as \u2018 The Moniteur; \u2019 others, \u2018 The Press \u2019 and \u2018 The Free Press,\u2019 \u2018 The Petit Journal \u2019 and \u2018 The Petit Journal de la Somme.\u2019 The principle is that there must be an adaptation of plaintiff\u2019s title either exact or to an extent sufficient to show an appropriation of words producing similitude in the titles themselves, or from well-established popular designation. Within this principle the plaintiff has failed to bring his case by proofs, and the relief sought by his bill of complaint must be denied.
