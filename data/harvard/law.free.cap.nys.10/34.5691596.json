The justice rendered judgment in favor of plaintiff for $16.10, the amount it cost to repair the wagon, and $2.15 costs. The county court affirmed the judgment, and defendant again appeals. Code Civil Proc. \u00cdT. Y. \u00a7 2893, provides that, upon the return of a summons duly served, the justice must wait one hour after the hour specified therein for its return, unless the parties sooner appear.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b54-12\">Argued before Learned, P.

The summons was returnable at 9 a. m. The justice called the case at 9:45 a. m., but waited until 10 before proceeding with it. This was a compliance with the statute, which requires the justice to wait one hour. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 2893.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s testimony tended to prove his case. The circumstances detailed justified the inference that the plaintiff was free from negligence, and that his wagon was broken by means of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The defendant, in his subsequent conversation with plaintiff, requested him to have the wagon repaired, and promised to pay the cost thereof. This was a substantial confession of his negligence, and an agreement as' to the measure of damages. The plaintiff acted upon it. Substantial justice was done. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
