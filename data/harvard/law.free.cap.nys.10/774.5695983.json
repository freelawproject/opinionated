An order was made in that court denying a motion made upon the judge\u2019s minutes for a new trial. Appeal from the judgment and order. The action was brought to recover damages for the alleged negligence of defendant in so constructing the floor in its boiler shop in Syracuse that, upon November 21, 1881, the leg of the table crushed through the floor, thereby causing some boiler sheets to slide off, and strike the plaintiff, who was then one of defendant\u2019s employes,' breaking his leg, and causing other injuries to him. The defendant denied \u2022any negligence, and alleged that plaintiff was fully acquainted with the construction of the floor, and assumed all the risks incident thereto, and to the' work at which he was engaged at the time of the accident; and also alleged that the plaintiff and his co-employes directly contributed to the accident by their negligence in improperly loading the table. The building where the accident occurred had been built about a year preceding the occurrence, and the ground inclosed by the building was uneven, and a contract had been made by the defendant with one Martin to fill in and level up the ground, and also a subsequent contract to build a floor. Martin was a contractor and builder, capable, and was intrusted with entire charge of the work, and he proceeded to level up the place with dirt and ashes, and to lay on top of them a hemlock plank two inches thick upon stringers 4x4 and 4 feet apart, and ashes being back of and around the stringers. In March, 1881, the floor and foundation, where the injuries were received, were placed. The latter flooring and foundation were built under a contract made by the defendant with one Fairchild, who had had experience in such matters, and whose competency was not questioned upon the trial. The form and method of construction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>including the foundation underneath, and the selection of workmen and material, were left to his judgment and skill. Plaintiff had been in the employ of the defendant, at the time of the injury, for about eight months, and had been about the floor with opportunity to see how the floor and foundation were constructed. When the injury occurred he and five co-employes were bringing sheets of boiler iron, weighing about 290 pounds per sheet, from the yard into the shop, and piling them on a \u201claying-out table.\u201d This table had a top about 7x3Jleet, and was supported by four legs, each about 4x6 inches at the base, where they rested upon the floor in plain sight of the plaintiff and his co-employes. The sheets were not piled evenly upon the table, and their attention was called to it, but they continued to pile the iron as before, although some evidence indicates that the floor had begun to sag, and that fact was noticed, and although there were other tables on which it might have been piled. After an accumulation of about 85 sheets, one leg of the table crushed through the plank, and the iron slid off, and the plaintiff received the injuries complained of. Upon the leading questions of fact involved in the case the evidence is quite extensive, and considerably conflicting. A verdict had been obtained in a former trial in favor of the plaintiff, and the judgment entered thereon was brought into this court, and reversed on account of erroneous \u00a1rulings made at the trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b795-5\">Argued before Hardin, P.

His mother, who was called as a witness, testified, viz.: \u201cHis suffering was bad; very hard. I guess I know. He complained of great suffering. I was up day and night with him. \u201d Thereupon the following question was propounded to her: \u201c <em>Question. </em>You may state what complaints of bodily pain he made during the time he was confined in bed, if any.\u201d This question was objected to as immaterial and improper and inadmissible. Thereupon the court remarked: \u201cThe question is too broad.\u201d Then the plaintiff propounded the following question: <em>\u201cQ. </em>Well, commence at the early part, just as he was placed in bed and being taken home, and state what complaints of bodily pain he made, or what you observed as to his condition of suffering. \u201d Similar objections to those already stated were made to this question, and they were overruled, and the defendant took an exception. The witness answered: <em>\u201cAnswer. </em>Well, he complained of his back in the first place, and pain in his leg. \u201d Thereupon the defendant moved to strike the evidence out. The court denied the motion, and the defendant took an exception; and thereupon the plaintiff propounded the following question: <em>\u201cQ. </em>What complaints did he make? Tell the jury, so that they can hear you, how bad he suffered. <em>A. </em>Well, he complained many times that they hurt him so that he didn\u2019t know, that he could live through.\u201d The defendant moved to \u201cstrike out the evidence upon same grounds as stated in last objection.\u201d The motion was denied, and the defendant excepted. The witness stated that he was \u201ctaken up and helped on the lounge Christmas morning.\u201d Thereupon the following question was propounded to her: \u201cHow, did he complain of suffering during that time?\u201d The answer was: \u201cYes, sir. Hot much. Hot as much as he had nine or ten .days the worst of his suffering. The first nine or ten days were the worst of his suffering.\u201d In <em>Olp </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>48 Hun, 169, in an action which was brought to recover damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff, \u201cher husband was allowed, against the objection and exception of the defendant\u2019s counsel, to testify as to complaints made by his wife, after the day of the accident, of being dizzy-headed, of a great roaring in her head, and of pain in the back of her eyes. Held, that the evidence should not have been received. * * * The evidence of statements made long after the injury as to the effect of the injury, or as to the sufferings endured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>therefrom, is not competent.\u201d In delivering the opinion, the court refers to <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>105 N. Y. 294, 11 <em>N. </em>E. Rep. 630, in which case the court of appeals held as follows: \u201cIn an action to recover damages for alleged negligence causing a personal injury, declarations of the party injured, made some time after the injury, simply to the effect that he is suffering pain, when not made to a physician for the purpose of professional attendance, are not competent as evidence.\u201d We think the rulings made by. the trial judge, tested by the cases to which we have just referred, were erroneous. Respondent calls our attention to <em>Hagenlocher </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>99 N. Y. 136, 1 N. E. Rep. 536. As we understand that case it is only an authority for holding that it is \u201ccompetent for plaintiff to prove exclamations indicative of pain made by such person at the time of the injury.\u201d We think it does not justify all the evidence which was received in the case before us. Our attention is invited to <em>Lewke </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>46 Hun, 286, where a witness was permitted to testify that he \u201csaw the plaintiff picked up from the spot where he received the injury.\u201d The plaintiff immediately went to the store of the witness, and the witness \u201cnoticed the condition of his clothes, and that his left leg seemed to be swelling. It was at this time that he complained of pain in his limb.\u201d And it was stated by the court in this case, viz.: \u201cAnd it would seem that the complaint in the present case, made so soon after the accident, and while plaintiff\u2019s injured leg was visibly swelling, was so closely allied to mere exclamation as to justify the reception of the evidence.\u201d If we were to give full effect to all that was decided in this case, it would not justify the reception of all the evidence received in the case before us. The opinion contains no reference to <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., supra. </em>In the latter case, Peckham, J., said: \u201cHer declaration that \u2018it pained her very badly\u2019 is mere hearsay, and should not have been permitted. \u201d Applying that rule to the case before us, we think some of the evidence given by the plaintiff\u2019s mother was inadmissible, and erroneously receiv\u00e9d.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">2. The case states, viz.: \u201cDuring the summing up to the jury, counsel for the plaintiff stated to the jury that he would \u2018read to them the law applicable to this case as it had been laid down by the court of appeals,\u2019 and commenced to read to them authorities.\u201d Thereupon the counsel for the defendant objected. The court permitted the authorities to be read, and the defendant took an exception thereto. While we do not propose to examine the question involved in the exception, and place our decision upon the ruling made in respect to the right of counsel to read authorities to the jury, we may observe in passing that it was the duty of the trial court to instruct the jury as to the law ofjthe case, and we may call attention to the appropriate remarks of Brady, J., in <em>Lesser </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>39 Hun, 343, in dealing with a similar question. He says: \u201cThe practice of reading to the jury, as done here, has been condemned by a number of adjudged cases. <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>44 Cal. 70; <em>Tuller v. Talbot, </em>23 Ill. 357; <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Craig, </em>51 Ill. 288; <em>Reich </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>17 Wkly. Dig. 141; <em>Allaire </em>v. <em>Allaire, </em>39 N. J. Law, 113; <em>Koelges </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>57 N. Y. 638. Perhaps in this state it may be done where the matter read is the law of the case, and can by no possibility prejudice the adverse party, <em>(Koelges </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., supra;) </em>but, nevertheless, it must be said that it is a custom more honored in the breach than in the observance, and, further, should not be allowed as long as the jury are required to accept for their guidance the legal rules pronounced by the court. If the counsel desires to call the attention of the court to rule, doctrine, or maxim, and to illustrate by treatise or adjudication, it is proper to do so; but the jury, if addressed on the subject by counsel, may confuse the construction and the reading, and thus obstruct, if they do not defy, the administration of justice.\u201d The observations made by the learned judge meet with our approval, and accord with the general practice which has come under our observation.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">3. Defendant requested the court to charge the jury, viz.: \u201cThat if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>jury find that it was negligent for Dee, plaintiff\u2019s foreman and co-employe, to continue piling up iron on the table in question after he saw the floor sag thereunder, and that such negligence caused the accident, then plaintiff cannot recover. \u201d The court refused to give the charge as requested, but did charge the same, adding thereto the words: \u201cProvided defendant had performed its duty in the construction of the groundwork and floor in question.\u201d The defendant also asked the court to charge \u201cthat, if the jury find that plaintiff, prior to the accident, knew of and appreciated the manner in which defendant\u2019s floor was constructed, then he assumed the risk of the defect, if any, and its construction.\u201d This request was refused, and the further request was made \u201cthat, if the plaintiff was capable, and had the opportunity, by knowing thereof, prior to the accident, of judging of the propriety of the form of construction of defendant\u2019s floor, then, having continued in its employ, he cannot recover.\u201d This request was refused. In <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>103 N. Y. 668, 9 N. E. Rep. 183, it was held by the court of appeals, viz.: \u201cThe majority of the court are of opinion that this judgment should be reversed, for the reason that the facts established beyond dispute that the injured employe entered upon the service and remained in it with a full knowledge and appreciation of the risk and danger resulting from leaving the coupling uncovered. The fact was entirely obvious, the resultant peril plain at a glance, and the injured servant a skilled workman, a foreman of the rollers, accustomed <em>to the </em>machinery and the service, and having the capacity and ability to. fully appreciate the consequences of leaving the couplings uncovered. Within the rule applicable to such cases, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate took upon himself the risk of injury from the observed and obvious omission.\u201d We think the trial judge did not keep within the principle laid down in the case from which we have just quoted. Judgment and order reversed on the exceptions, and a new trial ordered in the county court of Onondaga county, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
