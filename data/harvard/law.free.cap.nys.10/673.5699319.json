In the Otsego circuit of January, 1887, the plaintiff had a verdict for $155. A motion for a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes was made by the defendant, and granted by H. Boardm\u00e1n Smith, J., who presided at the trial; and he based his order granting such trial upon an error committed in the charge; and the order allowed \u201c $10 costs to abide the event. \u201d The plaintiff took an appeal from that order to the general term, and, after a consideration of the appeal, the general term, on the 13th of November, 1888, affirmed the order, with costs, and the defendant entered a judgment of affirmance, and for his costs, $89.03, December 21, 1888. On the 14th of January, 1889, at a circuit and special term held in Otsego county, an order was granted containing the following words: \u201cThat plaintiff be, and he is hereby, stayed from prosecuting or moving said case, or taking any proceeding therein towards enforcing the trial thereof, until the costs of the appeal from the order granting the motion for a new trial are paid.\u201d At a special term held on the 14th of May that order was resettled and amended by the same justice who granted the same, and the plaintiff appeals from the order \u201cstaying plaintiff from moving this cause for trial until the costs of the appeal from the order granting the motion for a new trial are paid, and from each and every part of said order. \u201d Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 779, provides that where costs, directed by an order to be paid, are not paid within the time fixed, or, if no time is fixed, within 10 days after the service of the order, all proceedings on the part of the party required to pay them, except to vacate the order, are stayed, without further direction of the court, until payment of such costs; and that, when the order directs that the costs of the motion abide the event of the action, they may be taxed as a part of the action, or set off against costs awarded to the adverse party, as the case may require.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b693-12\">Argued before Hardin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Q\">Inasmuch as the $10 costs of motion in the order of January, 1887, were allotted to abide the event, the non-payment of them by the plaintiff does not permit the defendant to avail of the provision in section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure in respect to a stay of proceedings. Upon the questions made as to the non-payment of the costs of the appeal included in the judgment of affirmance of the order granting a new trial, which costs amount to $89.03, the cases of <em>Eisenlord </em>v. <em>Clum, </em>5 N. Y. Supp. 512, and <em>Verplanck </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>47 N. Y. Super. Ct. 513, are in point, and adverse to the decision made at special term in this case. However, <em>Phipps </em>v. <em>Carman, </em>26 Hun, 518, seems to be a decision which would support the order appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>from. An examination of chapter 390, \u00a7 3, Laws 1847, of section 779 as it appeared in the Code of Remedial Justice, (being chapter 8, p. 146, vol. 2, Laws 1876,) and section 12, c. 431, p. 456, vol. 1, Laws 1876, and Mr. Throop\u2019s note to section 779 of the Code of Civil Procedure, inclines us to follow the decision of the third department in <em>Eisenlord </em>v. <em>Clum, supra. </em>We think the order should be reversed. Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
