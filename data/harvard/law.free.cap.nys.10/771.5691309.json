Oliver against Walter Heywood Chair Manufacturing Company. Plaintiff appeals from an order vacating an attachment in his favor against defendant, on tbe ground that it was a non-resident corporation. Code Civil Proc. H. Y. \u00a7 1780, provides as follows: \u201cAn action against a foreign corporation may be_ maintained by a resident of the state, or by a domestic corporation, for any\" cause of action. An action against a foreign corporation may be maintained by another foreign corporation, or by a nonresident, in one of the following cases only: (1) Where the action is brought to recover damages for the breach of a contract made within the state, or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>lating to property situated within the state at the time of the making thereof.

Therefore, where such right is created by statute, the conditions therein attached to its exercise must be fulfilled, and they must appear before the court obtains jurisdiction. In the case at bar the defendant is a foreign corporation, and an attachment was issued against its property for a cause of action which did not appear to have arisen in this state,- and therefore it was necessary, in order that the court should acquire jurisdiction, that it should appear that the plaintiff was a resident of the state. The papers are silent upon this point. Where the statute, as a preliminary to jurisdiction, requires facts to exist, they cannot be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
