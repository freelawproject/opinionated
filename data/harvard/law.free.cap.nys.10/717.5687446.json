Moulton, widow of the deceased. From a decree in favor of the administratrix the petitioners appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b738-8\">In the notice of appeal the appellants state that they \u201cintend to bring up for review,\" upon such appeal, the surrogate\u2019s order of reference, herein made and entered in said surrogate\u2019s office on the 22d day of December, 1886; * * * the surrogate\u2019s order herein made and entered in said surrogate\u2019s office on the 13th day of February, 1888; * * * the surrogate\u2019s decision and order denying the petitioners\u2019 motion to amend their petition in this matter. \u201d David Mouiton, in his life-time a resident of the town of Floyd, in Oneida county, died on the 7th day of May, 1886, intestate. On the 18th of May, 1886, Emily A. Moulton filed her petition for her appointment as administratrix in the surrogate\u2019s office of said county; and having filed her oath of office and a bond in the penalty of $12,000, with two sureties, letters of administration were issued to her on the 20th day of May, 1886, to which letters were attached \u201cthe seal of office of bur said surrogate,\u201d and, in witness of their due execution, was placed thereon the date, to-wit, the 20th day of May, and the same were signed by J. D. F. Stone, special surrogate. On the 2d day of October, in the year 1886, W. B. Bliss, surrogate, duly attached his signature to an exemplification of the letters. Appraisers were appointed, and an .inventory was made and filed in the surrogate\u2019s office, September 29, 1886. On the 9th of December, 1886, the administratrix filed a new bond, with two sureties, in the penal sum of $20,000, which was on the that day approved by the surrogate, and filed in his office. On the 18th day of May, 1886, Emily A. Moulton commenced an action in the supreme court against the appellants, the heirs at law of David Moulton, deceased, for the purpose of foreclosing a mortgage which bore date the 10th day of May, 1877, and was executed by Amie H. Kellogg to Charles S. Symonds, as assignee in bankruptcy of David Moulton, and which mortgage was assigned by Charles F. Symonds, as assignee in bankruptcy, to Emily A. Moulton, by an instrument in writing, bearing date the 29th day of December, 1877, claiming to be due on said mortgage $8,650, with interest from the 10th of November, 1877. After issue joined in the action to foreclose the mortgage, the case was partly tried before a special term, when, by an order made in that action, the proceedings were suspended \u201cto allow petitioners to take proceedings in the surrogate\u2019s court to remove said administratrix, and obtain the appointment of an administrator in her plac.e. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b738-9\">On the 24th day of December, 1886, the appellants verified their petition addressed to the surrogate of Oneida county, praying for the removal of Emily A. Moulton from the office of administratrix, stating therein that she had \u201cpresented her petition to said surrogate of the county of Oneida in the usual form, praying that such proceedings be had that administration of the goods, chattels, and credits of said deceased be granted to her, and filed her bond of the same date in the sum or penalty of$12,000 only; * * * and thereupon, on the 20th day of May, 1886, letters of such administration, in the usual form, were issued and signed by J. D. L. Stone, special surrogate of said county, appointing said Emily A. Moulton administratrix of the goods, chattels, and credits of the said David Moulton, deceased;\u201d also stating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>she had filed an inventory with the surrogate \u201cshowing assets of said estate for administration to the amount, as footed, of $8,163.61;\u201d also stating that \u201csaid administratrix, by reas on'of her misconduct and dishonesty in the execution of her office as representative of decedent, is disqualified, and is unfit for the due execution of her office; * * * that she has sought to conceal, and has concealed, property and assets belonging to said estate, * * * and has neglected and has willfully refused to obey provisions of law relating to the discharge of her duties; that she has been guilty of wrong and other misconduct in the execution of her duty as administratrix in retaining possession and control of assets, and the evidence thereof, belonging to the estate of decedent, and is claiming the same as her own, which greatly embarrasses the administration, and jeopardizes the interests of your petitioners, and others interested in the distribution of said estate, viz., that the mortgage hereinafter mentioned, as your petitioners are informed and believe, is a part of and belongs to the estate of said David Moulton, and yet said administratrix refuses to have it included in the inventory of the estate, but fraudulently claims it as her own. * * *\u201d The petition also alleges that \u201cshe has become and is incompetent or disqualified by law to act as such administratrix, * * * and the grant of said letters was obtained by false suggestions of material facts and suppression of her antagonism to the said estate.\u201d In the petition it is also alleged \u201cthat the aforesaid petition of said Emily A. Moulton represents that she was the widow of said David Moulton, whereas the petitioners claim and believe that she was never lawfully married to him, nor lived with him as his wife, but separate and apart as a single woman; and that the goods, chattels, and credits of said deceased did not exceed $6,000, whereas they were at least $20,000, including the mortgage hereinafter mentioned, as your petitioners are informed and believe to be true.\u201d It is also alDged in the petition of the appellants \u201cthat the assignment of said mortgage, and the bond accompanying it, to said Emily A. Moulton, was unlawfully, wrongfully, and fraudulently obtained, or so obtained and held in trust for the use and benefit of said David Moulton, subject to his control and disposition. * * * Said Emily A. Moulton (then Emily A. Mickle) entered into a conspiracy with said David Moulton to defraud his creditors, and to save said farms to him, and in furtherance thereof they, and those acting with them, caused to be written a certain contract or antenuptial agreement whereby it was provided that, in consideration of marrying said Moulton, he was to pay her $50,000, as follows: $10,000 within one year after marriage, and $10,000 each year thereafter, until the whole $50,000 was paid,\u2014in lieu of all dower. Such agreement bears date the 1st day of February, 1876, but it was made in 1877, long after the said petition in bankruptcy was filed, and said adjudication was made as aforesaid, and after the pretended making of such agreement she claimed to have been married to said David Moulton, which the petitioners, on information and belief, deny, but, if she was ever married to him, such marriage, if at all, took place long after the filing of said petition in bankruptcy and the adjudication aforesaid; and the motive and intent of all such acts was to prevent the estate of said David Moulton, and particularly the real estate described in said mortgage, from passing to said assignee, he then being indebted to divers persons to the amount \u00f3f about $200,000, and to save the said property to said David Moulton; and thereafter he made proof in that proceeding in bankruptcy of her pretended claim on said agreement.\u201d They also alleged that they were \u201ceach and all creditors of the said David Moulton, and of his estate.\u201d On the 30th day of December, 1886, Emily A. Moulton verified her answer to the amended petition of the appellants, in which petition she admitted some of the matters alleged in the petition of the appellants, and denied certain allegations contained therein, and alleges her ownership of the bond and mortgage, and that-\u201cat the time of the assignment thereof by said Symonds the same were held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>and owned by said Symonds, as assignee in bankruptcy of Frank W. Davis, David Moulton, and Jeremiah C. Carr, in a proceeding in bankruptcy then pending in the district court of the United States for the northern district of Mew York; that the petitioners, Sarah M. Kellogg, Miriam M. Kellogg, Julia Ann Sleeper, and Eliza Pratt, and the undersigned, were creditors of the said David Moulton, and were parties to that proceeding; that- each proved and filed a claim against the estate of said David Moulton in bankruptcy, and the same were duly adjudicated by said bankrupt court, and by the order and decree of said court were ordered to be paid, and were paid;\u201d and she also alleged that she had filed a new bond in the sum of $20,000, \u201cwith two good and sufficient sureties, which bond * * \u25a0* was duly approved by said surrogate.\u201d On the 22d of December, at a surrogate\u2019s court, after hearing the parties, an order was made by the surrogate, appointing \u201cFrederick G. Fincke, Esq., referee, to take and report to the surrogate the evidence upon the facts as to the alleged grounds for revoking said letters of administration, with his opinion thereon; * * * and said referee bring in his report before the surrogate with all convenient speed, and the hearing of the parties herein on the confirmation of the report of the referee, and the decree to be made herein, be brought on upon a notice of eight days. \u201d After the referee had taken great volume of testimony at the instance of the respective parties, he made his report on the 31st of December, 1887, and in his third conclusion of law said, viz.: \u201cThat Emily A. Moulton was duly and legally appointed administratrix of the estate of David Moulton, deceased, and was lawfully entitled to such appointment, which was not obtained by her by reason of any concealment of fact, and by reason of any <em>\u2018 </em>false suggestion of a material fact,\u2019 and that she has faithfully discharged her duties as administratrix, and has not been guilty of misconduct in the execution of her office as such administratrix, and that the letters of administration written to her should not be revoked; and that the petitioners are not entitled to the relief asked for in their petition, and are not entitled to the removal of said Emily A. Moulton from her position as administratrix, and that said Emily A. Moulton should be allowed to continue the discharge of the trust and duties of administratrix, and settle up said estate, and that the petitioners herein should be dismissed.\u201d On the 11th of January, 1888, the petitioners prepared and served about a hundred exceptions to the referee\u2019s report, and on the 13th day of February, 1888, in the surrogate\u2019s court, the petitioners asked leave to give evidence of the debts and claims against the estate of David Moulton, and the amounts and numbers of each of the debts and claims, to which the respondent objected; and thereupon the surrogate ordered the matter \u201csent back to F. G.Fincke, Esq., thereferee herein, to take and report to the surrogate the evidence which the petitioners may offer on the question of fact of the debts and claims against said estate,\u201d and on the 6th day of March, 1888, thereferee made an additional or supplemental report, in wiiich report, among other things, he stated that the assets of the estate amount to the sum of $8,153, and that he had before him \u201cno facts upon which to form an opinion as to the solvency of the estate;\u201d although in his report he stated that the total amount of claims admitted and disputed is the sum of $8,680.75. On the 12th of March, 1888,. the petitioners filed exceptions to the supplemental report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b740-6\">At a surrogate\u2019s court on the 14th of May, 1888, an order was made reciting the proceedings already had, and: \u201c(1) That the report of the said Frederick G. Fincke, the referee herein, and the questions of fact and the conclusions of law as herein found and determined by him, be, and the same are hereby, in all things ratified and confirmed, and are to stand as the order and determination of this court. (2) That the petition of the said petitioners Miriam M. Kellogg, Sarah M. Kellogg, Julia Ann Sleeper, and Eliza Pratt is hereby dismissed. (3) The costs, charges, and expenses, incurred by the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Emily A. Moulton in her defense to this proceeding, be charged against and be paid from the estate of the said David Moulton, deceased.\u201d On the 27th of June exceptions were filed to the decree of the surrogate, and the appellants subsequently presented requests to find 75 matters of fact and 28 matters of law. Interspersed with the requests are the words, \u201cIso find;\u201d \u201cI refuse to find except as found by me in my finding;\u201d \u201cPetitioners except;\u201d \u201cI refuse to find;\u201d which expressions are printed in italics, although they nowhere appear to have any signature of the surrogate. In the case presented, it is stated; \u201cThe surrogate made the same rulings and decisions as made by the referee to same, and to each thereof, and gave to the petitioners and respondent an exception to each of his rulings and decisions against the petitioners and respondent, and the petitioners and respondent duly excepted. The said surrogate has marked on the margin of said requests to find, etc., as appears thereon, and the petitioners have duly taken exceptions to each of such refusals to find or rule. After this matter and proceeding were so heard, tried, and submitted to the surrogate for decision and decree, at a surrogate\u2019s court held in and for the county of Oneida, at the surrogate\u2019s office in Rome, on the 14th day of May, 1888, the said surrogate made and entered a decree, as annexed hereto. But the said surrogate did not file, nor has he filed, in his office, his decision in writing, which states separately the facts found and the conclusions of law, except as stated in the decree herein, to which omission or refusal the petitioners duly excepted.\u201d On or about the 25th day of June, 1888, the respondent\u2019s attorney served a copy of said decree, and on the 27th day of June, 1888, the petitioners duly made, filed, and served exceptions to said decree, and each part thereof, as hereinbefore app\u00e9ars. The case then contains 32 requests to find, and, interlined or printed in opposite the requests, are the words, \u201cI so find. W. B. B\u201e\u201d or, \u201cI decline to so find,\u201d or, \u201cFindings with certain qualifications,\u201d\u2014with the initials of the surrogate added; and following are 25 requests to find certain conclusions of law, with interlineations, with words, \u201cI refuse to find. W. B. B.;\u201d or words, \u201cI so find;\u201d and following each of the expressions of refusal are the words, \u201cPetitioners except. \u201d And on the 22d of August, 1888, it appears there were filed with the surrogate certain formal exceptions to the refusal of the surrogate to find.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b741-5\">Code Civil Proc.

Section 2545 of the Code .of Civil Procedure provides that \u201cthe surrogate must file in his office his decision in writing, which must state separately the facts found and the conclusions of law.\u201d If the parties to the proceeding now before us had followed the requirements of this section, by presenting to this court a \u201cdecision in writing,\u201d which stated separately the facts found and the conclusions of law, the practice would have been much more satisfactory than that which now appears in the appeal-book before us; and it would have been in keeping with our decision in <em>Otis v. Hall, </em>6 N. Y. St. Rep. 592, and also our decision in <em>Re Keef, </em>43 Hun, 98. In the latter case it was said in the opinion delivered in this court, viz.: \u201cUnless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>some authority can be found to the contrary, we thin, \u00bfhe safer practice would be for the surrogate to make an independent decision, with findings of fact and law, accepting or rejecting the conclusions of the referee, as shall seem just. Exceptions can be filed to such findings and to subsequent refusals to find or findings in'settlement of case, as provided in section 2545.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">2. It appears by the evidence, as well as by the admission made upon the hearing, that there was an intermarriage of the respondent with the deceased. The position of the appellants, to support which they gave considerable evidence, is that the marriage took place in the spring of 1877. The position of the respondent is, to which she gave considerable evidence in support thereof, that the marriage took place in the spring of 1876. Being the widow of the deceased, she was per force of the statute<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entitled to administer upon his estate, having the prior right to letters of administration. <em>In re Page, </em>107 N. Y. 266, 14 N. E. Rep. 193; <em>Libbey </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>112 N. Y. 525, 20 N. E. Rep. 355. Having a right to administration, no notice or citation was necessary. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 2660-2662.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">3. Whatever force there may have been in the objection made to the appointment of the respondent as administratrix, and the issuing of letters of administration to her by the special surrogate of the county of Oneida, without record proof of his authority to act (by reason of sickness, absence, or disability of the surrogate) when the objection was taken in the petition filed.in 1886, we think the force thereof has been wholly removed by chapter 455 of the Laws of 1888, which provided in that chapter that \u201cthe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> official acts of John D. E. Stone, as special surrogate, * * * since the 1st day of January, 1885, while acting in the place of the surrogate of said county by reason of the sickness, absence, or lunacy of said surrogate, so far as such acts may be affected, impaired, or questioned, by reason of the failure of the making and filing of a certificate showing the occurrence of such disabilities, as required by law, are hereby legalized, ratified, and confirmed, and the same shall have all the force and effect and validity as if such certificate had been made and filed.\u201d It may be observed incidentally that the surrogate seems to have approved of the action of the special surrogate very soon thereafter. Surely, such was apparent from the action of the surrogate in filing the inventory, and in approving and filing a bond executed by the administratrix. Whatever irregularity there may have beeniwe think was cured before the making of the order brought before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">4. Sections 2684, 2685,2686, and 2687 of the Code of Civil Procedure confer upon the surrogate\u2019s court power and prescribe the practice and mode of procedure for the removal of an administrator or revocation of letters of administration issued to such administrator. Section 2685 provides that \u201ca written petition, duly verified, praying for a decree revoking those letters, and that the executor or administrator may be cited to show cause why a decree should not be made accordingly: (1) Where the executor or administrator was, when letters were issued to him, or has since become, incompetent or disqualified by law to act as such, and the grounds of the objection did not exist, or the objection was not taken by the petitioner, or a person whom he represents, upon the hearing of the application for letters; (2) where, by reason of his having wasted or improperly applied the money or other assets in his hands, or invested money in securities unauthorized by law, or otherwise improvidently managed or injured the property committed to his charge, or by reason of other misconduct in the execution of his office, or dishonesty, drankenness, improvidence, or want of understanding, he is unfit for the due execution of his office; (3) where he has willfully refused, or without good cause neglected, to obey any lawful direction of the surrogate contained in a decree or order, or any provision of law relating to the discharge of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>duty; (4) where the grant of his letters was obtained by a false suggestion of a material fact.\u201d Section 2686 provides that \u201ca petition, presented as prescribed in the last section, must set forth the facts and circumstances showing that the case is one of those therein specified. Upon proof, by affidavit or oral testimony, satisfactory to the surrogate, of the. truth of the allegations contained in the petition, a citation must be issued according to the prayer thereof.\u201d It is further provided in section 2687: \u201cUpon the return of a citation, issued as prescribed in the last section, if the objections, or any of them, are established to the surrogate\u2019s satisfaction, he must make a decree, revoking the letters issued to the person complained of. But the surrogate may, in his discretion, dismiss the proceedings, upon such terms, as to costs, as justice requires, and may allow the letters to remain unrevoked, in either of the following cases: (1) Where the case is within subdivision third of the last section but one; (2) where the case is within subdivision fourth of that section, if the person cited is entitled to letters, notwithstanding the false suggestion.\u201d We think questions arising under these sections are largely \u201cin the discretion of the surrogate.\u201d In considering certain powers of the surrogate, in <em>McGregor </em>v. <em>Buel, </em>24 N. Y. 169, not wholly dissimilar to the questions which may arise under the sections of the Code to which we have just referred, it was said by Denio, J.: \u201cThe determination of the surrogate upon such questions is, as it should be, summary and exclusive.\u201d We think the provisions of section 2687, to-wit, \u201cif the objections, or any of them, are established to the surrogate\u2019s satisfaction, he must make a decree revoking the letters issued to the person complained of,\u201d were intended to confer upon the surrogate a judicial discretion in viewing the facts and circumstances disclosed by the evidence furnished to sustain the objections made. See <em>In re West, </em>40 Hun, 296; affirmed 111 N. Y. 687, 19 N. E. Rep. 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We think that the evidence and proceedings submitted to the surrogate fail to establish that the administratrix was \u201cincompetent or disqualified by law to act as such. \u201d It was provided in the Revised Statutes (volume 2, p. 75) that no letters of administration should be granted \u201c to any person who shall be judged incompetent by the surrogate to execute the duties of such trust, by reason of drunkenness, improvidence, or want of understanding. * * *\u201d In expounding that provision of the statute, the chancellor said, in <em>Coope </em>v. <em>Lowerre, </em>1 Barb. Ch. 47, viz.: \u201cHo degree of legal or moral guilt or delinquency, therefore, is sufficient to exclude a person from the administration, as the next of kin, in the cases of preference given by the statute, unless such person has been actually convicted of an infamous crime. * * * The improvidence which the framers of the Revised Statutes had in contemplation, as a ground of exclusion, is that want of care or foresight in the management of property which would be likely to render the estate and effects of the intestate unsafe, and liable to be lost or diminished in value by improvidence, in case administration thereof should be committed to such improvident person. * * * The evidence in this case tending to show the respondent\u2019s dishonesty, and that be had been guilty of divers offenses against the laws of society, but which could not throw any light upon the question of his providence or improvidence, should therefore have been excluded by the. surrogate.\u201d In <em>McMahon </em>v. Harrison, 10 Barb. 659, it was held, viz.: \u201cUnder the provisions of the Revised Statutes respecting the granting of letters of administration in cases of intestacy, vice and moral delinquency will not of themselves disqualify a person to act as administrator.\u201d In <em>Emerson </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>14 N. Y. 452, the question considered by the court was whether the appellant there was legally incompetent to serve, and it was said that the fact that a person is \u201cof small pecuniary means, and that he has been guilty of misconduct or mismanagement in administering the trust-estate, do not authorize the surrogate to supersede the letters testamentary, under 2 Rev. St. p. 72, \u00a7\u00a7 18-21, and Id. p. 69, \u00a7 3, on the ground that the executor is legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>incompetent to serve \u2018by reason of improvidence;\u2019\u201d and it was also further held; \u201cThe term \u2018 improvidence \u2019 refers to such habits of mind and conduct as render a man generally, and under all ordinary circumstances, unfit to serve;\u201d and, in delivering the opinion in that case, Comstock, J., referred to <em>Coope </em>v. <em>Lowerre, supra, </em>approvingly; and the same case was approved in <em>McMahon </em>v. Harrison, 6 N. Y. 447; and the case was also approved in <em>Coggshall </em>v. <em>Green, </em>9 Hun, 472; and in the course of the opinion delivered by Talcott, J., it was said, viz.: \u201cMoral guilt or delinquency is not a ground for excluding a person from receiving letters unless he has been convicted of an infamous crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The learned counsel for the appellants, in a very exhaustive argument submitted to us, lays great stress upon the circumstances attending the transfer of a mortgage for $8,650 by Symonds, as assignee, to the plaintiff, and to the fact that she had commenced an action to foreclose that mortgage, and had omitted to place the same upon the inventory filed,' and seems to suppose that her removal from the office of administration was essential in order to enable the appellants, as heirs at law, or as creditors of the deceased, to contest the title of the plaintiff to the mortgage, and to enable them to assert that the mortgage in fact was an asset belonging to the estate of the deceased; and he calls our attention to the Laws of 1858, c. 314, which authorizes executors or administrators to maintain an action to set aside fraudulent conveyances, transfers, or assignments made by the deceased. It must be borne in mind that the object of that statute is to enable creditors summarily to reach assets that have been fraudulently disposed of by the intestate; however, we see no difficulty, under the provisions of that statute, in the creditors availing themselves of all its provisions in this case, even though the respondent remained as the administratrix. Surely, upon creditors applying to the administratrix to bring such an action as the Laws of 1858 authorizes, she would be called upon to yield to the request, or to make a refusal. If she refused, then the creditors could bring an action and make her a defendant in her representative as well as her individual capacity, and allege her refusal to bring the action, and thus the creditors would have the full benefit of the\" provisions of the statute to the same extent as though the action had been brought by the administratrix. In <em>Bate </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>11 N. Y. 237, it was held that if theadministrator \u201ccollude with the fraudulent vendee, or, after reasonable request, refuse to take proceedings to impeach his title and reach the property in his hands* a creditor may maintain an action against Mm and the executor or administrator for that purpose. \u201d That case was decided in 1854, and was referred to approvingly in <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Leggett, </em>51 N. Y. 554. In <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>50 Barb. 430, it was said: \u201cOrdinarily a creditor of the estate of a deceased person cannot maintain an action against a fraudulent vendee of the latter to impeach the sale of personal property, unless the executor or administrator should collude with the fraudulent vendee, or, after reasonable request, refuse to take proceedings to impeach the title and reach the property in his hands.\u201d We are of the opinion that the removal of the respondent from the office of administratrix was not necessary to. enable the appellants, as creditors, to maintain proper action to avoid the alleged ownership by the plaintiff of the mortgage on the ground that it was the property of the deceased, and that the transfer thereof to the plaintiff was fraudulent. In <em>Re Kellogg, </em>39 Hun, 284, it was said by Landon, J.: \u201cThis executor, being the donee of the gift, did not disaffirm it. ,His interest was opposed to his duty. But he ought to have disaffirmed it, and, because he voluntarily failed in duty, the surrogate has power to compel his performance of it. The statute authorizes the surrogate to control executors. 2 Rev. St. p. 220, \u00a7 1. In such case the general creditor can invoke this remedy. The statute dispenses with judgment and execution. <em>Southard </em>v. <em>Benner, </em>72 N. Y. 424.\u201d We see nothing in that case inconsistent with the views we have already ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>pressed. In <em>Lichtenberg </em>v. <em>Herdtfelder, </em>103 N. Y. 307, 8 N. E. Rep. 526, it was said: \u201cThe fact that the fraudulent grantee is one of the executors furnishes no insurmountable obstacle. If she should refuse to restore the lands to the estate, she should be removed from her office of executrix, and then the remaining two executors could, under the act of 1858, disaffirm the conveyances of the real estate, and bring an action to set them aside; or the two executors could commence the action, making the executrix a defendant, and in such an action obtain for the estate the relief demanded. If the two defendants refused to commence the action upon the application of the creditors or some of them, they could be compelled to commence it by an order of the surrogate, who has ample power to that end, under section 2481 of the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AsF\">In <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>McDonnell, </em>113 N. Y. 530, 21 N. E. Rep. 695, it was said: \u201cBut the administrators do not avail themselves of the power given to them by statute. It was their right and duty to do so. They have been applied to, and refuse. Is the creditor, therefore, without a remedy? Clearly not. Upon the face of the complaint, it is apparent that the administratrix has an interest adverse to the creditors of the estate. They call for property which she claims to own in her own right, and which she refuses to apply upon the debts of her intestate. These circumstances require an exception to be made to the general rule which forbids an estate or its management to be taken from the hands of those lawfully intrusted with it; for it is equally well settled that where such parties are either in collusion with one holding the property alleged to have been fraudulently transferred, or where, as in this case, it is actually claimed by them, or the trustee unreasonably refuses to sue, the creditors, or other persons interested, may themselves bring an action for or reclaim the prpperty fraudently transferred, making the transferees and the trustee parties. 1 Story, Eq. Jur. \u00a7 423; <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>72 N. Y. 70; <em>Bate </em>v. Graham, 11 N. Y. 237; <em>In re Cornell, </em>110 N. Y. 351, 18 N. E. Rep. 142; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Leggett, </em>51 N. Y. 552. In such a case the creditor stands in the place of the trustee, and it is immaterial that he is not a judgment creditor.\u201d In <em>Lore </em>v. <em>Dierkes, </em>51 N. Y. Super. Ct. 157, it was said: \u201cAlthough the instrument may be fraudulent as to creditors, the next of kin or their representative cannot avoid it. The representative of the next of kin, or rather the administrator, avoids it in behalf of creditors. Such an avoidance cannot result in favor of those for whom it cannot be avoided, but against whom it is vested.\u201d If the bond and mortgage which were assigned by Symonds to the plaintiff were the property of Moulton at that time, it may be said upon the assumption that he consented to the assignment, as the evidence seems to indicate he did; that he, if living, could not be heard to question the respondent\u2019s ownership to the same. In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Wooster, </em>36 N. Y. 414, it was said: \u201cSo that, if the money paid was the debtor\u2019s, as he now insists it was, and the conveyance to the wife, therefore, fraudulent as against creditors, it was not fraudulent as against him, for he was not only consenting to the act, but himself performed it.\u201d In <em>Renfrew </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>11 Hun, 258, in speaking for this court, Talcott, J., said: \u201cThe recipient of property with intent to defraud creditors possesses the intimacy and, confidence of the fraudulent debtor, and advises the attempted fraud, and consents to be made the instrument thereof. To allow the grantor in such a case to set aside the grant, and be restored to all he parted with for the illegal purpose, would be to afford great encouragement to future attempts of that character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">5. If the bond given by the administratrix upon her appointment, or the new bond given by her for $20,000, was irregular or \u201cinadequate in amount,\u201d or the sureties therein were insufficient, a remedy is provided therefor in section 2597, Code Civil Proc. Persons interested in the estate under such circumstances may present a petition to the surrogate stating the insufficiency of the sureties, \u201cor that the bond is inadequate in amoutit;\u201d \u201cpraying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>the principal in the bond may be required to give a new bond, in a larger penalty, or new or additional sureties, as the case requires; or, in default thereof, that he may be removed from his office, and that letters issued to him may be revoked;\u201d and it is further provided that, when the bond is given by an administrator, \u201cthe petition may.also be presented by any creditor of the decedent.\u201d Thereupon, if it appears to the surrogate that there is reason to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, he must cite the administrator to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted. Section 2598, Id., provides for the surrogate\u2019s hearing the allegations and proofs of the parties, and that, if he finds that any of the objections are valid, \u201che must make an order, requiring the principal in the bond to give new or additional sureties, or a new bond in a larger penalty, as the case requires, within such a reasonable time, not exceeding five days, as the surrogate fixes, and directing that, in default thereof, his letters be revoked.\u201d We think these sections provide ample remedy in a case where the surety \u201cis insufficient,\u201d or where the bond is \u201cinadequate in amount.\u201d Although the appellants claim that the bond was defective in that it was inadequate in amount, and that the sureties were insufficient, and that one of the sureties was incompetent, they did not seek the remedy prescribed by the sections just alluded to. Having omitted to seek the remedy prescribed by the sections, we think they were not in a situation to insist, for either of the causes mentioned, on a removal of the administratrix under section 2685, Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">6. If the administratrix \u201cfailed to return an inventory, or a sufficient inventory, the appellants had a remedy therefor under section 2715, Id. If an order under that section had been obtained, and the administratrix had \u201c willfully refused or without a cause neglected to obey\u201d it, such refusal would have furnished ground for her removal, under subdivision 3, \u00a7 2685, Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">7. Appellants have taken multitudinous exceptions, which are found distributed throughout the case presented to us, to rulings of the referee in receiving and in rejecting evidence; to the rulings of the surrogate in receiving or rejecting evidence; the conclusions of fact found by the surrogate; to refusal of surrogate to find certain facts; to refusals of the surrogate to find certain conclusions of law; and to his findings upon certain questions of law. Fortunately, we need not protract this opinion to the extraordinary length that would be required to discuss each of these exceptions in detail. We have carefully looked at all of them, and we are of the opinion that no errors were committed in receiving or rejecting evidence which make it apparent to this court \u201cthat the exceptant was necessarily prejudiced thereby.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2545; <em>Brick </em>v. <em>Brick, </em>66 N. Y. 144; <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Pullman, </em>72 N. Y. 269; <em>In re Ross, </em>87 N. Y. 514; <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>88 N. Y. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">This court having the power to decide questions of fact which were before the surrogate, as we held in <em>Re McGraw, </em>45 Hun, 354, affirmed 111 N. Y. 66, 19 N. E. Rep. 233, in the exercise of that power we are of the opinion that the surrogate in the discharge of his official duty, and in applying his judicial discretion to the cas\u00e9 before him, having regard to all the aspects thereof, properly reached the conclusion evidenced by his order refusing to remove the respondent from the office of administratrix -of the goods and chattels of David Moulton, her deceased husband. We are of the opinion that the several orders brought up by the appeal of the appellants should be sustained. Decree of the surrogate of Oneida county refusing to revoke letters of administration to Emily A. Moulton, and intermediate orders, affirmed, with costs against the appellants personally.
