Taylor against Frank Wynne, Hannah Wynne, and others, to dispossess defendants, as tenants, of the possession of real property which had been sold to Taylor on an execution issued against Frank Wynne. The petition stated that Wynne had leased the premises in question for a term of five years, beginning April 1, 1885; that on March 26, 1888, the judgment was docketed on which the execution was issued; that on April 4, 1888, Wynne assigned the lease to his wife, and that afterwards the execution was issued. Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 1430, provides that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>expression \u201creal property,\u201d as used in chapter 13, arts. 3, 4, relating to execution sales of land, includes leasehold property where, at the time of sale, the lessee or his assignee is possessed of at least five years\u2019 unexpired term of lease. The petition was dismissed, and the petitioner appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b665-3\">Argued before Barnard, P.

In the present case there was but two years unexpired of the lease when the judgment was docketed. The lease not being \u201creal property,\u201d the judgment was not a lien upon it. The assignment to the wife conveyed it free from the lien of the judgment, and when the execution was afterwards issued against the husband the lease was no longer bis property, and a sale upon an execution against him carried no title to the purchaser. Another defect upon the face of the petition was that the judgment was not stated to be for $25, exclusive of costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We are still of the opinion expressed on the former appeal. Motion for re-argument denied, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
