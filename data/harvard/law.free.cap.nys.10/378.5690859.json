These allegations clearly bring the moving party within the provisions of section 1377 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which permits an execution to be issued upon application to the court and upon due notice, provided that the judgment so docketed in the county clerk\u2019s office had, at the time of the granting of the motion, a valid existence. It is contended by counsel for the appellant that the order was erroneous, inasmuch as an action upon a justice\u2019s judgment is barred after the lapse of six years from the time of its rendition, under subdivision 7, \u00a7 382, Code Civil Proc. This proposition, however, was distinctly repudiated in the case of <em>Waltermire </em>v. <em>Westover, </em>14 N. Y. 16, where it was held that the statute of limitations, as it existed under the Revised Statutes, (2 Rev. St. p. 295, \u00a7 18,) which is now embodied in the subdivision of section 382, already noted, did not extinguish or destroy the lien created by the judgment as docketed in the county clerk\u2019s office. The obligation of the defendant to pay a debt was not obliterated by a lapse of time; for the statute acts only on the remedy, and not upon the obligation to pay. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>54 N. Y. 424. There is nothing in the case of <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Horn, </em>47 Hun, 51, which controverts the foregoing proposition; for in the last-named case the statute of limitations had run against the justice\u2019s judgment before the transcript thereof had been filed in the county clerk\u2019s office, while in the case before us six months only had elapsed between the render<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ing of the judgment by the justice of the peace and the record of the same in the county clerk\u2019s office. Much reliance has been placed in this appeal upon the case of <em>Dieffenbach v. Roch, </em>112 N. Y. 621, 20 N. E. Rep. 560; but that decision is simply to the effect that a judgment of a justice of the peace docketed in the county clerk\u2019s office is not a judgment \u201crendered\u201d in the county court, but remains \u201ca judgment * * * rendered in a court not of record, \u201d within the meaning of the provision of subdivision 7, \u00a7 382, Code Civil Proc., declaring that an action upon such a judgment must be commenced within six years after the final judgment was rendered. That case did not undertake to and did not in fact impair in the slightest degree the decision of the same court in <em>Waltermire </em>v. <em>Westover, </em>already referred to. Under these provisions of the Code and these authorities the order of the county court was properly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider the question whether or not the order so made is appealable to this court. It was held in <em>Kincaid </em>v. Richardson, 25 Hun, 237, that no appeal lies to the general term from an order of the county court granting leave to issue an execution upon a judgment recovered in a justice\u2019s court, where a transcript thereof was filed and judgment thereon docketed in the clerk\u2019s office of the county. The conclusion of this court in that ease finds corroboration in the decision of <em>Dieffenbach </em>v. <em>Roch, supra. </em>Section 1342 of the Code of Civil Procedure seems to limit the review by this court of orders of the county court, affecting a substantial right, to those cases where the action is brought in or is taken by appeal to that court. This case does not come within that class. But we prefer to rest our decision on the proposition first discussed above. The order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
