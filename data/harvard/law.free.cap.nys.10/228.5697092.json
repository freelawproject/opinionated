The test, therefore, is whether a necessity was shown for the purpose stated. The proof fails to show suvh a necessity. From all that appears by the affidavits on both sides, it is evident that the plaintiff has sufficient knowledge of the facts constituting his alleged cause of action, and that his object is to obtain information concerning an anticipated defense, and to find out whether the cause of action cannot be extended to other parties. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
