Bozzoni against Frances M. Woodward to recover the price of a carriage sold to defendant. The latter went to plaintiff\u2019s carriage manufactory, looked at a book of cuts of carriages, and selected one to be sent to her. Plaintiff testified that afterwards defendant went to his shop, and was shown a carriage, and that she said \u201cit was just the article she wanted, and she would take it. Defendant ordered the steps of the carriage to be padded, and told plaintiff to deliver it to a certain line of steamers, directed to her at her residence. Tlie expense of the padding was to be paid for, in addition to the price originally agreed upon for the carriage. Plaintiff testified that he shipped the carriage in question as directed, and that he afterwards saw it in the possession of defendant\u2019s counsel. Defendant claimed that she never received the particular wagon which she approved at the shop. Judgment was given for plaintiff, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b664-12\">Argued before Barnard, P.

Directing alterations to be made did not necessarily disprove acceptance. On the contrary, the jury might well consider it to be further evidence in that direction. The delivery in pursuance to defendant\u2019s direction was also proved. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
