J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGV\">This is an action for an alleged breach of contract of employment. The answer interposed a general denial, with an allegation that the defendant was discharged for cause. The rate of recovery was based upon the following letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXGb\">\u201cJuly 19, 1889.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-13\"><em>\u201cMr. Otto </em>Wachtershauser\u2014Dear Sir: Your letter received. I can give you work for the season, commencing on the 12th of August, and, if possible, will give you steady work, but cannot promise it. If you are in H. Y., stop in and see me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4q\">Yours, truly, Sydney E. Smith.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">In pursuance of the letter above mentioned, plaintiff went into the defendant\u2019s employ on August 12, 1889. The middle of the third week he was discharged, as defendant alleges, on account of his imperfect work, and for incompetency, receiving his wages for the time that he worked. The plaintiff claims that the word \u201cseason\u201d meant employment until December 15, 1889, and sues for damages for breach of the contract, from August 28 to December 15, 1889, at the rate of $13 per week. The defendant testified that there is no period of time knowp as a \u201cseason\u201d, in the trade, and was corroborated by two of his workmen, who had been in his employ for several years. It will be seen that the letter upon which this action is predicated specifies no time going to show the duration of the term \u201cseason\u201d therein mentioned. In such a case paroi evidence is admissible for the definition of such term. The court below believed plaintiff\u2019s testimony upon this point, and, although the defendant\u2019s witnesses gave a contrary interpretation, the court had a right to accept plaintiff\u2019s definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-15\">It appears, however, according to defendant\u2019s theory, that plaintiff was discharged for incompetency, and, as that was a disputed question of fact in the case, the finding of the court cannot be reviewed on this appeal. It also appeared that the plaintiff had been in the defendant\u2019s employ for over a year previous to the contract last mentioned, and that he had given him a recommendation when such employment terminated. There are no important questions of law arising in this case. The court below is the judge of the credibility of witnesses, and of all questions of fact. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
