For former report, see 9 H. Y. Supp. 536.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b762-10\">Action by John B. Boss against John Simon, Ignatz Schmitt, and others, to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien. Simon was the owner of the premises sought to be subjected to the lien, and Ignatz Schmitt had leased them. Defendant Simon demurred to the complaint on the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against him, and from a judgment sustaining the demurrer plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b762-11\">Argued before Larbemore, C, J., and Allen and Bookstaver, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b762-12\"><em>J.

There were but two questions upon the appeal. The first was whether or not the statement in the lien was sufficient as against the owner; and the second was whether the \u2022allegations in the complaint that the defendant, the owner, had full knowledge of, and consented to, the doing of the work, was a sufficient pleading of the facts. The reargument is asked for on the authority of <em>Cornell </em>v. <em>Barney, </em>94 N. Y. 394, which the respondent claims his counsel, through inadvertence, overlooked, and to which he failed to draw the attention of the \u2022court. But that ease does not touch the question of the sufficiency of the notice of a lien in any way, and the sole question decided there was that, in \u25a0order to bind the owner, the work must be done, or materials furnished, at his instance or that of his agent; and, in the absence of evidence that the lessor had some connection with plaintiff\u2019s contract, plaintiff is not entitled to have or enforce a lien against the interest of the lessor in the land or building, but only against that of the lessee. This does not affect the question of what is necessary to plead in the complaint in order to admit evidence to hold the lessor. It only goes as to what evidence would be required in such a case; and that distinction was expressly made by the general term, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>which reversed the judgment in this case. The motion for a reargument, or for leave to go to the court of appeals, will therefore be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
