Davis against Jemima S. Davis, individually, Bebecca D. McKay, and Jemima S. D\u00e1vis, and William W. Ambler as executors of Gilbert T. Davis, to recover possession of the books of account of the late firm of Davis &amp; Co., composed of plaintiff and his father, said Gilbert T. \u2022 Davis. The partnership was dissolved by mutual consent, and it was agreed that deceased should retain the books, collect the accounts, and pay the debts of the firm. Subsequently plaintiff made a general assignment to his father for the payment of debts. The court made an order directing defendants to deliver possession of the books to plaintiff, and they now appeal therefrom.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b918-7\">Argued before Barnard, P.

In any view, however, he ought not to have the absolute and unrestricted custody of them. As matter of law, the interest in the accounts passed toG. T. Davis in his'life-time, in trust to pay debts, and the plaintiff only retained an equitable interest therein. We think it was proper to give the plaintiff access to the books; at the same time,'also, the defendant should have been allowed to have the books where they could be used in furtherance of the trust, and in settlement of the estate of G. T. Davis, deceased. The order should be so modified as to have them placed in the custody of some officer or person where both parties can have access to them at all reasonable times. Ko costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
