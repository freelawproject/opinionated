Riley, as administratrix of the estate of Thomas M. Riley, deceased, against Henry Gitterman and William Sulsbacher. One of <em>the </em>actions was <em>to </em>recover on an undertaking, given by defendants as sureties for one Eouis Siedenbach, on an appeal by him from a judgment in an action theretofore pending between himself as plaintiff and Julia A. Riley (plaintiff herein) as defendant. The action of <em>Siedenbach </em>v. <em>Riley </em>was originally brought against Thomas M. Riley, <em>then sheriff of </em>Kings county, <em>to </em>recover property taken by said Riley under execution. Thomas M. Riley died pending this action, and it was revived against his administratrix. Judgment was rendered against Siedenbach, who appealed to the general term, and gave tile undertaking referred to above. The judgment was affirmed by the general term, (42 Hun, 656, <em>mem,) </em>and Siedenbach then appealed to the \u25a0court of appeals. The other action by said Julia A. Riley was to recover on the undertaking given on appeal to the court of appeals, where the judgment \u25a0of the general term was affirmed. 19 H. E. Rep. 275. Pending his appeal to the court of appeals, Siedenbach died, and the action was ordered to be revived and continued in the name of William Sulsbacher, to whom Siedenbach had executed a general assignment for benefit of creditors. Defendants insist that they are relieved from liability because the court of appeals did not revive the action in the name of Siedenbach\u2019s administrator. Both actions were tried before the court, a jury being waived, and the following opinion was delivered:</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-12\">\u201cCullen, J. As to the objection that the judgment of affirmance is a nullity, because the action was not properly revived in the court of appeals, 1 think it is not well taken. Sections 755-765, Code, are re-enactments or modifications of the Code, which it was held did not apply to the court of appeals. <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>8 How. Pr. 175. Section 1736, Code, makes special provisions for revival of actions in replevin, but this, like the section above mentioned, only applies to the original action, not to appeals. Sections 1297 and 1298 apply to appeals, but section 1297 is by its terms plainly confined to the case of the death of a party before appeal taken. Section 1298 applies to cases like the present,\u2014the death of a party after appeal taken,\u2014but it authorizes the dismissal of an appeal upon the proceedings provided, in case of -no order being made substituting some other person in place of the party; but it does not at all prescribe how, or in what person, that substitution shall be made. The procedure, therefore, remains as it existed under the old Code. In <em>Hastings </em>v. <em>McKinley, supra, </em>it was intimated that the court might have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>proceeded to hear the cause and render judgment as of a day before the death of the party, but the court deemed it proper to follow, as far as practicable, the course prescribed in courts of original jurisdiction. The power to revive an action in the name of an assignee, after the death of the assignor, is settled. <em>Schell </em>v. <em>Devlin, </em>82 N. Y. 333. It matters not that the action is in replevin, if I am right in the opinion that the special provisions as to revival in that character of action have no application to appeals. The court of appeals thus having the power to revive the action in the manner followed in the case, it follows that the order of revival made by the court is conclusive. <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Paterson, </em>4 Paige, 413. If the order was improperly made, the party aggrieved must apply to the court to vacate the order, but it cannot be questioned collaterally. These two actions are not upon the same bond, and therefore the causes of action are different. The pendency of one is hence no bar to the maintenance of the other, but, as the parties are the same, and the satisfaction in the first case will discharge both liabilities, I think the proceedings in the second action should be stayed after judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">Code Civil Proc. N.
