The question. presented is whether the sums paid to the Lawyers\u2019 Title Insurance Company are taxable as legal disbursements by the plaintiff in an action to foreclose a mortgage. It was decided at the special term (9 N. Y. Supp. 336) that only disbursements for official searches could be allowed in such cases, and the sum claimed by the plaintiff and rejected by the clerk, having been paid for unofficial searches, could not be taxed as a legitimate disbursement. Our examination leads us to the same conclusion, and the orders appealed from should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
