N. Y. \u00a7 758, which provides that \u201cthe estate of a person or party jointly liable upon contract with others shall not be discharged by his death, and the court may make an order to bring in the proper representative of the decedent when it is necessary so to do for the proper disposition of the matter. <em>\u201d</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b281-9\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-10\">Action by the First national Bank of Jersey City against Peter Lenk and others, constituting the general partners, and Otto Huber and another, constituting the special partners, in the limited partnership of Peter Lenk &amp; Co. Plaintiff sought to hold the special partners liable as general partners on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ground that their contributions to the capital of the firm were not in \u201cactual cash payments,\u201d as required by 4 Rev. St. 3ST. Y. (8th Ed.) p. 2492, \u00a7 2. Pending this action, defendant Huber died, and on plaintiff\u2019s motion the action was revived against the executors of decedent\u2019s will. The following opin- ' ion was filed at special term:</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">\u201cBarrett, J. I do not agree with the counsel for'Huber\u2019s estate that an action against a special partner seeking to make him liable as a general partner for failure to pay in, in cash, the amount certified to have been contributed is an action to recover a penalty. The action is against him upon contract, treating him from the beginning as a general partner, and liable as such. That is the normal condition of things, and it is for the special partner to limit his ordinary partnership liability by a strict compliance with the statute. Eailure to so strictly comply does not give a right of action as for a penalty. It simply prevents the partner from setting up the statute against the ordinary partnership liability which he has assumed. In this view of the matter, the action is plainly upon contract, and it survived. The other objection, namely, that insolvency of the surviving partners must be averred before the representatives of the deceased partner can be brought in, is met by section 758 of the Code. Certainly, \u2018the proper disposition of the matter,\u2019 to quote the language of this section, requires that the representatives of the deceased special partner, who was. sought to be charged, should be brought in. Thus the real \u25a0question involved in the action can be directly determined. This becomes entirely apparent when we consider that the persons who were avowedly general partners have not defended; and, so far as the other special partner also sought to be charged is concerned, it is entirely appropriate that his liability \u25a0should be determined at the same time as that of Huber. I think that the learned counsel for the Huber estate is also in error in supposing that section 758 is confined to cases where the contract liability is in terms several as well \u2022as joint. The language is, \u2018 the estate of a person or party jointly liable upon contract with others shall not be discharged by his death,\u2019 etc. The matter of several liability is only referred to in connection with a severance of the action. But the liability here, if there is any, would seem to be joint and several. The question is therefore reasonably free from doubt, and the motion should be granted. \u201d</p>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-6\">Defendants appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-7\">Code Civil Proc. H. Y. \u00a7 758, is as follows: \u201cIn case of the death of one of \u2022two or more plaintiffs, or one of two or more defendants, if the entire cause \u25a0of action survives to or against the others, the action may proceed in favor of \u2022or against the survivors. But the estate of a person or party jointly liable upon contract with others shall not be discharged by his death, and the court may make an order to bring in the proper representative of the decedent when it is necessary so to do for the proper disposition of the matter, and, where \u25a0the liability is several as well as joint, may order a severance of the action so \"that it may proceed separately against the representative of the decedent, and \u25a0against the surviving defendant or defendants. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b282-8\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

We see no reason why this rule does not apply to the ease of the death \u2022of a joint debtor pending the action. Section 758 of the Code has in no manner altered the rule stated, which has been established by a long line of decisions. The order should he reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
