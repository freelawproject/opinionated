J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEL\">This is an appeal from a judgment rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor for commissions as a broker or dealer in machinery. It is shown by the evidence that the plaintiff brought a customer who bought the boiler in question, for which the defendant received $800. Plaintiff testified that the defendant, through his manager, Hillhouse, agreed that, if plaintiff found a purchaser for the boiler, he would pay him 10 per cent, of the purchase price. The sale was consummated, and, for a refusal on the part of the defendant to pay such commission, this action was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">The main question in this case is one of fact, as to the authority of Hill-house to bind the defendant. It is a well-settled question of practice that an appellate court will not disturb a judgment rendered upon disputed facts. The court below has found, upon the whole testimony, that the agreement was made, plaintiff did act in good faith, procured a customer, and defendant got the fruits of his labor, and that the agency was established. <em>Leslie </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>63 N. Y. 27; <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>19 Wkly. Dig. 531; <em>Warburton </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>112 N. Y. 683, 20 N. E. Rep. 592; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>115 N. Y. 556, 22 N. E. Rep. 261. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
