The only evidence of a conversion was the testimony of plaintiff that he had received a letter from the sister saying that she had not received the money. Judgment was given for plaintiff, and defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b564-12\">Argued before Larremore, O.

Those letters were not even offered in evidence, their contents only being given. But, even if the letters themselves had been offered, they would not have been evidence against the defendant, not having been written by any party to the action touching the matter in controversy. They were clearly hearsay evidence of a third party not under oath. The judgment should therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs of the appeal to the appellant to abide the event of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
