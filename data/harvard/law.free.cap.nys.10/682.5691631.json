The defendant demurs on the ground that the <em>cestui que trust </em>is not made a party defendant. The demurrer was properly overruled. A <em>cestui que trust </em>is a proper party, but not ordinarily a necessary party. Defendant has mistaken his remedy. If, for any reason, the presence upon the record of the <em>cestui que trust </em>as a party defendant was desirable, a motion should have been made that he be brought in. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
