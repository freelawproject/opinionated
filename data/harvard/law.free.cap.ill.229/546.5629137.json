Judicial notice\u2014courts do not take judicial notice of what is shown by journals of legislature. One contending that the title of an act was changed after it passed the House and Senate and before it was signed by the Governor must make proof of such fact, since courts do not take judicial notice of what is shown by the original journals of the Senate and House of Representatives, and will presume that a law certified to by the Secretary of State is in the form in which it was passed by the legislature.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-12\" pgmap=\"546\">2. Constitutional law\u2014when provision against reviving or amending law by reference to title is not violated. Where both the title and body of an act indicate an intention to create a law complete in itself, the provision of section 13 of article 4 of the constitution against reviving or amending laws by reference to title, only, is not violated, notwithstanding the effect of the act may be to repeal by implication or modify prior existing laws.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-13\" pgmap=\"546\">3. Same\u2014section 1 of act of 1905, fixing limitation in suits for personal injury against cities, is not invalid. Section 1 of the act of 1905, (Laws of 1905, p. 111,) requiring suits for personal injury against cities, towns or villages to be brought within one year, takes such actions out of the operation of the general Statute of Limitations as respects cities, towns and villages, and is not in violation of section 13 of article 4 of the constitution.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b546-14\" pgmap=\"546(57) 547(17)\">4. Same\u2014act of 1905, which relates to personal injury suits against cities\u00a1 is not special legislation. The act of 1905, limiting the time for the bringing of personal injury suits against cities, towns and villages to one year from the injury and requiring notice to be given within six months, applies to all cities, towns and villages in the State, and hence is not special legislation such as is prohibited by the constitution.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b547-4\" pgmap=\"547\">5.

One who brings a personal injury suit against a city, town or village must aver and prove that he has given the notice required by section 2 of the act of 1905, (Laws of 1905, p. 111,) and it is not sufficient, if no notice was given, that suit was brought within six months from the date of the injury.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\" pgmap=\"547\">Appeal, from the Circuit Court of Peoria county; the Hon. N. E. Worthington, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\" pgmap=\"547(229) 548(52)\">This is an action on the case brought by appellant in the circuit court of Peoria county for injuries received by him while driving along one of appellee\u2019s streets on March 28, 1906. The suit was filed April 30, 1906, and appellee was served with summons on the 3d day of May, 1906. The declaration was filed May 4, 1906, and appellee filed its answer, by way of demurrer, May 15, 1906, which demurrer was on the 14th day of November overruled by the court, and on the same day appellee filed the general issue and appellant added his similiter thereto. It is not contended that the declaration failed to show a right of action nor is it contended that appellant failed to make out a good cause of action on the trial. The only contention in the case is, that appellant in his declaration failed to aver that notice had been given the appellee, as provided in an act entitled \u201cAn act concerning suits at law for personal injuries and against cities, villages and towns,\u201d approved May 13, 1905, and in force July 1, 1905, and that upon the trial of said cause no evidence was offered tending to show that any such notice as provided in said act of 1905 was given appellee by appellant. At the close of appellant\u2019s evidence the appellee moved the court to instruct the jury that there was not sufficient evidence to support a verdict, which motion the court sustained, and from the judgment based on a directed verdict appellant prosecutes an appeal direct to this court, for the reason that the constitutionality of a statute is involved.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-5\" pgmap=\"548\">Barnfs &amp; Boulwarf, for appellant:</attorneys><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-6\" pgmap=\"548\">The act entitled \u201cAn act concerning suits at law for personal injuries and against cities, villages and towns,\u201d is not the act that was passed by the Senate and House of Representatives of the Forty-fourth General Assembly.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\" pgmap=\"548\">The act in question is unconstitutional, being an amendment to previous acts in relation to limitation, injuries and practice while purporting to be a complete act in itself.

The act deals with limitations and notice, and there is nothing in the title to the act referring to limitations or notice. The rule is, that the title must express the real subject of the act, so as to put the legislature and those persons who are affected thereby on inquiry as to its contents. 26 Am. &amp; Eng.

Section 2 of said act (Hurd\u2019s Stat. 1905, p. 1154,) is as follows: \u201cAny person who is about to bring any action or suit at law in any court against any incorporated city, village or town for damages on account of any personal injury shall, within six months from the date of injury, or when the cause of action accrued, either by himself, agent or attorney, file in the office of the city attorney (if there is a city attorney, and also in the office of the city clerk) a statement in writing, signed by such person, his agent or attorney, giving the name of the person to whom such cause of action has accrued, the name and residence of person injured, the date, and about the hour of the accident, the place or location where such accident occurred and the name and address of the attending physician (if any).\u201d Section 3 provides that if the notice provided for in section 2 is not given as therein required, any such suit brought against any such city shall be dismissed, and the party suffering such dismissal shall be forever barred from suing on account of such injury. There was no averment of compliance with section 2 in the case at bar, and it is conceded that no attempt whatever was made to comply with said section before bringing this suit.</p> <p id=\"b551-3\" pgmap=\"551(155) 552(28)\">It is first insisted by appellant that the title of this act was changed after it passed the House of Representatives and the Senate and before it was signed by the Governor. It is stated by counsel for appellant in his brief that the word \u201cand\u201d was inserted in the title of the act, between the 7 _ words \u201cinjuries\u201d and \u201cagainst.\u201d There is no evidence in the record of any such change having occurred in the title of the act. This court cannot take judicial notice of what the original journals of the House of Representatives and the Senate show, and if appellant desired to show that a change had been made in the title or body of the bill after it had been passed and before it was signed by the Governor he should have introduced the original journals to support his contention. In the absence of any proof to the contrary we must presume that the law as certified to by the Secretary of State is in the same form that it was when it passed the legislature.</p> <p id=\"b552-4\" pgmap=\"552\">It is next insisted by appellant that the act in question violates section 13 of article 4 of the constitution, which provides that \u201cno law shall be revived or amended by reference to its title only, but the law revived or the section amended shall be inserted at length in the new act.\u201d Appellant\u2019s contention on this point cannot be sustained. Section 2 above quoted is not an amendment to any previous statute but is entirely new legislation. Section 1 of the act in question fixes one year as the limitation within which suits for personal injuries may be commenced against any incorporated city, village or town, and provides that no suit or action at law shall be commenced on account of a personal injury against a- city, village or town after the expiration of one year from the time such injury was received or the cause of action accrued. Appellant\u2019s argument under this point applies only to said section 1, and the validity of that section is not directly involved in this case. But even if it were, appellant\u2019s position is not tenable. The only effect of section 1 on the general Statute of Limitations is to take actions for personal injuries against cities, villages and towns out of the operation of the general statute and place them under the one year limitation fixed by the said section 1, leaving the general Statute of Limitations in full force and effect as to all other persons or corporations who may be sued for personal injuries. Neither in the title nor the body of the act is there anything found to indicate that the act is amendatory of any existing law. Both the title and the terms of the act indicate an intention to create a law complete within itself, and when this is the case the constitutional provision above referred to is not violated, notwithstanding the effect of such act may be to repeal by implication or modify prior existing laws. People v. Knopf, 183 Ill. 410; Badenoch v. City of Chicago, 222 id. 71.</p> <p id=\"b553-3\" pgmap=\"553\">It is next insisted that the act in question violated the constitution prohibiting special legislation, the contention being that the act applies to cities, villages and towns but does not apply to other municipal corporations. This position cannot be sustained. It is true that counties, townships, school districts and other political divisions are excluded from the operation of the statute in question, but the act-applies to all cities, villages and towns in the State. The power of the legislature to pass general laws applicable only to cities, villages and towns of the State has never been questioned in this court, so far as we are advised. A law is general when it applies to all persons in the State similarly situated. Hawthorn v. People, 109 Ill. 302; People v. Butler Street Foundry Co. 201 id. 236.</p> <p id=\"A7M\" pgmap=\"553\">Finally, appellant insists that, if the act in question is constitutional, the bringing of the suit before the expiration of the six months was a sufficient compliance with the spirit of the statute, and that the statute ought to be held applicable only to cases where the suit was brought after six months after the injury and within one year. Such a construction of the act would in a great measure defeat the purpose of this law. If a party having a claim for personal injury may wait until the six months have about expired and then sue without giving any notice, the law might as well be repealed. Statutes of this character are mandatory, and the giving of the notice is a condition precedent to the right to bring such suit, and the giving of the notice must be averred and proved by the plaintiff to avoid a dismissal of his suit. This construction is in harmony with the holdings in other States where similar statutes exist. See 15 Am. Sr Eng. Ency. of Law, (2d ed.) p. 483, and cases there cited; Elliott on Streets and Roads, sec. 642.</p> <p id=\"b553-6\" pgmap=\"553\">Finding no error in the record the judgment below is affirmed.
