Taxes\u2014property needed by Illinois Central railroad to reach Ohio river is within charter tax provision. In view of the facts that the acts of Congress in aid of the construction of the Illinois Central and Mobile and Ohio railroads contemplate a railroad connecting the great lakes with the Gulf of Mexico, and that the Illinois General Assembly accepted the provisions thereof, property needed by the Illinois Central railroad to enable its traffic to reach the Ohio river falls within the provisions of its charter relating to the substituted method of taxation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-6\" pgmap=\"430\">2. Same-\u2014fact the tax-payer fails to pay taxes does not affect method of taxation. The fact that the Illinois Central railroad has not apportioned the earnings of its bridge across the Ohio river with the approach thereto on the Illinois side, so that no earnings are credited to the approach as being a part of the charter lines of the company, does not affect the determination of the question as to how such approach shall be regarded with reference to taxation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-7\" pgmap=\"430\">3. Same\u2014charge for use of leased line is part of the company\u2019s earnings. The fact that the legislature, by an act subsequent to the Illinois Central Railroad Company\u2019s charter, authorized that company to lease its lines does not take such lines out of the charter exemption with reference to taxation, provided the lines were such as were authorized by the charter; but the earnings of such lines, by whatever name called, are part of the gross \u201cproceeds, receipts or income\u201d of the road.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-8\" pgmap=\"430\">4. Same\u2014approach to bridge over the Ohio river is \u201crailroad track.\u201d The approach to the Illinois Central bridge over the Ohio river is \u201crailroad track\u201d as distinguished from a steamboat used in ferrying trains across the river, and is not taxable by the ordinary methods governing the taxation of property owned by a railroad company other than \u201crailroad track.\u201d</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b430-9\" pgmap=\"430\">5. Same\u2014approach to bridge over Ohio river is not a branch or lateral line. The Illinois approach to the Illinois Central railroad bridge over the Ohio river must be regarded' as a switch or sidetrack authorized by the company\u2019s charter and not as a branch or lateral railroad, and comes within that class of property for which the charter of the company provides a method of taxation, and is not subject to the ordinary methods of taxation.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b431-2\" pgmap=\"431\">6. Eminent domain\u2014power to condemn for switches or sidetracks is a continuing one.

that the Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company on January 1, 1886, procured a lease upon the St Louis and Cairo railroad, extending from Cairo, Illinois, to St. Louis, Missouri, for a term of forty-five years, and St. Louis has become the northern terminus of said Mobile and Ohio company\u2019s road and New Orleans has become the southern terminus of the Illinois Central lines.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-3\" pgmap=\"434\">The petition further alleges that on March 29, 1886, the Illinois Central Railroad Company and the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad Company procured from the legislature of the State of Kentucky an act \u00e1uthorizing them, or either of them, to build a railroad bridge across the Ohio river at or near the said city of Cairo, and that shortly thereafter the said companies began the construction of said bridge and that the same was completed and opened for traffic in October, 1889; that said bridge was built 60 feet above high-water mark; that the bridge proper is about one mile in length and each of the approaches to said bridge about one and one-half miles in length, and consist of steel viaducts and high earth embankments; that the steel viaduct part of the Illinois aproach is 2656 feet in length and the earth embankment is 5-307 feet in length; that the bridge was first a single track bridge throughout, but now the Illinois approach is double-tracked ;

that the company\u2019s right of way is limited to 200 feet in width, but it has been widened, for the distance of a mile, from 200 feet to almost 600 feet to accommodate the approach; that the acquisition of this strip of land of 17.60 acres to widen its said right of way and the construction of the said approach constitute a new and independent enterprise and are the location and construction of a new road, which can only be properly designated as a branch or lateral road of the said company.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-2\" pgmap=\"436\">The petition further alleges that said company uses said bridge for the transfer of its trains running from various points and that the same has been so used by the Mobile and Ohio railroad for a number of years, and that petitioner is informed and believes that a contract exists between said companies, which is to run for twenty-five or more years, under which said Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company is to use said bridge, and that the amount now paid by it for such use to the Illinois Central company is not less than $150,000 per annum; that in addition to this income, from other and independent sources the said Illinois Central Railroad Company now collects, and has for many years collected, from shippers an extra charge of two cents per hundred on account of the said bridge, which said rate is called the \u201cCairo bridge toll that the said bridge, together with said approach, is a toll bridge, and the said toll of two cents per hundred is first taken out for said company before a division of freights- is made between it and other companies; that after said company had acquired its southern lines, and up to the time of the completion of said bridge, it owned and used large transfer boats at Cairo to transfer its cars and trains across the Ohio river, and that it paid taxes, as levied from year to year, on all of such boats; alleges that the Illinois Central Railroad Company has no power or right to own, have or use any property whatever beyond what is reasonably necessary to enable it to maintain and operate its railroad extending from Cairo to the north-west and north-east corners of the State, and that said bridge approach is in no way either necessary or essential to the operation of said road as provided for by said act of incorporation, and it is but the northern terminus of said company\u2019s New Orleans railroad, extended into Illinois to connect with its Illinois railroad three and one-half miles north of the southern terminus of said road.</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b436-3\" pgmap=\"436(20) 437(261)\">The petition further alleges that the relators herein applied by petition to the State Board of Equalization of this State, at its September term, 1905, and requested it to value and assess the said bridge approach for the purposes of taxation ; that said petition was referred by said board to its committee on the assessment of railroad property, and that said committee, on November 8, 1905, reported, in writing, to the board, that said bridge approach was not, in their judgment, assessable by the board, and that said report was then and there adopted, and of such action the relators were officially notified by the secretary of said board on November 9, 1905; alleges that the Illinois Central Railroad Company had expended in the construction of said approach up to February, 1902, about $375,000, and that since that time it has been widened and greatly improved and is of the value of not less than one-half a million dollars, and that it is wholly within the county of Alexander and school district No. 1, over which the board of education of the city of Cairo has jurisdiction, and that about 4000 feet of said approach is within the city of Cairo and that about 4000 feet is without the limits of said city, but inasmuch as the north end of said approach runs near to and into the original main line of said railroad, petitioner, for the purposes sought by this petition, does not include the north 1300 feet of said approach.

The answer then sets out sections 1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11, 15, 18, 22 and 27 of the said act, and alleges that after the passage and acceptance of said charter, as aforesaid, the said company surveyed and located its railroad and branches and began work on the main trunk thereof before January 1, 1852, as required by section 23 of its charter, and completed its road and branches and had the same in operation before the expiration of the year 1855; that in the location and construction of its railroad at or near the city of Cairo, for the purpose of securing suitable and proper right of way lands for main tracks, depots, station grounds, switch yards, side-tracks, switch tracks, turn-outs, engine houses, shops, and all other structures needful or necessary for the construction, maintaining, altering, preserving and the complete operation of its railroad, as contemplated by its charter and the said act of Congress providing for the construction of a railroad from Chicago to Mobile, said company on October 15, 1853, purchased from the trustees of Cairo city property, for the southern terminus of its road in the city of Cairo, a strip of land in the upper or northern part of said city extending from the Ohio to the Mississippi river, commonly known as the \u201cIllinois Central 500-foot strip;\u201d also a certain other strip of ground 200 feet in width lying north of and intersecting said 500-foot strip about midway of the two rivers; also two certain other pieces of land lying south of said 500-foot strip in the southerly portion of said city, one tract being 1000 feet in width and extending from Fourteenth to Eighteenth street, and the other 450 feet in width, now constituting block 1, at Second street; also the right to lay and operate a double line of rails from said 500-foot strip down and upon the Ohio river levee embankment to the two said tracts last mentioned; that said company thereafter constructed its said railroad upon and over said lands and built a passenger depot on said ground at Second street, and has ever since maintained the same, and established freight houses, depots, engine houses, switch yards, with side-trades, etc., on said piece of ground between Fourteenth and Eighteenth streets, in said city of Cairo-, and has ever since maintained the same; also constructed and laid down lines of main track over the said 200-foot strip south to said 500-foot strip, and thence curving to the left over, upon and along said 500-foot strip to the Ohio river, and from that point southward along said levee embankment to said freight and passenger depot aforesaid, and has ever since maintained and operated the same, with many sidetracks and switch tracks connecting therewith, upon said several pieces of ground above described within the city limits of said city of Cairo, including said 500-foot strip, which for many years has been known as its North Cairo yard, all of which lands were originally selected and have ever since constituted the southern terminus of said company\u2019s railroad at Cairo, Illinois; alleges that within a few years after the completion of the Illinois Central railroad the Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company completed its road from Mobile to the city of Columbus, Kentucky, and that for a number of years connection was made between the two roads by a steamboat, called \u201cThe Illinois,\u201d but that this arrangement was in due course of time discontinued, owing to the increasing demands of commerce. The answer then sets forth a number of reasons for such discontinuance, among which was the consolidation of several southern lines of railroad into the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad Company and the extension of the line of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company from Columbus to a point on the Ohio river opposite the city of Cairo, and from that time until the completion of the bridge across the Ohio river the use of transfer boats for the transfer of cars and trains across the said river; admits that for a period of over twenty years, during the operation of said boats, in addition to the seven per cent charter tax exacted of it by the State of Illinois, it paid special taxes on said transfer boats, but that said taxes on said boats were paid only because steamboats were not such property as' contemplated by section 22 of its charter; that said connections across the Ohio river became wholly inadequate to meet the growing demands of commerce, and it was absolutely necessary to the successful and complete operation of both the Illinois and southern lines that some more expeditious and satisfactory means of connection across said river should be devised; that on March 29, 1886, the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad Company procured from the legislature of the State of Kentucky an act authorizing the said company and the Illinois Central Railroad Company, or either of them, to build a railroad bridge in the State of Kentucky, at or near the city of Cairo, across the Ohio river to the boundary line between the States of Kentucky and Illinois; that prior to this time, on June 13, 1882, the Illinois Central Railroad Company had leased the lines of the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad Company, extending from New Orleans to a point opposite the city of Cairo, for a term of four hundred years from July 1, 1882; that in pursuance of said act the last above named company at its own expense constructed the said bridge and has ever since owned the same as part of its railroad, together with the Kentucky approach, and that said bridge extends across the Ohio river to the said 500-foot strip; that because of the increasing business of the Illinois charter lines of the Illinois Central railroad it became necessary that said company connect its then existing tracks with the tracks of the said bridge; that said bridge was built 53 feet above high water, and because of the altitude of said bridge, in order to properly lay the necessary tracks connecting said bridge with the then existing line tracks and give the same the necessary curve and grade to reach the elevation of the bridge and pass around and over existing tracks of said company, it became absolutely necessary that additional ground adjacent to and touching said original way lands acquired in 1853 should be obtained, and that thereupon, for the purposes aforesaid, said company, on April 18, 1889, obtained, by deed from the trustees of the Cairo city property, an additional strip of land containing 17.60 acres, and after procuring said strip of land said company at its own expense constructed said Illinois Central bridge approach, and laid tracks thereon connecting its main line with the rails on said bridge; that said bridge was completed and opened for traffic in October, 1889.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-3\" pgmap=\"441(61) 442(291)\">The answer further alleges that all of the tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, and other railroads entering Cairo, are laid upon embankments 12 to 16 feet above the natural ground, but because of the necessity therefor the tracks of said company leading to said bridge were laid at a much greater altitude, partly on an earth embankment and partly on steel trestles; that the entire length of said tracks leading to said bridge is 7963 feet; that the northerly'portion thereof, 5307 feet in length, is laid on an earth embankment, the northerly end thereof, intersecting with the earth embankment on which the main tracks are laid, at that point being about 15 feet above the natural surface and thence extending southward, bearing gradually to the right, away from the main track embankment, and then curving to the left towards the bridge, with a gradual increasing height and width until it reaches the southerly end of the embankment, where the height is about 50 feet and its width 185 feet at its base; that of the land covered by said 5307-foot embankment 7.5 acres is of the land purchased in 1889 and 8.2 acres is of the original way lands acquired in 1853 j that the southerly portion of said tracks, 2656 feet in length, leading to the bridge, is laid on a steel viaduct commencing at the terminus of said earth embankment and curving towards and extending to the bridge, all of which is upon the original way lands acquired by the Illinois Central Railroad Company in 1853; that the said earth embankment is double-tracked, and that the Illinois Central Railroad Company is now engaged in filling in with earth the space covered by said steel viaduct, and proposes to make the said bridge approach a continuous earth embankment, except at crossings, where concrete or steel viaducts will be maintained, and lay a double track thereon to said bridge, all of which work and additional tracks were and are necessary to meet the demands of commerce and the increasing business of said road.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-3\" pgmap=\"442(65) 443(382) 444(32)\">The answer denies that said bridge approach is a \u201cbranch or lateral railroad\u201d of the Illinois Central railroad, or an \u201cindependent enterprise,\u201d or \u201cthe northern end or terminus of the Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad Company,\u201d but, on the contrary, avers that said tracks and superstructure are a part of the Illinois Central Railroad Company\u2019s railroad constructed in pursuance of its charter, and that said approach, and the tracks laid thereon, to said bridge are absolutely indispensable and necessary for the proper operation of said road; admits that said steel viaduct leading to said bridge crosses 50 or 60 feet above the surface tracks of said Illinois Central Railroad Company, and that none of said tracks touch any of the tracks of said company except at the point of their junction with the main line, a mile and a half from the river, and alleges that it was practically impossible to construct said tracks otherwise; that the southern terminus of said road is not solely at its passenger depot in' the city of Cairo, but is at said city, and embraces all of the land and tracks owned by said company at that point; that the southern terminus of the Chicago, St Louis and New Orleans Railroad Company is at New Orleans and its northern terminus is its said railroad bridge over the Ohio river; alleges that about January 2, 1889, the Illinois Central Railroad Company and the Mobile and Ohio Railroad Company, which operated a road from Mobile to St. Louis through the city of Cairo, entered into an agreement for the joint use of the Illinois Central passenger station in the city of Cairo,- and its tracks from the junction with the bridge approach leading thereto, and the joint use of the Mobile and Ohio company\u2019s switch tracks on the opposite side of the river, and giving the right to said company last mentioned to use said bridge and the approaches thereto for the purpose of transferring its trains and cars across the said river, for which said company pays to the Illinois Central company the sum of $150,000 per annum, and that in addition to such use of said bridge the said Illinois Central company uses it for the transfer of all its trains and cars which require transfer across the said river; avers that it had the power and authority to build and operate said bridge approach not only under the provisions of its charter, but by virtue of the act of the General Assembly of February 25, 1867;

admits that petitioner made application to the State Board of Equalization to assess and value said approach for purposes of taxation and that the action taken thereon was as stated in said petition; alleges that said company pays, and has always paid, taxes on its said property not held for railroad purposes or in use in the operation of its road, to the full extent paid by other owners of like property, and as to the property held and used by it for railroad purposes, including said Illinois Central bridge approach, it pays a charter tax far in excess of taxes paid by other railroad companies owning like property in the State of Illinois; admits that said approach has cost up to the present time $500,000; that it is wholly within the county of Alexander and school district No. 1, and that the northerly portion thereof, (north of the city limits and of the length of about 4000 feet,) for the distance of about 1300 feet at the north end thereof, runs near to and into and consists of a considerable portion of the original earth embankment on which said company\u2019s original main tracks are laid;

The act of the Illinois legislature of February 17, 1851, accepting the act of Congress, pledged, the faith of the State to execute its part of the trust confided to Illinois, Mississippi and Alabama; and the act of said legislature of February 10, 1851, granting the charter in question to the Illinois Central Railroad Company, was evidently in furtherance of the object expressed in said act of Congress and with a full purpose of doing all that was required of Illinois to carry out that object. Said three acts were all in pari materia and upon a cognate subject, and said charter should therefore be construed as the act of the legislature of the State of Illinois carrying out the intention of Congress to make the Illinois Central railroad a part of one continuous thoroughfare from Chicago to the gulf. 9 U.

The main tracks of the charter lines of the Illinois Central Railroad Company coming from the north, after passing the northern limits of the city, proceed south about a quarter of a mile, practically midway between the two rivers, and then turn to the east until within a few hundred feet of low-water mark on the Ohio river, when they turn in a southerly direction and proceed along the west bank of the Ohio river about two miles to the passenger depot in that city. The tracks leading to the bridge across the Ohio leave the main line tracks about three-quarters of a mile north of the city limits and run south on the west side of the main line tracks, gradually ascending and departing a little to the west from the main line tracks but practically parallel thereto, until the tracks- leading to the bridge turn to the east at a point but little south of the place where the main lines turn to the east. The line leading to the bridge then passes over a steel viaduct and crosses the main tracks of the charter lines at a point about 50 or 60 feet above the main tracks and about 700 feet west of the most westerly portion of the bridge proper. If the bridge and the main tracks of the charter line were on the same level, those tracks and the railroad track on the bridge could be connected by a switch approximately 700 feet in length. The accompanying plat will perhaps assist in arriving at a correct understanding of the situation:</p> <p id=\"b450-3\" pgmap=\"450\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b450-4\" pgmap=\"450(91) 451(61)\">The question is whether the tracks leading to the bridge, and the embankment and steel structure upon which they rest, should be taxed in the ordinary way for the purposes of the State and the various local municipalities, or whether they are exempt from such taxation by virtue of sections 18 and 22 of the charter of the Illinois Central Railroad Company. Appellee contends, and the circuit court held, that these tracks, and the embankment and structure upon which they rest, constitute a branch or lateral railroad 'of the Illinois Central Railroad Company not a part of the lines the construction of which was contemplated by the charter; while appellants contend that the tracks, and the embankment and structure upon which they rest, are a part of the lines of the company constructed pursuant to the provisions of its charter and necessary for the proper operation of the road.</p> <p id=\"b451-3\" pgmap=\"451\">In 1850 the Congress of the United States passed an act which received the approval of the executive on the 20th day of September in that year, and which, so far as here material, with its title, reads as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b451-4\" pgmap=\"451\">\u201cAn act granting the right of way, and making a grant of land to the States of Illinois, Mississippi and Alabama, in aid of the construction of a railroad from Chicago to Mobile.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b451-5\" pgmap=\"451\">\"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled: That the right of way through the public lands be, and the same is hereby granted, to the State of Illinois for the construction of a railroad from the southern terminus of the Illinois and Michigan canal to a point at or near the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, with a branch of the same to Chicago, on Lake Michigan, and another via the town of Galena, in said State, to Dubuque, in the State of Iowa,\u201d etc.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b451-6\" pgmap=\"451\">\u201cSec. 2.

By that act the southern terminus of the road in the State of Illinois was to be \u201cat or near the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,\u201d and the road south of the Ohio was to be constructed from the city of Mobile \u201cto a point near the mouth of the Ohio river.\u201d Pursuant to the provisions of that act the Mobile and Ohio railroad was built from Mobile to the city of Columbus, in the State of Kentucky, which is situated on the bank of the Mississippi river about twenty miles below Cairo, and for a period of many years connection was made between the two roads by steamboat. Later the lines of the Mobile and Ohio were extended to a point opposite Cairo, where connection was made over the bridge there located from the lines of the Mobile and Ohio to those of the Illinois Central, and vice versa.</p> <p id=\"b457-4\" pgmap=\"457(146) 458(381) 459(77)\">The act of the General Assembly approved February 10, 1851, cedes and grants to this company all lands which may be selected under the grant made by the government to the State of Illinois by virtue of the act of Congress, setting out the title of the latter act, to-wit, \u201cAn act granting the right of way and making a grant of land to the States of Illinois, Mississippi and Alabama in aid of the construction of a railroad from Chicago to Mobile,\u201d from which it is apparent that the General Assembly of the State then contemplated the use of some method of transportation by which \u00abfreight and passengers carried south on the lines of the Illinois Central Railroad Company in Illinois should be transported across the Ohio river, that they might- thence .be carried by railroad to Mobile or points en route. It is to be observed that the act of Congress by the first section, grants the right of way through the public lands \u201cfor the construction of a railroad from the southern terminus of the Illinois and Michigan canal\u201d to a point at or near the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi, and by section 7, for the purpose of aiding.in \u201cthe construction of a railroad\u201d from the city of Mobile to a point near the mouth of the Ohio, grants are made to the States of Alabama and Mississippi. It is apparent that Congress did not make the grants upon condition that the same company should own the railroad throughout its entire length from Chicago to Mobile. The act speaks of the construction \u201cof a railroad\u201d in Illinois and the construction \u201cof a railroad\u201d from Mobile to the mouth of the Ohio. It follows, therefore, that it is a matter of no importance in this litigation that the lines of road now operated by the Illinois Central Railroad Company and owned or leased by that company have their southern terminus at the city of New Orleans, in the State of Louisiana, and not at the city of Mobile, in the State of Alabama. The lines of the Mobile and Ohio and the lines of the Illinois Central now connect at Cairo. Entire trains may be transferred from the lines of one road to the lines of the other. Passengers, freight, mail and express may pass from Chicago to Mobile by a continuous journey by rail, crossing the Ohio at a point near its mouth and near the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The purpose of the- national Congress in making the original grants has been attained. This view has been taken by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. State of Illinois, 163 U. S. 142, where it was said: \u201cThe line of railroad communication crossing the Ohio river at Cairo, and of which the Illinois Central railroad forms part, has been established by Congress as a national highway for the accommodation of inter-State commerce and of the mails of the United States, and as such has been recognized and promoted by the State of Illinois. This will clearly appear by a brief recapitulation of the acts of Congress and the State of Illinois on the subject. * * * The manifest purpose of Congress was to establish a railroad in the center of the continent, connecting the waters of the Great Lakes with those of the Gulf of Mexico, for the benefit of inter-State commerce as well as of the military and postal departments of the government of the United States.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b459-3\" pgmap=\"459(287) 460(17)\">It is contended that, notwithstanding this fact the corporation created by this State is, for all purposes of local government, a domestic corporation, and that as to this controversy the Illinois Central stands exactly as if no such purpose had ever been entertained by Congress; that the question of whether this property now' under consideration should be taxed as appellee seeks to have it taxed is a matter to be determined precisely as though the Illinois Central Railroad Company was authorized to construct a railroad from the mouth of the Ohio to Chicago, without any regard to the transfer of passengers, freight, mail and express, by rail, from its southern terminus to points beyond the Ohio. This view we think entirely too narrow. It could not reasonably be expected that all traffic to the south on this road should find destination north of the mouth of the Ohio, and while it is true that the question of the taxation of the company is solely a question for the State of Illinois, it is nevertheless true that in determining what property was needful for the operation of a road extending from the northern part of the State to the extreme southern boundary, the legislature could not but recognize the necessity of some means of passing and re-passing the Ohio river, and if the legislature, accepting, as it did, the provisions of the a\u00a3t of Congress, realized, as it must have done, the necessity of the ownership by the Illinois Central Railroad Company of property which would enable its traffic to reach the Ohio river, it would seem to follow that such property necessary for that purpose would fall within the provisions of the statute providing for commutation of the taxes or for a substituted method of taxation.</p> <p id=\"b460-3\" pgmap=\"460\">It. is also urged that the bridge approach is, in law, a part of the bridge, and many authorities are cited in support of .this proposition. It is then contended that the earnings of the bridge proper should be so apportioned as that a part thereof should be treated as the earnings of this approach ; that none of the earnings of the bridge proper are credited to this approach; that as the Illinois Central Railroad Company has not elected to treat the portion of the earnings of the bridge proper which are, in fact, the earnings of the approach as a part of the earnings of its charter lines, appellants cannot say that the approach in question is to be regarded as a part of the charter lines of the Illinois Central. In other words, that as the company does not pay taxes on the approach, or money in lieu thereof, in the manner that the law requires it to pay upon its charter lines, it should be required to pay taxes in the method prescribed by the general laws of the State for the taxation of railroad property. The failure of a tax-payer to comply with the law in reference to the payment of his taxes has nothing to do with the determination of the method by which the property should be taxed. If the Illinois Central Railroad Company is not paying the proper percentage of the earnings of this approach into the State treasury it should be required to do so, but its failure so to do does not alter the law.</p> <p id=\"b460-4\" pgmap=\"460(107) 461(335)\">It is also contended that under the contract which the Illinois Central has with the Mobile and Ohio, and under the practice of the Illinois Central by which an arbitrary charge or toll is levied upon freight passing over the bridge, on account of its so passing, the bridge, including this approach, is, in fact, a toll bridge. The contention further is, that under its charter the company has no right to maintain a toll bridge; that even if this approach might, under some-circumstances,- be exempt from ordinary taxation, it is not now so exempt because it is now devoted to a use not contemplated by the charter. Attention is called by appellee, in this connection, to the cases of In re Swigert, 119 Ill. 83, and Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. People, 119 id. 137. In those cases the question was whether a grain elevator known as the \u201cCairo elevator,\u201d and located on ground owned by the Illinois Central Railroad Company in the city of Cairo and leased to the firm of Halliday Bros., was exempt from taxation under sections 18 and 22 of the charter of that company. The court held that it was not so exempt, on the ground that it had no necessary connection with the construction, maintenance or operation of the company\u2019s road. The approach is not in the same class. It is directly and continually used in the operation of the lines of the Illinois Central. It is used in the business of operating a railroad, and in no other business. By the sections of the act of February 12, 1855, above set out, the Illinois Central Railroad Company was authorized to make contracts with other roads by which other roads might use the tracks of the Illinois Central. While it is true that if the legislature, by an act subsequent to the charter, empowered the company to acquire and hold property which it was not by the charter authorized to acquire and hold, such property would not come within the charter exemption, it is also true that when the law-makers by the act of 1855 authorized the company to lease its tracks to other companies,, a use of the tracks by another company under such a lease would not be a use for other' than railroad purposes, as was the us\u00e9 of the elevator. It matters not what name is given to the earnings resulting from the use of the charter line tracks of the company by other companies, they are still a part of \u201cthe gross or total proceeds, receipts or income derived from said road and branches.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b461-3\" pgmap=\"461(45) 462(147)\">It is also insisted that this approach is taxable under the law as announced by this court in Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Irvin, 72 Ill. 452. In that case it was held that a steamboat owned by the company for the purpose of carrying passengers and freight between Cairo, Illinois, and Columbus, Kentucky, thereby making a connection between the northern terminus of the Mobile and Ohio railroad and the southern terminus of the Illinois Central railroad, was not exempt from taxation by virtue of the provisions of the charter, on the ground that a steamboat is not railroad property, and that the right of carrying by rail, possessed by the Illinois Central Railroad Company under its charter, does not include, as a necessary incident, the right to carry by water. It is apparent that that case is not in point. This approach is like unto a switch track which would carry the cars of the Illinois Central Railroad Company from its main track to the wharf at the river\u2019s edge, and is unlike an instrumentality for transporting cars or passengers and freight upon or over the stream.</p> <p id=\"b462-3\" pgmap=\"462\">In People v. Illinois Central Railroad Co. 215 Ill. 177, it was held that the property here involved could not be taxed by the local assessor. Whether it could be taxed by the State Board of Equalization was not there decided, but it was there determined that this approach was used exclusively for railroad purposes and came within the denomination \u201crailroad track.\u201d We are satisfied that the use which has been made of this approach is not such as would warrant us in holding that it was taxable by ordinary methods, as was the case with reference to the steamboat and the elevator.</p> <p id=\"A11\" pgmap=\"462(99) 463(95)\">The parties hereto agree that the Federal government required the bridge in question to be built at a height of 53 feet above high-water mark on the Ohio river. This requirement has made necessary the expenditure of a large sum of money in the construction of this approach. Had the bridge been constructed on the same grade as the main tracks of the charter lines of the Illinois Central Railroad Company, the only thing necessary to make the connection between the rails on the bridge and such main tracks would have been a comparatively inexpensive switch track. It cannot be seriously contended that the greater expense of the method necessarily pursued under regulations established by the government of the United States in providing a way whereby cars might pass from the main tracks of the Illinois Central Railroad Company on the Illinois shore to the. tracks on the west end of the bridge, and from the tracks on the bridge to the main tracks of the company in Illinois, would affect the question as to whether or not the property made use of for that purpose is exempt from ordinary taxation.</p> <p id=\"AKo\" pgmap=\"463\">It is to be observed that no traffic of any character originates along this approach and that no passengers, freight, express or mail find a destination at any point which -it touches. In this respect it is entirely different from an ordinary branch or lateral line. (Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad Co. v. Wiltse, 116 Ill. 449.) Section 1 of the charter vests the Illinois Central Railroad Company with the power of acquiring and holding all \u201creal and personal estate which may be needful to carry into effect fully the purposes and objects of this act.\u201d The third section authorizes the company to acquire land \u201cfor the location of depots and stopping stages, for the purpose of constructing bridges, dams, embankments, excavations, station grounds, spoil-banks, turn-outs, engine houses, shops, and other buildings necessary for the construction, completing, altering, maintaining, preserving and complete operation of said road.\u201d In In re Swigert, supra, it was said that the enumeration in this charter of property that may be acquired by the corporation \u201cdoubtless includes the road, with all necessary switches and turn-outs.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b463-4\" pgmap=\"463(59) 464(161)\">In Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway Co. v. Baltimore and Ohio and Chicago Railroad Co. 149 Ill. 272, the appellee sought in the county court to condemn a strip of land for the purpose of connecting its tracks with the tracks of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company. It was there contended that the petitioner was without the power to condemn, for the reason that the connection which it proposed to make was either a branch line or a re-location of the main line, but it was held that the proposed connection, which was not over 800 feet in length, was not a branch road and was not a re-location of the main line, but that it was a side-track needful for the operation of the main line; and it was further said, that \u201cthe grant of power to locate and construct a railway carries with it the right to construct turn-outs, sidings and such conveniences as are usual in the necessary operation of the road,\u201d and that the act of 1872, \u201cwhile requiring the persons incorporating the company to name the places from which and to which it is intended to construct the proposed railway, lays down no limitation as to the places where such switches, side-tracks or turn-outs are to be constructed.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b464-3\" pgmap=\"464\">We conclude, upon consideration of the fact that the act creating the Illinois Central Railroad Company was passed, in part, for the purpose of carrying out the object of the national Congress as expressed in the act of Congress approved September 20, 1850, upon consideration of the various provisions of the charter of that company, and upon consideration of the language used and the conclusions reached by this court in the two cases last referred to, that it is clear and certain that power to acquire and construct this approach for the purpose of connecting the main tracks of the charter lines of the Illinois Central Railroad Company in Illinois with the tracks upon the bridge over the Ohio at the east line of the State was granted by the charter to the company, and that the approach is therefore within the exemption created by sections 18 and 22,' supra. This approach must be regarded as a switch or side-track \u201cneedful to carry into effect fully the purposes and objects\u201d of the act, and not as a branch or lateral railroad.</p> <p id=\"b464-4\" pgmap=\"464(29) 465(59)\">The question whether the sections of the charter providing for the commutation of the taxes of the Illinois Central Railroad Company or for substituted taxation of its property should be liberally or strictly construed has been much discussed. We find it unnecessary to determine that question, for the reason that in our view the property involved in this litigation comes clearly within that class of property exempted from ordinary taxation by the charter, whether the sections in question be liberally or strictly construed. '</p> <p id=\"b465-3\" pgmap=\"465\">It is also urged that long prior to the construction of this approach the power of the Illinois Central Railroad Company to condemn lands for the purpose for which this approach is used had been exhausted, and that as it could not acquire this property by condemnation i't could not acquire it for the purposes contemplated by its charter, and therefore could not hold it free from such taxation as is imposed by the general law. The power to acquire land by condemnation for side or switch tracks, such as this, is not exhausted by an apparent completion of the road, but may be exercised as other or additional conveniences of this character may become needful or requisite for the operation of the railroad. (Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Co. v. Wilson, 17 Ill. 123.) The power to acquire land for switch or side-tracks \u201cis a continuing power, which may be exercised from time to time as the needs of the company may require.\u201d Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad Co. v. Illinois Central Railroad Co. 113 Ill. 156.</p> <p id=\"b465-4\" pgmap=\"465\">Whether the approach is, in law, a part of the bridge so as to draw to itself a portion of the earnings of the bridge proper which are now not credited to the approach or to the charter lines in Illinois, is not for our consideration or determination in this suit.</p> <p id=\"b465-5\" pgmap=\"465\">The judgment of the circuit court will be reversed and the cause will be remanded, with directions to overrule the demurrer to the answer.</p> <p id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
