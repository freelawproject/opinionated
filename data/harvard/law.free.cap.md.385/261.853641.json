The statute<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> together, require that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>criminal defendant be brought to trial within 180 days after the earlier of either the appearance of defendant\u2019s counsel or the first appearance of the defendant. Concluding that the nolle pros of the initial indictment \u201cwas intended to circumvent that portion of the rule, which leaves to the administrative judge to decide whether a case, once set within 180 days, should be continued for good cause shown,\u201d and noting that, as to that indictment, more than 180 days had then elapsed since the prescribed appearances, the trial court ruled that \u00a7 6-103 and Rule 4-271 had been violated and, therefore, dismissed the re-indicted charges. The Court of Special Appeals, agreeing with the trial court\u2019s analysis, affirmed. <em>State v. Price, </em>152 Md.App. 640, 644-45, 833 A.2d 614, 617 (2003). We granted the State\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>State v. Price, </em>379 Md. 98, 839 A.2d 741 (2004). We agree with the Circuit Court and the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">On May 9, 2002, the respondent was indicted, charged with robbery, first degree assault, and second degree assault. He appeared without counsel in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on May 17, 2002 and his counsel entered his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>appearance five days later, on May 22, 2002. The trial date was set for July 23, 2002. At a status conference, conducted on June 21, 2002, noting the assigned prosecutor\u2019s unavailability on the trial date due to a conflict with the trial of another case, the State requested a continuance of the trial date. Pointing to his incarceration, the respondent objected. Nevertheless, after confirming that both counsel were available on that date, the trial court continued the case to August 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Prior to the new trial date,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by motion filed August 5, 2002, the State sought to continue the trial date once again. When it did so, the State was subject to a court order, entered in response to the respondent\u2019s motion to compel discovery, pursuant to which the State was required, within ten (10) days, to file a written answer to the respondent\u2019s then pending discovery motion and provide the respondent with certain enumerated material. The order also stated: \u201cin the event the State fails to abide by this Order, the State shall be prohibited from producing any witness, or evidence at trial or hearing which relates in any way to the State\u2019s non-disclosure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">At a hearing on the motion to continue, held August 12, 2002, the State argued that the continuance was necessary because it had not received a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis of evidence submitted to the crime lab on May 10, 2002. In support of that argument, the State informed the court that it is the crime lab\u2019s practice not to begin DNA analyses until it receives a subpoena with a trial date and that, although neither it nor the police officer had advised the crime lab of the trial date or knew that they should, the analysis would not have been ready in time for the August 12th trial date in any event, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cWe had a status date on June 21st where this trial date was scheduled. Even if I knew on June 21st to notify them of that trial date, we still couldn\u2019t have had the trial date today because it would take them four to six weeks to do the testing and we have to give 45 days notice, so that would have been a middle of September trial date anyway.\u201d[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">Noting that the <em>\u201c[Hicks][</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>date in this case doesn\u2019t even run until the end of November. This case was just [indicted] the end of May, it\u2019s a very serious matter,\u201d it pointed out that \u201cunder the 180 days he has until the middle to end of November to have [a speedy trial], and we have a lot of time between the 2 nd week in August and the end of November to set that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Characterizing the State\u2019s reason for requesting a continuance as \u201cnot even a poor excuse, it\u2019s a pitiful excuse,\u201d and refusing to keep the respondent \u201csitting in jail,\u201d the administrative judge denied the motion for continuance. Believing that the DNA evidence was needed as part of its case, the State declined to go to trial without it. Consequently, it nolle prossed the charges against the respondent, stating, however, \u201cwe\u2019ll get a new charging document today to charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The respondent was re-indicted for the identical charges. That did not occur, however, until September 19, 2002, some five weeks after the initial indictment was nolle prossed. The new indictment was met with a motion to dismiss for violation of the <em>Hicks </em>Rule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The hearing on that motion was held on November 27, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>In support of its motion, the respondent relied on his consistent demand, from the first request for continuance by the State, for strict compliance with the <em>Hicks </em>Rule and the order to compel discovery. Specifically, he pointed out that his first appearance under the initial indictment occurred on May 17, 2002 and, consequently, at the time of the hearing, more than 180 days had expired. With respect to the order to compel discovery, the respondent noted that the State had not met the ten day deadline to provide discovery before its nolle pros of the indictment terminated the case. That order prohibited, moreover, he adds, the State \u201cfrom producing any witness or evidence at trial or hearing which relates in any way to the nondisclosure.\u201d The trial date being beyond the <em>Hicks </em>date, the respondent concluded that the State entered \u201ca nolle pros to get around Judge Debelius\u2019 order [to compel discovery]\u201d and \u201calso to get around the <em>Hicks\u2019 </em>date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The State disputed that analysis, emphasizing instead when in the 180 day period the nolle pros was entered, on the eighty-third day, with \u201cninety-seven days remaining to reset the case.\u201d It also submitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">\u201cThe sole purpose of requesting the continuance was to get the [DNA] testing done, and it couldn\u2019t have been more clear as to why we were asking for the continuance. And whether or not the judge grants that or not that\u2019s not really the issue, the issue was the nolle pros to get around the 180, and the answer i[s] clearly no, because there was over three months to reschedule the trial date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Accepting the State\u2019s argument that it \u201cacted not to circumvent the prohibition that a case be tried within 180 days, because there were a number of days left,\u201d the court nevertheless granted the respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment. It did so because it concluded that, in addition to the 180 day requirement, Rule 4-271, consistent with the statute it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>implements, contains a second component, prohibition of the continuance of a trial date except for good cause found by the administrative judge or that judge\u2019s designee. Thus, pointing out that \u201cthe supervision of the dockets is given to the administrative judge,\u201d who, by determining, in that capacity, or by designee, whether good cause exists to continue the trial date, \u201cdeeide[s] whether cases can and can\u2019t be tried within the 180 days,\u201d and noting that the State does not have the right to appeal that good cause determination, the court was satisfied that \u201cit was the decision of the administrative judge of that county that the State had not established a good cause\u201d that was being sought to be circumvented.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Emphasizing that ninety-seven of the 180 day <em>Hicks </em>period remained when the State nolle prossed the charges against the respondent due to the unavailability of DNA test results, the Circuit Court expressly found that, \u201cin this case what really is occurring is the State acted not to circumvent the prohibition that a case be tried within 180 days ... that wasn\u2019t what the State was intending,\u201d that the results of DNA testing were essential to its case and to complying with both the respondent\u2019s discovery request and the court\u2019s order with respect thereto, and that the nolle pros is a legitimate prosecutorial option available to the State, the State submits that the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals erred in dismissing the re-indictment of the respondent. It argues that dismissal is, in fact, inconsistent with the settled pronouncements of this Court, pronouncements which, it says, have stated clearly that where a case has been nolle prossed for unavailability of DNA evidence, the 180 day period runs from the date of the appearances of counsel and defendant pursuant to the subsequent indictment, rather than the one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>that was nolle prossed. It is the State\u2019s position, in other words, that the \u201cstatute and rule [apply] only when the circumstances are such that, in the absence of the nol pros, dismissal with prejudice was a certainty because the State was absolutely incapable of trying the case within the 180 day period.\u201d The State relies on <em>State v. Brown, </em>341 Md. 609, 672 A.2d 602 (1996); <em>State v. Glenn, </em>299 Md. 464, 474 A.2d 509 (1984); <em>Curley v. State, </em>299 Md. 449, 474 A.2d 502 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The State is correct, \u201cwhen a circuit court criminal case is nol prossed, and the state later has the same charges refiled, the 180-day period for trial prescribed by \u00a7 [6-103] and Rule [4-271] ordinarily begins to run with the arraignment or first appearance of defense counsel under the second prosecution.\u201d <em>Curley, </em>299 Md. at 462, 474 A.2d at 508. There was an exception to the general rule recognized in <em>Curley, </em>however, \u201cwhere the prosecution\u2019s purpose in filing the nol pros, or the necessary effect of the nol pros, was to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 [6-103] and Rule [4-271].\u201d <em>Glenn, </em>299 Md. at 467, 474 A.2d at 511. <em>Curley </em>and <em>Glenn </em>both involve and, although they reach different results, elucidate the \u201cnecessary effect\u201d component of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>Curley, </em>the State nolle prossed the charges against the defendant on \u201cthe final day for trial,\u201d 299 Md. at 453, 474 A.2d at 504, and when ther'e had not been a trial date set. Notwithstanding the State\u2019s representation to the defendant as to the reason for the nolle pros, that it was entered, \u201cbased on the combined factors of the apparent inadmissibility of the blood alcohol content test as performed in the case and upon the request made of the State by the family of the victim,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 453, 474 A.2d at 504, and the trial court\u2019s apparent acceptance of that explanation, <em>id. </em>at 453, 474 A.2d at 504, this Court reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment, containing the identical charges, brought three months subsequently. While recognizing the appropriateness of the exception to the general rule applied by the trial court, the Court declared that exception to be \u201ctoo limited,\u201d explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>\u201cWhere the [Sjtate\u2019s action <em>necessarily circumvents </em>the statute and rule prescribing a deadline for trial, this should be sufficient to continue the time period running with the initial prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 461, 474 A.2d at 508 (emphasis added). The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">\u201cWhen the nol pros was entered on March 23, 1981, which was the final day for trial, it was too late for compliance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. At the time a trial date had not even been assigned. The case could not have been tried on March 23rd, as the defendant, his counsel, and witnesses were not present. There was no reason for them to have been present, as March 23rd was not the assigned trial date. As of the close of business on March 23rd, the case would have had to have been dismissed for violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. In reality, the prosecution had already lost the case under \u00a7 591 and Rule 746 when the nol pros was filed. Regardless of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s motives, the necessary effect of the nol pros was an attempt to evade the dismissal resulting from the failure to try the case within 180 days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 462-63, 474 A.2d at 508-509.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">By contrast, in <em>State v. Glenn, supra, </em>it was clear to the Court that the nolle pros in that case did not have the \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of circumventing the 180 day Rule. In that case, the Court first considered whether the record evidenced any intention on the part of the State to circumvent the 180 day Rule and rejected that proposition. It observed, in that regard, that the State nolle prossed the charges against Glenn, as \u201c[t]he record clearly establish[ed], with no basis for a contrary inference ... because of a legitimate belief that the charging documents were defective and because the defendant\u2019s attorney would not agree to amendment of the charging document.\u201d 299 Md. at 467, 474 A.2d at 511. Addressing the effect of that action, the Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">\u201cUnlike the situation in <em>Curley, </em>the necessary effect of the nol pros in these cases was not to circumvent \u00a7 591 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Rule 746. November 17, 1981, which was the assigned trial date and the date of the nol pros, was only 123 days after the arraignment and first appearance of counsel. If the cases had not been nol prossed, trial could have proceeded on November 17th. If the cases had not been nol prossed, and if for some reason trial had not proceeded when the cases were called on November 17th, there remained fifty-seven days before the expiration of the 180-day deadline. In <em>Curley, </em>if the cases had not been nol prossed on the 180th day, it necessarily would have been dismissed for a violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746. This is not the situation in the present cases. The effect of the nol pros in the present cases was not necessarily to evade the requirements or sanction of \u00a7 591 and Rule 746.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 467, 474 A.2d at 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\"><em>State v. Brown, supra, </em>is to similar effect. The charges in that case were nolle prossed forty-three days before the assigned trial date because, as in the case <em>sub yodice, </em>the requested DNA tests had not been completed, and charges were re-instituted via indictment filed three months later. <em>Brown, </em>341 Md. at 612, 672 A.2d at 604. The State did not seek a postponement of the trial before entering the nolle pros and the defendant, conceding the necessity of the test results and that a postponement most probably would have been granted, had one been requested, argued only the nolle pros\u2019s effect on the requirements of the statute and the rule, and the Court confined its decision to that issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Denying the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>dant\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271, after reviewing <em>Curley </em>and <em>Glenn, </em>the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOe\">\u201ca nol pros will have the \u2018necessary effect\u2019 of an attempt to evade the requirements of \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271 <em>only </em>when the alternative to the nol pros would have been a dismissal with prejudice for noncompliance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">341 Md. at 619, 672 A.2d at 607, citing <em>State v. Phillips, </em>299 Md. 468, 474 A.2d 512 (1984); <em>State v. Henson, 335 </em>Md. 326, 335-336, 643 A.2d 432, 437 (1994). Applying that rule, it explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">\u201cIt is obvious that the nol pros in the case at bar did not have the necessary effect of an attempt to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271. If the case had not been nol prossed on October 5,1993, there would have been 43 days before the expiration of the 180-day period. In this respect, the case is very much like the <em>Glenn </em>case. During this 43-day period, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office may have been able to expedite the DNA testing and obtain the results so that trial of the case could have begun before the deadline. Alternatively, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office may have obtained from the administrative judge, in accordance with \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271, a good cause postponement of the trial to a date beyond the 180-day period. There was clearly a basis for such postponement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 620, 672 A.2d at 607-608.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">The \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of the nolle pros is only one of the inquiries that informs the decision whether, in a specific situation, the general rule that the 180 day period runs from the date of the arraignment under the new indictment, should be applied, rather than the exception recognized in our cases. That exception, as articulated in <em>Curley </em>and reiterated in later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>cases, <em>see Glenn, </em>299 Md. at 466, 474 A.2d at 511; <em>Brown, </em>341 Md. at 614, 672 A.2d at 604-605; <em>Henson, </em>335 Md. at 335 n. 4, 643 A.2d at 436 n. 4, has two components: the nolle pros\u2019 purpose and the nolle pros\u2019 effect. <em>See Baker v. State, </em>130 Md.App. 281, 289, 745 A.2d 1142, 1146 (2000), in which the intermediate appellate court, stating the analytical framework for re-indicted cases, recognized, as well as articulated, that the <em>Curley </em>exception was \u201ca two pronged\u201d one. This Court has not had the occasion to address, directly or extensively, the former component. The Court of Special Appeals has, however. <em>See State v. Akopian, </em>155 Md.App. 123, 841 A.2d 893 (2004); <em>Ross v. State, </em>117 Md.App. 357, 700 A.2d 282 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In <em>Akopian, </em>faced with the prospect of proceeding to trial without its witness, a police officer on assignment in connection with the Washington/Virginia snipers, when the administrative judge denied its request for a continuance and the defendant waived his jury trial prayer and discovery motion,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the State nolle prossed the charges against the defendant. It re-indicted the defendant within two days and, thereafter, consistently sought to have the case set in for trial within the 180 day period measured from initial appearance/arraignment in the first indictment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Despite the defendant\u2019s persistent appearance without counsel and the administrative judge\u2019s reluctance to set a trial date when the defendant was unrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>sented,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the State succeeded in having the trial date set within 180 days of the initial appearance, only to have the case not go forward on that date due to inclement weather. Although impressed by the State\u2019s efforts to meet the <em>Hicks </em>deadline and sympathetic to the State\u2019s position, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">\u201cBut the position I have taken with respect to these motions and this rule is that there are two parts to that rule ... discussed in <em>Hicks.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">\u201cOne is that trial has ... to be tried ... within 180 days. The other part to the rule ... is that it may not be continued unless for good cause shown by the administrative judge. And the cases that have dealt with this issue on appeal have discussed the importance of allowing the administrative judge to manage this docket so that all cases can be handled in an efficient manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u201cSo ... it is not just the 180-day clause within the rule, but ... that the case cannot be continued unless for good cause shown and found by the administrative judge. In this case, clearly the State entered the nol-pros to avoid the order of the administrative judge which is that the case not be . continued, no good cause having been shown. <em>I will say that the State, through the extraordinary efforts of [the State\u2019s Attorney], has managed in my view to satisfy the 180-day prong of that </em>rule[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] by managing to get the case set back in on the re-indictment by December 11th, which makes this case different from any case that is cited on appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201cThat notwithstanding, I think when you read those cases, they stand for the proposition that .. . notwithstanding that you were able to get it set back in, that still the net effect of this was that you overruled the determination of the administrative judge that there was no good cause for continuing the prosecution of this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><em>Akopian, </em>155 Md.App. at 137, 841 A.2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed. Having concluded that \u201cthe State\u2019s action, in and of itself, did not have the necessary effect of circumventing the 180-day rule,\u201d there being more than fifty days remaining in the original <em>Hicks </em>period when the nolle pros was entered, the intermediate appellate court turned to the purpose for entering the nolle pros. As to that prong, it discerned no facts from the record indicating \u201cthat the State\u2019s use of a <em>nolle prosequi </em>had either the necessary effect or the purpose of circumventing the 180-day rule\u201d and it so held. To the intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVf\">\u201cIt [was] abundantly clear from the record that the State made extraordinary effort to obtain a trial date well within the outside limit of the original 180-day calendar. In every instance the State\u2019s effort was thwarted by appellee\u2019s appearance without counsel and, what we conclude to be, his refusal to be represented. It is true that the savvy defendant can manipulate the system to obtain delays, and the facts before us lead to the inescapable conclusion that appellee\u2019s goal was to delay trial to the point of a <em>Hicks </em>violation, despite the State\u2019s best efforts to avoid that result. The State should not suffer the detriment of his manipulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"><em>Akopian, </em>155 Md.App. at 143, 841 A.2d at 904-905 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">One of the cases to which the <em>Akopian </em>court referred, and whose holding it analyzed, was <em>Ross, supra. </em>In that case, on the scheduled trial date, the State nolle prossed drug charges against the defendant immediately after its request for continuance, made because the drugs had not been analyzed, had been denied by the county administrative judge. In denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>the motion, that judge expressly refused to find good cause to continue the case and commented, \u201cI don\u2019t think this case can be put back in. Our docket is too crowded.\u201d 117 Md.App. at 361, 700 A.2d at 284. The defendant was re-indicted eight days later and subsequently tried within the 180 day period applicable to that indictment, but more than the 180 days applicable to the nolle prossed indictment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Reversing the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of the <em>Hicks </em>Rule and statute, the Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat the State entered the nol pros to circumvent the 180-day limit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 700 A.2d at 289. In support of that holding, the court emphasized the requirement of the statute and the rule that a defendant be brought to trial not later than 180 days of arraignment or first of appearance of counsel, that those requirements are mandatory, dismissal being the sanction for violation, and the role of the county administrative judge in overseeing compliance with those requirements.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 363-64, 700 A.2d at 285-86. As to the latter, more specifically, the court found significant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the county administrative judge\u2019s discretion to determine whether good cause exists to extend the trial date \u201ccarries a heavy presumption of validity\u201d and is \u201crarely subject to reversal upon review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364-65, 700 A.2d at 286, quoting <em>Dalton v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 673, 682, 591 A.2d 531, <em>cert, denied, </em>325 Md. 16, 599 A.2d 89 (1991) and <em>State v. Frazier, </em>298 Md. 422, 451, 470 A.2d 1269, 1284 (1984) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected the State\u2019s argument, which, relying on <em>Brown, </em>341 Md. 609, 672 A.2d 602, and <em>Glenn, </em>299 Md. 464, 474 A.2d 509, stressed that there were eighty-eight days left to run in the 180 day time period when the nolle pros was entered, concluding that the nolle pros did not have the \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of circumventing the 180 day period:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cIn <em>Brown, </em>however, there was no ruling from the administrative judge. Moreover, both parties had agreed that, if requested, a postponement for good cause would have been granted, and that there was a possibility that the case could have been brought to trial within the remaining forty-three days of the 180-day time period. We also note that there was no decision from the administrative judge in <em>Curley </em>and <em>Glenn. </em>In the present case, however, a postponement was requested and denied and, as found by the administrative judge, the case could not be set in before the tolling of the 180-day limit. We again stress that in light of the administrative judge\u2019s supervision of the docket, we are unable to ignore his statement that the case could not be heard before expiration of the 180-day time period. In addition, immediately following the judge\u2019s ruling, the State entered a nol pros in the case. We can discern no clearer attempt to circumvent the time period dictated by Art. 27, \u00a7 591 and Rule 4-271.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"><em>Ross, </em>117 Md.App. at 370, 700 A.2d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">We agree with the court\u2019s result and its analysis. Just as the test for determining the applicable 180 day period when there has been a nolle pros of one indictment and a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>indictment containing the same charges is two pronged, the statute and the rule, as the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court recognized, have two aspects. Section 6-103 and Rule 4-271 \u201cset forth [both] a definite time requirement for the trial of criminal cases and an explicit procedure for postponing a case beyond the 180-day limit.\u201d <em>Goldring v. State, </em>358 Md. 490, 493, 750 A.2d 1, 2 (2000), quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>349 Md. 688, 701, 709 A.2d 1244, 1249 (1998) (some citations omitted). They \u201ccodify and implement the chief legislative objective that \u2018there should be a prompt disposition of criminal charges in the circuit courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>349 Md. 688, 700, 709 A.2d 1244, 1249 (1998), quoting <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 334, 403 A.2d at 369. Their intended objectives, implemented via the mechanism established by the statute and the rule, are to afford reasonably prompt trials, and eliminate excessive scheduling delays and unjustifiable postponements. <em>Hicks, </em>285 Md. at 316, 403 A.2d at 359; <em>Dorsey, </em>349 Md. at 701, 709 A.2d at 1250; <em>Farinholt v. State, </em>299 Md. 32, 41, 472 A.2d 452, 456 (1984). Thus, \u201cthe mechanism of the <em>Hicks </em>Rule serves as a means of protecting society\u2019s interest in the efficient administration of justice. The actual or apparent benefits of \u00a7 [6-103] and Rule 4-271 confer upon criminal defendants are purely incidental. <em>See Calhoun v. State, </em>299 Md. 1, 11-12, 472 A.2d 436 (1984); <em>Curley v. State, </em>299 Md. 449, 460, 474 A.2d 502 (1984); <em>Frazier, </em>298 Md. at 456, 470 A.2d at 1286-87; <em>Marks v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 269, 277, 578 A.2d 828, 832 (1990).\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>349 Md. at 701, 709 A.2d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State sought and was refused a continuance, the administrative judge expressly finding no good cause for one. The effect of that ruling was to mandate that trial proceed, as scheduled. The consequence of the State not going forward or not producing evidence was dismissal of the case or an acquittal. When the State nolle prossed the case, it was, as the State concedes, to avoid those results. Thus, the State is correct, the nolle pros did not have the \u201cnecessary effect\u201d of circumventing the 180 day requirement of the statute and the rule; rather, it was for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>purpose of circumventing, and, indeed, that intention was achieved, the requirement of the statute and the rule that trials proceed except when there has been a finding of good cause by the administrative judge.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that \u201cthe purpose for entering the nol pros in the case under consideration was to circumvent the authority and decision of the administrative judge.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>152 Md.App. 640, 654, 833 A.2d 614, 623 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">This case is stronger than <em>Ross. </em>In addition to the administrative judge finding no good cause for continuance and thus requiring the State to proceed to trial, the State was under, and in violation of, a discovery order requiring it to respond and imposing sanctions for non-compliance. The nolle pros also avoided the effect of that order and, so, its \u201cnecessary effect\u201d was to circumvent that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">.

Moreover, with regard to the extent of a postponement, even though the administrative judge may not personally select or approve the new trial date in a postponed case, such selection is made by personnel operating under his supervision and reporting to him.
