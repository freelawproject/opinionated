As of the date petitioner made his application, his driver\u2019s license had been revoked both in Illinois and in Florida and the MVA denied his application on the basis of Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article, which prohibits the MVA from issuing a license \u201c[d]uring any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked ... in this or any other state.\u201d Petitioner sought review in the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) of the MVA\u2019s failure to process his license application and in a hearing on January 15, 2004, before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), petitioner was granted his requested relief and the MVA was ordered to process petitioner\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license. On February 10, 2004, the MVA filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Following argument, the trial court issued a written opinion on August 5, 2004, reversing the decision of the ALJ. Thereafter, petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with this Court which we granted on November 29, 2004. <em>Gwin v. Motor Vehicle Administration, </em>383 Md. 569, 861 A.2d 60 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Petitioner presents the following question for our review, to which we have added a second question to reflect the more narrow issue as presented to the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">1. \u201c[Does] the Driver License Compacts Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-703 of the Transportation Article] allow[ ] a Maryland resident with a permanent revocation of his Florida driver\u2019s license to apply for a Maryland driver\u2019s license after serving one year of the revocation?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>2. Does McLCode (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article, conflict with the Driver License Compact, found at Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 16-703 of the Transportation Article? [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As we have reframed the focus of this case, we hold that there is no conflict between Md.Code (1977, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article, which permits the MVA to deny a driver\u2019s license to an individual whose driver\u2019s license has been revoked in Maryland or any other state, and the Driver License Compact, found at Md.Code (1977, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 16-703 of the Transportation Article. The clear legislative intent of these two statutes indicates that Maryland law recognizes extraterritorial license revocations and the MVA is not permitted to issue a license to an individual whose license has been permanently revoked in another jurisdiction, even after a period of one year of the revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Petitioner, currently a Maryland resident, completed an Application for a Maryland Non-Commercial Driver\u2019s License on April 8, 2003, in pursuit of a Maryland driver\u2019s license. In response to question number four on the application, which states, \u201cIs your driver\u2019s license or privilege to drive suspended, revoked, refused or cancelled in this or any other state, Washington D.C., or Canada?\u201d petitioner indicated in the affirmative. A bolded statement printed on the application immediately adjacent to the question four response area reads, \u201cIf yes, you are not eligible for a Maryland driver\u2019s license.\u201d This statement appears in response to Md.Code (1977, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article, which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u201c\u00a7 16-103.1. [Persons not to be licensed] \u2014 Disqualifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">The Administration may not issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>(1) During any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled in this or any other state, unless the individual is eligible for a restricted license under \u00a7 16-113(e) of this subtitle....\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Petitioner\u2019s rather dismal driving record indicates that he has four convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs (\u201cDUI\u201d) for which he received a license revocation in Illinois and a permanent license revocation in Florida.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>unclear precisely how long petitioner has resided in Maryland, but it appears to be at least since April 2000 given that petitioner\u2019s MVA record indicates that on April 6, 2000, he secured a Maryland State Identification card,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which is valid for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The MVA declined to consider petitioner\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license, noting on petitioner\u2019s application that he would \u201cneed clearance letters from the [Florida] and [Illinois] DMV[s]\u201d (alterations added). In a letter from petitioner\u2019s counsel, dated April 9, 2003, one day after petitioner\u2019s license application was denied by the MVA pursuant to \u00a7 16-103.1, petitioner requested a hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings. A hearing was scheduled for May 27, 2003, at which petitioner failed to appear, and, upon petitioner\u2019s request, a later hearing was scheduled for January 15, 2004. At the January 2004 hearing, petitioner appeared with his attorney before Mary Shock, Administrative Law Judge; no representatives from the MVA appeared, and the MVA proceeded on the documents it had submitted. Petitioner argued that the Interstate Driver\u2019s License Compact (\u201cCompact\u201d), into which Maryland had entered in 1987,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see </em>1987 Md. Laws, Chap. 320, codified at Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-703 of the Transportation Article, supercedes Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-103.1 of the Transportation Article and, effectively, compels the MVA to conduct an investigation of petitioner\u2019s fitness to drive a motor vehicle, and upon a satisfactory assessment, to issue petitioner a Maryland driv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>er\u2019s license after he has served one year of the permanent revocation of his Florida license. Following the conclusion of petitioner\u2019s testimony and counsel\u2019s argument, the ALJ found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201c[Petitioner has] been revoked in Illinois since 1982 and in Florida since 1984. And the Florida revocation is a lifetime revocation, so you are unable to have that cleared in order to apply for a license or to overcome the disqualification section of 16-103.1. But I have considered the Article [V] of the [C]ompact entered into with other jurisdictions. Article [V], Section 2, states if such revocation is not terminated, except after the applicant has held a license, but the same has been revoked by reason in whole or in part of a violation and if such revocation is not terminated except after an expiration of one year from the date the licensee was revoked, such person may make an application for a new license if permitted by law. And the licensing authority has the authority to refuse but an investigation must be performed. Even the disqualification section of 16-103.1 does not \u2014 although in the end it conflicts it does not prevent the application and the investigation[.][S]o I will order that the MVA process the licensee\u2019s application for a driver\u2019s license because it\u2019s been more than a year since the revocation.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">On February 11, 2004, the MVA sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of the ALJ\u2019s determination. The trial court examined the issue in terms of whether \u00a7 16-103.1 conflicts with \u00a7 16-703, and if there is a conflict, which statute prevails. In a decision dated August 5, 2004, the trial court reversed the ALJ and determined that the statutes did not conflict, and instead were intended to act in concert. The trial court reasoned that the language of \u00a7 16-103.1 evinces the General Assembly\u2019s intent to provide \u201crecognition of extraterritorial revocations beyond that which the Compact recognizes\u201d and \u00a7 16-103.1 \u201cprovides the MVA with a mechanism to recognize revocations of non-Compact \u25a0 states and deny issuance of a license on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Our review of this case is enabled by Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.

On the other hand, if the court should find that the substantial rights of a petitioner for review have been prejudiced, by one or more of the causes specified in \u00a7 [10-222 of the State Government Article], because of an administrative finding, inference, conclusion or decision, then it is the function of the court to reverse or modify the order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">221 Md. at 230,156 A.2d at 662 (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Turning to the case before this Court, petitioner contends that the Driver License Compact, Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 16-703 of the Transportation Article, trumps the allegedly conflicting Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-103.1 of the Transportation Article. Specifically, in support of his position that \u201capplication for a new license, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>expiration of one year from the date a license was revoked by another state, may be made if permitted by law,\u201d petitioner points to Article V of the Compact, with particular focus on Article V(2), which governs Applications for New Licenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cUpon application for a license to drive, the licensing authority in a party state shall ascertain whether the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of a license to drive issued by any other party state. The licensing authority in the state where application is made shall not issue a license to drive to the applicant if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-6\">(1) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been suspended by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such suspension period has not terminated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">(2) The applicant has held such a license, but the same has been revoked by reason, in whole or in part, of a violation and if such revocation has not terminated, except that after the expiration of 1 year from the date the license was revoked, such person may make application for a new license <em>if permitted by law. </em>The licensing authority may refuse to issue a license to any such applicant if, after investigation, the licensing authority determines that it will not be safe to grant to such person the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the public highways.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">The MVA responds that petitioner is incorrect in his assertion that \u00a7 16-703 Article V(2) \u201cabsolutely requires a party state to find individuals still revoked in other states eligible for licensure after one year.\u201d The MVA continues that petitioner\u2019s \u201cassumption ignores savings language in the same Compact provision, providing that the minimum one-year eligibility must yield to a party state\u2019s other law prohibiting eligibility and licensure in those circumstances.\u201d That is, the MVA urges that the inclusion of the phrase \u201cif permitted by law\u201d found in Article V(2) functions as a savings clause, \u201crecognizing that member states, such as Maryland, may have stricter licensure prohibitions that affect the out-of-state revoked driver\u2019s eligibility.\u201d This savings clause, according to the MVA, modifies solely \u201cthe exception permitting the applicant to apply for (and obtain) a license while still revoked in another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>state ...\u201d and serves to harmonize the provisions of the Compact with Maryland\u2019s other motor vehicle laws, including \u00a7 16-103.1.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">A. License Application Processing and Denial</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Petitioner draws a distinction between application for a new license and issuance of a new license and narrowly focuses his appeal on the issue of whether \u201c[petitioner is <em>eligible </em>to apply for a Maryland driver\u2019s license and have an investigation conducted by the MVA\u201d to determine petitioner\u2019s fitness as a safe driver (emphasis added). It is the distinction between application and licensure on which petitioner bases his contention that the MVA may issue a license after the expiration of one year from the date a license was revoked by another state. Petitioner goes on to note that the ALJ simply ordered that the MVA process petitioner\u2019s application for a license, and consideration of petitioner\u2019s eligibility to be <em>issued </em>a license is \u201cnot yet ripe for appeal: 1) because the investigation has not been conducted to determine whether it would be safe under Maryland law to issue him a license; and 2) the ALJ did not order the MVA to issue [petitioner] a license\u201d (alteration added). Petitioner is essentially arguing that he should be considered for licensure and that, upon investigation, is confident that he ultimately will be issued a license in Maryland. In a letter to the OAH dated April 9, 2003, one day after petitioner\u2019s license application was denied by MVA pursuant to \u00a7 16-103.1, petitioner\u2019s counsel indicated his belief that he would prevail under the scrutiny of an investigation into his fitness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201cMr. Gwin is confident he will pass such an investigation and is willing to comply with any and all conditions that may be deemed necessary to protect the public safety. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>he does have a serious alcohol problem, he has been abstinent since January 20, 2000. At that time he went into detox at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore for 8 or 4 days. From there he went to Reality House in Laurel for 45 days. From there he moved to a Transitional Rehabilitative Residence (TRR) for 14 months. Since leaving the TRR he has been attending 2 to 3 AA meetings per week and has stayed alcohol free.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The MVA disputes that this issue is not yet ripe, and classifies that which petitioner deems a failure to <em>process </em>the license application, as an actual <em>denial </em>of petitioner\u2019s license application. According to the MVA, its denial of the license application relegates petitioner\u2019s demand for an investigation irrelevant. The MVA notes that petitioner \u201cchallenged the authority of the MVA to deny his application under [\u00a7 16-103.1], thereby initiating the contested case presently before this Court\u201d (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The occurrence which we have been asked to review has already taken place and \u201c[t]his Court has defined a justiciable controversy as one wherein \u2018there are interested parties asserting adverse claims <em>upon a state of facts which must have accrued </em>wherein a legal decision is sought or demanded.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boyds Civic Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County Council, </em>309 Md. 683, 690, 526 A.2d 598, 601 (1987) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Patuxent Oil Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs of Anne Arundel County, </em>212 Md. 543, 548, 129 A.2d 847, 849 (1957) (quoting 1 W.H. Anderson, <em>Actions for Declaratory Judgments </em>\u00a7\u00a7 17 (2d ed.1951))). Moreover, we are confronted with the issue of a possible conflict between statutes applicable to petitioner and applied by respondent, and their dispute as to the proper application of the statutes is a recognition of the existence of a contested case and, indeed, places the issues squarely before us. Thus, our review is appropriate because \u201cthere is either an actual existing controversy, or antagonistic claims which indicate inevitable litigation, or when a party asserts a legal status or right and there is a denial by an adversary party, and the court is satisfied that such a decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>will serve to terminate the controversy.\u201d <em>Eberts v. Congress\u2019l Country Club, </em>197 Md. 461, 465, 79 A.2d 518, 519 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">B. License Disqualifications</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The statutory provision containing the disqualification from licensure of a person whose driving privileges are revoked elsewhere emerged in 1970 as part of the Legislature\u2019s comprehensive repeal and reenactment of Maryland\u2019s Motor Vehicles Laws. <em>See </em>1970 Md. Laws, Chap. 534. This disqualification, as found in the former Md.Code (1970), Art. 66/6 \u00a7 6-103(2), stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\u201c\u00a7 6-103. What persons shall not be licensed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">The department shall not issue any license under this subtitle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">2. To any person whose license has been suspended, refused, or cancelled, during the suspension, refusal, or cancellation, or to any person whose license has been revoked.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">Later, in 1977, the Legislature repealed Article 66)6 and reenacted it as Titles 11 through 27 of the Transportation Article. <em>See </em>1977 Md. Laws, Chap. 14. The license disqualification provisions were left largely intact and were supplemented also to bar licensure to anyone whose license had been <em>revoked. </em>The relevant portion of the statute appeared as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">\u201c\u00a7 16-103.1. Persons not to be licensed \u2014 Disqualifications.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">The Administration may not issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-13\">(1) During any period for which his license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Owing to ambiguity in the manner in which the word \u201clicense\u201d is defined in the Transportation Article,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Legislature in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 209, clarified and augmented \u00a7 16-103.1(1) to articulate the intent that the disqualification apply both to Maryland and to out-of-state licensees whose license had been revoked, suspended, refused or canceled, and to provide an exception allowing restricted licensure under certain circumstances. The Floor Report and Bill Analysis accompanying 1993 Md. Laws, Chap. 209, indicated that the definition of \u201clicense\u201d as the privilege to drive in Maryland obscured whether the provisions of \u00a7 16.103.1 applied to a person whose license had been revoked, suspended, refused or canceled in another jurisdiction. The bill was intended to codify the MVA\u2019s <em>de facto </em>policy of not issuing a license to any such disqualified individuals, to provide the MVA with clear authority to refuse to license such persons, and to eliminate any confusion in the law. This revision reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u201c\u00a7 16-103.1. [Persons not to be licensed] \u2014 Disqualifications.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">The Administration may not issue a driver\u2019s license to an individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">(1) During any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked, suspended, refused, or canceled <em>in this or any other state, </em>unless the individual is eligible for a restricted license under \u00a7 16-113(e)[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] of this subtitle....\u201d [Alteration added.] [Emphasis added.] [Footnote added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>C. The Driver License Compact</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In recognition of the interaction of motor vehicle laws among states and the possibility for conflicting outcomes, the Maryland Legislature passed 1987 Md. Laws, Chap. 320 to become a part of the Driver License Compact. Chapter 320\u2019s introductory statement reveals the underlying legislative intent for entering the Driver License Compact and reads, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cFOR the purpose of providing for the State of Maryland to enter into a certain driver license compact with other jurisdictions in the United States; providing for the reporting and effect of certain convictions; prohibiting the Administration from assessing points against an individual under certain circumstances; requiring the Administration to assess points against an individual under certain eircum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>stances; <em>prohibiting issuance of a driver\u2019s license under certain circumstances; </em>providing for the applicability of certain other laws.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The legislative intent is further highlighted by the statement of changes brought about by the bill as indicated in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee\u2019s Bill Analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201cBy this bill, the State of Maryland adopts the Driver License Compact. The Compact is a comprehensive interstate agreement designed to promote compliance with motor vehicle laws in the party states and to make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility more just and equitable. The Compact provides, among other things, lor comity among the party states in issuing licenses and for cooperation in reporting convictions of motor vehicle offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">D. Petitioner\u2019s License Revocations</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Petitioner urges that the intent of the Compact, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cto give the MVA clear authority to refuse to issue a driver\u2019s license to a person whose driver\u2019s license has been suspended, revoked, refused or canceled in another jurisdiction,\u201d can be honored by the MVA\u2019s giving effect to an out-of-state revocation for one year before a licensee can apply for a Maryland license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, petitioner contends that although his fourth DUI prompted permanent revocation of his driver\u2019s license in Florida, according to the language of the Compact Art. IV,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>DUI offenses, in respect to his application for licensure in Maryland, must be treated as if they occurred in Maryland.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201c[I]t is clear that the State of Maryland did not intend for out of state revocations to be mandatory in this State, for periods of time longer than would have been imposed had the crime occurred in Maryland. Such an argument is contrary to Maryland policy and the intent of the legislature .... The MVA has failed to show that the legislative intent was to give greater weight to the laws of foreign jurisdictions than to the laws of Maryland, by barring a Maryland citizen from obtaining a license in this State pursuant to a lifetime revocation in another state, when the same offense had it occurred in Maryland would have resulted in a much lighter sanction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In essence then, as described by the trial court, petitioner believes that \u201c[bjecause \u00a7 16-103.1 broadly disqualifies any person who currently has a revoked license in another state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>without consideration of the comparable penalties in Maryland,\u201d the laws are in conflict. Thus, notwithstanding that a fourth DUI offense in Maryland leads to a minimum of two year\u2019s license revocation, petitioner would have us read \u00a7 16-103.1 as applying a less stringent penalty of one year\u2019s revocation, <em>via </em>the Compact\u2019s provisions, when an individual whose license has been revoked by another jurisdiction becomes a Maryland resident and seeks licensure in this State.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Petitioner relies extensively on <em>Welch v. Alabama Dep\u2019t. of Pub. Safety, </em>519 So.2d 517 (Ala.1987), for the proposition that the Compact should take precedence over related state law. In <em>Welch, </em>the Supreme Court of Alabama examined whether Alabama, a Compact state, could \u201cissue a license before the expiration of a revocation period imposed by the State of an applicant\u2019s former residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517. Mr. Welch had his Florida license revoked for five years following his second DUI conviction. Upon moving to Alabama thirteen months after his Florida revocation, Welch\u2019s application for an Alabama driver\u2019s license was denied by the Alabama Driver License Division of the Department of Public Safety and Welch\u2019s attorney was informed that Welch would be required to obtain a letter of clearance <em>from </em>Florida <em>before </em>he would be granted a license. Welch brought suit, seeking an investigation to declare him a safe driver. The circuit court sided with the Division and Welch appealed. The intermediate appellate court looked to Ala.Code 1975 \u00a7 32-6-7, which states, \u201c \u2018A driver\u2019s license shall not be issued to the following persons: ... (3) Any person whose driving right or privilege is revoked ....\u2019\u201d and interpreted Alabama\u2019s enactment of the Compact as incorporating extraterritorial revocations, a finding that the Supreme Court of Alabama found to be erroneous. Id. at 519. After considering Art. V(2) of the Compact addressing \u201cApplication for New Licenses,\u201d the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Court of Alabama determined that the Compact\u2019s language did not intend to incorporate \u201cextraterritorial revocations, which are entirely outside the control of the legislature of [Alabama]. [T]he reading applied ... such an interpretation would make any revocation by a Compact state, however severe, binding on the licensing authority of [Alabama].\u201d <em>Welch, </em>519 So.2d at 519 (alterations added). In reversing the intermediate appellate court, the Alabama high court went on to determine that the phrase, \u201cif permitted by law,\u201d found in Article V(2), required the licensing authority to look \u201cto the revocation made by the former licensing state. If the revocation is still in force under its own terms, an application for a new license could <em>never </em>be permitted by law ... until the original revocation expires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>petitioner offers <em>Welch </em>and several other cases<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in support of his argument that the Compact requires \u201ca state\u2019s licensing bureau to issue a license to a driver who is revoked in another state.\u201d The MVA responds that the cases necessarily invoke the peculiarities of a particular state\u2019s law and are, therefore, inapplicable to the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>case. We are not persuaded by <em>Welch </em>and the other cited cases. The Alabama statute in <em>Welch </em>regarding license disqualification lacks the explicit language \u201cin this or any other state\u201d that is found in Md.Code \u00a7 16-103.1 and which clearly encompasses extraterritorial revocations. As we have discussed, the \u201cin this or any other state\u201d qualifier was added to \u00a7 16-103.1 in 1993 in order to dispel any uncertainty as to the MVA\u2019s authority to refuse to license an applicant whose driving privileges are suspended, revoked, refused or canceled in another jurisdiction. In addition, petitioner concedes that licensure in Maryland would not terminate his permanent Florida revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The MVA urges that petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the interplay of \u00a7 16-103.1 and \u00a7 16-703 is incomplete. The trial court summarized the MVA\u2019s position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\u201c[T]he words \u2018if permitted by law\u2019 are intended to harmonize Maryland requirements for a license with the uniformity efforts made by states entering the Compact.... [W]hen a driver has his license revoked in another jurisdiction, only after one year may he apply in Maryland, <em>and </em>only if Maryland law permits such an application. In this case, \u00a7 16-103.1 unambiguously prohibits issuance of a license to a person whose license is presently revoked in another state. The MVA also claims this has been the long-standing interpretation of the two statutes. It concludes, suggesting that its position is more accurate because it compels drivers with blemished out-of-state records to clear those records before applying in Maryland; such a preliminary cleansing of out-of-state driving records was an intention of the drafters of the Compact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The parties to the instant appeal propose our acceptance of competing views of statutory intent. Accordingly, we must examine the statutes before us, the Driver License Compact, \u00a7 16-703, as well as \u00a7 16-103.1, in terms of the larger statutory scheme, namely, the promotion of safety through the recognition of both our State\u2019s and extraterritorial motor vehicle laws. Neither the Compact, nor \u00a7 16-103.1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>stands on its own and \u201cwe do not read particular language in a statute in isolation or out of context; rather, we construe statutory language in light of the Legislature\u2019s general purpose and in the context of the statute as a whole.\u201d <em>State v. Crescent Cities Jaycees Found., Inc., </em>330 Md. 460, 468, 624 A.2d 955, 959 (1993); <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124,132, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). \u201c[W]here statutes relate to the same subject matter, and are not inconsistent with each other, they should be construed together and harmonized where consistent with their general object and scope.\u201d <em>Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 10, 497 A.2d 142, 146 (1985), <em>Crescent Cities Jaycees, </em>330 Md. at 468, 624 A.2d at 959. We accept the presumption that the Legislature intended that which it enacted and \u201c[n]either statute should be read ... so as to render the other, or any portion of it, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>GEICO, </em>332 Md. at 132, 630 A.2d at 717; <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 222, 804 A.2d 426, 428 (2002); <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 524, 636 A.2d 448, 452 (1994); <em>Tracey v.

Our interpretation of a statute should \u201cseek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106, 112 (1994); <em>Comptroller of Treasury v. Fairchild Indus., Inc., </em>303 Md. 280, 288, 493 A.2d 341, 345 (1985). Moreover, principles of statutory construction dictate that \u201cwhere the language of a statute is clear, courts may not insert or omit words to make the statute express an intention not evident in its original form.\u201d <em>Bridges, </em>304 Md. at 10-11, 497 A.2d at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We observed in <em>Toler v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>373 Md. 214, 817 A.2d 229 (2003) (finding that a licensed driver for whom driving constituted a significant part of employment may accumulate sixteen points before the MVA may suspend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>that individual\u2019s license) that \u201c \u2018if the true legislative intent cannot readily be determined from the statutory language alone,\u2019 we may look to other indicia of that intent, including the structure of the statute, how it relates to other laws, its legislative history, its general purpose, and the \u2018relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220, 817 A.2d at 233 (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525-26, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)). Finally, \u201c[i]n our endeavor to harmonize the provisions of all of the relevant statutes, this Court will prefer an interpretation that allows us to avoid reaching a constitutional question.\u201d <em>Bank of America v. Stine, </em>379 Md. 76, 86, 839 A.2d 727, 733 (2003); <em>see East Prince Frederick Corp. v. County Board of Comm\u2019rs, </em>320 Md. 178, 182, 577 A.2d 27, 29 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Our reading of the Compact and of \u00a7 16-103.1 compels us to agree with the MVA\u2019s assessment of the two statutes. That is, \u00a7 16-103.1 authorizes the State of Maryland to recognize non-Maryland issued suspensions, revocations, refusals or cancellations by refusing to issue licenses for persons in those statuses, and to so recognize such suspensions, etc., does not create a conflict with the provisions of the Driver License Compact. The MVA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cNo conflict exists between [ ] \u00a7 16-103.1(1) and the Compact when the savings clause, \u2018if permitted by law,\u2019 in [ ] \u00a7 16-703 V(2) is given effect and interpreted to say what it clearly says: that a driver revoked in one party state will be eligible for licensure in a different party state one year after the revocation took effect, so long as he is otherwise permitted to do so by the laws of that party state. Giving effect to the words in V(2) \u2018if permitted by law\u2019 carries out the presumption that the legislature intended both statutes to be harmonized to give full effect to each. Indeed, ignoring the modifying terms \u2018if permitted by law\u2019 renders that language meaningless and superfluous.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">This Court finds nothing in the wording of \u00a7 16-103.1 to indicate that it was intended to be subordinated to the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>pact, nor do we find any statement in the language of the Compact found at \u00a7 16-703 to evidence an intent that the Compact was intended to supercede what may be viewed as more stringent state motor vehicle laws. Moreover, it is illogical to presume that the Legislature intended with its entry as a Compact state to make Maryland a safe harbor for extraterritorial drivers who have incurred harsh penalties in their home state for motor vehicle violations. The MVA echoes this sentiment, observing that the Compact was not intended to encourage \u201cthe worst and most dangerous drivers to avoid the consequences of their conduct by simply moving into another party state.\u201d As the trial court observed, the Legislature\u2019s intent in specifically inserting into \u00a7 16-103.1 the phrase, \u201cin this or any other state\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201cwas to recognize and respect extraterritorial revocations. This language serves two rational purposes. First, it provides recognition of extraterritorial revocations beyond that which the Compact recognizes. Second, the language of \u00a7 16-103.1 provides the MVA with a mechanism to recognize revocations of non-Compact states and deny issuance of a license on that basis. Under [petitioner\u2019s] interpretation of these statutes, revocations from Compact states would have no prohibitive force and effect in Maryland after one year, while revocations from non-Compact states would have force and effect for a period of time consistent with the statute in the non-[C]ompact state. This was not the intent of the General Assembly in adopting the Compact.\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We are likewise persuaded of the viability of the MVA\u2019s interpretation in light of two other provisions found in the Compact. First, \u00a7 16-703, Art. I, articulates an express intent that an applicant\u2019s out-of-state driving record be considered prior to licensure. Article 1(b)(2) reads, in relevant part: \u201c(b) It is the policy of each of the party states to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">(1) Promote compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the jurisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(2) Make the reciprocal recognition of licenses to drive and eligibility therefor more just and equitable by considering the overall compliance with motor vehicle laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license by reason of which the licensee is authorized or permitted to operate a motor vehicle in any of the party states.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In addition, \u00a7 16-703, Art. VI, addresses the Applicability of Other Laws:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cExcept as expressly required by provisions of this Compact, nothing contained herein shall be construed to affect the right of any party state to apply any of its other laws relating to licenses to drive to any person or circumstance, nor to invalidate or prevent any driver license agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a party state and a nonparty state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">This language indicates that the Compact is not intended to supercede the application of other- \u2014 possibly more stringent\u2014 motor vehicle laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The MVA properly denied petitioner\u2019s application for a Maryland driver\u2019s license based on the language of Md.Code (1977, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 16-103.1(1) of the Transportation Article, which prohibits the MVA from issuing a driver\u2019s license \u201c[djuring any period for which the individual\u2019s license to drive is revoked ... in this or any other state.\u201d This provision clearly intended to encompass revocations of the license of both Maryland and out-of-state drivers. Section 16-103.1(1) does not conflict with the provisions of the Driver License Compact, Md.Code (1977, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 16-703 of the Transportation Article, which allows a licensee, revoked elsewhere, to apply for a Maryland license after the expiration of one year of the out-of-state revocation. The intent of these enactments was to advance motor vehicle safety and the stricter Maryland laws do not undermine the provisions of the Compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">. Petitioner appears to have received one DUI conviction in either Arkansas or Illinois in November 1976, and received DUI convictions in Florida in 1972, 1975 and 1984. Although there is indication in his Florida Driver History Record that the 1976 DUI offense occurred in Arkansas, the parties have indicated that the 1976 DUI resulted in revocation of petitioner\u2019s Illinois license. It is unclear where petitioner was living at that time. The 1984 conviction, when petitioner was presumably a Florida resident, was petitioner\u2019s fourth, and under Florida law, the result is permanent license revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The MVA provided in its brief a synopsis of the history of Florida's permanent revocation statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201cUntil 1998, Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 322.28(2)(e) and 322.271(4) (1997) provided that a person whose license was permanently revoked, based on four or more convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol, might be reinstated after 5 years with restrictions, if the person could demonstrate specific conditions and remedial treatment. <em>State Dep't of Highway Safety &amp; Motor Vehicles v. Fountain, </em>[883] So.2d 300, 301 (Fla.App.1Dist.2004). Florida amended \u00a7 322.271(4) in 1998 to delete this option for drivers permanently revoked for four or more DUI\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>In 2003 the Florida Supreme Court found the amendment unconstitutional for violating the same subject matter bill requirement. For a time between that date and the date the Florida legislature reenacted the amendment, the statute prior to the change remained in effect. Persons subject to permanent revocation for DUI again had an opportunity to apply under the prior statute for reinstatement on conditions. <em>Id. </em>The Florida legislature properly reenacted the amendment [effective July 1, 2003], <em>Id., </em>so at this time the provision for reinstatement is not available.\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">There is no indication that petitioner sought reinstatement of his Florida driver\u2019s license during any of the periods when reinstatement was available to him. The currently enacted Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 322.28, effective July 1, 2003, states, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-10\">\"322.28.

We realize that petitioner\u2019s Florida revocation occurred more than twenty years ago, but as petitioner apparently made no efforts at reinstatement during those two decades, it is somewhat irrelevant that his <em>particular </em>revocation actually lasted more than one year or two years.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\">. These cases, from other Compact states, include <em>Bray v. Department of Pub.

Vargason, </em>607 N.W.2d 691, 698 (Iowa 2000) (holding that driver whose privileges had been revoked in Iowa for six years and permanently in Florida was eligible for a restricted driver\u2019s license only through the district court and not through the motor vehicle agency but also finding that Iowa's specific disqualification \"statute does not preclude the issuance of an Iowa driver's license, if permitted by Iowa law, after a one-year period following the out-of-state revocation\u201d); and <em>People v. Hutson, </em>178 Ill.App.3d 836, 128 Ill.Dec. 40, 533 N.E.2d 1128, 1129 (1989) (finding that, under the Compact, the revocation of an Illinois licensee, who moved to Iowa, properly obtained an Iowa license and then moved back to Illinois where he was arrested while driving with expired Iowa license, was terminated by the Iowa license issuance and stating that \"to find otherwise would arbitrarily assign an inferior position to persons reli- . censed in a foreign Compact state\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
