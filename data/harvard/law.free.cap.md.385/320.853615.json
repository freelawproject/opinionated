Trial on the matter of custody subsequently took place on July 1 and 2, 2003. The circuit court issued its decision on September 8, 2003, awarding the maternal grandparents sole legal and physical custody of the child based upon that court\u2019s finding that Ms. Dougherty was \u201cunfit,\u201d and, <em>although not finding Mr. McDermott an \u201cunfit\u201d </em>parent, the court found that his employment in the merchant marine, requiring him to spend months-long intervals at sea, constituted \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d as that term was defined in <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 191, 372 A.2d 582, 593 (1977) <em>(\u201cHoffman\u201d), </em>and the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d and need for a stable living situation thus warranted that custody be placed with the Doughertys. Mr. McDermott appealed this decision to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the lower court\u2019s decision in an unreported April 5, 2004, opinion. The intermediate appellate court subsequently denied Mr. McDermott\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration on May 21, 2004, and thereafter he petitioned this Court for a Writ of Certiorari, which we granted on August 25, 2004. <em>McDermott v. Dougherty, </em>382 Md. 688, 856 A.2d 724 (2004).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Petitioner\u2019s appeal centers on the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201c1. Is concern that the parent might not obtain employment and remain in the state of Maryland a high enough concern to meet the \u2018only to prevent harm or potential harm to the child\u2019 standard required by the U.S. Supreme Court case of <em>Troxel v. Granville </em>and/or the high standards referenced in the previous cases cited therein, 530 U.S. 57[, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 147 L.Ed.2d 49] (2000)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">2. Do the facts involved in this case constitute \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 as described in <em>Shurupoff v. Vockroth, </em>372 Md. 639[, 814 A.2d 543] (2003)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">3. Does the Order in this case violate the holding of the Maryland case of <em>Schaefer v. Cusack, </em>124 Md.App. 288[, 722 A.2d 73] (1998), which is that custody must be decided based on the circumstances as they are now and not based on a future plan or conjecture or based on past behavior that has ceased?\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We hold that in disputed custody cases where private third parties are attempting to gain custody of children from their natural parents, the trial court must first find that both natural parents are unfit to have custody of their children or that extraordinary circumstances exist which are significantly detrimental to the child remaining in the custody of the parent or parents, before a trial court should consider the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard as a means of deciding the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We further hold that under circumstances in which there is no finding of parental unfitness, the requirements of a parent\u2019s employment, such that he is required to be away at sea, or otherwise appropriately absent from the State for a period of time, and for which time he or she made appropriate arrange<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ments for the care of the child, do not constitute \u201cextraordinary or exceptional circumstances\u201d to support the awarding of custody to a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Accordingly, we shall reverse and direct the lower courts to grant custody of Patrick to petitioner. Although we find the declaration, announced by the plurality opinion in Troxel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> affirming \u201cthe fundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children,\u201d 530 U.S. 57, 66, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000), to be instructive, our determination also rests upon the potential for absurd results that might result from a holding that denies custody to a fit and willing parent on the basis that the means by which he or she supports himself or herself and his or her family calls for his or her periodic absence from the State although having arranged suitable and safe alternative care for the child, or based upon the fact that the child, in a particular case, might be \u201cbetter raised\u201d by grandparents. With our holding we need not reach the issue of whether the circuit court\u2019s order in the case <em>sub judice </em>improperly examined past behavior or future plans in deciding custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">By the time of the current dispute there had been a lengthy series of events in the dispute over the custody of Patrick Michael McDermott, born April 30, 1995, to Charles David McDermott and Laura A. Dougherty, who were married on November 26, 1994, in Baltimore County and subsequently took up residence in Abingdon, Maryland. Their relationship having deteriorated, the spouses separated shortly after Patrick\u2019s birth. Suffice it to say, between the time this custody disagreement was launched by Mr. McDermott\u2019s September 29, 1995 filing, in the Circuit Court for Harford County, of his Complaint for Limited Divorce, Child Custody and Child Support from Ms. Dougherty, and the grandparents\u2019 February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>2002 complaint for third-party custody, <em>i.e., </em>the action to which the instant appeal can be most directly traced, the various parties, whether represented by counsel or proceeding pro se, utilized the full measure of the court\u2019s resources in their filings of petitions and motions in regard to support and custody of Patrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Ms. Dougherty, who had some history of alcohol-related trouble, was convicted of her fourth drinking and driving offense in November 2001, which ultimately would result in a period of incarceration. On January 3, 2002, apparently just prior to her incarceration, Ms. Dougherty, who then had primary residential custody of Patrick, signed a power of attorney giving her parents, the Doughertys, authority to care for Patrick and make all decisions on his behalf. Apparently unaware of Ms. Dougherty\u2019s incarceration, Mr. McDermott filed a motion on January 8, 2002, seeking a temporary modification of a November 8, 2001, custody order and stated in his reasons for the petition, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cThe mother has left town, given power of attorney to parents and quit her job. Ms. Dougherty is scheduled for sentencing on 3/15/02 for up to 24 months. I am unemployed currently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">He requested that custody be shared by himself and the maternal grandparents. Sometime prior to January 10, 2002, and possibly as early as early December 2001, petitioner signed on to work a six-month seaman\u2019s contract at sea. Mr. McDermott executed a notarized letter on January 9, 2002, stating his desire that Patrick remain in the care and custody of the Doughertys at their home in Joppa, Maryland, through the end of the 2001-2002 academic year. In addition, Mr. McDermott wrote a letter, which appears to be dated January 10, 2002, to Patrick\u2019s court-appointed attorney and indicated that Mr. Dougherty, Patrick\u2019s grandfather, had responded that he and his wife did not know Ms. Dougherty\u2019s whereabouts when queried by Mr. McDermott.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Apparently, after Mr. McDermott went to sea, the court signed an order to show cause in response to his Temporary Motion/Petition to Modify Custody and scheduled the matter for a show-cause hearing on January 14, 2002, requiring that the child\u2019s mother as well as the Doughertys be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">Mr. McDermott departed on his ship in the first half of January 2002. While it is not manifest that any subterfuge occurred, it seems that petitioner went to sea believing that Ms. Dougherty still had legal custody of the child and not knowing of her incarceration or of the scheduled hearing on his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">At some point in time, what formerly had been a cooperative relationship between Mr. McDermott and the Doughertys deteriorated. The Doughertys\u2019 counsel apparently spoke with Mr. McDermott by telephone on January 14, 2002, while the latter was aboard ship, and informed him that Ms. Dougherty had begun a jail sentence on or about January 4, 2002. In affirming this conversation as well as Mr. McDermott\u2019s apparent consent that both sets of grandparents share joint legal custody of Patrick, the Doughertys\u2019 counsel prepared and filed in the Circuit Court for Harford County on February 12, 2002, a Complaint for Third-Party Custody and Motion for an Ex-parte Order, naming the Doughertys, as well as the McDermotts, Patrick\u2019s paternal grandparents, as plaintiffs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The paternal grandparents later noted, however, that they \u201cnever signed a document to be plaintiffs in this case, and have had a strained relationship with the Dougherty\u2019s [sic] during the period January to July 2002\u201d when Mr. McDermott was at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">On February 13, 2002, the court signed an order providing that the grandparents, the Doughertys and the McDermotts, would share \u201ctemporary joint legal custody\u201d and the Doughertys would have residential custody of Patrick. Visitation by the parents \u2014 one of whom was in jail, and the other at sea at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>the time \u2014 was ordered to \u201ctake place at the mutual convenience and approval of plaintiffs,\u201d <em>ie., </em>the Doughertys.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Mr. McDermott returned from sea in early July 2002 and the Doughertys, without any modification of the court\u2019s custody order, apparently returned Patrick to Mr. McDermott shortly thereafter to mollify the child\u2019s sustained entreaties and crying that he wanted to be with his father. Patrick remained with his father for the duration of 2002. On July 25, 2002, petitioner filed a Complaint for Modification of Custody seeking to be granted permanent primary residential and legal custody of Patrick. The Doughertys, labeling Patrick\u2019s living with his father at the time as \u201cde facto\u201d custody, sought to dismiss the complaint stating that they were \u201cunsure as to Mr. McDermott\u2019s ability to care for the child on a daily basis and believe that it is in the best interest of the child that custody not be changed .... \u201d Petitioner\u2019s parents, who at the time shared legal custody with the Doughertys, agreed with petitioner\u2019s request for a change of legal custody to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">At a pre-trial conference in November 2002, the matter was set down for trial in May 2003 but trial was later delayed until July 2003. The circuit court advised Mr. McDermott to hire an attorney to represent him in his petition for custody, and accordingly, Mr. McDermott hired his present attorney in December 2002 and went to sea in early 2003 in order to \u201cmake the money to pay for [a custody] attorney\u201d (alteration added). Apparently, Patrick lived with the Doughertys during his father\u2019s time at sea in the early months of 2003. Mr. McDermott returned to Maryland in March 2003 during his two-week break between ship assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Ms. Dougherty, petitioner\u2019s former wife, filed a Motion to Modify Custody on May 23, 2003, seeking to remove Patrick from her parents\u2019 custody,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> citing that they withheld visitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>were \u201cverbally and psychologically abusive to the child\u201d and \u201c[b]oth of the child\u2019s natural parents are able and willing to take care of Patrick.\u201d On June 18, 2003, Mr. McDermott responded in opposition to his former wife\u2019s motion. He filed an answer, an amended complaint for custody and also apparently sought back child support from Ms. Dougherty as well as trial costs and an estimated $18,000 in legal fees that he expected to incur at the scheduled trial. The circuit court did not immediately rule on these and other outstanding motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Trial in the matter of Mr. McDermott\u2019s request for permanent custody took place on July 1 and 2, 2003. The parties presented both lay and expert testimony regarding Ms. Dougherty\u2019s and Mr. McDermott\u2019s respective fitness as parents. Mr. McDermott indicated that he went to sea in January 2003 in order to bolster his finances in his effort to obtain sole custody of Patrick and he intended to establish permanent residence in Maryland if granted full custody. He noted that he and Patrick were then residing with a family in Port Deposit, an atypical, though presently workable and harmonious, living situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">The maternal grandparents stated that they had decided to contest custody because they believed that Patrick needed stability in his life and over the past four years they had been the only consistently stable presence for the child. Upon the trial\u2019s conclusion, the circuit court held the matter <em>sub curia, </em>and stated that the current order, <em>i.e., </em>that of February 13, 2002, remained in effect. The parties continued to jostle for custody while the ruling remained pending in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The circuit court issued a memorandum opinion and order on September 8, 2003, granting sole legal and physical custody of Patrick to the Doughertys. The court expressed its doubt at the veracity of Mr. McDermott\u2019s stated intentions to remain in Maryland and stated in its finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">\u201cBased on the analysis of the above [Ross <em>v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 191, 372 A.2d at 593] factors, the court concludes that Ms. Dougherty is unfit to have custody at this time, and that exceptional circumstances exist that overcome the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>sumption that Patrick\u2019s best interest is served <em>by </em>custody in Mr. McDermott. In particular, because the court is unable to rely upon Mr. McDermott\u2019s representations that he intends to obtain employment and remain in Maryland, it would appear, to Patrick\u2019s detriment, that stability in his living arrangements would be jeopardized.\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">On September 16, 2003, Mr. McDermott, through his counsel, filed simultaneously a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment contending that the circuit court\u2019s opinion was contrary to existing federal and state ease law and a notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The circuit court denied petitioner\u2019s motion. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision on April 5, 2004, with an unreported decision that incorporated the circuit court\u2019s detailed recitation of the considerable procedural history of this case. Petitioner sought reconsideration from the intermediate appellate court, but was denied on May 21, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">A. Fundamental Constitutional Parental Right to Raise One\u2019s Children</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">One of the earlier United States Supreme Court cases<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in respect to parental rights, and one that has been described in subsequent cases as seminal, is the case of <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), albeit it does not concern the rights of third parties. It is important primarily for its language, which stressed the importance of family in our society. Nebraska, apparently as a reaction to World War I war, enacted a statute that forbade the teaching of the German language to children who had not yet reached the eighth grade.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>In the process of holding the statute unconstitutional, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201cThe problem for our determination is whether the statute as construed and applied unreasonably infringes the liberty guaranteed to the plaintiff in error by the Fourteenth Amendment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u2018No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201cWhile this court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. <em>Without doubt, </em>it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, <em>establish a home and bring up children, </em>to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cFor the welfare of his Ideal Commonwealth, Plato suggested a law which should provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">\u2018That the wives of our guardians are to be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child, nor any child his parent.... The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u201cIn order to submerge the individual and develop ideal citizens, Sparta assembled the males at seven into barracks and intrusted their subsequent education and training to official guardians. <em>Although such measures have been deliberately approved by men of great genius their ideas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>touching the relation between individual and state were wholly different from those upon which our institutions rest; and it hardly will be affirmed that any Legislature could impose such restrictions upon the people of a state without doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Constitution.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"><em>Meyer, </em>262 U.S. at 399-402, 43 S.Ct. at 626-28 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">One of the early cases citing to <em>Meyer, supra, </em>was <em>Pierce v. Society of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary, </em>268 U.S. 510, 530, 45 S.Ct. 571, 572-73, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), involving the Oregon Compulsory Education Act. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cAfter setting out the above facts, the Society\u2019s bill alleges that the enactment conflicts with the right of parents to choose schools where their children will receive appropriate mental and religious training, the right of the child to influence the parents\u2019 choice of a school ... and is accordingly repugnant to the Constitution and void.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cUnder the doctrine of <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>we think it entirely plain that the Act of 1922 unreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control .... The child is not the mere creature of the state; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.\u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">In a case not exactly on point in a dispute between natural parents that involved competing state jurisdictions, <em>i.e., </em>whether one state had the power to modify the custody determination of another state, the Court in <em>New York v. Halvey, </em>330 U.S. 610, 613, 67 S.Ct. 903, 905, 91 L.Ed. 1133 (1947), opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-U\">\u201cUnder Florida law the \u2018welfare of the child\u2019 is the \u2018chief consideration\u2019 in [cases between natural parents] shaping the custody decree or in subsequently modifying or chang<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ing it. But \u2018the inherent rights of parents to enjoy the society and association of their offspring, with reasonable opportunity to impress upon them a father\u2019s or a mother\u2019s love and affection in their upbringing, must be regarded as being of an equally important, if not controlling, consideration in adjusting the right of custody as between parents in ordinary cases.\u2019 \u201d [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In the 1970\u2019s the United States Supreme Court wrestled with a series of cases that, although not always directly concerning custody issues, continued to recognize the importance of the rights of parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651-58, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1210-16, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972), the Court was considering an Illinois statute that mandated that, upon the death of a mother, the unmarried [to that mother] natural father had no right to a hearing on custody. The statute mandated that in such cases the children of the deceased mother automatically became dependents of the state. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">\u201cStanley presses his equal protection claim here. The State continues to respond that unwed fathers are presumed unfit to raise their children and that it is unnecessary to hold individualized hearings to determine whether particular fathers are in fact unfit parents before they are separated from their children. We granted certiorari, to determine whether this method of procedure by presumption could be allowed to stand in light of the fact that Illinois allows married fathers \u2014 whether divorced, widowed, or separated \u2014 and mothers \u2014 even if unwed \u2014 the benefit of the presumption that they are fit to raise their children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">\u201cThe private interest here, that of a man in the children he has sired and raised, undeniably warrants deference and, absent a powerful countervailing interest, protection. It is plain that the interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his or her children \u2018come[s] to this Court with a momentum for respect lacking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>when appeal is made to liberties which derive merely from shifting economic arrangements.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cThe Court has frequently emphasized the importance of family. The rights to conceive and raise one\u2019s children have been deemed \u2018essential,\u2019 <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, </em>\u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma, </em>316 U.S. 535, 541, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 1113, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), and \u2018[r]ights far more precious ... than property rights,\u2019 <em>May v. Anderson, </em>345 U.S. 528, 533, 73 S.Ct. 840, 843, 97 L.Ed. 1221 (1953). \u2018It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\u2019 <em>Prince v. Massachusetts, </em>321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). The integrity of the family unit has found protection in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Ninth Amendment, <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, </em>381 U.S. 479, 496, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201cDespite <em>Bell </em>and Carrington,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it may be argued that unmarried fathers are so seldom fit that Illinois need not undergo the administrative inconvenience of inquiry in any case, including Stanley\u2019s. The establishment of prompt efficacious procedures to achieve legitimate state ends is a proper state interest worthy of cognizance in constitutional adjudication. But the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency.

Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978), was a factually unusual case, and is one of, if not the only, case in which the Supreme Court upheld the sole use of the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard in regard to the third-party placement of children, although at the same time it opined that <em>if a parent were fit </em>it would generally be constitutionally prohibited to take custody from that parent on the basis of the \u201cbest interest of the child.\u201d First, the father had never wed the mother and the child had been raised by her mother and stepfather; second, it was an adoption case; third, it was the stepfather who was seeking to adopt the child and the stepfather had been married to the child\u2019s mother for the nine years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>prior to the petition for adoption; and fourth, the natural father only sought the power to veto the adoption unless he was first declared to be unfit which had not happened and he did not want custody for himself. It appears under those circumstances that the Court almost considered that the natural father had waived or forfeited his constitutional rights as a natural father, although the Court did not specifically so state. The father also claimed that the law in Georgia that permitted a natural father who had been wed to the mother to veto adoptions, but did not afford the same veto right to a natural father who had not been married to the mother, was unconstitutional in that it denied him the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Because the trial court had used \u201cbest interests\u201d language that was then used by the state appellate court opinion, that language also ended up in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. The Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201cThe trial court denied appellant\u2019s petition, and thereby precluded him from gaining veto authority, on the ground that legitimation was not in the \u2018best interest of the child\u2019; appellant contends that he was entitled to recognition and preservation of his parental rights absent a showing of his \u2018unfitness.\u2019 Thus, the underlying issue is whether, in the circumstances of this case and in light of the authority granted by Georgia law to married fathers, appellant\u2019s interests were adequately protected by a \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">\u201cWe have little doubt that the Due Process Clause would be offended \u2018[i]f a State were to attempt to force the breakup of a natural family, over the objections of the parents and their children, <em>without some showing of unfitness and for the sole reason that to do so was thought to be in the children\u2019s best interest.\u2019 </em>But this is not a case in which the unwed father at any time had, or sought, actual or legal custody of his child. Nor is this a case in which the proposed adoption would place the child with a new set of parents with whom the child had never before lived. Rath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>er, the result of the adoption in this case is to give full recognition to a family unit already in existence, a result desired by all concerned, except appellant. <em>Whatever might be required in other situations, </em>we cannot say that the State was required in this situation to find anything more than that the adoption, and denial of legitimation, were in the \u2018best interests of the child.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\"><em>Quilloin, </em>434 U.S. at 254-55, 98 S.Ct. at 554-55 (citation omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Interestingly, a year later the Court addressed a similar issue as to equal protection significantly differently, also in an adoption case, albeit based upon gender discrimination claims.

The unwed father has no similar control over the fate of his child, even when his parental relationship is substantial \u2014 as in this case. <em>He [under the statute </em>] <em>may prevent the termination of his parental rights only by showing that the best interests of the child would not permit the child\u2019s adoption by the petitioning couple.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201cDespite the plain wording of the statute, appellees [the natural mother and stepfather] argue that unwed fathers are not treated differently under [the statute] from other parents. According to appellees, the consent requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>of [the statute] is merely a formal requirement, lacking in substance, as New York courts find consent to be unnecessary whenever the best interests of the child support the adoption. Because the best interests of the child always determine whether an adoption petition is granted in New York, appellees contend that all parents, including unwed fathers, are subject to the same standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">\u201cAppellees\u2019 interpretation ... finds no support in New York case law.

Accordingly, it is clear that [the statute] treats unmarried parents differently according to their sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201cThe question before us, therefore, is whether the distinction in [the statute] between unmarried mothers and unmarried fathers bears a substantial relation to some important state interest. Appellees assert that the distinction is justified by a fundamental difference between maternal and paternal relations \u2014 that \u2018a natural mother, absent special circumstances, bears a closer relationship with her child ... than a father does.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cIn sum, we believe that [the statute] is another example of \u2018overbroad generalizations\u2019 in gender-based classifications.

In <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 747-67, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 1391-402, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982), the Court discussed the importance of the fundamental rights of parents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201cToday we hold that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment demands more than this [the preponderance standard]. Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">The Court went on to give its reasons, reasons based upon the fundamental rights of parents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cThe fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life. If anything, persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protection than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs. When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\u201cAt the factfinding, the State cannot presume that a child and his parents are adversaries. <em>After the State has established parental unfitness at that initial proceeding, </em>the court may assume at the <em>dispositional </em>[this emphasis in original], stage that the interests of the child and the natural parents do diverge.... But until the State proves parental unfitness, the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship. Thus, at the factfinding, the interests of the child and his natural parents coincide to favor use of error-reducing procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\u201cThe [state] court\u2019s theory assumes that termination of the natural parents\u2019 rights invariably will benefit the child. Yet we have noted above that the parents and the child share an interest in avoiding erroneous termination. Even accepting the court\u2019s assumption, we cannot agree with its conclusion that a preponderance standard fairly distributes the risk of error between parent and child. Use of that standard reflects the judgment that society is nearly neutral between erroneous termination of parental rights and erroneous failure to terminate those rights. For the child, the likely consequence of an erroneous failure to terminate is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>preservation of an uneasy status quo. For the natural parents, however, the consequence of an erroneous termination is the unnecessary destruction of their natural family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">\u201c \u2018[T]he State registers no gain towards its declared goals when it separates children from the custody of <em>fit </em>parents.\u2019 \u201d [Citations omitted.] [Footnotes omitted.] [Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\"><em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983), was another unique case. The unwed natural father had not received notice of an adoption case in respect to his child and accordingly did not appear and thus never proffered any testimony as to his contact with the children. Based only on the appellee\u2019s evidence, the Court held that because the natural father had never established a significant relationship with the child, the failure of the lower court to give him notice of the adoption proceedings, even though the state had knowledge of his whereabouts, did not violate his constitutional rights, since the natural father could have guaranteed receipt of notice by sending a postcard to some registry. Justice White, dissenting, with Justices Marshall and Blackmun joining, pointed out that the majority was making assumptions as to the nature of the father\u2019s relationship with the child, without the father ever having had a chance to present evidence in respect to that relationship. Even in holding against the father, the majority nonetheless recognized the importance of parental rights, quoting from its cases, <em>supra, </em>before, in essence, nullifying his status as the natural father because it found that he had not established a sufficient relationship with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\"><em>Reno v.

Detained minor aliens who were subject to deportation by INS, by reason of certain statutes, were treated differently than de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>tained minors held for \u201cexclusion.\u201d Apparently, the deportable minor aliens were not swiftly turned over to others, but rather kept in detention for extended periods of time.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court described the issue: \u201cOver the past decade, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS or Service) has arrested increasing numbers of alien juveniles who are not accompanied by their parents or other related adults. Respondents, a class of alien juveniles so arrested and held ... contend that the Constitution and immigration laws require them to be released into the custody of \u2018responsible adults.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id, </em>at 294, 113 S.Ct. at 1443. In resolving the issue, the Court compared the situation to the matters of custody in respect to natural parents of citizens. Perhaps, as dicta, given the nature of the particular case, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201cAlthough respondents [the alien minors] generally argue for the categorical right of private placement discussed above, at some points they assert a somewhat more limited constitutional right: the right to an individualized hearing on whether private placement would be in the child\u2019s \u2018best interests\u2019 \u2014 followed by private placement if the answer is in the affirmative. It seems to us, however, that if institutional custody (despite the availability of responsible private custodians) is not unconstitutional in itself, it does not become so simply because it is shown to be less desirable than some other arrangement for the particular child. \u2018The best interests of the child,\u2019 a venerable phrase familiar from divorce proceedings, is a proper and feasible criterion for making the decision as to which of two parents will be accorded custody. But it is not traditionally the sole criterion \u2014 much less the sole <em>constitutional </em>criterion \u2014 for other, less narrowly channeled judgments involving children, where their interests conflict in varying degrees with the interests of others. Even if it were shown, for example, that a particular couple desirous of adopting a child would <em>best </em>provide for the child\u2019s welfare, the child would nonethe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>less not be removed from the custody of its parents so long as they were providing for the child <em>adequately. </em>Similarly, \u2018the best interests of the child\u2019 is not the legal standard that governs parents\u2019 or guardians\u2019 exercise of their custody: So long as certain minimum requirements of child care are met, the interests of the child may be subordinated to the interests of other children, or indeed even to the interests of the parents or guardians themselves.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 303-04,113 S.Ct. at 1448 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In <em>M.L.B. v.

The appellant, an indigent mother, had her appeal of the termination of her parental rights dismissed because she lacked the money to pay the fees. The issue was whether the fundamental rights of parents were sufficiently strong, making the statute, or its application to an indigent parent, unconstitutional. The Court found for the mother.

Accordingly, we shall also examine it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In <em>Troxel, </em>a mother desired to limit her children\u2019s visitation with the parents of their deceased father, a man to whom she had never been married. The paternal grandparents invoked a Washington statute that permitted any person to petition the superior court for visitation rights of any child at any time, and gave discretion to the court to grant visitation when in the best interest of the children, without regard to any change in circumstances. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 60, 120 S.Ct. at 2057. After the trial court ordered visitation with the grandparents in excess of the mother\u2019s desires, she appealed to Washington\u2019s intermediate appellate court, which reversed the lower court, stating that the grandparents lacked standing unless a custody action was pending. <em>Id. </em>at 62, 120 S.Ct. at 2058. The Washington Supreme Court affirmed, holding the non-parental visitation statute invalid, but based its decision on substantive due process grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 63, 120 S.Ct. at 2058. The grandparents appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which affirmed, holding that the statute on which the superior court had based its order awarding visitation to the paternal grandparents unconstitutionally interfered with the mother\u2019s \u201cfundamental right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of her\u201d children. <em>Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 72, 120 S.Ct at 2063. In criticizing the trial court\u2019s \u201cslender findings\u201d in support of its visitation order, the United States Supreme Court faulted the statute\u2019s failure to accord sufficient deference to the parent\u2019s interests, and, as the Maryland Court of Special Appeals in a decision issued less than a month after <em>Troxel, </em>further critiqued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cthat the [trial court] decision placed the burden on the parent to prove that grandparent visitation was not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>child\u2019s best interest; and that there was no requirement that the parent be shown to be unfit.

Accordingly, <em>Troxel </em>is further instructive as to this case insofar as it recognizes the parent\u2019s fundamental right to direct his or her children\u2019s care, custody and control, <em>see Troxel, </em>530 U.S. at 65, 120 S.Ct. at 2060, and it impliedly rejects the substitution of a judge\u2019s opinion that a particular child would be better raised in a situation a trial judge prefers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Our courts have left little doubt of the importance placed on the parent-child relationship. As this Court recently stated in <em>Shurupoff v.

In a situation in which both parents seek custody, each parent proceeds in possession, so to speak, of a constitutionally-protected fundamental parental right. Neither parent has a superior claim to the exercise of this right to provide \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of the children. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 5-203(d)(2) of the Family Law Article.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Effectively, then, each fit parent\u2019s constitutional right neutralizes the other parent\u2019s constitutional right, leaving, generally, the best interests of the child as the <em>sole standard </em>to apply to these types of custody decisions. Thus, in evaluating each parent\u2019s request for custody, the parents commence as presumptive equals and a trial court undertakes a balancing of each parent\u2019s relative merits to serve as the primary custodial parent; the child\u2019s best interests tips the scale in favor of an award of custody to one parent or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Where the dispute is between a fit parent and a private third party, however, both parties do not begin on equal footing in respect to rights to \u201ccare, custody, and control\u201d of the children. The parent is asserting a fundamental constitutional right. The third party is not. A private third party has no fundamental constitutional right to raise the children of others. Generally, absent a constitutional statute, the non-governmental third party has no rights, constitutional or otherwise, to raise someone else\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>B. Best Interests of the Child in the Absence of Parental Unfitness and Extraordinary or Exceptional Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The arguments and outcome of the instant case in no way alter the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard that governs courts\u2019 assessments of disputes <em>between fit parents </em>involving visitation or custody. We have frequently and repeatedly emphasized that in situations where it applies, it is the central consideration. <em>See Wilhelm v. Wilhelm, </em>214 Md. 80, 84, 133 A.2d 423, 425 (1957) (stating succinctly and conclusively in regard to the best interests standard, that \u201c[i]t seems unnecessary to cite additional authority in support of this firmly established rule\u201d). So critical is the best interests standard that it has garnered superlative language in the many cases in which the concept appears: This Court labeled it \u201cof transcendent importance\u201d in <em>Dietrich v. Anderson, </em>185 Md. 103, 116, 43 A.2d 186, 191 (1945), as the \u201cultimate test\u201d in <em>Fanning v. Warfield, </em>252 Md. 18, 24, 248 A.2d 890, 894 (1969), and as the \u201ccontrolling factor\u201d in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 113, 642 A.2d 201, 208 (1994). <em>See also Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 175, n. 1, 372 A.2d at 585 n. 1 (providing a more complete survey of the various descriptions of the best interest standard). Although the child\u2019s well-being remains the focus of a court\u2019s analysis in disputes between fit parents, \u201c[t]he best interests standard does not ignore the interests of the parents and their importance to the child. We recognize that in almost all cases, it is in the best interests of the child to have reasonable maximum opportunity to develop a close and loving relationship with each parent.\u201d <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 220, 721 A.2d 662, 669 (1998) (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">C. Standards for Custody Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">When considering the application of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard it is essential to frame the different situations in which it is attempted to be applied. First, and certainly the most important application of the standard, is in disputes between fit natural parents, each of whom has equal constitutional rights to parent. In those cases the dispute can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>be resolved best if not solely, by an application of the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d standard. This situation most often arises in marriage dissolution issues between natural parents and it is necessary to resolve the matters of custody and visitation between two constitutionally equally qualified parents. Although the Court is unaware of any compilation of numbers, it can reasonably be supposed that the vast majority of cases throughout the country in which the \u201cbest interest of the child standard\u201d is applied, or sought to be applied, are of this nature. When these cases are subtracted from the total universe of custody and visitation cases, there remains a much smaller number of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">The second most frequent situation in which that standard has been applied is, we believe, in the various types of state proceedings in which the states are injecting themselves into the parenting situation in the exercise of their generally recognized power to protect the child. In various jurisdictions, and sometimes in different cases within the same jurisdiction, the standard applied, after recognizing the power of the state to intervene in the case by reason of unfitness or circumstance, is an avoidance of harm to the child or a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard, and often both standards. Most often the best interest standard becomes applicable after a finding that it is necessary to protect the child who is being exposed to harm by the parental unit. When these numerous eases are subtracted from the total number of custody and visitation dispute cases, the remainder of the cases fit into an even smaller category.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">This category is generically referred to as \u201cthird-party\u201d custody disputes, <em>i.e., </em>persons other than natural parents or the State attempting, directly or indirectly, to gain or maintain custody or visitation in respect to the children of natural parents. In some states, third-party issues arise in actions involving those states\u2019 use of guardianship, <em>i.e., </em>custody actions appear to be titled sometimes as guardianship actions although they are in essence custody actions. In some states the actions are titled as habeas corpus actions, in some states the third party seeks custody through intervention in a domes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tic action between the natural parents (as in the present case), and in some states the third party initiates a separate action titled in some other manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Even within the third-party subset of custody actions there are further differences. Some states have conceptualized the idea of physiological parents, third parties who have, in effect, become parents and thus, the case is considered according to the standards that apply between natural parents. This further reduces the number of pure third-party cases. The pure third-party cases are further narrowed in some jurisdictions by \u201cfailure of adoption\u201d cases, in which, upon the \u201cfailure of adoption,\u201d a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard may be applied. In still other pure third-party cases, in respect to the standard to be used, all parties seeking custody of children are designated as third parties. In that situation there are no constitutional rights involved (although in some cases constitutional claims are made using terms such as \u201cpsychological parent\u201d and the like) and the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard is generally applied. There are also those cases which we would otherwise call pure third-party cases, except that the natural parents did not raise the issue of their fundamental constitutional right to parent in that particular case and the courts accordingly did not address it. These cases further reduce the body of cases that we shall discuss. Indeed, other types of situations may further reduce the number of pure third-party cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">In any event, in comparison with the total number of cases in which attempts are made to utilize the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard, or it is used, the number of pure third-party cases, such as the present case, is relatively small. It is on these remaining cases throughout the country, that we primarily focus our attention.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">We have been able to separate the cases (and the states) into three categories. First, those that utilize, as the ultimate determining factor, the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard (which ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>pears to be the minority view). Second, those cases (and the states) that appear to use some type of hybrid standard or have utilized language in the opinions that support both the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard and the \u201cunfit parent\u201d and/or \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard. We shall refer to these cases as the hybrid view. The third category of cases, which appear to be the majority of the cases and the states, hold that, in this limited class of pure third-party custody cases (the category of the present case), that the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard is inappropriate unless the finder of fact <em>first </em>finds that the natural parents are unfit, the natural parents by their conduct have waived or lost their \u201cconstitutional protections,\u201d or there is a finding of extraordinary, exceptional, or compelling circumstances that require the court to remove the child from the natural parents in order to protect the child from harm. It is only if the parents are unfit, or if there is some exceptional circumstance exposing the child to harm, that the child may be removed from the custody of the parents. If a preliminary finding of parental unfitness or extraordinary circumstances is made, the court is then faced with what to do \u25a0with the child. In only that context, then, after such preliminary findings are proved, may the custody of the child be based on a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard. This last standard appears to be the majority view in the United States and, until very recently, likely was the Maryland position, albeit the language of our cases over the years has not been altogether clear. To the extent we may not have explicitly previously adopted the majority view in third-party custody cases in this state, we do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">We shall discuss, for the most part, only the pure third-party cases since the early 1970\u2019s \u2014 the era when the Supreme Court, in various types of cases, re-emphasized the constitutional rights of parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">1. Minority View</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">We start with what we consider to be the minority view: the states that apply the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard, and generally only, or ultimately, this standard, in spite of some dicta in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>cases to the contrary.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> These states appear to be Colorado, Illinois,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Pennsylvania and West Virginia (although there are contrary cases in West Virginia).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In 1981 the Supreme Court of Illinois, in <em>In re Custody of </em>Townsend, 86 Ill.2d 502, 56 Ill.Dec. 685, 427 N.E.2d 1231 (1981), overturned the granting of custody to a third party (the sister of the child) over the protest of the child\u2019s natural father who had not been married to the natural mother.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Although the court considered the father\u2019s presumptive rights, it included language which, it can be argued, place Illinois in the minority column: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 508, 56 Ill.Dec. 685, 427 N.E.2d at 1234 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). <em>See also In re the Estate of K.E.S. and J.M.S., Minors, </em>347 Ill.App.3d 452, 461, 283 Ill. Dec. 76, 807 N.E.2d 681, 688 (2004), decided on somewhat different grounds, but stating nonetheless, that \u201c[t]he most important consideration in child custody disputes is the best interest of the child\u201d (alteration added). The intermediate appellate court relied primarily on its own cases, but did cite at one point to the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Townsend </em>decision. <em>But see In re Petition of Kirchner, </em>164 Ill.2d 468, 208 Ill.Dec. 268, 649 N.E.2d 324 (1995), a failure of adoption case which contains some contrary language and <em>In re Custody of Peterson, </em>112 Ill.2d 48, 96 Ill.Dec. 690, 491 N.E.2d 1150 (1986), which sets the standard in Illinois that applies where the children in a nonparent/parent custody dispute are not in the custody of the natural parent. It requires a nonparent first to establish that the child is not in the custody of the natural parent before the custody dispute is determined based upon the \u201cbest interest\u201d test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201cIn child-custody disputes it is an accepted presumption that the right or interest of a natural parent in the care, custody and control of a child is superior to the claim of a third person. The presumption is not absolute and serves only as one of several factors used by courts in resolving the <em>ultimately controlling question of where the best interests of the child lie. </em>A court need not find that the natural parent is unfit or has forfeited his custodial rights before awarding custody to another person if the best interests of the child will be served.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>We include in the minority line of cases the very unusual West Virginia case of <em>Lindsie D.L. v. Richard W.S., </em>214 W.Va. 750, 591 S.E.2d 308 (2003), even though the third party seeking visitation was the half-sister of the child and was asserting her own alleged constitutional rights as a sibling. The child\u2019s natural father (who was not the father of the half-sister) objected, based upon his fundamental rights as a parent. The case had been dismissed below because the trial court had found that \u201cthere was no legal right of visitation with a minor half-sibling.\u201d The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals held: \u201c[W]e now conclude that Lindsie [the half-sister seeking visitation] may have a right to continued visitation with her half-sibling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 754, 591 S.E.2d at 312. It then remanded the case to the trial court for it first to \u201chear and determine whether or not visitation with her half-sister, Cassandra, is in the best interests of Lindsie [the half-sister seeking visitation] ... [and] also hear and determine whether such visitation is in the best interests of Cassandra [the sister with whom visitation was sought]. In making this determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>tion there is a presumption that [the natural father] is acting in the best interests of Cassandra.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756, 591 S.E.2d at 314 (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">In <em>In re the Custody of A.D.C., Child., </em>969 P.2d 708, 710 (Colo.App.1998), that court awarded custody to grandparents as against the natural mother. The court first described the pertinent issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201c[The natural] Mother further argues that due process and the legal presumption in favor of the biological parent require that a parent be awarded custody unless it is shown by clear and convincing proof that the child would suffer emotional or physical harm by such an award. Again, we disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cUnder [a Colorado statute] the determination of custody is expressly based upon the best interests of the child. Furthermore, due process does not require a showing of unfitness before custody may be awarded to a non-parent.\u201d [Alterations added.] [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in <em>Charles v. Stehlik, </em>560 Pa. 334, 341-42, 744 A.2d 1255, 1258-59 (2000), reaffirmed a prior decision when it opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cNext, Appellant [natural father] argues that Appellee [stepfather] should have been required not only to prove that there were convincing reasons as to why [the child] should remain with Appellee, but also that Appellant was an unfit parent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201cIn <em>Albright v.

We again emphasize that the standard seeks only to stress the importance of parenthood as a factor in determining the best interests of the child. However, other factors which have significant impact on the well ' being of the child can justify a finding in favor of the non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>parent, even though the parent has not been shown to have been unfit.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">\u201cWe see no reason to abandon our <em>Albright </em>holding.

Hybrid View<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Next we discuss the cases that contain language, that supports, so to speak, a composite of the majority and the minority views. In some instances it is difficult to determine where these particular states are in respect to the various views. In some of the cases, such as those from Vermont, the language also would support that state as being among the majority view that we shall later discuss. These states that we consider to be somewhere in the middle include the states of Oregon, Connecticut, Vermont, Washington, Missouri, Louisiana, Maine, Nevada, Arkansas, Nebraska, Texas, perhaps California and, currently, perhaps this state. In some of the states the cases are intermediate appellate court cases, and in some of the states various intermediate appellate decisions differ. In some, both positions are found within the same opinion. This is perhaps a result of the confusion that the term \u2018best interests\u2019 can generate when applied in differing contexts.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Although the court in the Vermont case of <em>In re S.B.L., </em>150 Vt. 294, 553 A.2d 1078 (Vt.1988), actually decided that an unmarried father of a child born out of wedlock did not enjoy the parental presumption of fitness, it utilized language that indicated that its position emphasized the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard. In essence, it first found that under Vermont law a father (not married to the mother) of a child was not consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ered to be the natural father and thus not entitled to the presumptions afforded a natural parent. Thus, it considered the dispute as between two third parties [to which the best interests test always applies]. The Vermont Supreme Court first noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">\u201cThe instant case is novel because it is presented as a custody fight between a father of a child born out of wedlock, and a person who is neither the spouse of that party nor a parent of the child over- whom custody is sought.

At this point the Vermont court noted in a footnote that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201cOur one precedent on the respective custody rights of parents and third parties was decided in 1926. Although the child in [that case] was in the care of a grandparent, the custody order awarded custody to the child\u2019s father.

The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">\u201cMoreover, the parental preference doctrine is only that \u2014 a preference \u2014 an advantage given to parents over other persons.

Instead, <em>in the extraordinary circumstance, </em>when there is a conflict, the best interest of the child has always been regarded as superior to the right of parental custody.

Her husband was paralyzed from an accident and could not work and the mother was trying to avoid going on welfare. While receiving treatment she was involuntarily committed to a state hospital and later she was committed to another treatment center. She spent approximately four months in the two institutions. While she was committed, her child was cared for first by a baby-sitter, and ultimately was adjudicated an \u201cuncared for\u201d child and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>placed with the Commissioner of Children and Youth Services, which in turn, placed the child with the same baby sitter for care.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Later, after sufficient recovery, the mother began efforts to regain custody of her child by filing suit against the Commissioner. Thereafter, the appropriate authorities determined that she was then fit to be a parent. Nonetheless, after further skirmishes, the Commissioner filed a separate petition to terminate her parental rights. Accordingly, this opinion is not a pure third-party case in that the state was the petitioning party.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In spite of the Maine (she had undergone recovery at her parent\u2019s house in Maine) authorities confirming that she was fit, the trial court ultimately denied the natural mother\u2019s petition for revocation, terminated her parental rights and designated the Commissioner as a statutory parent for the purpose of placing the child for adoption with the babysitter and her husband. In its opinion the Supreme Court of Connecticut stated that it was the position of the Commissioner that the department \u201cdisputed and still disputes, however, that return of the child to her mother was or is in the child\u2019s best interests because of the intervening attachment that formed between the child and her foster family during her mother\u2019s illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657, 420 A.2d at 880. The trial court had found for the Commissioner on that basis. In respect to the revocation of the child\u2019s commitment to the Commissioner, the court noted the statutory requirements and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cWhile it is certainly true ... that parents have no natural right to the custody of their children that can prevail over a disposition effecting the child\u2019s best interests, parents are entitled to the presumption, absent a continuing cause for commitment, that revocation will be in the child\u2019s best interest unless the state can prove otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">\u201cWe must reject the claim of so-called \u2018parental rights\u2019 theory under which \u2018the parent has rights superior to all others except when he is proved unfit.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 659-61, 420 A.2d at 881-82.

Savage, </em>254 Neb. 836, 580 N.W.2d 523 (1998), was a case in which third parties were attempting to adopt two children over the natural father\u2019s objection and over the objection of the natural mother who was attempting to revoke her consent to the adoption. When she had consented to the adoption she lied when she stated that she did not know who the father was and thus the natural father, Gomez, neither received notice nor consented to the adoption. The natural parents, although not married, had sporadically lived together and during those periods the natural father had partly sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ported the child. The natural father had married another woman by the time of the proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 848, 580 N.W.2d at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The children were subsequently placed with the Savages. Gomez contested the adoption by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus for the return of his children.

There are several other Nebraska cases which contain similar language, or merely find the natural parent unfit and go from there based upon the \u201cbest interests\u201d standard.

In <em>In re Custody of Shields, </em>120 Wash.App. 108, 120-28, 84 P.3d 905, 911-12 (2004), a post<em>Troxel </em>case, the intermediate court, in a stepparent/natural parent custody dispute, attempted to apply a standard it had created prior to <em>Troxel </em>to the <em>post-Troxel </em>case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">\u201cPrior to 1987, parent and nonparent custody actions were governed by [a specific Washington statute], which required courts to determine custody based on the best interests of the child. However, courts determining nonparent custody cases were reluctant to apply the best interests standard when determining custody as between a parent and a non-parent. <em>See In re Marriage of Allen, </em>28 Wash.App. 637, 626 P.2d 16 (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">\u201cThe <em>Allen </em>court concluded that courts determining custody between a parent and nonparent must apply a more stringent balancing test to protect both the parents\u2019 constitutional rights to privacy and the family entity. <em>Allen </em>held that the state may interfere with the parents\u2019 constitutional rights only if (1) the parent was unfit, or (2) \u2018the child\u2019s growth and development would be detrimentally affected by placement with an otherwise fit parent.\u2019 Significantly, the <em>Allen </em>court proposed the detriment to the child standard as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>a \u2018middle ground\u2019 requiring a showing more than best interests, but less than parental unfitness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-4\">\u201cIn summary, we reaffirm our agreement with <em>Allen </em>.... Nevertheless the requisite showing under <em>Allen </em>is substantial. While the detriment standard does not require a showing of parental unfitness, it does require a showing of actual detriment to the child\u2019s growth and development.\u201d [Alteration added.] [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-5\"><em>See also In re Custody of S.H.B., </em>118 Wash.App. 71, 74 P.3d 674 (2003), a contest for custody between two third parties (the paternal and maternal grandparents); <em>In re Marriage of Allen, </em>28 Wash.App. 637, 626 P.2d 16 (1981); <em>In re Welfare of Schulz, </em>17 Wash.App. 134, 561 P.2d 1122 (1977) (a termination case in which the court rejected grandparents\u2019 claim to custody).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">An intermediate appellate court in Missouri in the case of <em>M.P.M. v. Williams, </em>611 S.W.2d 274 (Mo.App.1980), determined that the natural father was entitled to custody over the claim of a stepfather. The court found both fathers to be fit. It stated: \u201cIt is well established that the parent has the superior right to the custody of his or her minor children as against third persons. This right will not be denied ... unless it is established that the parent is an unfit person or is unable to care properly for the minor children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 277-78 (citations omitted). <em>See also In re Marriage of Campbell, </em>685 S.W.2d 280 (Mo.App.1985), where a different Missouri intermediate appellate court found a father unfit and awarded custody to a third party stating the same standard as <em>M.P.M.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In <em>Chavez v. Chavez, </em>148 S.W.3d 449 (Tex.App.2004), a Texas intermediate appellate court, in a case where a third-party grandparent intervened in a divorce case seeking to have a conservatorship created in respect to the children of the marriage, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201cFor the court to award managing conservatorship to a non-parent ... the non-parent must prove ... that appoint<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ing the parent as a managing conservator would result in serious physical or emotional harm to the child. There must be evidence to support the logical inference that some specific, identifiable behavior or conduct of the parent will probably cause that harm. \u201cFurther, it is wholly inadequate to simply present evidence that a non-parent would be a better choice as custodian of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">\u201cThus, the grandparents here had to establish either (1) it was not in the children\u2019s best interest for Liliana to be appointed as a managing conservator <em>because </em>it would significantly impair the children\u2019s physical health or emotional development; or (2) Liliana voluntarily relinquished actual care, control, and possession of the children to the grandparents for a least one year .... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 458-59 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">There are several intermediate appellate decisions from various California courts in which a California visitation statute was challenged on constitutional grounds. At least one of the appellate circuits has held the statute constitutional, but that case notes that \u201cat least four California appellate opinions have found section 3102 unconstitutional .... \u201d <em>Fenn v. Sherriff, </em>109 Cal.App.4th 1466, 1477, 1 Cal.Rptr.3d 185 (2003). The four opinions in which the statute was declared unconstitutional were from different appellate circuits. Our state may belong in either, or both, of the other categories. For that reason we have placed it with the hybrid states for the purposes of this opinion. All the language of the Maryland cases stress \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d language, but often do so in a manner that can be construed, in respect to third-party disputes, as just another way of ascribing to the majority view. In other words, some language, sometimes in the same case, supports both views. All of the adoption cases seem to stress the \u201cbest interest\u201d language, exclusively; as do, of course, the cases between natural parents and those between only third parties. Likewise, the language is used extensively where the State is involved in actions affecting the natural parents\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>rights. While the same language is always used in third-party cases involving attempts to assert rights over natural parents, other language in some of those cases appears to support the majority position, albeit always including \u201cbest interest\u201d language as well. For example, in one of our seminal cases involving third-party/natural parent contests, <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 175-79, 372 A.2d 582 (1977), we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A55\">\u201cThe best interest standard controls when the dispute ... is between his biological father and mother. It also controls when the dispute over custody is between a biological parent and a third party.... In parent-third party disputes, however, there is a twist to the application of the best interest standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u201cNevertheless, there persists in this State in a contest over the custody of a child, but always subject to the best interest standard, that part of the common law concept which declares that the right of either parent is ordinarily superior to that of anyone else.... In <em>Ross v. Pick, supra, </em>199 Md. [341] at 351[, 86 A.2d 463 (1952) ], we set out this principle in the form of a presumption.... In <em>Ross v. Pick, supra, </em>199 Md. at 351, 86 A.2d 463, we pointed out that the ordinary entitlement of parents to the custody of their minor children ... is not an absolute one and declared that the right \u2018may be forfeited where it appears that any parent is unfit to have custody of a child, or where some exceptional circumstances render such custody detrimental to the best interests of the child.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\u201cTo recapitulate: the best interest of the child standard is always determinative in child custody disputes. When the dispute is between a biological parent and a third party, it is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest is subserved by custody in the parent. That presumption is overcome and such custody will be denied if (a) the parent is unfit to have custody, or (b) if there are such exceptional circumstances as make such custody detrimental to the best interest of the child. <em>Therefore, in parent-third party disputes over custody, it is only upon a determination by the equity court that the parent is unfit or that there are exceptional circum</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number><em>stances which make custody in the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child, that the court need inquire into the best interest of the child in order to make a proper custodial </em>disposition.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> [Bolding added.] [Cita- . tions omitted.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The language of <em>Hoffman </em>that we have emphasized and bolded, when compared with the rest of the language as to the \u201cbest interest\u201d standard appears to create a conundrum of sorts. If the custody is always to be ultimately determined by what is in the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child then the parents\u2019 fitness or extraordinary circumstances have no place in the discussion. In our view, the \u201cbest interest\u201d language of <em>Hoffman, </em>with the presumptions and conditions attached to it, can be interpreted as consistent with the majority view, <em>i.e., </em>in third-party cases there must first be a finding of parental unfitness or extraordinary circumstances before custody can be transferred to a third party based on a \u201cbest interest\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Numerous of this state\u2019s appellate cases since <em>Hoffman, </em>if not all of them, can be traced back to that case. For instance, the <em>Ross v. Hoffman </em>language was discussed extensively in the Court of Special Appeals case of <em>Lipiano v. Lipiano, </em>89 Md.App. 571, 577-78, 598 A.2d 854, 857 (1991), where that court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">\u201cThe principles governing the judicial resolution of child custody disputes between biological parents and other persons were set forth in <em>Ross </em>.... Summarizing its several conclusions, the Court there held, at 178-79[, 372 A.2d 582]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATe\">\u2018To recapitulate: the best interest of the child standard is always determinative in child custody disputes [here that court quotes the same language from <em>Ross </em>we have quoted above].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">\u201cThe language used by the <em>Ross </em>Court is clear and precise. It does not envisage there being degrees of third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>parties \u2014 \u2018natural\u2019 parents who are not biological parents, \u2018equitable\u2019 parents, and others. Certainly, the closeness of the relationship between the child and the non-biological parent is of considerable importance, but that importance relates to whether there are exceptional circumstances which would make an award of custody to the biological parent detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">In a true \u201cbest interest\u201d jurisdiction, the standard would be applied directly to the child as it is in the minority jurisdictions, such as Pennsylvania, Colorado, perhaps Oregon and other states. <em>Hoffman </em>has been extensively cited throughout our most recent case of <em>Shurupoff v. Vockroth, </em>372 Md. 639, 814 A.2d 543 (2003), in which we quote most of the above language from <em>Hoffman. </em>We also stated in that case, addressing evidentiary standard issues, but also noting the language problem we have previously discussed, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">\u201cTo some extent, these differences may account for some of the language used by the courts in describing the standard of proof applicable in those cases. Maryland law is somewhat ambiguous. On the one hand, Maryland Code, \u00a7 5-203(a)(2) of the Family Law Article, provides that a parent is the sole <em>natural </em>guardian of his or her minor child if the other parent dies, abandons the family, or is incapable of acting as parent. On the other, we have not viewed custody disputes between a surviving parent and a third party as in the nature of legal guardianship proceedings, but, subject to the <em>Ross v. Hoffman </em>analysis, as like any other custody case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\u201cSome States, as petitioner notes, have, indeed, adopted a clear and convincing evidence standard in parent/third party custody cases (or in cases that the court found equivalent to a custody dispute).

With that additional language, if it stands, Maryland has gone from, questionably, the majority view in this country as to private third-party custody actions to clearly the minority view. That was not the intention of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">We shall hold, as we indicated in the beginning of our opinion, that, generally, in private actions in which private third parties are attempting to gain custody of children of natural parents over the objection of the natural parents, it is necessary first to prove that the parent is unfit or that there are extraordinary circumstances posing serious detriment to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the child, before the court may apply a \u201cbest interest\u201d standard. With this clarification, Maryland will be consistent with the majority view in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">It appears, as we now view it, that the original qualifying language in <em>Hoffman </em>as to third-party cases, is closer to, although not squarely within, the majority view than to the minority view.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">3. Majority View</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We now discuss the majority view, <em>ie., </em>because of the presumption that natural parents are fit to raise their children and/or because natural parents have a fundamental constitutional right to raise their children, or both, there must first be a finding that the natural parents are unfit, or extraordinary circumstances detrimental to the welfare of the child must first be determined to exist, before the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d test may be applied when private third-parties dispute custody with natural parents. The majority view, in one manifestation or another, prevails in at least the following states: New Jersey, Iowa, Ohio, New York, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arkansas, Maine, Alaska, Kansas, South Dakota, North Dakota, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia, Florida, Indiana, Utah, probably Idaho, and until, arguably, recently, Maryland. The Supreme Court of New Jersey would also place Arizona, Missouri, California, Washington and New Hampshire in the majority category. With the case <em>sub judice, </em>Maryland returns to the majority category.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Because it has furnished a comprehensive view of the case law on the issue of the rights of natural parents <em>vis-a-vis </em>third parties, we shall commence this discussion with a relatively recent case from the Supreme Court of New Jersey, <em>Watkins </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>v.

In contrast, under the standard urged by Justice Stein, custody would be awarded to a third party if the child\u2019s growth and development would be \u2018detrimentally affected\u2019 by placement with a parent. <em>Post </em>at 290, 748 A.2d at 589 (Stein, J., dissenting). It appears that he is urging a camouflaged child\u2019s best interest standard. The use of such a standard to decide custody disputes between a fit parent and a third party will evolve into a \u2018fitness contest\u2019 whose outcome will depend on the whims of the trial court. Application of Justice Stein\u2019s \u2018detrimentally affected\u2019 standard to this case reveals only that it might be detrimental to Chantel to be raised by Larry when compared to the Nelsons. He then concludes that the Nelsons might possibly be better parents than Larry. The danger inherent in that approach is that it permits reallocation of children by the judiciary \u2014 a system that would undoubtedly victimize poor people. <em>See </em>Carolyn Curtis, <em>The Psychological Parent Doctrine in Custody Disputes Between Foster Parents and Biological Parents, </em>16 Colum. J.L. &amp; Soc. Probs., 149, 155 (1980). The standard that we adopt has as its benchmark the welfare of the child while at the same time protecting parental rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The New Jersey court then stated the majority view, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-7\">\u201cTo recapitulate, it is the relationship of the child to the person seeking custody that determines the standard to be used in deciding the custody dispute. When the dispute is between two fit parents, the best interest of the child standard controls.... But, when the dispute is between a fit parent and a third party, only the fit parent is presumed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>be entitled to custody.... Viewed in that context, in custody determinations between a fit parent and a third party, as opposed to claims made between two fit parents, the child\u2019s best interests become a factor <em>only after the parental termination standard has been met, rather than the determinative standard itself.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cThe standard that controls a custody dispute between a third party and a parent involves a two-step analysis. The first step requires application of the parental termination standard<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> or a finding of \u2018exceptional circumstances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cIf either the statutory parental termination standard or the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 prong is satisfied, the second step requires the court to decide whether awarding custody to the third party would promote the best interests of the child.... That said, the point to be emphasized is that the best interest of the child cannot validly ground an award of custody to a third party over the objection of a fit parent without an initial court finding that the standard for termination of the rights of a non-consenting parent or the \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 prong has been satisfied.

The court noted that the natural parent was claiming that she had not been found unfit and accordingly the trial court should not have granted custody to the grandparent. The court opined noting that, \u201cwhen a third person seeks to deprive a parent of custody, she cannot do so without <em>first </em>proving that the parent is not a suitable person to have the child\u201d (emphasis added). Later, in an opinion consistent with <em>Schuh, </em>in an intermediate appellate court case in which the state sought to terminate parental rights in favor of the grandparents, <em>Robbins v. State, </em>80 Ark.App. 204, 208, 92 S.W.3d 707, 710 (2002),<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> that court opined, \u201cAs a general rule, there must be a finding of unfitness of the natural parents in order to give custody to a third party.\u201d A different Arkansas intermediate appellate court appears to have departed somewhat from the <em>Schuh </em>holding. In <em>Dunham v. Doyle, </em>84 Ark.App. 36, 40, 129 S.W.3d 304, 307 (2003), the court stated, <em>inter alia </em>that, \u201cWhile there is a preference in custody cases to award a child to its biological parent, that preference is not absolute. Rather, of prime concern, and the controlling factor, is the best interest of the child\u201d (citation omitted). We presume the controlling law in Arkansas is its Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Schuh </em>opinion, albeit it is fifteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The Nevada high court opined, in at least two earlier cases, <em>Norris v. Graville, </em>95 Nev. 71, 589 P.2d 1024 (1979) and <em>Cole v. Dawson, </em>89 Nev. 14, 504 P.2d 1314 (1973) that, \u201cthe policy of this state is to award custody to a parent, in preference to a nonparent, unless the parent is found to be unfit.\u201d <em>Norris, </em>95 Nev. at 73, 589 P.2d at 1025.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In two separate later cases the Supreme Court of Nevada, while apparently attempting to establish what constituted situations contrary to the welfare of the child, discussed a Nevada standard that appears to be its application of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d First, in <em>Locklin v. Duka, </em>112 Nev. 1489, 1495-96, 929 P.2d 980, 934 (1996), the court stated in reliance on opinions of other states, including Maryland\u2019s <em>Ross v. Hoffman, supra, </em>in regard to what constitutes \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d that, \u201c[w]e therefore hold that in Nevada, extraordinary circumstances sufficient to overcome the parental preference presumption are those circumstances which result in serious detriment to the child.\u201d Then, apparently further protecting parental rights, that court held that even after the parental presumption has been rebutted by the showing of serious detriment to the welfare of the child, the court must then still go on to consider the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d before depriving a parent of custody: \u201cWe also conclude, consistent with the law in New York and Wisconsin, that when considering the two-part test ... the best interests of the child must still be considered, even after a finding of extraordinary circumstances that overcome the parental preference presumption.\u201d <em>Locklin, </em>112 Nev. at 1496, 929 P.2d at 935. The <em>Locklin </em>court focused only on what constituted \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d and left intact that state\u2019s parental fitness test that it had restated a few months prior in <em>Litz v. Bennum, </em>111 Nev. 35, 888 P.2d 438 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201cWe conclude that the parental preference policy is a rebut-table presumption that must be overcome either by a showing that the parent is unfit or other extraordinary circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThe Bennums argue that <em>Fisher v. Fisher, </em>99 Nev. 762, 670 P.2d 572 (1983), deemphasizes the parental preference doctrine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cTherefore, the <em>Fisher </em>court did not change the fact that the parental preference doctrine is a presumption that must be overcome if the parent is fit. Instead, the <em>Fisher </em>court emphasized that when it clearly appears that the child\u2019s welfare requires a change of custody, then the natural parent presumption may be overcome. However, this court has made it clear that the \u2018best interests of the child is usually served by awarding his custody to a fit parent.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFB\"><em>Litz, </em>111 Nev. at 38, 888 P.2d at 440 (some citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The Supreme Court of Alabama recently placed that state clearly in the majority category when it stated in <em>Ex parte . N.L.R, </em>863 So.2d 1066, 1068-69 (Ala.2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201cThis Court recently stated the standard a trial court <em>must apply </em>in a custody dispute between a parent and a nonparent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u2018This Court established the standard a trial court must apply in a custody dispute between a parent and a non parent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">\u201c \u2018The prima facie right of a natural parent to the custody of his or her child, as against the right of custody in a nonparent, is grounded on the common law concept that the primary parental right of custody is in the best interest and welfare of the child as a matter of law. <em>So strong is this presumption, absent a showing of voluntary forfeiture of that right, that it can be overcome only by a finding, supported by competent evidence, that the parent seeking custody is guilty of </em>... <em>misconduct or neglect to a degree which renders that parent an unfit and improper person to be entrusted unth the care and upbringing of the child in question.\u2019 \u201d \u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201cTherefore, <em>before </em>the trial court could properly award custody to the maternal grandmother, the trial court had to find N.L.R \u2018unfit\u2019 to be entrusted with the custody of his children. However, the trial court instead found N.L.R. \u2018to be <em>fit </em>to have custody.\u2019 This finding clearly precluded, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>matter of law, the award of custody to the maternal grandmother.\u201d [Citation omitted.] [Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In <em>Kay v. Rowland, 285 </em>S.C. 516, 517, 331 S.E.2d 781-82, 781 (1985), the Supreme Court of South Carolina, citing to <em>McDowell v. Richardson, </em>279 S.C. 268, 305 S.E.2d 577 (1983), opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cIn <em>McDowell, </em>we held it was error to award custody to a grandparent absent a finding that the natural parent was unfit. Thus, we recognized the superior rights of a natural parent in a custody dispute with a third party. Once the natural parent is deemed fit, the issue of custody is decided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In <em>Hockstok v. Hockstok, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 238, 242, 246, 247, 781 N.E.2d 971, 975, 979 (2002), the Supreme Court of Ohio addressed the pertinent issues in a paternity case. It first noted a statute that provided that if a court found that it was in the best interests of a child for neither natural parent to have custody, a court could give custody to a relative of the natural parents. The court nonetheless opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cAccordingly, we have held that in a child custody proceeding between a parent and nonparent, a court may not award custody to the nonparent \u201cwithout <em>first </em>determining that a preponderance of the evidence shows that the parent abandoned the child; contractually relinquished custody of the child; that the parent has become totally incapable of supporting or caring for the child; or that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child.\u2019 If a court concludes that any one of these circumstances describes the conduct of a parent, the parent may be adjudged unsuitable, and the state may infringe upon the fundamental parental liberty interest of child custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201cThus, a finding of parental unsuitability has been recognized by this court as a <em>necessary first step </em>in child custody proceedings between a natural parent and nonparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201cIn <em>In re Perales,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we held that since the issue of custody in that case did not arise from a divorce proceeding but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>rather from a dispute between a parent and a nonparent, the juvenile court erred in applying the best interest standard ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201cSuch an outcome [requiring a hearing where a natural parent has a right to contest unfitness] is consistent with the jurisprudence of this court that in custody cases between a natural parent and nonparent, a parental unsuitability determination must be made and appear in the record before custody can be awarded to a nonparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cAfter such a determination has established, or taken away, a parent\u2019s fundamental custodial rights, the focus must shift from the rights of the parents to the rights of the child.

Masitto, </em>22 Ohio St.3d 63, 488 N.E.2d 857 (1986). Ohio\u2019s intermediate appellate courts have opined similarly. <em>See In re Alyssa, </em>153 Ohio App.3d 10, 790 N.E.2d 803 (2003); <em>In re Adoption of Mays, </em>30 Ohio App.3d 195, 507 N.E.2d 453 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The Supreme Court of Alaska has addressed the issue in a case in which grandparents had intervened in a custody dispute between natural parents and were awarded custody over the objections of the natural parents. Much of the case concerns the evidentiary standards (preponderance or clear and convincing) that were applicable. That court also discussed the rule as to third-party custody in Alaska. In <em>Evans v. McTaggart, </em>88 P.3d 1078, 1083, 1085 (Alaska 2004), the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201cIn <em>Turner v. </em>Pannick<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> the question was whether the \u2018welfare of the child\u2019 requirement ... could be satisfied if the non-parent showed that the child\u2019s best interests would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>be served by awarding custody to the non-parent, or whether the non-parent must prove \u2018that it clearly would be detrimental to the child to permit the parent to have custody.\u2019 <em>Turner </em>held that the welfare of the child test could not be satisfied by a best interests showing and that what was required was a showing that parental custody would clearly be detrimental to the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201cWe thus hold that in order to overcome the parental preference a non-parent must show by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is unfit or that the welfare of the child requires the child to be in the custody of the non-parent. One element of the welfare of the child requirement is that the non-parent must show that the child would suffer clear detriment if placed in the custody of the parent.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In <em>In the Matter of the Guardianship of Williams, </em>254 Kan. 814, 818-26, 869 P.2d 661, 665-70 (1994), that court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">\u201cThe Kansas courts have long applied the best interests of the child test in resolving custody disputes between two fit parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">\u201cOn the other hand, it has long been the rule that the parental preference doctrine prevails when the dispute is between a parent and a third person, unless the parent is found to be unfit. The rule is succinctly stated ... as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u2018[A] parent who is able to care for his children and desires to do so, and who has not been found to be an unfit person to have their custody ... is entitled to the custody of his children as against the grandparents ... even though at the time ... such grandparents or others are giving the children proper and suitable care and have acquired an attachment for them.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-9\">\u201c[T]he court declared as unconstitutional a statutory provision which required the court to apply the best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>test instead of the parental preference doctrine in certain parent-nonparent custody disputes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201c \u2018[The natural mother] cannot be denied that right for the sole reason that a court determines and concludes that someone other than a natural parent might do a better job of raising the child, thus furthering his \u201cbest interests.\u201d \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\u201cThe best interests of the child test, which is asserted here by [the third-party guardian], has long been the preferred standard to apply when the custody of minor children is at issue between the natural parents of the child or children.

On the other hand, in a custody dispute between a parent and a third party, such as we have here, the focus is significantly different because the parties are not on par. Although the child\u2019s best interest is still of great impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>tance, it is <em>presumed </em>that it is in the best interest of the child to be placed in the custody of the parent. Consequently, a nonparent who seeks to displace the parent as custodian bears the burden of overcoming the parent\u2019s presumptively superior right to custody. This burden has been described to require a showing, by clear and cogent evidence, that the parent is unfit or has acquiesced in or voluntarily relinquished custody to the third party for such a long period of time that \u2018the affections of the child and the third party have become so interwoven that to sever them would seriously mar and endanger the future happiness of the child.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><em>McGuire, </em>487 N.E.2d at 460 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The intermediate appellate court in Utah similarly opined in <em>Duncan v.

Were that so, any third party who offered a better neighborhood, better school<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ing, more financial capability, or more stability would consistently prevail in obtaining custody in spite of a fit natural parent\u2019s constitutional right to parent.

In <em>Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 191, 372 A.2d at 593, we first aggregated these factors from a survey of this Court\u2019s earlier case law, and later as to \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d affirmed their application in <em>Shurupoff, </em>372 Md. at 646, 814 A.2d at 548.

The circuit court presented the following summary in its September 2003 memorandum opinion, which stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201c1. <em>The length of time the child has been away from the biological parent. </em>Patrick as been in the custody of his grandparents since February 13, 2002 pursuant to an Order by consent granting temporary joint legal custody to the Doughertys and the McDermotts, with primary residence to the Doughertys. Notwithstanding the court\u2019s order, Mr. McDermott had <em>de facto </em>custody of Patrick from August 2002 until December 2002, at which time he returned to sea duty. Patrick has also spent considerable time with his father during the summer of 2003. As previously noted, there have been several other periods of time in which Patrick was in the custody of his grandparents or his mother, most being periods of time that Mr. McDermott was not residing in the State of Maryland but was pursuing his occupation as a merchant seaman. <em>When Mr. McDermott has been present in Maryland, he has had regular and frequent contact with Patrick.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">2. <em>The age of the child when care was assumed by the third party. </em>Patrick is now eight years old; he was six years old when the temporary custody order granting joint custody to the Doughertys and the McDermotts was signed on in February 2002. From May 2001 through January 2002, Patrick was in the custody of his [mother] Ms. Dougherty, and prior thereto, in the custody of his father when he was not at sea. Essentially, Patrick has moved around quite a bit since he was born. He has lived with both parents at different times, and sometimes with the Doughertys, and his primary caretakers at one time or another were not necessarily those persons who were named as such in the various, applicable court orders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">3. <em>The possible emotional effect on the child of a change in custody. </em>It is clear from all testimony that Patrick has strong emotional attachments to all members of his family, both parents and grandparents. [Patrick\u2019s court-appointed attorney] testified that Patrick is doing well in school and that his school ... represents an anchor in his life. [Patrick\u2019s court-appointed attorney], also offered that the Doughertys have given Patrick the stability that he needs .... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Custody of Patrick has been changed several times during his short life; at this point, continuity and stability are important considerations before this Court. Although he has resided with his maternal grandparents since January 2002, he continues to have regular and unfettered visitation with his mother and father. The court is concerned that should Mr. McDermott be granted custody of Patrick, his propensity for using Patrick as a pawn in the conflict between him and Ms. Dougherty, and now the Doughertys, will obstruct natural family relationships with the maternal side of Patrick\u2019s family.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">4. <em>The period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child. Generally, when Mr. McDermott has relinquished custody of Patrick, it has been because he went to sea. </em>His periods at sea have lasted several months, after which he has sought to regain custody of Patrick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\">5. <em>The nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian. </em>There is no question that Patrick is very close to the Doughertys. His maternal grandparents have always been a part of Patrick\u2019s life, and, during many periods, have cared for him exclusively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">6. <em>The intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child. It is clear from Mr. McDermott\u2019s testimony that he feels that Patrick\u2019s interests are served by being in his custody, that his care and custody would be superior to any other family member, and that he has a genuine interest in raising Patrick. </em>However, the court is unable to agree with the totality of Mr. McDermott\u2019s self-assessment. It has appeared at various time during these proceedings that Mr. McDermott\u2019s interest in having custody of Patrick was not strictly limited to his desire to care for Patrick, but also his desire to control Ms. Dougherty, and that he has used Patrick as a pawn in the ongoing engagement between Ms. Dougherty and himself.... Although Mr. McDermott indicated ... that he would remain in Harford County should he gain sole custody of Patrick, the court is unconvinced of his sincerity in this regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>7. <em>The stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent. </em>Mr. McDermott was initially awarded custody in this case. For the most part, custody was changed first to Ms. Dougherty and then to the Doughertys because of Mr. McDermott\u2019s lengthy periods of absence from the State due to his employment as a merchant seaman. It would appear that Mr. McDermott\u2019s periodic absences and relinquishment of custody [have] had adverse effects on Patrick. For example, shortly after Ms. Dougherty\u2019s arrest and subsequent incarceration in early 2002, Mr. McDermott signed onto ship going to Africa and not expected to return until summer 2002....<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It is self-evident that a revolving door of custodians would not be in Patrick\u2019s best interest, now or in the future.\u201d [Alterations added.] [Footnote added.] [Some emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We conclude that the circuit court inappropriately found that the absences inherent in Mr. McDermott\u2019s job requirements constituted \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">First, we note that, although the Circuit Court for Harford County expressed some reservation as to Mr. McDermott\u2019s ability to provide a \u201cconsistent and stable environment for his child,\u201d it failed to find Mr. McDermott to be an unfit parent<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and it is presumed that fit parents act in the best interests of their children. <em>See Parham v.

Therefore, in parent-third party disputes over custody, it is only upon a determination by the equity court that the parent is unfit or that there are exceptional circumstances which make custody in the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child, that the court need inquire into the best interest of the child in order to make a proper custodial disposition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\"><em>Hoffman, </em>280 Md. at 178-79, 372 A.2d at 587 (alteration added) (emphasis added). It is in this latter phase of the inquiry that the circuit court erred by inappropriately equating \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d with the absences occasioned by Mr. McDermott\u2019s merchant marine work. By finding that the dictates of Mr. McDermott\u2019s employment voided his right to be a custodial parent, the circuit court overlooked its own lack of a finding of unfitness and failed to accord petitioner with the presumptive benefits of a natural parent, especially a fit natural parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">In <em>Ross v. Pick, </em>199 Md. 341, 86 A.2d 463 (1952), this Court explained the requisite showing to overcome the presumption that a child\u2019s best interests are served by the child\u2019s remaining in the custody of the parent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>\u201cWhere parents claim the custody of a child, there is a <em>prima facie </em>presumption that the child\u2019s welfare will be best subserved in the care and custody of its parents rather than in the custody of others, and the burden is then cast upon the parties opposing them to show the contrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 351, 86 A.2d at 468. <em>See also Shurupoff, </em>372 Md. at 662, 814 A.2d at 557 (reiterating that \u201cit is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest lies with parental custody\u201d subject to a showing that the parent is fit or that no exceptional circumstances exist). Accordingly, it was the Doughertys\u2019 burden to show that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d existed for a granting of custody in their favor; it was not Mr. McDermott\u2019s burden to demonstrate the <em>absence </em>of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d Indeed, it is a weighty task (or should be) for a third party seeking custody to demonstrate \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d which overcome the presumption that a parent acts in the best interest of his or her children and which overcome the constitutional right of a parent to raise his or her own children.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>determining that Mr. McDermott\u2019s job duties at sea rose to the level of \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d however, the circuit court improperly penalized a fit parent who desired custody of his son, and placed on the parent the burden of disproving that which is questionably not even a proper \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">F. Father\u2019s Employment in the Merchant Marine</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Mr. McDermott is a graduate of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and a licensed ship Captain in the Merchant Marine. Many of his previous jobs have involved maritime work. Prior to his marriage he worked aboard ships but upon his marriage he ceased ocean-going and worked primarily in the Port of Baltimore. Following his divorce from Ms. Dougherty, petitioner accepted periodic jobs which took him to sea for several months at a time. Such is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>nature of much maritime work, and the attendant required time commitments also are not uncommon in other lines of work including military deployments, ground transportation of goods, natural gas and oil production, offshore commercial fishing, sport fishing, etc.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Mr. McDermott\u2019s job duties do not involve work that is illegal, untoward, or otherwise injurious. Nor is there evidence in this case of any illegal conduct on his part. While his required absences from Maryland for consecutive months at sea may occasion interruptions in his relationship with Patrick and may be less than ideal, such work is the employment especially available to him and for which he has particularized training. This Court recognizes Maryland\u2019s tradition as a maritime State wherein any number of our residents engage in various activities at sea and beyond and going to sea is but one of many occupations which require the worker to depart the State and absent himself or herself for months at a time. We would be loathe to reach a holding that jeopardizes a fit parent\u2019s right to custody of his child, by the change of custody to third parties, simply because the source of what is his livelihood and his means to support himself and his family takes him from the State for months\u2019 long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Although casting its decision in the light of Mr. McDermott\u2019s having voluntarily gone to sea, the circuit court actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>penalized Mr. McDermott for the absences occasioned by the essential terms and very nature of his employment. It is difficult, if not impossible, to work as a seaman without going to sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">At one hearing, the circuit court was incredulous of Mr. McDermott\u2019s explanation at trial that he had resigned from his position as a merchant marine, but maintained his membership in the union of merchant mariners in order to sustain Patrick\u2019s health insurance. Instead, the court chose to believe that Mr. McDermott\u2019s ongoing membership was for the purpose of keeping open the possibility that he might re-engage in maritime work at some future date, even if he had sole custody of Patrick.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The Doughertys urged their selection as the stable custodians, contending that the father\u2019s lifestyle as a merchant seaman \u201cpresented a challenge to the [c]ourt in terms of his ability to care for his child on a consistent basis ... and he has left the state of Maryland for various lengths of time during the course of this case\u201d (alteration added).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The Doughertys\u2019 argument implies that Mr. McDermott\u2019s absences from the State, which were occasioned solely by the dictates of his employment, would be the only obstacle to his otherwise deserving full custody of Patrick. Thus, according to respondents\u2019 reasoning, Mr. McDermott\u2019s parenting rights are contingent on his employment. The Doughertys maintain that the circuit court\u2019s finding was not dependent on the specific <em>type </em>of employment held by Mr. McDermott, but rather it was the accumulation, timing, and voluntariness of his employment-related absences that made the circumstances exceptional. The circuit court echoed this position, stating, \u201cIn the past whenever Mr. McDermott faced adverse circumstances, he left the State for protracted periods of time for sea duty, seemingly without concern for how his leaving would affect Patrick.\u201d The circuit court was not able to find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Mr. McDermott was an unfit parent, but rather declined to grant him custody based on \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d occasioned by the absences inherent in his position as a merchant mariner. Accordingly, it was Mr. McDermott\u2019s employment that persuaded the circuit court of the presence of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The absences inherent to Mr. McDermott\u2019s merchant marine work are not unlike those required of military personnel or others in occupations mandating periods of service away from one\u2019s home. Custody issues should be determined on a case-by-case basis. <em>See Barnard v. Barnard, </em>157 Md. 264, 267-68, 145 A. 614, 616 (1929) stating the proposition that \u201c[t]here can be no binding, and very little helpful, precedent found in the decisions of the courts on this subject, because essentially each case must depend upon its peculiar circumstances\u201d (alteration added). It is noted that other courts also generally have been reluctant to establish a definitive standard governing child custody when a fit parent is called away for an extended period for work. For example, the case of <em>In re Marriage of Rayman, </em>273 Kan. 996, 47 P.3d 413 (2002), discusses the. Supreme Court of Kansas\u2019 rejection of a mother\u2019s request \u201cfor a bright line rule that a parent with residential custody of his or her children loses that custody when required to be away from his or her children for an extended period of time\u201d such as a twelve-month military tour overseas. <em>Id. </em>at 1001, 47 P.3d at 416. <em>In re Rayman </em>involved a nonresidential custodian fit mother who invoked the parental preference doctrine <em>(i.e., </em>fit parents are a child\u2019s preferred custodians) contending that it was less disruptive to her children to place them in her temporary residential custody in Kansas and later Tennessee, than to allow them to remain with their stepmother, and near her ailing parents in Texas, while the children\u2019s residential custodian father completed a twelve-month military \u201chardship tour\u201d in Korea before returning to Texas. <em>Id. </em>at 999, 47 P.3d at 416. In rejecting the mother\u2019s petition, the Kansas high court observed: \u201cEach situation involving military families has distinct differences, as do the facts of temporary changes which relate to nonmilitary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>custodial relationships. The temporary transfer of the parent with residential custody must not automatically trigger a custody change .... Custody is an issue to be determined on a case-by-case basis ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1001, 47 P.3d at 416-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In a somewhat analogous and presently unreported decision involving a soldier\u2019s Family Care Plan, <em>i.e., </em>a compulsory document providing for care of the family in the soldier\u2019s absence, which provided that the paternal grandmother would care for the children during the custodian soldier-father\u2019s deployment, the Court of Appeals of Iowa, that state\u2019s intermediate appellate court, adopted the holding of the <em>In re Rayman </em>court, stating, \u201cWe further decline to adopt a bright line rule divesting a parent of physical care whenever the parent is required to be away from the children for an extended period.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Grantham, </em>2004 WL 2579567, at *8 (Iowa App., Nov.15, 2004). Similarly, in <em>In re Marriage of Hruby, </em>304 Or. 500, 748 P.2d 57 (1987), a divorced legal custodian father, who had served in the Navy since the child\u2019s birth and had placed the child in the care of the child\u2019s aunt given the parents\u2019 inability to provide care, sought to regain custody of his child with whom he had maintained regular contact and support. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 748 P.2d at 58. The child\u2019s care-giver aunt disputed a parental custodial preference and intervened in the heated custody action asserting that the child had developed a close relationship with the aunt and uncle. <em>Id. </em>at 502-503, 748 P.2d at 58. In awarding custody of the six-year-old child to the father, the Oregon Supreme Court noted that Oregon law supports a fit parent\u2019s right to custody of his minor children \u201cunless there are compelling reasons for depriving him of that custody\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508 n. 5, 748 P.2d at 62 n. 5 (emphasis omitted), and because the father was not a stranger to his child, there was \u201cno showing that the child would not receive adequate care and love from the father or that the child would be otherwise unduly harmed, physically or psychologically, by giving custody to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 748 P.2d at 67. Thus, the <em>In re Hruby </em>court found no compelling reasons to deny custody to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>In non-military circumstances<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> courts have reached similar results in favor of a fit parent who is temporarily gone for extended periods and who desires custody of his or her children. The Louisiana intermediate appellate court declined to maintain custody in the maternal grandparents, who had assumed custody after their daughter abandoned her husband and minor children, when the father later sought custody of the children. Similar to the present case, the father, <em>a tugboat captain, </em>initially had consented to the grandparent custodial arrangement because he was away from home on a regular basis. <em>Jones v. Jones, </em>415 So.2d 300, 301 (La.Ct.App.1982). In approving of custody with the father, who had paid child support on a regular basis and had a new wife who desired to have the children and care for them, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">\u201cIt is not proper to merely compare the parent\u2019s circumstances and situation with that of the non-parent and award custody on the basis of best interests of the child. The \u2018best interest\u2019 comparison is the proper basis for custody contests between parents; <em>it is not properly applied to a contest between a parent and a non-parent because the parent enjoys the paramount right to custody. ... </em>[T]he trial court did not find, and the record does not support a finding, that appellant has forfeited his right to parenthood; is unfit to care for his children; or is unable to provide a home for them. Although the [maternal grandparents] have</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">It is not clear whether the ships upon which petitioner sailed during the relevant periods were United States flagged vessels. They may have been foreign flagged vessels. In any event, petitioner was a licensed captain in the Merchant Marine, albeit, at times he may have served as an officer or seaman on foreign flagged vessels. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>cared for these children for a considerable period of time, we do not consider this to be a compelling reason to leave the children with them particularly in light of [the father\u2019s] remarriage, stable lifestyle, and close, loving relationship with his children. <em>Likewise, [the father\u2019s] absences from home in connection with his employment do not constitute a compelling reason to deprive him of the custody of his </em>children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 302 (alterations added) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Some may discern from these cases a theme that suggests that grandparents are convenient surrogates for parents who encounter difficulties \u2014 whether economic, emotional or logistic \u2014 in raising their children. Grandparents\u2019 contributions do not go unnoticed and their efforts likely accrue to the benefit of the grandchildren. A quote from a case before the Supreme Court of Iowa supports this proposition, but with an especially relevant caveat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cOur cases have emphasized that parents should be encouraged in time of need to look for help in caring for their children <em>without risking loss of custody. </em>The presumption preferring parental custody is not overcome by a mere showing that such assistance was obtained. Nor is it overcome by showing that those who provided the assistance love the children and would provide them with a good home. These circumstances are not alone sufficient to overcome the preference for parental custody.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\"><em>In re Guardianship of Sams, </em>256 N.W.2d 570, 573 (Iowa 1977) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Although the Doughertys did not maintain Patrick in their home and raise the child from infancy, the relative regularity of their contribution as well as the positive contribution of all grandparents must be acknowledged. Nevertheless, their efforts on Patrick\u2019s behalf under the circumstances of this case cannot overcome the fundamental constitutional right of a fit parent to exercise care and custody of his child and the circuit court, clearly impressed with the grandparents\u2019 care, cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>invoke absences occasioned by the parent\u2019s proper employment in support of placing the child with the grandparents due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">G. Counsel Fees and Costs</p>\n<p id=\"A_X\">Mr. McDermott filed an answer and a counter/amended complaint in June 2003 seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and suit costs as well as addressing custody and support issues. The circuit court did not sign an order specifically responding to this filing, but it can be concluded that in awarding custody to the Doughertys, the circuit court effectively denied Mr. McDermott\u2019s petition for costs and fees. In affirming the circuit court, the Court of Special Appeals mandated that costs were to be paid by appellant (Mr. McDermott). In the present appeal, Mr. McDermott renews his petition for attorney\u2019s fees and suit costs (which said costs would include reimbursement of the charges for preparation of the trial\u2019s transcript). We note that Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 12-103 of the Family Law Article provides for the award of costs and counsel fees in some child custody and support actions.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We observe that discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>awarding counsel fees rests with the trial court and the award of counsel fees \u201cmust be based upon the statutory criteria and the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Jackson, </em>272 Md. 107, 112, 321 A.2d 162, 166 (1974); <em>see also Turner v. Turner, </em>147 Md.App. 350, 413, 809 A.2d 18, 55 (2002) (remanding, <em>inter alia, </em>the issue of counsel fees in marriage dissolution case to the circuit court to \u201cconsider the issue of attorney\u2019s fees based on accurate factual underpinnings\u201d). Accordingly, the trial court must determine the issue of counsel fees upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Mr. McDermott\u2019s request for an award of the cost of the trial transcripts is a related, though less frequently examined issue, and must be addressed in the context of suit costs. Md. Rule 2-603, in regard to costs pursuant to judgment in civil actions, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">\u201c(a) Allowance and allocation. Unless otherwise provided by rule, law, or order of court, the prevailing party is entitled to costs. The court, by order, may allocate costs among the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Additionally, Title 8 of the Maryland Rules, governing \u201cAppellate Review in the Court of Appeals and Court of Special Appeals\u201d specifically addresses the issue of transcript preparation and transcript costs. Md. Rule 8-411 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201c(a) Ordering of transcript. Unless a copy of the transcript is already on file, the appellant shall order in writing from the court stenographer a transcript containing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">(1) a transcription of (A) all the testimony or (B) that part of the testimony that the parties agree, by written stipulation filed with the clerk of the lower court, is necessary for the appeal or (C) that part of the testimony ordered by the Court pursuant to Rule 8-206(d) or directed by the lower court in an order; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">(2) a transcription of any proceeding relevant to the appeal that was recorded pursuant to Rule 16-404 e.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">(b) Time for ordering.

The appellant shall (1) file a copy of the written order to the stenographer with the clerk of the lower court for inclusion in the record, (2) cause the original transcript to be filed promptly by the court reporter with the clerk of the lower court for inclusion in the record, and (3) promptly serve a copy on the appellee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Md. Rule 8-607(a), governing assessment of costs provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\u201c(a) Allowance and allocation. Unless the Court orders otherwise, the prevailing party is entitled to costs. The Court, by order, may allocate costs among the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">Md. Rule 8-608, addresses the computation of costs:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">\u201c(a) Costs generally allowed. The Clerk shall include in the costs the allowance determined pursuant to section (c) of this Rule for reproducing the briefs, the record extract, and any necessary appendices to briefs and any other costs prescribed by these rules or other law. Unless the case is in the Court of Appeals and was previously heard and decided by the Court of Special Appeals, the Clerk shall also include the amount paid by or on behalf of the appellant for the original and the copies of the stenographic transcript of testimony furnished pursuant to section (a) of Rule 8-411. If the transcript was paid for by the Office of the Public Defender, the Clerk shall so state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">(b) Costs generally excluded. Unless the Court orders otherwise, the Clerk shall exclude from the costs the costs of reproducing the record if it was reproduced without order of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">(c) Allowance for reproduction. The Clerk shall determine the allowance for reproduction by multiplying the number of pages in the briefs, the record extract, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>necessary appendices to briefs by the standard page rate established from time to time by the Court of Appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ai\">Accordingly, based on the fact that Mr. McDermott sought a transcript of the circuit court proceedings in order to prosecute his appeal, the costs incurred in obtaining that transcript are considered \u201ccosts\u201d of his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In this case there is no doubt that Patrick loves his father and Mr. McDermott loves his son. Petitioner has maintained his relationship with his son since the child\u2019s birth, even when the child was not domiciled with him. The results of myriad examinations, reports and testimony were insufficient to convince the circuit court that Mr. McDermott was an unfit parent, and clearly, Mr. McDermott\u2019s vigorous use of the family courts provides insight on his desire to have custody of Patrick. Courts cannot preempt the established and constitutionally-protected fundamental rights of a parent, who is not \u201cunfit,\u201d simply because that parent\u2019s job takes him from the State for extended periods of time or merely because a child might be better off, in a particular judge\u2019s view, living elsewhere. The circuit court erred in invoking the dictates of Mr. McDermott\u2019s work as a merchant marine, insofar as the requirements of the job caused him to be absent from the state for several months-long periods of time, and arriving at the conclusion that application of the guidelines for \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranted placing Patrick in the custody of his maternal grandparents.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand to that court with instructions to reverse the decision of the circuit court. The case is ordered remanded to the circuit court in order for it to address the issue of counsel fees.

Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 372 A.2d 582 (1977), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>trial court erred in granting custody of Patrick to the Doughertys. I do not concur, however, with the Court\u2019s sudden and wholly unnecessary <em>purported </em>discarding of those standards. I say \u201cpurported\u201d because it is not clear to me what the Court has really done in its 113-page slip opinion, other than to sow uncertainty and confusion in an area that demands clear and accessible guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">In <em>Ross, supra, </em>this Court, synthesizing earlier decisions, laid out a very clear standard for resolving custody disputes between a parent and a non-parent. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">\u201cTo recapitulate: the best interest of the child standard is <em>always </em>determinative in child custody disputes. When the dispute is between a biological parent and a third party, it is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest is subserved by custody in the parent. That presumption is overcome and such custody will be denied if (a) the parent is unfit to have custody, or (b) if there are such exceptional circumstances as [to] make such custody detrimental to the best interest of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 372 A.2d at 587. (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">We recognized in <em>Ross </em>that parents \u201chave the natural right to the custody of their children,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 176, 372 A.2d at 586, but regarded the strong presumption in favor of such custody as sufficient to protect that right. We made clear that \u201cthe ordinary entitlement of parents to the custody of their minor children\u201d was not absolute and that it \u201cwould not be enforced inexorably, contrary to the best interest of the child, on the theory of an absolute legal right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 178, 372 A.2d at 586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">At least seven times since <em>Ross </em>we have restated and confirmed those principles. In <em>Nagle v. Hooks, </em>296 Md. 123, 128, 460 A.2d 49, 51 (1983), citing <em>Ross, supra, </em>280 Md. at 174-75, 372 A.2d at 585, we stated that \u201c[i]n resolving custody disputes, we are \u2018governed by what is in the best interest of the particular child and most conducive to his welfare. This best interest standard <em>is firmly entrenched in Maryland and is deemed to be of transcendent importance! </em>\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>added). In <em>Taylor v. Taylor, </em>306 Md. 290, 303, 508 A.2d 964, 970 (1986), we made the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">\u201cWe emphasize that in <em>any </em>custody case, the paramount concern is the best interest of the child. As Judge Orth pointed out for the Court in <em>Ross v. Hoffman </em>[citation omitted], we have variously characterized this standard as being \u2018of transcendent importance\u2019 and the \u2018sole question.\u2019 The best interest of the child is therefore not considered as one of many factors, but as the objective to which virtually all other factors speak.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In <em>McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 481, 593 A.2d 1128, 1130 (1991), we repeated that statement from <em>Taylor. </em>In <em>Petrini v.

Vockroth, </em>372 Md. 639, 814 A.2d 543 (2003), we revisited afresh the standard to be applied in custody disputes between a parent and non-parent. After surveying both the consistent holdings of this Court and the treatment of the issue in other States, we consciously and clearly confirmed what we said and held in <em>Ross: </em>\u201cThe court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>must always, necessarily, inquire into what is in the child\u2019s best interest, <em>for that is the ultimate, determinative factor.\u201d Shurupoff, </em>372 Md. at 662, 814 A.2d at 557. (Emphasis added). We added, so that there could be no confusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoW\">\u201cThe real point made in <em>Ross v. Hoffman </em>and carried forth since is that, when the dispute is between a parent and a third party, it is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest lies with parental custody. If there is a sufficient showing that the parent is unfit, however, or that exceptional circumstances exist which would make parental custody detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest, the presumption is rebutted and custody should not be given to the parent, for, in either situation, parental custody could not possibly be in the child\u2019s best interest. So long as the best interest of the child remains the definitive standard and there is any reasonable alternative, it defies both logic and common sense to place a child in the custody of anyone, including a parent, when either that person is unfit to have custody or such action, because of exceptional circumstances, would be detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><em>Shurupoff </em>372 Md. at 662, 814 A.2d at 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The Court today, in a 113-page slip opinion suggests, with its right hand, that the best interest of the child standard no longer applies in disputes between a parent and a non-parent \u2014 that the parent\u2019s Constitutional right to custody is predominant \u2014 but, with its left hand, seems to indicate that that is not the case at all, and that, in the end, courts must act in the child\u2019s best interest. Why the Court chooses to take such an unnecessarily convoluted path is a mystery to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Court seems to be concerned that an unfettered application of the best interest standard will result in judges engaging in inappropriate social engineering, of wrenching children from parents who may be poor or otherwise disadvantaged and giving them to wealthier, more advantaged, people on the theory that the children would be better off. That is <em>not </em>what the <em>Ross </em>approach allows, however, and the trial judges in this State understand that is not the case. The presumption afforded under <em>Ross </em>is rebutted <em>only </em>when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>evidence shows that the parent is <em>unfit </em>to have custody or that <em>exceptional circumstances exist which would make parental custody detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest. </em>Neither of those circumstances would include a feeling by a judge that the child might simply be \u201cbetter off\u2019 with the non-parent, that, in the judge\u2019s view, the non-parent could give the child a more affluent or even a more caring upbringing. That does <em>not </em>suffice to warrant denying custody to the parent, and, if the record in any case indicates that the trial court did not properly apply the presumption favoring parental custody, its decision will be reversed on appeal, as this very case illustrates.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In the end, even under the Court\u2019s new approach, the trial court will have to apply the best interest standard. The Court agrees that a parent\u2019s Constitutional right to raise his/her children is not absolute. It agrees that custody may be denied to a parent if the evidence shows that the parent is unfit, and it even continues to bless the alternative basis for denying parental custody \u2014 exceptional circumstances <em>which would made parental custody detrimental to the child\u2019s best interest. </em>That will necessarily require the court to examine and be governed by what is in the child\u2019s best interest. So why go through 113 pages of convolution to say, in the end, what has already been said, confirmed, and reconfirmed in a few clear simple paragraphs?</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">.

Kline, </em>254 Md. 240, 254 A.2d 353 (1969) (holding that divorced father's long hours working as tool and die maker during which time child would be left in care of non-relatives, combined with father\u2019s dishonorable discharge from Army for larceny charge and year-long absence from the child\u2019s life merited awarding custody to maternal aunt and uncle who had assumed care of the child two years prior when the child's mother brought the child to them in a weak and malnourished state and then disappeared).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\"><em>See also Burrows v. Sanders, </em>99 Md.App. 69, 77-78, 635 A.2d 82, 86 (1994) (upholding chancellor's finding of \"exceptional circumstances\u201d in awarding custody of child, born to a sixteen-year-old mother, to paternal grandparents who had raised the child for four years, and observing that granting the mother substantial visitation was in recognition of her improved condition and potential to receive full custody in the future). <em>The circumstances of the case sub judice do not rise to the level of the above cases in respect to the issue of \u201cexceptional circumstances.\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\">. Many offshore sport-fishing boats migrate north and south with the seasons and the \u2018\u2018runs\u201d of marlin, tuna, etc. Their captains and crews are often gone from their home ports for months at a time, as are commercial fisherman such as long-liners, ocean scallopers and the like. Their families, usually spouses, but one supposes other family members on occasion, tend the children while the parent is gone. While in disputes between natural parents the \"best interests\u201d standard may well result in the home-ported parent prevailing over the absent parent, the nature of the work should not impinge upon the absent parent's constitutional rights in third-party disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Other vocations that require extended absences from home would be those involved in major construction projects, tunnel workers, high steel workers, Alaskan cannery workers, United Nations\u2019 workers on duty in foreign countries, members of the State Department on years-long duty abroad, workers for overseas construction companies, and perhaps a myriad of other vocations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">. Being a member of the Merchant Marine is a calling; often an honorable calling requiring many sacrifices. In time of war members of the Merchant Marine sometimes make the ultimate sacrifice. Employment in the vocation is not some type of \"bad act.\" Not only is it a job, but it is a service to be in the United States Merchant Marine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">. Service in the Merchant Marine can be classified as somewhere between military and non-military service. In times of war the 'Merchant Marine may come under governmental control. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1101 (2004) provides <em>inter alia, </em>\"It is necessary for the national defense and development of its foreign and domestic commerce that the United States shall have a merchant marine ... (b) capable of serving as a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or national emergency .... It is declared to be the policy of the United States to foster the development and encourage the maintenance of such a merchant marine.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b530-6\">. Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 12-103 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\"(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 The court may award to either party the costs and counsel fees that are just and proper under all the circumstances in . any case in which a person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">(1) applies for a decree or modification of a decree concerning the custody, support, or visitation of a child of the parties; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">(2) files any form of proceeding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">(i) to recover arrearages of child support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">(ii) to enforce a decree of child support; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">(iii) to enforce a decree of custody or visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">(b) <em>Required considerations. </em>\u2014 Before a court may award costs and counsel fees under this section, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">(1) the financial status of each party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-15\">(2) the needs of each party; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">(3) whether there was substantial justification for bringing, maintaining, or defending the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-17\">(c) <em>Absence of substantial justification. </em>\u2014 Upon a finding by the court that there was an absence of substantial justification of a party for prosecuting or defending the proceeding, and absent a finding by the court of good cause to the contrary, the court shall award to the other party costs and counsel fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\">. The concurring opinion implies that the majority opinion is in conflict with seven of our prior cases: <em>Nagle v. Hooks, Taylor v. Taylor, McCready v. McCready, Petrini v. Petrini, Boswell v. Boswell, In re Mark M. </em>and <em>Shurupoff v. Vockroth. </em>Other than <em>Shurupoff, </em>the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>opinion is not inconsistent with any of the seven cases. <em>Shurupoff </em>is a case that modified the holding in <em>Ross v. Hoffman </em>and is a case we partly disavow in the case <em>sub judice. In re Mark M. </em>involved a dispute between the State and a parent and was a case in which a child in a previous case had been adjudged a Child in Need of Assistance and who had already been placed in a guardianship. The issue in that case concerned whether the juvenile court had improperly delegated its authority to establish visitation to the Department of Social Services and also issues of psychological evaluations, including independent evaluations, to be used in determining visitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The other cases are even more distinguishable. None involve third-party attempts to gain custody over the children of others. The majority opinion is clearly limited to such third-party cases. <em>Nagle, Taylor, McCready, Petrini, </em>and <em>Boswell </em>are all cases involving disputes between natural parents. The present opinion changes nothing as to those cases, does not apply to <em>In re Mark, </em>and overrules, in part, <em>Shurupoff, </em>which itself overruled a relevant part of <em>Ross v. Hoffman. </em>It was <em>Shurupoff </em>that departed from the principles of <em>Ross v. Hoffman. </em>The majority opinion in the case at bar, restores it and further clarifies <em>Ross v. Hoffman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">We have been careful not to resolve issues relating to the rights and responsibilities of the State in the various actions in which it plays a role, leaving those issues for the cases in which they are presented. Moreover, we have time and again in our opinion noted that the \"best interest\" standard that applies in disputes between natural parents, with our opinion, remains unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The Court has gone to great lengths to affirm that the present opinion is limited to the context of attempts by pure third parties to gain custody over the children of others.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
