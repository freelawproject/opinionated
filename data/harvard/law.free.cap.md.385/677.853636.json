Pointing out that claims for medical injury, as a condition precedent to filing an action in court, must be submitted to non-binding arbitration by being filed with the Health Claims Arbitration Office and arguing that the appellant\u2019s claims were for medical injury, the appellee moved to dismiss the appellants\u2019 complaint. Agreeing with the appellee, the trial court granted its motion. For reasons hereinafter to be set forth, we shall reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Stephanie, a fourteen year old minor, was, on September 26, 2001, admitted as a patient at Suburban Hospital for injuries sustained when she jumped from a moving automobile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On October 2, 2001, while a patient on the psychiatric ward, being treated for depression, she was assaulted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>raped or attempted to be raped by a male patient. The appellants filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against the appellee. In the complaint, they alleged that the appellee breached the duties it owed Stephanie \u201cto exercise reasonable care for her protection and ... to protect her from being assaulted and raped,\u201d resulting in \u201csevere physical and emotional pain and suffering which may be permanent\u201d and which has required and will continue to require medical attention, with the necessary financial expenditures and anticipated financial losses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellee filed a motion to dismiss and argued in support of the motion the appellants\u2019 failure to file their claims pursuant to the Maryland Health Care Malpractice Claims Act, with the Health Claims Arbitration Office.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Circuit Court granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>appellee\u2019s motion and dismissed the appellants\u2019 complaint, with prejudice and without leave to amend. Noting that \u201cthe Health Claims Arbitration Act was designed to cover health care providers, and that generally has been given a rather broad perspective,\u201d the Court reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">\u201cIt cannot be ignored that Suburban is a medical facility, and would come under the general umbrella of health care providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">\u201cThat statute is designed for the purpose of bringing these matters to a preliminary matter of resolution before it comes to court, and I am satisfied that the language mandates that this \u2014 even though it is a hospital and the theory of recovery is negligence as opposed to medical malpractice, which is medical negligence \u2014 I feel that the defendant\u2019s argument is the stronger of the two. That it should be dismissed for failure to have been pursued in the proper fashion of the Health Claims Arbitration Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The Appellants noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, on our own motion, we issued the writ of certiorari, <em>see </em>372 Md. 684, 814 A.2d 570 (2003), to consider this important issue of public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">It is well settled that, \u201c[a]bsent a waiver by the parties, the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act requires the submission of malpractice claims against health care providers to an arbitration proceeding as a condition precedent before maintaining a tort action in the circuit court.\u201d <em>Goicochea v.

The claims against health care providers to which the Act pertains are only those in which medical injuries are alleged. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-2A-01(f),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> defining \u201cmedical injury\u201d to \u201cmean[ ] injury arising or resulting from the rendering or failure to render health care.\u201d This Court has considered, and explained, this definition of \u201cmedical injury\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>\u201cLT]he legislature did not intend that claims for damages against a health care provider, arising from non-professional circumstances where there was no violation of the provider\u2019s professional duty to exercise care, to be covered by the Act. It is patent that the legislature intended only those claims which the courts have traditionally viewed as professional malpractice to be covered by the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><em>Cannon v. McKen, supra, </em>296 Md. at 34, 459 A.2d at 200. <em>See Nichols v. Wilson, </em>296 Md. at 161, 460 A.2d at 61 (\u201cit is only those claims for damages where there has been a violation of the health care provider\u2019s professional duty to exercise care which are within the Act\u201d); <em>Brown v. Rabbitt, </em>300 Md. 171, 175, 476 A.2d 1167, 1169 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Our consideration and explanation were in the context of the rendering of medical services or treatment. In <em>Goicochea v. Langworthy, supra, </em>and <em>Nichols v. Wilson, supra, </em>there were allegations that, while providing the medical treatment sought, the health care provider committed intentional torts on the patient. In <em>Goicochea v. Langworthy, supra, </em>the allegation that the doctor, during a hernia examination, \u201cintentionally assaulted and battered [the plaintiffs] left inguinal area with the full force of his left forefinger for approximately five minutes,\u201d 345 Md. at 723, 694 A.2d at 476, was found \u201cinsufficient to remove [the plaintiffs] claim from the coverage of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 729, 694 A.2d at 479. The allegation in <em>Nichols v. Wilson, supra, </em>that, while on the operating table, prepared for the removal of sutures, the defendant doctor \u2018Vithout provocation ... intentionally, violently, maliciously, wantonly and recklessly struck with his hand the left cheek of [the plaintiff],\u201d causing permanent injury, pain and mental anguish, 296 Md. at 155, 460 A.2d at 58, which \u201cclearly sounds in traditional assault and battery terms and alleges an <em>intentional, malicious, wanton and reckless </em>act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 161, 460 A.2d at 61, was held by this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>not to be within the Act, \u201ceven though such action took place during the rendering of health care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We were careful to point out that not all intentional torts were automatically excluded, opining, instead, that \u201cthere may well be many [intentional torts] that would be so covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 161 n. 5, 460 A.2d at 61 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The complaint in <em>Brown v. Rabbitt, supra, </em>alleged a breach of express and implied warranties made to the plaintiff and on which the plaintiff relied, in connection with a tubal ligation procedure. Concluding that such an action was covered by the Act \u2014 \u201c[t]his is clearly a claim involving the appellee\u2019s professional expertise and thus is subject to mandatory arbitration, notwithstanding the fact that the action is brought for breach of warranty,\u201d 300 Md. at 176, 476 A.2d at 1170-, the Court stated the critical question as being \u201cwhether the claim is based on the rendering or failure to render health care and not on the label placed on the claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 476 A.2d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The complaint in <em>Cannon v. McKen, supra, </em>sounded in negligence, strict liability in tort and breach of warranty. 296 Md. at 28-29, 459 A.2d at 197. The causes of action arose out of the injury to the plaintiff, a dental patient, incurred when, while \u201csitting in [the defendant dentist\u2019s] dental chair, a part of the chair and/or x-ray wall attachment broke loose and fell on her, striking her on the face and head.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 459 A.2d at 198. Although conceding that \u201c[a] much closer situation may develop where the injury occurs during treatment when equipment, being used in that treatment, malfunctions and causes the injury,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 36, 459 A.2d at 201, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">\u201c[T]he Act covers only those claims for damages arising from the rendering or failure to render health care where there has been a breach by the defendant, in his professional capacity, of his duty to exercise his professional expertise or skill. Those claims for damages arising from a professional\u2019s failure to exercise due care in non-professional situations such as premises liability, slander, assault, etc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>were not intended to be covered under the Act and should proceed in the usual tort claim manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 459 A.2d at 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We made clear, however, that the burden is on the pleader to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\u201callege sufficient facts to make clear the theory upon which the alleged liability is based. It is a basic rule of law that where a cause of action is dependent upon a condition precedent, plaintiff must allege performance of such condition or show legal justification for nonperformance. If the [complaint] fails to contain such allegations, defendant can object by [motion to dismiss] or plea.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\"><em>Id, </em>at 38, 459 A.2d at 202. Noting that the complaint alleged the plaintiffs status as a dental patient using the dental chair and/or x-ray equipment wall attachment at the time that she was injured, the Court found the pleadings \u201ctoo sparse to allow a determination whether [the plaintifffs injury arose because of the defendant\u2019s breach of his professional duty owed her or because of a breach of duty which he may have owed her as a premises owner or in some other non-professional capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, 459 A.2d at 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\"><em>J&amp;well v. Malamet </em>also addressed the pleading requirement, in the process clarifying the holding in <em>Nichols v. Wilson </em>with respect to when intentional torts alleged to have been committed by health care providers during the rendering of medical care are covered by the Act. In that case, the plaintiff alleged that a physician had \u201cintentionally, wrongfully, willfully, maliciously and violently\u201d assaulted, battered and sexually abused her by fondling her vaginal and breast areas during two musculoskeletal examinations. 322 Md. at 267-269, 587 A.2d at 477. Noting that \u201c \u2018the factual context in which the tort was allegedly committed,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 272, 587 A.2d at 479, is critical, after analyzing our cases and the allegations in the complaint before it, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-9\">\u201cUnlike <em>Nichols, </em>the claims here as alleged do not support a view that \u2018in no way can it be read that the Legislature intended them to be within the Act.\u2019 In the face of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>allegations, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that the claims as set out were not for medical injury allegedly suffered by Jewell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 274, 587 A.2d at 480. In explanation, we detailed the Court\u2019s attempt at oral argument to obtain a concession from the physician\u2019s counsel \u201cthat the conduct complained of had no conceivable validity as part of the examination being conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 587 A.2d at 481. It was in the absence of such a concession, \u201cthat we [were] unable to conclude, as a matter of law, that the allegations as voiced are not subject to the Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The <em>Jewell v. Malamet </em>holding and analysis were extensively discussed and explicated in <em>Goicochea v. Langworthy, supra. </em>Addressing the pleading requirement, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-6\">\u201cConsequently, under <em>Jewell, </em>the determination of the proper initial forum for cases involving allegations of intentional torts committed by health care providers depends upon the factual context in which the tort was allegedly committed. Where a plaintiff alleges that he or she was injured by a health care provider during the rendering of medical treatment or services, the Act is implicated, regardless of whether the claim sounds in negligence or intentional tort. When confronted with such a claim, the trial court must determine if the plaintiffs factual allegations remove the claim from the Act\u2019s coverage. If the complaint sets forth facts showing that the claimed injury was not inflicted during the rendering of medical services, or that the injury resulted from conduct completely lacking in medical validity in relation to the medical care rendered, the Act is inapplicable, and the action may proceed without first resorting to arbitration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-7\">\u201cUnder our holding in <em>Jewell, </em>however, if the trial court is unable to conclude that the allegations remove the claim from the Act\u2019s coverage, the court should not exercise jurisdiction over the claim until a malpractice claim is filed with the HCAO. The HCAO initially will determine if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>claim alleges a \u2018medical injury\u2019 and is therefore subject to the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">345 Md. at 728-29, 694 A.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">In the instant case, we observe that it is alleged that Stephanie was assaulted and raped, or attempted to be raped, in her hospital room while a psychiatric patient on the appellee\u2019s premises, but, at the time of the assault, no active or direct health care was being rendered by any health care provider. Moreover, it is not alleged that a health care provider committed the assault. To the contrary, the allegation is that it was committed by another-a male \u2014 of the appellee\u2019s psychiatric patients. Nor is there an allegation, and it is inconceivable that there could be one, that the assault was itself a part of the course of treatment that Stephanie was receiving for depression.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The appellee argues that the Circuit Court correctly ruled that the appellants\u2019 claim against it was covered by the Act and, therefore, that their complaint, because it was not filed initially in the Health Claims Arbitration Office, was properly dismissed. Specifically, it says, the appellants did not meet their obligation to show in their complaint that the Act does not apply. The appellee concedes that the complaint sufficiently alleged the hospital-patient relationship, also that the assault was committed by another patient and that the appellee owed Stephanie a duty to protect her from such assaults; however, it maintains that \u201c[wjhat is missing ... are factual allegations that would take the Appellant\u2019s claims against her health care provider that arose during the course of a hospital-patient relationship outside the scope of the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It proffers, in that regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201cIn order to determine if Suburban was negligent in \u2018[p]ermit[ting] an adult male patient to walk into [Appellant\u2019s] room which was in close proximity to the nurse\u2019s station,\u2019 or \u2018[f]ail[ing] to provide adequate security for [Apellant\u2019s] well-being,\u2019 a jury would have to address various issues involving the professional competence and judgment of agents and employees of Suburban. There is no way a jury can determine whether Suburban failed to meet the common law tort standard of acting as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances without addressing the following issues:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-4\">\u2022 Was it reasonable to place a minor female psychiatric patient such as the Appellant on Suburban\u2019s psychiatric unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">\u2022 Assuming the assaulting patient was also a patient on the psychiatric unit, was it reasonable to place that individual on Suburban\u2019s psychiatric unit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-6\">\u2022 Did the patient who allegedly committed the assault say or do anything that would have or should have indicated to Suburban\u2019s staff that he posed a threat to the Appellant or anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">\u2022 Was the adult patient who allegedly assaulted the Appellant appropriately evaluated, diagnosed and treated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>\u2022 Was the Appellant appropriately evaluated, diagnosed and treated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-4\">\u2022 Was the condition and diagnosis of the adult patient who allegedly assaulted the Appellant such that Suburban\u2019s staff, in the exercise of their professional judgment, should have taken certain steps to ensure that he not come into contact with the Appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">\u2022 Considering the conditions of the patients involved, was there appropriate supervision and surveillance provided by Suburban\u2019s staff?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\"><em>Appellee\u2019s brief </em>at pages 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In addition to those of our cases as we have reviewed, the appellee relies on <em>Long v. Rothbaum, </em>68 Md.App. 569, 514 A.2d 1223 (1986) and <em>Roberts v. Suburban Hospital, </em>73 Md. App. 1, 532 A.2d 1081 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\"><em>Long v. Rothbaum </em>was an action against health care providers, Franklin Square Hospital and Taylor Manor, for false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of constitutional rights, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The factual basis for the action, as revealed by the complaint, can be stated simply. The plaintiff was taken to Franklin Square Hospital by Toll Facilities\u2019 police, who believed that the plaintiff was suicidal. When he attempted to leave, the doctors and other agents of the hospital \u201crestrained him, subsequently drugged him and still later caused him to be admitted involuntarily to a mental health facility,\u201d 68 Md.App. at 571, 514 A.2d at 1224, for the accomplishment of which they executed illegal documents \u2014 Physicians\u2019 Certificates that did not comply with the procedure prescribed by COMAR 10.21.01.03, <em>id. </em>at 576, 514 A.2d at 1226,\u2014and handcuffed and transported him to \u201can asylum.\u201d 68 Md.App. at 571, 514 A.2d at 1224. Having been delivered to the \u201casylum,\u201d Taylor Manor, where he remained for 7 days, \u201cthrough the actions of doctors and other agents of Taylor Manor, he was illegally involuntarily admitted, without his consent kept at Taylor Manor, subjected to unlawful procedures and other wrongful actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 572, 514 A.2d at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>Cognizant that the critical question is the basis for the claim, whether it is based on the rendering or failure to render health care, rather than how the claim is labeled, <em>id. </em>at 575, 514 A.2d at 1226, quoting <em>Brown v. Rabbitt, </em>300 Md. at 175, 476 A.2d at 1169, the intermediate appellate court rejected the plaintiffs argument \u201cthat intentional torts simply are not \u2018medical injuries,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 573, 514 A.2d at 1225, and focused on the allegations of the complaint. It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-4\">\u201cThe complaint shows that Long was brought to Franklin Square Hospital because he was thought to be a suicide risk. He was kept there involuntarily because the health care providers at that hospital were attempting to treat him for that problem. His claimed false imprisonment, from which the asserted emotional distress arose, was caused by those health providers who executed Physicians\u2019 Certificates for mentally disordered that are required for involuntary admission to mental health facilities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 514 A.2d at 1226. After discussing the plaintiffs arguments with respect to the violation of COMAR 10.21.01.03 and pertinent other provisions, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">\u201cIt is apparent to us that what Long\u2019s complaint in fact alleges is misdiagnosis of his condition and the subsequent rendition of unnecessary and, therefore, improper care. The appellees\u2019 alleged failure to comply with various CO-MAR provisions dealing with the treatment of involuntary mental committees is in effect a charge of malpractice \u2014 the failure to adhere to a standard of care required (by CO-MAR) of certain health care providers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 576, 514 A.2d at 1226-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">The Court of Special Appeals proceeded to contrast its case with <em>Nichols v. Wilson, </em>noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-9\">\u201cThe case before us is unlike <em>Nichols. </em>In that case the cause of action (the slap) did not arise from a negligent, reckless, or unnecessary suture removal. Rather, the slap was a gratuitous act that obviously was not part of the medical treatment. Here, the cause of action is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>the treatment itself and other actions that are said to be in violation of mandated health care standards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 567-77, 514 A.2d at 1227. The intermediate appellate court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">\u201cIn the case before us, Long\u2019s claims arise from a doctor-patient relationship, albeit an involuntary one. They stem from the rendering of health care in alleged contravention of standards applicable to that care. They implicate directly the professional competence of the several appellees. We hold that Long\u2019s common law claims involve medical injuries as defined in \u00a7 3-2A-01(f), and thus are subject to arbitration as a condition precedent to judicial relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 578, 514 A.2d at 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The plaintiff in <em>Roberts v. Suburban Hospital </em>brought, in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, an action against the hospital, which presented three theories: strict liability, breach of implied warranties of fitness and merchantability and negligence. 73 Md.App. at 2-3, 532 A.2d at 1082. A hemophiliac, the plaintiff alleged that he had received all of his blood transfusions at the hospital and that he contracted AIDS as a result of a blood transfusion. <em>Id. </em>The hospital moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging failure to comply with the mandatory arbitration requirements. The Court of Special Appeals agreed, although the Circuit Court had not decided the case on that basis. It did so on the basis that the negligence count \u201cstated a claim for breach of professional skill and duty and ... it was therefore subject to the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7, 532 A.2d at 1084. \u201cThat count charged the hospital with breaching a duty to use ordinary and reasonable care in the selection, screening and testing of blood suppliers and donors for infectious diseases and viruses including the AIDS virus and to use ordinary and reasonable care to mitigate the possibility of AIDS being transmitted to patients receiving blood transfusions in the hospital.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6, 532 A.2d at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The cases in which the Act has been found to apply, including those on which the appellee relies, have all involved claims that arose as a result of the rendering of medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>treatment or the failure to do so, <em>Goicochea v. Langworthy, supra </em>(alleged assault committed by doctor while examining the plaintiff for a hernia); <em>Brown v. Rabbitt, supra </em>(warranties, express and implied in connection with a tubal ligation); <em>Roberts v. Suburban Hospital, supra </em>(alleged negligence in connection with blood transfusions); <em>Long v. Rothbaum, supra </em>(misdiagnosis of mental condition), or there was such ambiguity in the pleadings in that regard that exclusion from the Act is required as a matter of law. <em>Jewell v. Malamet, supra </em>(alleged assault and battery committed by doctor by fondling the vaginal and breast areas of the plaintiff during two musculoskeletal examinations). <em>See also Cannon v. McKen, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">As we have seen, the Court neither found the Act to apply nor not to apply in <em>Cannon v. McKen; </em>rather, it remanded the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings to allow the plaintiff to plead facts which would resolve the issue. Of significance to the issue <em>sub judice, </em>however, was that, in that case, the plaintiff was injured while sitting in the dental chair as a dental patient, when the dental chair and/or x-ray wall attachment broke loose and injured her; there was a plausible connection between the allegations and the plaintiffs injuries being \u201cmedical injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">In this case, the allegations of the complaint clearly do not show that Stephanie\u2019s injuries were incurred during the active rendering of medical services and, indeed, they show that they were not inflicted by a medical care provider or as a result of that provider\u2019s treatment or failure to treat. In fact, the complaint does not allege injury by a health care provider during the rendering of medical treatment or services. Moreover, an assault, rape or attempted rape can in no way be described as medical service and it is inconceivable that it could, or would, be prescribed as treatment for depression. In addition, even were it to be so prescribed, assault, rape or attempted rape is completely lacking in any medical validity in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>Nevertheless, the appellee maintains that the Act applies because, <em>inter alia, </em>Stephanie was under the care of a health care provider, the hospital, and the decision to hospitalize her and treat her condition involved medical judgment. Moreover, it believes that the diagnoses that were made with respect to Stephanie and the male patient who assaulted her, as well as the decisions that the hospital made with respect to where to house them necessarily involved professional judgment and, thus, implicate the Act. In effect, the appellee seems to be suggesting that Stephanie\u2019s hospitalization was itself treatment and that every decision emanating from the decision to hospitalize, however indirect and whatever its connection to the claimed injury, is the rendering of medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">The appellee reads our cases too broadly with respect to the interpretation to be given to \u201crendering health care.\u201d On the contrary, our cases make clear that the cause of the injury must have been \u201ca breach by the defendant, in his[, her or its] professional capacity, of [the] duty to exercise ... professional expertise or skill\u201d in rendering or failing to render health care. <em>Cannon v. McKen, supra, </em>296 Md. at 36, 459 A.2d at 201. Thus, we have said that when it is clear from the allegations of the complaint that the plaintiffs claimed injury was not inflicted during the rendering or failure to render medical service or that it was the result of conduct having utterly no medical validity in relation to the medical care rendered, the action properly proceeds in Circuit Court, without first resorting to arbitration. <em>Goicochea v. Langworthy, </em>345 Md. at 728, 694 A.2d at 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">This case is much like <em>Nichols v. Wilson, </em>although the injuries in this case did not occur during the rendering of health care, at least not directly at the moment of the injury. Like the slap, the assault, rape or attempted rape by the male patient bore no relationship to the medical treatment for which Stephanie was hospitalized. What the Court said in <em>Nichols v. Wilson </em>thus applies with equal, if not greater \u2014 the medical provider did not cause the injury in this case \u2014 , force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>here: \u201c[i]n no way can it be said that the legislature intended such a claim to be within the Act.\u201d <em>Nichols v. Wilson, </em>296 Md. at 161, 460 A.2d at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

Section 3-2A-04 then provides that \"[a] person having a claim against a health care provider for damage due to a medical injury shall file his claim with the Director,\u201d subsection (a)(1), and, prescribes procedures for doing so. Thus, a claim against a health care provider for \u201cmedical injury,\" where the amount of damages sought exceeds the \"limit of the concurrent jurisdiction of the District Court\" is governed by the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b778-10\">.
