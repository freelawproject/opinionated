On September 20, 2004, Judge Jackson held a hearing and on November 8, 2004, issued Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, in which he found, by clear and convincing evidence, that James violated MRPC Rules l.l, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a), 8.1(b) and 8.4(a)(c) and (d), Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-607, and 16-609, and Sections 10-304 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Petitioner recommends disbarment and took no substantive exceptions to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, merely asking that the $8.39 amount regarding escrow check number 1074 be amended to $10.00 to reflect the greater amount that Respondent admitted he gave to Ms. Smith.

James, III for allegedly violating several rules of professional conduct. Upon consideration of the complaint, Mr. James, hereinafter called the \u2018Respondent,\u2019 and the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland via Bar Counsel, hereinafter called the \u2018Petitioner,\u2019 entered into a Conditional Diversion Agreement, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-736, on November 18, 2002. On February 20, 2004, the Petitioner, having found Respondent to be in material default, revoked the Agreement. By Order dated March 17, 2004, the Court of Appeals transmitted this matter to this Court to hear the charges contained in the pleadings in accordance with Maryland Rule 16-757, <em>et seq. </em>On March 22, 2004, the Petitioner filed a Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action against the Respondent. The matter came for hearing before this Court on September 20, 2004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">\u201cAt the outset of the hearing, Petitioner pursued its Motion for Sanction, alleging that on May 29, 2004, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Respondent was personally served with Petitioner\u2019s Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents and Request for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents but failed to submit responses thereto by June 29, 2004, which was 30 days after service and 15 days after Respondent filed his Answer on June 14, 2004. According to this Court\u2019s scheduling order dated July 26, 2004, all discovery was to be completed by August 11, 2004. The Respondent submitted Answers to Interrogatories, Requests for Production of Documents and Requests for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents on August 31, 2004. The Court found Respondent\u2019s responses to discovery to be untimely and non-responsive. The Court, therefore, granted Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Sanctions and foreclosed the Respondent from putting on any evidence that was requested in the Petitioner\u2019s Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents. As a result, Petitioner\u2019s Requests for Admission of Facts and Genuineness of Documents were admitted, pursuant to Rule 2-424(b), due to the Respondent\u2019s failure to respond within 30 days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT SUPPORTING COMPLAINT NO. 2002-175-17-9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">\u201cPetitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.15(a), 8.4(a)(d), Rules 16-607 and 16-609 and Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7\u00a7 10-306 and 10-307 by his misappropriation and commingling of trust money. The Court makes the following Findings of Fact, finding that they are supported by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\u2018On November 18, 2002, Respondent and Petitioner entered into a Conditional Diversion Agreement; however, on February 20, 2004 that Agreement was revoked. In February of 2001, the Respondent handled a claim for Sheila Smith. On or about February 20, 2001, the proceeds of an arbitration award in the amount of $7,500.00 were forwarded to the Respondent on behalf of Ms. Smith. The Respondent deposited Ms. Smith\u2019s $7,500.00 award into his attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ney escrow account held at Chevy Chase Bank. On or about May 17, 2001, the Respondent wrote escrow Check No. 1074 to Ms. Smith in the amount of $1,222.47,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which was [$10.00] more than Ms. Smith was entitled to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\u201cThe Respondent\u2019s escrow Check No. 1074 caused an overdraft on his escrow account in the amount of [$10.00]. Thereafter, Chevy Chase bank assessed a $30.00 non-sufficient funds charge on the Respondent\u2019s escrow account. On June 18, 2001, the Respondent\u2019s escrow account had a negative running balance of $38.39.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">\u201cOn June 19, 2001, the Respondent deposited $8,000.00 into his escrow account on behalf of a personal injury client, Catherine A. Davis. When Respondent deposited Ms. Davis\u2019 $8,000.00 into his escrow account, his running balance fell to $7,961.61. The Respondent was to maintain in escrow Ms. Davis\u2019s net proceeds of $1,774.75; however, he fell below that amount on July 18, 2001, August 3, 2001 and August 6, 2001. Three of the Respondent\u2019s Chevy Chase escrow checks were presented to the bank on April 22, 2002. All three checks caused an overdraft in a combined total amount of $70.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\u201cIn January of 2000, the Respondent started using his attorney escrow account for personal and business matters. Escrow Check No. 1063, dated January 10, 2000, was written to Directv, a personal expense. The Respondent testified that during 1999 he and his wife, who is also an attorney, had several discussions about depositing client checks into their personal account and that based on their discussions, the Respondent stopped using the personal account and started using his escrow account for business and personal matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW FOR COMPLAINT NO. 2002-175-17-9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">\u201cThe Court finds that the Respondent violated all the Rules of Professional Conduct charged by the Petitioner in the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action. The Respondent mishandled Ms. Davis\u2019 $8,000.00 settlement in violation of Rule 1.1 by not maintaining intact the $8,000.00 when he deposited the money into his escrow account.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When Ms. Davis\u2019 funds were deposited into the escrow account the Respondent\u2019s account balance fell to $7,961.61 due to having a negative balance of $38.39. Further the Respondent failed to maintain intact Ms. Davis\u2019 net proceeds of $1,774.75. On three different occasions the escrow account balance fell below the $1,774.75 amount due to Ms. Davis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">\u201cThe Court also finds that the Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), Maryland Rule 16-609 and Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7 10-306 by not maintaining Ms. Davis\u2019 $8,000.00 settlement in the escrow account when it was deposited and later by not maintaining intact Ms. Davis\u2019 net proceeds of $1,774.75. The Respondent\u2019s escrow account fell below $1,774.75 on July 18, 2001, August 1, 2001 and August 6, 2001. The Respondent failed to keep Ms. Davis\u2019 proceeds of $1,775.75 intact until she cashed her settlement check on August 10, 2001. Further, three escrow checks were presented to the bank on April 22, 2002, and all three checks caused an overdraft in a combined total of $70.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">\u201cThe Court further finds that Respondent has been using his escrow account for personal and business matters since January 10, 2000 in violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.15(a) and Rule 16-607. The Respondent\u2019s mishandling of his escrow account and his failure to keep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Ms. Davis\u2019 monies intact until disbursed is prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\n<em>FINDINGS OF FACT SUPPORTING COMPLAINT NO. 2001-101-17-9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">\u201cIn the complaint of Fazlur R. Kazim, Petitioner alleges that the Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a), 8.1(b) and 8.4(a)(c)(d) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, Maryland Rule 16-604 and 16-609 and Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-306 in connection with his representation of Mr. Kazim. The Court makes the following Findings of Fact, finding that they are supported by clear and convincing evidence:</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">\u2018In December of 2002, Mr. Kazim retained the Respondent to investigate and prosecute a civil action against attorney Clark U. Fleckinger, II for alleged damages resulting from an affair he had with Mr. Kazim\u2019s wife, which led to a divorce. At the initial meeting with the Respondent, Mr. Kazim signed a retainer agreement and gave the Respondent a $1,500 check representing a $1,000 nonrefundable engagement fee and $500 retainer and/or investigative fee. Upon receipt of Mr. Kazim\u2019s $1,500 check, the Respondent cashed the check and made two cash deposits into his operating account totaling $1,476.30. The Respondent never deposited Mr. Kazim\u2019s $500 into the escrow account.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adi\">\u201cThroughout the representation the Respondent failed to communicate with Mr. Kazim. Mr. Kazim sent the Respondent five (5) e-mails and called the Respondent numerous times to no avail. The Respondent never responded to Mr. Kazim\u2019s e-mails and telephone calls. The Respondent never sent Mr. Kazim any written communications throughout the representation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">\u201cMarc O. Fielder, Bar Counsel Investigator, interviewed the Respondent, who stated that Mr. Kazim had retained him because he suffered from a physical disability, which was rooted in the emotional distress he suffered while going through his divorce. The Respondent informed Mr. Fiedler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>that he was looking at several causes of action to pursue on behalf of Mr. Kazim including intentional interference of the marital contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, possible negligence and adultery. Originally, the Respondent considered filing a cause of action against Mr. Fleckinger and Mr. Grozbean, who had represented Mr. Kazim\u2019s wife in the divorce proceeding. The Respondent, however, determined early on that there was no cause of action against Mr. Grozbean. The Respondent stated to Mr. Fiedler that he was proceeding against Mr. Fleckinger because Mr. Fleckinger had had an affair with Mr. Kazim\u2019 s wife. The Respondent informed Mr. Fiedler that he had not been terminated from the representation and was waiting for additional medical records from Mr. Kazim. Mr. Kazim testified that the Respondent never requested additional medical records than what was initially provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">\u201cThroughout the representation the Respondent never advised Mr. Kazim that he did not have a cause of action against Mr. Fleckinger. Further, the Respondent never advised Mr. Kazim that nothing further would be done on his matter unless additional medical records were provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">\u201cBy letter dated July 9, 2003, Petitioner requested the Respondent to submit a written response to Mr. Kazim\u2019s complaint. Although the Respondent received Petitioner\u2019s letter of July 9, 2003, he did not respond to that letter. Petitioner sent the Respondent a second letter dated July 30, 2003 by certified mail, return receipt requested, requesting a written response to Mr. Kazim\u2019s complaint within ten days. Although the Respondent received Petitioner\u2019s second letter of July 30, 2003, the Respondent did not respond within ten days. Petitioner sent the Respondent a third letter dated September 11, 2003 by certified mail, return receipt requested, requesting a written response to Mr. Kazim\u2019s complaint within seven days. Although the Respondent received Petitioner\u2019s third letter of September 11, 2003, the Respondent did not respond within seven days. Thereafter, the Petitioner sent the Respondent a fourth letter dated September 24, 2003 by certified mail, return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>receipt requested, requesting a written response to Mr. Kazim\u2019s complaint within seven days. Although the Respondent received Petitioner\u2019s fourth and final letter dated September 24, 2003, the Respondent did not respond within seven days. The Respondent never submitted a written . response to Petitioner\u2019s letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW FOR COMPLAINT NO. 2001-101-17-9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\u201cThe Court finds that the Respondent violated all the Rules of Professional Conduct alleged by the Petitioner. Respondent incompetently represented Mr. Kazim in violation of Rule 1.1 by not exhibiting the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. The Respondent claimed he was pursuing a cause of action against Mr. Fleckinger for having an affair with Mr. Kazim\u2019s ex-wife. In Maryland, it has long been recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-6\">[a]t common law, [an] action for criminal conversation provided different benefits to and imposed different burdens upon men and women. Only a man could sue or be sued for criminal conversation. These facts remain unchanged under the common law as it exists in Maryland today. A man has a cause of action for criminal conversation, but a woman does not. Moreover, a man who engages in an act of sexual intercourse with another man\u2019s wife is civilly liable for damages, but a woman who engages in a similar activity with another woman\u2019s husband is not. Thus, Maryland\u2019s law provides different benefits for and imposes different burdens upon its citizens based solely upon their sex. Such a result violates the [Equal Rights Amendment]. Any previous implicit approval by this Court of the action for criminal conversation is eradicated by the existence of the [Equal Rights Amendment]. The common law cause of action for criminal conversation is a vestige of the past. It cannot be reconciled with our commitment to equality of the sexes. We now hold that in Maryland the cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>criminal conversation is unconstitutional and is no longer viable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-4\"><em>Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 592-593, 414 A.2d 929 (1980); <em>see also Doe v. Doe, </em>358 Md. 113, 747 A.2d 617 (2000) (Restating that criminal conversation had been abolished).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Therefore, there was no cause of action against Mr. Fleckinger. If the Respondent had done the minimal amount of research he would have discovered that there could not have been any cause of action for criminal conversation and would not have proceeded with the case. Thus, the Court finds that Respondent\u2019s failure to act with reasonable diligence in notifying Mr. Kazim that there was no cause of action was in violation of Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3. The Court also finds that the Respondent violated Rule 1.4 by failing to communicate with Mr. Kazim and keep him informed of the status of the matter despite repeated efforts by Mr. Kazim to speak with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJD\">\u201cThe Court further finds that Respondent\u2019s failure to deposit Mr. Kazim\u2019s $500 retainer and investigative money into the escrow account violated Rule 1.15(a),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Rule 16-604 and 16-609 and Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-306.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Respondent\u2019s taking of Mr. Kazim\u2019s $500 retainer and/or investigative fee on December 10, 2002 violated Maryland Rule 8.4(c)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by dishonestly taking trust monies that had not been earned. Hence, the Court finds that Respondent\u2019s lack of action in research<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>ing and advising Mr. Kazim that he did not have a cause of action against Mr. Fleckinger and the Respondent\u2019s failure to maintain Mr. Kazim\u2019s $500 in trust until earned or until paid to the investigator was conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of Rule 8.4(d). Moreover, the Court finds that Respondent violated Rule 8.1 by his wilful failure to respond to Petitioner\u2019s letters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">\u201cIn summary, this Court finds that the Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a), 8.1(b) and 8.4(a)(c)(d), Rules 16-604, 16-607 and 16-609 and Business Occupations and Professions Article \u00a7\u00a7 10-304 and 10-306 in connection with both complaints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">In proceedings involving attorney discipline, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Mr. Kazim testified that he \u201csaw\u201d Exhibit 7B in Mr. James\u2019s office and that he signed it \u201cin the apartment to retain [Mr. James]\u201d and further \u201cthe first time Pm seeing this, this billing worksheet\u201d was at the hearing.

You have never sent me any correspondence in the mail. I\u2019ve never, ever seen this sheet but this moment here, Your Honor, that he has presented me this sheet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The lack of any written correspondence was corroborated by the testimony of Mr. Marc Fielder, the investigator with the Attorney Grievance Commission, who reviewed Mr. James\u2019s client file on Mr. Kazim and did not see any correspondence to anyone in the file.

Although the act of adultery was not a viable action, the adulterous acts were actionable under claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The lack of legal research testified to by Mr. Fielder, the AGC investigator, is belied by Mr. James\u2019s contention in his exceptions and during argument before this Court, that \u201calthough the act of adultery was not a viable action, the adulterous acts were actionable under claims of negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d Essentially, James argues that violation of the criminal statute prohibiting adultery, Md.Code (2002, 2004 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 10-501 of the Criminal Law Article, is in and of itself a cause of action somehow related to the negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. However, even <em>cursory </em>research on Mr. James\u2019s part would have revealed that in <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>358 Md. 113, 747 A.2d 617 (2000), Judge Eldridge, speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>for this Court, emphasized that, \u201cThis Court decided twenty years ago that public policy would not allow tort damages based upon adultery. <em>See Kline v. Ansell, </em>287 Md. 585, 414 A.2d 929 (1980). That decision should not be ignored simply because the plaintiff has employed different labels and named a different defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 747 A.2d at 624. This exception is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">B. <em>James\u2019s Exceptions to Findings of Fact based upon discovery </em>sanctions,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Mr. James also has requested that the matter be remanded, \u201cas the defense was severely prejudiced by the inability to use, in either defense or rebuttal documents which were made available to Petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On the morning of the hearing, Bar Counsel pressed preliminary motions regarding the untimeliness of Mr. James\u2019s responses to interrogatories, requests for production of documents and requests for admissions and genuineness of documents, all of which had been served upon Mr. James on May 29, 2004, but not responded to until August 31, 2004, just twenty days before the hearing. At the hearing, Mr. James conceded that his responses were \u201cuntimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">In addition to untimeliness, Bar Counsel asserted that Mr. James\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories were unresponsive: Inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>rogatory number 9 stated, \u201cIf you intend to rely upon any documents or other tangible things to support a position that you have taken or intend to take in the action, provide a brief description, by category and location, of all such documents and other tangible things, and identify all persons having possession, custody, or control of them,\u201d to which Respondent replied, \u201cPlease see response to request for production of documents. I may rely upon any document that has been reviewed by, received from or sent to the Petitioner.\u201d Interrogatory number 17 requested, \u201cFor each of your clients named in the Petition for Disciplinary Action, state in detail the date you were retained, the nature of the legal work for which you were retained, the actual work you performed and the date of termination (if any) for each employment,\u201d to which Mr. James responded, \u201cPlease see request for production of documents.\u201d Interrogatory number 18 asked, \u201cFor each of your clients named in the Petition for Disciplinary Action, state the date of each communication you had with each client and the purpose and nature of each such communication (e.g., letter, telephone, etc.) and identify all documents which evince such communications,\u201d to which Mr. James responded, \u201cI cannot remember the date of each communication I had with each named client and the purpose and nature of each such communication as specified in this interrogatory.\u201d Interrogatory number 19 queried, \u201cFor each of your clients named in the Petition for Disciplinary Action, identify each person with whom you communicated on behalf of each client, the date, purpose and nature of each such communication and identify all documents which evince such communications,\u201d to which Mr. James replied, \u201cI cannot remember each person with whom I communicated on behalf of each named client as specified in this interrogatory.\u201d Further, in response to each and every request for production of documents, Mr. James had stated, \u201cUpon availability, inspection and related activities concerning relevant and non-privileged material, will be provided as requested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Mr. James asserts that he made client files available to Mr. Fielder, the investigator for Bar Counsel, and that he made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>boxes of his client files available to Bar Counsel on August 10, 2004, when the diversion agreement was signed, and on August 31, 2004, after the diversion agreement was revoked, when his deposition was taken; Bar Counsel did not review the uncategorized boxes of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">After lengthy argument presented by both Petitioner and Respondent, the hearing judge found that the responses were untimely and not responsive, agreed to deem admitted the admissions of facts and genuineness of documents, and foreclosed the Respondent from putting on documentary evidence relying upon that which had been requested in those requests. Respondent, however, argues that he was prejudiced by his inability to use documents \u201cmade available to Petitioner\u201d on August 31st, specifically with respect to his inability to \u201crefresh\u201d Mr. Kazim\u2019s recollection on cross-examination or for rebuttal, to show the frequency and specific dates of communication with Mr. Kazim, or to provide two cash deposits totaling $1,476.30.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">First, the responses to the discovery requests were untimely, even if they were considered to be responsive, having been filed on August 31, 2004, just twenty days prior to the hearing. The hearing judge did not abuse his discretion in determining that the conceded untimeliness of all of the discovery responses was an essential factor in precluding Respondent\u2019s use of information not timely produced. <em>See Wilson v. Crane, </em>385 Md. 185, 867 A.2d. 1077 (2005) (\u201cThus, an abuse of discretion should only be found in the extraordinary, exceptional or most egregious case\u201d), citing <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 13-14, 174 A.2d 768, 771 (1961) (stating that \u201ctrial judges, who are primarily called upon to administer [discovery] rules, are vested with a reasonable, sound discretion in applying them, which discretion will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of its abuse\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In addition, the hearing judge found that the answers to interrogatories and requests for production of documents were non-responsive, which also was not an abuse of his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Maryland Rule 2-421 (b) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The party to whom the interrogatories are directed shall serve a response within 30 days after service of the interrogatories or within 15 days after the date on which that party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is required, whichever is later. The response shall answer each interrogatory separately and fully in writing under oath, or shall state fully the grounds for refusal to answer any interrogatory. The response shall set forth each interrogatory followed by its answer. An answer shall include all information available to the party directly or through agents, representatives, or attorneys....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-4\">Rule 2-422 provides, in pertinent part, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">(c) Response. The party to whom a request is directed shall serve a written response within 30 days after service of the request or within 15 days after the date on which that party\u2019s initial pleading or motion is required, whichever is later. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is refused, in which event the reasons for refusal shall be stated. If the refusal relates to part of an item or category, the part shall be specified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-6\">(d) Production. A party who produces documents for inspection shall produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or shall organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Neither Rule was satisfied by Respondent in this case. At argument Respondent asserted that he had responded adequately to the interrogatories and the request for production of documents because he had proffered interrogatory answers on August 31, 2004, twenty days before the hearing. Those answers, however, were woefully inadequate in almost all respects, but particularly when in response to Interrogatory number 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Compounding this non-responsiveness was the fact that, as Respondent conceded at argument, his response to the Request for Production of Documents was essentially that \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>spection and related activities will be permitted as requested unless the request is refused.\u201d Mr. James argues that he was being responsive by providing boxes of uncategorized documents three months after service of the Requests, on the day of his deposition, which had been separately noted, and twenty days before the hearing. Under these circumstances, we do not find that Judge Jackson abused his discretion in determining that Mr. James was unresponsive to discovery requests and in imposing the specific sanction. The sanction imposed by Judge Jackson clearly was proportionate to the discovery abuse by Mr. James. Md. Rule 2-433(a); <em>see, e.g., People v. Camp, </em>352 Ill.App.3d 257, 287 Ill.Dec. 336, 815 N.E.2d 980, 984 (2004) (remanding the case to the trial court because sanction was disproportionate to the discovery violation); <em>Usowski v. Jacobson, </em>267 Conn. 73, 836 A.2d 1167, 1174 (2003) (stating that the sanction must be proportional to violation and is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Even were we to find an abuse of discretion, which we do not, the respondent was not prejudiced by the hearing judge\u2019s decision. Although Mr. James alleges that he lacked the ability to cross-examine Mr. Kazim, and \u201crefresh\u201d his recollection, as to dates and times, the record reflected that Mr. James used Mr. Kazim\u2019s complaint to the AGC to refresh his recollection of four visits that Mr. James conducted with Mr. Kazim that lasted approximately a half an hour or less and numerous messages that Mr. Kazim left for Mr. James on the latter\u2019s cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Mr. James also refers in this exception to \u201cthe two cash deposits totaling $1,476.30\u201d noted in the findings of fact, as coming from Mr. Kazim\u2019s $1,500 check, to support a finding of prejudice. The gravamen of the issue surrounding the money is that none of Mr. Kazim\u2019s retainer ever was placed in a trust account, including the $500 allegedly to be paid to an investigator. Further, Mr. James, in his answer to the Petition for Disciplinary Action, admitted that, \u201cUpon receipt of Kazim\u2019s $1,500 check, the Respondent cashed the check and thereafter made two cash deposits into his operating account totaling $1,476.30.\u201d This exception is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Neither Petitioner nor Respondent takes any specific exception to the Conclusions of Law rendered by Judge Jackson with respect to both complaints. Judge Jackson found violations of MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.15(a), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d); Maryland Rule 16-604, 16-607, 16-609; and Sections 10-304 and 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">With respect to Rule 1.1 requiring competent representation to a client, we heretofore have noted that in the Kazim matter, James did not provide \u201cthe legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation\u201d because even with cursory research James would have found that tort damages are not allowed based upon adultery. <em>Doe v. Doe, </em>358 Md. at 124, 747 A.2d at 624 (\u201cThis Court decided twenty years ago that public policy would not allow tort damages based upon adultery.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">With respect to the Davis matter, Respondent had a negative balance resulting from the inclusion of $10.00 in the Smith check over the amount that should have been paid and an insufficient funds charge in his escrow account at the time he deposited the $8,000 Davis settlement into his escrow account, causing the Davis settlement monies to be \u201clessened\u201d by the Smith arrearage. The net proceeds due Ms. Davis from the $8,000 settlement was $1,774.75, and was not maintained intact during the period it was held in the escrow account, so that on three different days there was less than $1,774.75 in James\u2019s escrow account. We previously have held that a \u201c[r]espondent\u2019s failure to properly maintain [a client\u2019s] settlement monies in his escrow account demonstrates his incompetence pursuant to Rule 1.1.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>380 Md. 661, 667-68, 846 A.2d 428, 432 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In January of 2000, James began using his escrow account, in which he previously deposited funds from a settlement for Ms. Davis, for both business and personal expenses. We have previously held that \u201c[s]uch conduct constitutes clear and convincing evidence of commingling\u201d in violation of Maryland Rule 16-607. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 469, 800 A.2d 782, 786 (2002). James intentionally ceased using his personal account and began using his trust account, and Ms. Davis\u2019s funds contained therein, for both business and personal expenses after discussion with his spouse. Because James\u2019s conduct with respect to his misuse of Ms. Davis\u2019s funds was a willful violation of Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, he is subject to discipline under Section 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 461, 671 A.2d 463, 469 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The same behavior in the Davis matter as well as James\u2019s failure to deposit Mr. Kazim\u2019s retainer and $500 in funds to be paid to an investigator also violated MRPC 1.15(d) and 8.4(d) as funds \u201cto be delivered in whole or in part to a client or third person,\u201d and Maryland Rules 16-604 and 16-609 and Section 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 671 A.2d at 469; <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 632, 714 A.2d 856 (1998). We have previously held that \u201cviolations of ... MRPC 1.15 ... \u2018necessarily\u2019 result in a violation of MRPC 8.4(a) as well.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gansler, </em>377 Md. 656, 699 n. 22, 835 A.2d 548, 573 n. 22 (2003), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 710-11, 810 A.2d 996, 1018 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The funds given to James by Mr. Kazim as a retainer and to pay for the costs of an investigator qualify as \u201ctrust money\u201d under Section 10-301 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. <em>See In re Printing Dimensions, Inc., </em>153 B.R. 715, 720 (Bankr.D.Md.1993). James\u2019s failure to deposit the \u201ctrust money\u201d violated Section 10-304 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, which requires that \u201ca lawyer expeditiously shall deposit trust money into an attorney trust account.\u201d Md.Code (2000, 2004 RepLVol.), \u00a7 10-304(a) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 299, 818 A.2d 219, 233 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Judge Jackson also concluded that the Respondent violated MRPC 1.3 and 1.4 in his handling of the Kazim matter. Rule 1.3 required Respondent to exercise reasonable diligence and promptness in representing his client and Rule 1.4 required the Respondent to keep Mr. Kazim reasonably informed about the status of his matter, comply with reasonable requests for information and explain with reasonable necessity a matter to permit informed decision-making on the part of the client. The Respondent clearly did not act competently in pursuing a cause of action with his client that had no legal basis, and failed to convey any information, let alone informed data, to Mr. Kazim, even in the face of repeated telephone calls from the client. He not only failed to act, he also did not react to his client\u2019s attempts to contact him, even though James had collected $1,500 to pursue a baseless cause of action. This unprofessional behavior is violative of Rules 1.3 and 1.4. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. West, </em>378 Md. 395, 409, 836 A.2d 588, 596 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The hearing judge determined that James acted in violation of MRPC 8.4(c) when he dishonestly took trust monies from Mr. Kazim by failing to deposit the $500 retainer and investigative money in the trust account. We have previously held that \u201c[i]ntentional misappropriation is also a violation of MRPC Rule[ ] ... 8.4(c).\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>381 Md. 680, 704, 852 A.2d 82, 96 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Finally, the hearing judge found that James violated MRPC 8.1 by failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s letters of July 9, 2003, July 30, 2003, September 11, 2003, and September 24, 2003, requesting information regarding Mr. Kazim\u2019s complaint. Mr. James\u2019s wilful and repeated failure to respond constitutes conduct that was violative of Rule 8.1. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Rose, </em>383 Md. 385, 392, 859 A.2d 659, 663 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">As we recently stated in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Goodman, </em>381 Md. 480, 850 A.2d 1157 (2004), the appropriate sanction for a violation of the MRPC depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, including consideration of any mitigating factors. <em>Id. </em>at 496, 850 A.2d at 1166; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>374 Md. 505, 526, 823 A.2d 651, 663 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McClain, </em>373 Md. 196, 211, 817 A.2d 218, 227 (2003). Primarily, we seek \u201cto protect the public, to deter other lawyers from engaging in violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, and to maintain the integrity of the legal profession.\u201d <em>Awuah, </em>374 Md. at 526, 823 A.2d at 663, quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 303, 818 A.2d 219, 236 (2003). To achieve the goal of protecting the public, we impose a sanction that is \u201ccommensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The Petitioner has requested that we disbar Respondent and we agree. The hearing judge did not find any mitigation for James\u2019s actions nor has the Respondent offered any. Mr. James acted in direct violation of 1.3, 1.4, 1.15, and 8.4, Maryland Rules 16-604, 16-607, and 16-609, and Maryland Code, Sections 10-304, 10-306, and 10-307 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. Mr. James misappropriated Ms. Davis\u2019 funds in escrow, misappropriated Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Kazim\u2019s money by not placing funds in escrow, and by using client funds for personal purposes. We have often stated that, \u201c[i]ntentional [misappropriation, by an attorney, of funds entrusted to [an attorney\u2019s] care \u2018is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and, in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, will result in disbarment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Spery, </em>371 Md. 560, 568, 810 A.2d 487, 491-92 (2002); <em>see also Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 410, 773 A.2d 463, 483 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">To compound the problem, Mr. James, in violation of MRPC 1.1, has acted incompetently and, in violation of MRPC 8.1, repeatedly has failed to respond to requests of Bar Counsel. Certainly, such conduct reflects Mr. James\u2019s inability to avoid further misconduct.
