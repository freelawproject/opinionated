At issue also is whether the trial court properly quashed subpoenas for the children to testify during the review hearing or <em>in camera.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Samone H., born on July 20, 1996, and Marchay E., born on January 19,1991, are the children of Katina M. On September 24, 1996, after investigating allegations of neglect regarding Samone H., the Baltimore City Department of Social Services (BCDSS) filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Division of Juvenile Causes, requesting that Samone H. be removed from Katina M.\u2019s care and declared a child in need of assistance (CINA)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the BCDSS claimed, among other allegations, that Katina M. had a history of drug abuse and had failed to provide adequate care for Samone H. The court conducted an emergency shelter care hearing<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and ordered \u201cBCDSS to provide care and custody for [Samone] in shelter care, pending [an adjudicatory] hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 18, 1997, the Circuit Court ordered Samone H. to be placed with a relative who BCDSS identified as her great-grandmother. Subsequently during the adjudicatory hearing Samone H. was declared a CINA by the Circuit Court but returned to Katina M. under an Order of Protective Supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>sion by BCDSS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Six weeks after the Baltimore City Police had responded to a call to the great-grandmother\u2019s residence because Katina M. had locked Samone H., Marchay E., and the great-grandmother in the house, BCDSS took custody of Samone H. and Marchay E. Thereafter, BCDSS petitioned to remove the children from the care of Katina M. and also to declare Marchay E. a CINA. After an emergency hearing, the Circuit Court ordered that both children be committed to the custody of BCDSS and placed in the care of the great-grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Within a month, on July 18, 1997, BCDSS requested that the Circuit Court remove the children from the great-grandmother\u2019s care and commit them to the custody of BCDSS with placement in the foster home where they currently reside. On January 27,1998, the Circuit Court conducted an adjudicatory hearing, determined Marchay E. to be a CINA and ordered both Samone H. and Marchay E. to remain in the custody of BCDSS. The court also established a permanency plan<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>have both children live with relatives capable of caring for them. During this time, Katina M. was allowed one supervised visit per month with each of the children.'</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Thereafter, the Circuit Court conducted periodic review hearings<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and on June 24, 1999, the court revised the permanency plan to a concurrent permanency plan of adoption or placement with a relative. The Circuit Court again changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>the permanency plan to one of adoption after another review hearing had occurred on December 6, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Katina M. then filed a motion for reconsideration seeking to change the permanency plan from adoption to reunification. During an annual review hearing held on March 1, 2002, Mary Gilliard, a BCDSS case worker assigned to the case since 1999, testified that Marchay E. and Samone H. should not be removed from their foster home because they were \u201cvery bonded\u201d with the foster family. Ms. Gilliard further testified that the visits between Katina M. and the children were \u201cgoing pretty well\u201d and that the children were glad to see Katina M. When questioned about the detrimental effect of discontinuing the visits, Ms. Gilliard appeared to have differing opinions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">[CHILDREN\u2019S COUNSEL]: There also is some emotional attachment between the children and their biological Mother, that\u2019s correct also?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">[MS. GILLIARD]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">[CHILDREN\u2019S COUNSEL]: And it would be detrimental to cut off that relationship between the children and their Mother, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">[MS. GILLIARD]: Yes, it would at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">While in response to questioning by Katina M.\u2019s attorney on the same subject, Ms. Gilliard testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Okay, do you think the children have an emotional bond with their Mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">[MS. GILLIARD]: I can\u2019t [answer] that question for you right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Do you think stopping the visits between the children and the Mother would be detrimental to the children?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-14\">[MS. GILLIARD]: I don\u2019t think so, no no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-15\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]:It would be okay, you don\u2019t think they would mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-16\">[MS. GILLIARD]: Nah, I don\u2019t think so at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Even though they\u2019re loving and caring with their Mother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">[MS. GILLIARD]: For the time that they\u2019re with them, they are you know, for that hour, but I don\u2019t think it would be detrimental to them if they don\u2019t see their biological Mom, because with the foster Mom they have been there so long so this is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Okay, but I\u2019m just talking about as far as the biological Mom and her children and you\u2019re saying it would be, there would be no harm done to stop the visits today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">[MS. GILLIARD]: Maybe to the biological Mom, but not to the children, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">During the March 1, 2002 hearing, Katina M. also testified about her visits with Marchay E. and Samone H:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">My visits are great. They don\u2019t want to be leaving, they get sad. Like I said, Samone tells me to follow them and Marchay told me that any \u2014 I asked Marchay when do she rather see me, the beginning of the month or the end. She said it doesn\u2019t really matter just as long as she [sees] me. She just don\u2019t want to not see me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">After hearing the testimony, the judge concluded that it would be in the children\u2019s best interests to remain in foster care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az7\">[There] is no doubt in mind as to ... what\u2019s in the best interest of the children and that\u2019s what I\u2019m concerned with. Not the best interest of the Father, not the best interest of the Mother, not in the best interest of the foster parents. It\u2019s what\u2019s in the best interest of the children. There\u2019s no question in this Court\u2019s mind that the children have been in foster care for a very, with the same family, for a very substantial time. Most of their lives. One child is only 5, the other child is 11. They have been in foster care since 1997. So, for a good part of their lives, for one almost the whole life and the other for at least half their lives, approximately half. There is no question in the Court\u2019s mind that they\u2019re bonded to the foster parents. That they consider the foster family as their family. I don\u2019t question that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Mother has turned herself around, but for many years she hadn\u2019t turned herself around and so to disrupt the children, to remove the children from the place where they\u2019ve lived for a good part of their lives would be detrimental to them and would serve no useful purpose....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">At the same time that the court ordered the permanency plan for adoption to continue, the judge also ordered Katina M.\u2019s supervised visits with the children to be increased to one hour two times per month and issued a separate order denying Katina M.\u2019s motion for reconsideration, which she appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Thereafter, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s ruling and held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Katina M.\u2019s request to change the permanency plan. The intermediate appellate court emphasized that the trial judge properly had considered the children\u2019s best interests in reviewing the permanency plan based upon the guidelines set forth in Maryland Code, Section 5-525(e) of the Family Law Article, because he had assessed the potential harm to Marchay E. and Samone H. if removed from their current placement; the length of time the children were with their foster family; and any bond the children had with the foster family and their biological mother. As such, the Court of Special Appeals held that there was \u201csufficient evidence in the record to support the Circuit Court\u2019s decision that a permanency plan of adoption [was] in the best interests of Marchay and Samone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Within one year, on March 13, 2003, the Circuit Court held another review hearing. Prior to the hearing Katina M. filed a motion for independent study seeking to have the children evaluated by a psychiatrist to provide an assessment of her relationship with her children and whether removing the children from foster care would be harmful; she also subpoenaed both Marchay E. and Samone H. to testify. At the hearing, before the judge who had presided at the March 2002 hearing, Katina M. argued that an independent study of her bond with her children would assist the court in determining whether to change the permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I did file a motion for independent study concerning matters relevant to the case. In that motion, I stated that the Department had in the past alleged that there was not a sufficient bond between the children, respondents, and my clients that they are \u2014 that stated that removal of the respondents from the foster parents would be harmful to the respondents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">Obviously, there is a TPR[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] pending to terminate my clients\u2019 rights. That the allegations regarding the bonding were made by the worker but not by any clinician, that the only way for the mother to rebut these allegations was to have an independent examination that the foregoing was sufficient good cause to order an examination, and that the examination would be conducted by our expert at a place and time convenient for the respondents, and that would not be harmful to the respondents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">Just to give you a little background, Your Honor, we did have a hearing before you on March 1st, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Again, Your Honor, we did not hear from any clinician about any bond. My client would like, and the court should want, an independent evaluation of the bond between the children and the mother because that would assist the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>and certainly all parties, in making a decision in this matter. This examination would not cause harm to the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">This issue had been through the appellate courts before, Your Honor. And <em>In re Mark M., In re Adoption of Mark M., </em>I have those cases if you\u2019d like to take a look at them. If I could get the clerk to hand these up. In those cases, the Department alleged that Mark was in a fragile mental state, and would be harmed by the evaluation. They claimed that the examination would have a catastrophic effect on Mark. In that case, the child had not seen his mother for over a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">Now, in this case, Your Honor, my client sees these children twice a month. I\u2019m not aware of any allegations that an examination would cause harm or would be, have a catastrophic effect on the children. And even if there were, Your Honor, in <em>In re Mark M. </em>and <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship of Mark M., </em>the court ordered that the mother be allowed to conduct an examination anyway. Despite the Department\u2019s allegation. And if you look at <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship, </em>Your Honor, it\u2019s very clear in that matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">And without a clinical evaluation, there is no way for the mother to rebut the Department\u2019s conclusion that there is no bond. The Court of Appeals in <em>Adoption/Guardianship of Mark M. </em>found that to deny such an evaluation would mean that Social Services is the only one able to present evidence on bonding. And because of that, because to otherwise not allow a mother\u2019s ability to defend her parental and constitutional rights, ordered that she be allowed to conduct an evaluation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">Also in <em>Mark M., </em>Your Honor, the Court of Appeals found that the mother, this is <em>Adoption Guardianship of Mark M., </em>the Court of Appeals found that the mother was a caring parent, had overcome her substance abuse problem, and considering the magnitude of the mother\u2019s rights, said an evaluation was appropriate. Here, again, Your Honor, my client has done all those things. She does care for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>children. And it would be appropriate to have an evaluation be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">I would ask the Court to apply both <em>In re Mark M. </em>and <em>In re Adoption Guardianship of Mark M., </em>and order that evaluation be done by the mother\u2019s expert. Your Honor, we are offering Brian Zamitsky, who is a psychiatrist who works at the Crownsville Hospital Center. He is responsible for conducting in patient and out patient juvenile forensic psychiatric evaluations for the juvenile court system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">We believe that this examination can be done with no harm to the child. The only harm I\u2019ve heard alleged so far from child\u2019s counsel is that the children would be removed from school for the evaluation. Certainly, we could work-I\u2019m not sure if that rises to the level of harm, but certainly we could work around the children\u2019s school schedule in order to accommodate the examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Both BCDSS and the children\u2019s attorney objected to the independent study arguing that an evaluation would be harmful to the children because the psychiatrist would be unfamiliar with the children and might delve into their past. Katina M. countered that the expert\u2019s evaluation would be limited to the \u201cbonding issue,\u201d without having to probe into the children\u2019s past experience with their mother. When the court denied the motion for independent study, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-9\">[KATINA. M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: In rebuttal, Your honor, I do think that there is controversy over whether the children have a bond with their mother or not. And I think that\u2014 [THE COURT]: Well, I don\u2019t think there is because\u2014 [KATINA. M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Well, the other thing, Your Honor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-10\">[THE COURT]: Because I heard the worker testify as to viewing the meetings between the children and the mother\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>\u2014and I was satisfied then and I\u2019m satisfied now that there is very little bond, if any, between, very little bond with the mother. All the bonding is with the foster family, the custodians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">THE COURT: I am not going to have an independent, in the sense of having some psychologist or psychiatrist say, interview the children. I am not going to put them through that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Your Honor, how can I rebut that, then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[CHILDREN\u2019S COUNSEL]: It\u2019s harmful to the children. [KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: How can I rebut it? That is the question. If I can\u2019t rebut it, then we\u2019re just saying well, the court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">THE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: \u2014 DSS rolls along without me having a say so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-9\">THE COURT: You rebutted it by the mother\u2019s description of her relationship with the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-10\">[KATINA M.\u2019s COUNSEL]: Now you\u2019re saying I can\u2019t. I mean, how am I going to \u2014 I think that\u2019s why we need the independent. We\u2019ve got my client and the Department of Social Services who both clearly have biases in this case. That\u2019s why an independent evaluation would be appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM6\">After lengthy argument between the parties, the trial judge stated: \u201cOkay. I am not at this point going to grant an \u2018independent evaluation\u2019 by mom\u2019s expert or anybody else\u2019s expert. Period. That ends it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">BCDSS thereafter, moved to quash the subpoenas to have Marchay E. and Samone H. testify or, in the alternative, to have the children testify <em>in camera. </em>Katina M. objected to having the children testify <em>in camera </em>and expressed concern about allowing the judge to question the children in her absence. In response to the motion to quash, the trial judge ruled: \u201cI am not putting young children on the stand. Peri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>od.\u201d and stated, \u201c[a]nd I\u2019m not going to do-I\u2019m not going to interview them in chambers. I\u2019m not going to interview them in the courtroom ... I am going to quash the subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The review hearing then proceeded to the merits of the case in which the court heard testimony from Ms. Gilliard and Katina M. regarding the children\u2019s placement and their relationship with both their foster family and Katina M. At the conclusion of the testimony, the court reaffirmed the permanency plan of adoption and held that the children should remain committed to the custody of BCDSS. Katina M. noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In an unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court first addressed whether the lower court had erred in denying Katina M.\u2019s request for an independent study and held that she had .failed to meet her burden of demonstrating good cause for the examination. The intermediate appellate court further opined that Katina M. had failed to show that the examination would not be harmful to the children. In reaching its decision, the Court of Special Appeals held that although Katina M. had tendered the name of the expert and had proposed that a \u201cstudy\u201d of the children would exclude a discussion of their past history, she did not \u201cproffer how the study would be conducted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The intermediate appellate court then addressed the trial court\u2019s decision to quash the subpoenas for Marchay E. and Samone H., and concluded that the children had been represented by counsel at both hearings and that \u201ctheir wishes ... \u2018clearly [had been] before the court for its consideration\u2019 \u201d without there being evidence of misrepresentation by their counsel. The intermediate appellate court emphasized that Katina M. had objected to opposing counsel\u2019s suggestion that the children be interviewed <em>in camera </em>and had \u201cnot claim[ed] that the children\u2019s wishes regarding visitation with her had been misrepresented.\u201d Thus, the Court of Special Appeals held that the lower court had not abused its discretion in quashing the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Katina M. filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">1. Is this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Mark M., </em>365 Md. 687, 782 A.2d 332 (2001), approving independent examinations of children in CINA cases limited to situations where the proposed examination is the subject of other expert opinion offered in the proceeding, and, in this case, did the trial court fail to adequately balance the <em>Mark M. </em>considerations when it refused to grant a requested independent bonding evaluation because it \u201cwas satisfied\u201d that \u201cthere is a very little bond, if any ... with the mother\u201d and it was not in the children\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d \u201cto put them through that?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion when it refused to hear from the children at the permanency planning review hearing on the grounds that \u201cI am not putting young children on the stand. Period.\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not going to interview them in chambers?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We granted the petition and issued the writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">In the present case, Katina M. asks us to review the trial court\u2019s order denying her motion for independent study during a permanency plan review hearing in which the plan remained static. As a threshold matter, we must consider whether the trial court\u2019s order is properly appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In general, appeals may only be taken from a final judgment of the trial court pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which states that \u201ca party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil ... case\u2019 ... [whether] entered ... in the exercise of original, special, limited, or statutory jurisdiction, unless ... expressly denied by law.\u201d <em>Smith v. Taylor, </em>285 Md. 143, 146, 400 A.2d 1130, 1132 (1979) (internal citations omitted). For the trial court\u2019s ruling to be a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>judgment it must either determine and conclude the rights of the parties involved or deny a party the means to \u201cprosecut[e] or defend[ ] his or her rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773 (1989). In considering whether a particular court order or ruling constitutes an appealable judgment, we assess whether any further order was to be issued or whether any further action was to be taken in the case. <em>See Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41-42, 566 A.2d at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">An order that is not a final judgment is considered to be an interlocutory order and ordinarily is not appealable unless it falls within one of the statutory exceptions set forth in Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-303 of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article. <em>See In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. 429, 434, 765 A.2d 624, 627 (2001). Relevant to our discussion is the exception embodied in Section 12-303 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">A party may appeal from any of the following interlocutory orders entered by a circuit court in a civil case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">(3) An order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">(x) Depriving a parent, grandparent, or natural guardian of the care and custody of his child, or changing the terms of such an order....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 12-303(x) of the Court and Judicial Proceedings Article. In <em>In re Damon M., </em>we assessed whether an appeal would lie from an order entered after a permanency plan review hearing in which the plan had been amended from reunification to long-term foster care, <em>id. </em>at 432-33, 765 A.2d at 626, and held that \u201can order amending a permanency plan calling for reunification to foster care or adoption [was] immediately appealable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438, 765 A.2d at 628.

We have held that \u201cthe best interests of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>child may take precedence over the parent\u2019s liberty interest in the course of a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute.\u201d <em>Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 219, 721 A.2d at 669; <em>see also In re Adoption No. 109141, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d at 208 (stating that \u201cthe controlling factor ... is ... what best serves the interest of the child\u201d). That which will best promote the child\u2019s welfare becomes particularly consequential where the interests of a child are in jeopardy, as is often the case in situations involving sexual, physical, or emotional abuse by a parent. As we stated in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994), the child\u2019s welfare is a consideration that is of transcendent importance\u2019 when the child might otherwise be in jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 561, 640 A.2d at 1096 (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">We have recognized that in cases where abuse or neglect is evidenced, particularly in a CINA case, the court\u2019s role is necessarily more pro-active. <em>See In re Justin D., </em>(357 Md. 431, 448, 745 A.2d 408, 417 (2000) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">A trial court, acting under the State\u2019s <em>parens patriae </em>authority, is in the unique position to marshal the applicable facts, assess the situation, and determine the correct means of fulfilling a child\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 365 Md. at 705-07, 782 A.2d at 343-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">B. Permanency Plans in CINA Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">In response to concerns that children were being lost in the foster care system without belonging to a permanent family, Congress enacted Public Law 96-272, the \u201cAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980,\u201d codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 670-79 (1988), which required states, among other things, to \u201cprovide a written case plan for each child for whom the state claims federal foster care maintenance payments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(16); <em>see also In re Yve S., </em>373 Md. at 574-75, 819 A.2d at 1044. Pursuant to Congress\u2019s mandate, Maryland created a statutory scheme directing the department of social <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>services to \u201cdevelop and implement a permanency plan that [was] in the best interests\u201d of those children committed to the local department of social services. <em>In re Yve S., </em>873 Md. at 574, 819 A.2d at 1044, quoting <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10W, </em>335 Md. at 103-06, 642 A.2d at 203-05 (1994); Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 2002 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-525(e) of the Family Law Article. In <em>In re Damon M., </em>we identified the importance of a permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">The permanency plan is an integral part of the statutory scheme designed to expedite the movement of Maryland\u2019s children from foster care to a permanent living, and hopefully, family arrangement. It provides the goal toward which the parties and the court are committed to work. It sets the tone for the parties and the court and, indeed, may be outcome determinative. Services to be provided by the local social service department and commitments that must be made by the parents and children are determined by the permanency plan. And, because it may not be changed without the court first determining that it is in the child\u2019s best interest to do so, the permanency plan must be in the child\u2019s best interest. These are the reasons, no doubt, that the court is charged with determining the plan and with periodically reviewing it, evaluating all the while the extent to which it is being complied with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">362 Md. at 436, 765 A.2d at 627-28. Most recently, in <em>In re Yve S. </em>we explained the need for trial courts to review permanency plans to ensure that children are being cared for in the best possible manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">As <em>In re Damon M. </em>observes, the purpose of a permanency plan is to set the direction in which the parent, agencies, and the court will work in terms of reaching a satisfactory conclusion to the situation. Once set initially, the goal of the permanency plan is re-visited periodically at hearings to determine progress and whether, due to historical and contemporary circumstances, that goal should be changed. It is not the purpose of the initial permanency plan hearing, however, to resolve all issues involved in that final resolution. If that were the case, there would be no need for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>review of how, on a regular basis, the plan is progressing or not. Also as <em>In re: Damon M. </em>indicates, the initial permanency plan hearing is to be held and conducted expeditiously. Protracted proceedings in establishing the initial plan defeat the purpose of the statute. The statute presumes that, unless there are compelling circumstances to the contrary, the plan should be to work toward reunification, as it is presumed that it is in the best interest of a child to be returned to his or her natural parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">378 Md. at 582, 819 A.2d at 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In <em>In re Yve S. </em>quoting from <em>In re Damon M., </em>we also delineated the requirements a trial court must follow when implementing a permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">[T]he court has the responsibility for determining the permanency plan, \u00a7 3-826.1(a)(l) and justifying the placement of children in out of home placements for a specified period or on a long-term or permanent basis, \u00a7 3-826.1(d), in addition to conducting periodic, six month reviews. \u00a7 3-826.1(f).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">Section 3-826.1 [now codified as Section 3-823 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] requires the court, not later than 11 months after a child found to be in need of assistance has been placed in foster care, see also Md.Code (1989, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1997 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7 501(m) of the Family Law Article, to hold a permanency planning hearing to determine the permanency plan for that child. \u00a7 3-826.1(a)(1) [now \u00a7 3-823(b)(l) ].

In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>articulating the importance of the parent-child relationship to the development of a child, Dr. Perry has opined that the attachment bond has several key elements, namely, that it is an \u201cenduring emotional relationship with. a specific person; ... the relationship brings safety, comfort, soothing and pleasure; ... and loss or threat of the person evokes intense distress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Studies of bonding, then, involve an evaluation of emotional relationships, or more specifically, as the Judicial Education Center of New Mexico (JEC) has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-6\">The purpose of a bonding study is to determine whether a bond or attachment exists between a parent and a child____ The bonding issue in permanency planning is the extent to which the parent is capable of caring for the child from the perspective of bonding and attachment.

JEC, 87 Child Welfare Handbook, Bonding or Interactional Study 37.1.3 (Jud. Educ. Ctr.1997, 2003 Supp.) [hereinafter \u201cChild Welfare Handbook\u201d]. Bonding studies trace their roots back to the 1930\u2019s when researchers began to analyze the interaction between mother and child. <em>See </em>David E. Arredondo, M.D., and Hon. Leonard P. Edwards, <em>Attachment, Bonding, And Reciprocal Connectedness, </em>2 J. Ctr. for Fam, Child. &amp; Cts. 109,110 (2000) [hereinafter \u201cAttachment &amp; Bonding\u201d]. Eventually, during the 1960s and 1970\u2019s, Dr. Mary Ainsworth, a distinguished researcher in developmental psychology, with other researchers and clinicians, conducted experiments in which she monitored the behavior of an infant child by having the child sit with the parent in a furnished playroom while a stranger would enter and then leave. Subsequently, the parent would then leave and reenter. <em>Id. </em>at 13. As a part of the experiment, Dr. Ainsworth would observe the child for signs of distress, attachment, and any exploratory behavior when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>caregiver would leave and reenter the room. Based upon the child\u2019s responses, Dr. Ainsworth would provide an opinion about the child\u2019s relationship with the parent. <em>Id. </em>Her experiments became the basis for modern bonding studies that are often presented in juvenile and family court proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Although bonding studies apparently have been conducted during the last thirty years, if not longer, there appear to be no uniform procedures for conducting such studies. In 1988, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) published guidelines for conducting a psychological evaluation of a child in custody dispute, <em>see </em>Child Custody Consultation: Report of the Task Force on Clinical Assessment in Child Custody 1 (1988) [hereinafter \u201cTask Force Report\u201d], and suggested that when assessing the parent-child bond, the psychiatrist should observe the interaction between the child and parent and measure whether the parent is able to empathize and communicate with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 6. To discern any \u201cbond,\u201d the task force report suggested that the psychiatrist also may ask the child to draw pictures of the family and make \u201cwishes\u201d about what is important to him or her, and also could present scenarios to elicit responses from the child evidencing his or her feelings toward each parent. <em>Id. </em>Although it cannot be predicted how many interviews the psychiatrist would need to conduct with the child, the task force report opined that eight to eighteen sessions may be required. <em>Id. </em>at 8. In addition, the task force indicated that the psychiatrist should conduct interviews of the parents and other persons of importance, such as the grandparents, stepparents, or caregiver, and examine any social service records, school reports, psychological test results, or medical records of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In the juvenile or family court context, bonding studies are used to evaluate the quality of the parent-child relationship, which may assist the court in determining the nature and extent of the custody it could chose to award to the parent figure. <em>See Bonding &amp; Attachment, </em>at 114. In particular, these studies have been used to decide questions regarding permanency planning, foster care, a parent\u2019s ability to nurture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the child, custody disputes, and other placement decisions and arise when a psychologist or psychiatrist is called to testify in a court proceeding. <em>See Bonding &amp; Attachment, </em>at 114. The American Psychological Association explained the role of a psychologist or psychiatrist in a juvenile proceeding as that of a professional expert who maintains an impartial stance when informing and advising the court of the relevant psychological factors involved in a custody dispute. <em>See </em>American Psychological Association, 49 Guidelines for Child Custody Evaluations in Divorce Proceedings No. 7, 677-80 (July 1994) [hereinafter \u201cChild Custody Evaluations\u201d]. In addition, social workers also offer opinions on the existence of bonding in the parent-child relationship. <em>See Bonding &amp; Attachment, </em>at 114. According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), clinicians participate in approximately one million legal cases annually. <em>See </em>David Faust &amp; Jay Ziskin, <em>The Expert Witness in Psychology and Psychiatry, </em>Science Resource Center 1 (1988). Often, when psychologists or psychiatrists are asked to complete a bonding study or evaluation they submit a report to the court detailing their findings and opinions. <em>Id. </em>Dr. David Arredondo and Judge Leonard Edwards, Superior Court of California, identified practical questions a judge should ask when evaluating a clinician\u2019s report, including the expert\u2019s qualifications, the methods employed in conducting the evaluation, and the child\u2019s family relationship. <em>Bonding &amp; Attachment </em>at 121-22.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Furthermore, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) set forth criteria developed by several clinicians and researchers on how to conduct a child custody evaluation: when conducting the evaluation of the child the psychiatrist should assess the continuity and quality of the attachment between the parent and child. <em>See </em>AACAP, Practice Parameters for Child Custody Evaluations at 5 (1997) [hereinafter \u201cPractice Parameters\u201d]. In making such assessments, the clinician should examine all medical, educational, and psychiatric records that are available and that may provide information on the parenting of the child. <em>Id. </em>at 13. In addition, the evaluator should interview the parents, the caregiver, and the children to ascertain the nature of their interactions with each other. <em>Id. </em>at 13-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The Fresno County, California Mental Health Plan Provider Manual (July 2002) [hereinafter \u201cFresno County Manual\u201d] also provides insight into the conduct of bonding studies, which are \u201cconducted when the case is set for a permanent plan hearing and possible termination of parental rights\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">It is a structured analytical interview including a mental health assessment (define or rule out clinical diagnosis using DSM IV) of both parent(s) and the child(ren), conducted by a Licensed Mental Health Clinician with appropriate experience.

In the case before us, Katina M. sought a change of the existing permanency plan to reunification during the review hearing, and in support thereof, requested a bonding study under Section 3-816 to refute the testimony, which she classified as expert, of the social worker who testified about the level of bonding between the children and Katina M. and the foster parents. We recognize that the levels of bonding or \u201cattachment and emotional ties\u201d to the child\u2019s parent, and to the \u201ccaregiver,\u201d testified by the social worker, are significant facts to be considered in the development of a permanency plan pursuant to Section 5-525(e)(ii) and (iii) of the Family Law Article, but are not the only factors, so that the denial of a bonding study would not <em>per se </em>affect parental rights in the permanency planning context.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">We also have not previously addressed whether a social worker\u2019s testimony on \u201cbonding\u201d should be considered as factual or as expert opinion, governed by Maryland Rule 5-702,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> as Katina M. has asked us to do, which she posits supports appealability of the denial of the bonding study. In this regard, the Court of Special Appeals, although not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>dressing this specific question, has limited a social worker\u2019s testimony during CINA proceedings to lay observations of the children. In <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship Nos. 2152A 2153A, 2154A, </em>100 Md.App. 262, 641 A.2d 889 (1994), the Court of Special Appeals held that the social worker was competent to testify as a lay witness \u201cabout the behavior of the children that she heard and saw first hand and the efforts that she undertook to prepare the children for the changes that they were facing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 276, 641 A.2d at 895, all of which were factual matters compared to evaluative opinions, but limited the social worker so that she would not be \u201cpermitted by the trial court to express any expert opinion about the adjustments of the children to their foster homes.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Various of our sister states have determined social worker\u2019s testimony about bonding to be equivalent to expert testimony when it was evaluative in nature. <em>See In re Luke M. et al., </em>107 Cal.App.4th 1412, 132 Cal.Rptr.2d 907, 917 (2003) (considering social worker\u2019s testimony, \u201cit would be detrimental for [the children] to live with [the biological father] in Ohio because they were bonded with [the foster parents],\u201d to be evaluative in nature); <em>In the Interest of S.O. et al., </em>483 N.W.2d 602, 604 (Iowa 1992) (determining that social worker\u2019s testimony was evaluative when she described the bond between the mother and her two older daughters as unhealthy); <em>In re the Adoption of M.T.S., </em>489 N.W.2d 285, 287 (Minn.App.1992) (qualifying two social workers as experts to testify about the child\u2019s bond with the natural parents); <em>In the Matter of Amanda Broadway, </em>191 Or.App. 78, 81 P.3d 99, 103 (2003) (viewing social worker\u2019s testimony that the \u201cmother and her children had a 'strong attachment\u2019 to each other\u201d as evaluative in nature); <em>Roberts v.

It is not necessarily the nature of the testimony in the action that controls the decision, but whether the proponent of the examination satisfies the factors articulated in <em>In re Mark M., </em>to \u201cdemonstrate good cause for such an examination,\u201d show that the examination is \u201creasonably calculated to assist the trier of fact in rendering its decision,\u201d and establish that the \u201cproposed examination will not be harmful to the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717-18, 782 A.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">With respect to the last factor in deciding whether a psychological examination would be harmful to a child, courts of other jurisdictions have considered the age and emotional condition of the child, the nature of the allegations of abuse and neglect, the strength of the relationship between the child and parent, and the child\u2019s difficulty in discussing family related issues. <em>See In the Matter of Thea T., </em>174 Misc.2d 227, 663 N.Y.S.2d 502, 504 (NY.Fam.Ct.1997); <em>Matter of Nicole, </em>146 Misc.2d 610, 551 N.Y.S.2d 749, 751-52 (NY.Fam.Ct.1990); <em>In re Child M., </em>452 Pa.Super. 230, 681 A.2d 793, 802 (1996). In addition, courts have assessed the nature of the examination by probing the qualifications of the clinician conducting the evaluation, including: his or her training, background, experience; the number of sessions the child would meet with the therapist; and the methodology employed during the sessions. <em>See In the Matter of Kaitlyn S., </em>148 Misc.2d 276, 560 N.Y.S.2d 88, 93 (NY.Fam.Ct.1990); <em>Matter of Nicole, </em>551 N.Y.S.2d at 752-53; <em>In re Child M., </em>681 A.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the court exercised its discretion in denying Katina M.\u2019s motion for a bonding study, but confirmed the permanency plan with additional time for visitation based, in part, upon the court\u2019s view of the bond that the children had with Katina M. and the caregiver. As such, the denial of the bonding study would only be appealable as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>interlocutory order under Section 12-303(x) if it deprived Katina M. of her right to care and custody of the children or changed the terms of her parental rights. <em>See In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. at 438, 765 A.2d at 628. In maintaining the permanency plan to proceed with the adoption of the children, the trial court continued the permanency plan from the prior year, as well as allowed Katina M. increased access to her children. Katina M.\u2019s rights would have been implicated had she made the motion for bonding study and appealed its denial when the court changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption pursuant to Section 3-823(e) and (g) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and our decision in <em>In re Damon M., </em>362 Md. 429, 765 A.2d 624 (2001), but not when the judge continued the plan and increased visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We acknowledge that bonding studies can be beneficial to the determination of a permanency plan and may assist the court in making decisions about a child\u2019s placement. Nevertheless, based upon the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s order denying the motion for such a study is not an appealable final judgment and does not constitute an interlocutory order under Section 12-303(x).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-9\">(3) it must be completely separate from the merits of the action; and</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The second issue for consideration is whether the trial court erred in quashing the subpoenas for the children to testify during the permanency plan review hearing and declining to interview the children <em>in camera. </em>The trial judge\u2019s actions arose within the context of a permanency plan review hearing, after which he continued the previous permanency plan of adoption, as well as increased Katina M.\u2019s visitation. Because the order continuing the permanency plan did not adversely affect Katina M.\u2019s parental rights or change the terms of the permanency plan to Katina M.\u2019s increased detriment, the trial judge\u2019s actions are not reviewable by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO DISMISS APPEAL; PETITIONER TO PAY COSTS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-6\">.

To be appealable under this narrow exception, the order must satisfy the following four requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">(1) it must conclusively determine the disputed question;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-8\">(2) it must resolve an important issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">(4) it must be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-11\"><em>See Dawkins v. Baltimore City Police Department, et al., </em>376 Md. 53, 58, 827 A.2d 115, 118 (2003); <em>In re Foley, </em>373 Md. 627, 633-34, 820 A.2d 587, 591 (2003); <em>Montgomery County v.

We have emphasized that \u201c[tjhe four elements of the test are conjunctive in nature and in order for a prejudgment order to be appealable and to fall within this exception to the ordinary operation of the final judgment requirement, each of the four elements must be met.\" <em>Dawkins, </em>376 Md. at 59, 827 A.2d at 118. \u201cFurthermore, in Maryland the four requirements of the collateral order doctrine are very strictly applied, and appeals under the doctrine may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>entertained only in extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Pittsburgh Corning v. Janies, </em>353 Md. 657, 666, 728 A.2d 210, 214 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">A court order denying a molion for independent study is not appeal-able as a collateral order. First, an order denying a motion for independent study does not conclusively determine the question of whether the permanency plan should have been changed from adoption to reunification. The trial court pursuant to Maryland Code, Section 3-801(1) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article and Maryland Code, Section 5-525(e) of the Family Law Article, considers several factors in reviewing the permanency plan, one of which is the parent-child relationship. Second, although a motion for independent study is important in permanency planning, it is not completely separate from the merits of the action because such studies are one factor that the court relies upon to assess child placement. Finally, the motion for independent study is reviewable on appeal when its denial affects the parental custodial rights. Thus, the collateral order doctrine is also unavailable as a means to appeal the court\u2019s order denying Katina M.\u2019s motion for independent study.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
