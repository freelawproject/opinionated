Brisbon, the respondent, a Petition for Disciplinary Action, in which it was alleged that she violated Rules 1.3 (Diligence);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.4 (Communication); <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 8.4 (Misconduct),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>pendix: Rules of Professional Conduct of the Maryland Rules, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 16-812. We referred the matter, pursuant to Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the Honorable Bonita J. Dancy of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The respondent having failed to respond to the Petition, an order of default, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-618(b),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was entered against her. Although notified, as required by Rule 2-613(c),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> that the order of default had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>entered and despite indicating that she likely would do so, the respondent failed to move to vacate the order, as required by Rule 2 \u2014 613(d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the passage of more than 30 days, the hearing judge conducted a hearing, after which she issued a Memorandum of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, making findings of fact and drawing conclusions of law, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"AME\">\u201cThis court finds that the averments made in the Petition for Disciplinary action in this matter are deemed admitted and the following findings of fact are established by clear and convincing evidence supported by exhibits admitted and the uncontroverted testimony of the Complainant, Oretha Tenezee Bailey and her present attorney, Jaime W. Aparisi at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"A7Sy\">\n<em>\u201cBackground Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AJe\">\u201cThe Respondent, Brenda C. Brisbon was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 20, 1997 and is presently decertified by Order of the Court of Appeals, dated August 25, 2003, for failure to comply with pro bono requirements pursuant to Md. Rule 16-903.</p>\n<p id=\"AWb\">\u201cBC Docket No. 2003-235-4-6</p>\n<p id=\"AmA\">\n<em>The Complaint of Oretha Tenezee Bailey</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AuN\"> \u201cThe Respondent was retained by Oretha Tenezee Bailey for representation in connection with an application for asylum before the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Respondent charged and collected a fee of approximately $ 1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"AkO\">\u201cThe Respondent and Complainant attended an initial interview with an INS agent. Citing material inconsistencies between the applicant\u2019s testimony and the application and/or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>other evidence, that agent referred the matter to an immigration judge. Respondent appeared with Ms. Bailey at a hearing before an immigration judge on March 20, 2002. That judge directed Complainant and Respondent to administratively close the asylum application or refile it in proper form within sixty (60) days (by May 20, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_\">\u201cComplainant immediately asked Respondent to administratively close the asylum application. The Respondent failed to act on her client\u2019s behalf. Having failed to diary, [or] otherwise note the deadline date of May 20, 2002 on her calendar, Respondent took no action on behalf of her client. As direct result of Respondent\u2019s failure to act by the May 20, 2002 deadline, the immigration judge rendered a decision and order finding against the application for asylum and ordered Complainant\u2019s departure under voluntary terms until September 5, 2002 with an alternate order of removal to her country of origin, Liberia. That decision noted that the fact that the application was not re-filed or closed and no extension was requested compelled the judge to find against the application.</p>\n<p id=\"AkIi\">\u201cDue to Respondent\u2019s failure to act on [her] behalf, if an appeal from the adverse ruling of the immigration judge is not overturned, Complainant is to be removed to Liberia where she was exposed to potential serious threats to her safety, personal liberty and health. Moreover, Complainant will not be able to reapply for asylum in the United States for a period of ten (10) years from the date of immigration court\u2019s order, that is August 6, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"A_t\">\u201cTestimony from Complainant and her present attorney indicates the action of the Immigration Court resulting from Respondent\u2019s failure to re-file or close the pending application for asylum have not been overturned on appeal. The Complainant faces deportation after October, 2004 whenever her temporary protected status is revoked and not extended.</p>\n<p id=\"A0h\">\u201cThe Respondent failed to competently prepare herself and her client for representation before the Immigration and Naturalization Service interview agent and immigration and judge on the hearing for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>\u201cRespondent failed to diligently pursue the legal matter for which she was retained for the benefit of her client, Oretha Tenezee Bailey, and failed to follow and pursue the instructions and directions of her client in the pursuit of that legal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">\u201cThe respondent failed to adequately explain and set forth the alternatives to her client or otherwise failed to respond to requests for information in connection with the representation of her client, Oretha Tenezee Bailey, specifically in connection with the client\u2019s instructions to administratively close the case on the application for asylum. When Complainant received no response to her inquiries regarding this matter, she believed Respondent had administratively closed the matter, when, in fact the Respondent failed to do anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">\u201cUpon notice of the allegations of the Complainant the Petitioner began a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of the Respondent and forwarded the complaint to the Respondent by letters dated November 7, 2002, December 4, 2002, January 7, 2003 and January 31, 2003. Although these requests for information were received by the Respondent she failed to respond to those requests for information by Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201cDue to the Respondent\u2019s failures to respond to requests for information in connection with a disciplinary investigation an investigator was assigned to conduct an investigation and interview the Respondent. At that interview the Respondent admitted to having received the previous requests for information sent by the Petitioner and admitted she failed to provide a timely response, or any response to those written requests. The Respondent failed to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority in connection with a disciplinary investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\u201cThe court concludes based upon the findings established by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent violated Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3, 1.4(a)(b) and 8.4(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The petitioner filed <em>Petitioner\u2019s Exceptions and Recommendation For Sanction, </em>in which it takes exception to the hearing court\u2019s failure to find that the respondent violated Rule 8.1(b), as alleged. It argues that the findings of fact support such a violation, pointing out that the hearing court detailed the letters sent to the respondent, seeking a response to the complaint filed by the complainant, and reported that the respondent conceded both receiving the letters and failing to respond to them. From those findings, the petitioner submits, the conclusion that the respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) necessarily follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">We review the findings of fact made by the hearing court to determine if they are based on clear and convincing evidence. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Zdravkovich, </em>381 Md. 680, 694, 852 A.2d 82, 90 (2004); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McCoy, </em>369 Md. 226, 234, 798 A.2d 1132, 1137 (2002); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 287, 614 A.2d 102, 108 (1992); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Clements, </em>319 Md. 289, 298, 572 A.2d 174, 179 (1990). <em>See </em>Md. Rule 16-759(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, and in fact, the \u201chearing court\u2019s findings of fact are prima facie correct and will not be disturbed unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ashworth, </em>381 Md. 561, 575, 851 A.2d 527, 535 (2004); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Garland, </em>345 Md. 383, 392, 692 A.2d 465, 469 (1997) (citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldsborough, </em>330 Md. 342, 347, 624 A.2d 503, 505 (1993)). Exceptions will be overruled when the findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>McCoy, </em>369 Md. at 234-235, 798 A.2d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The petitioner\u2019s exception with respect to the 8.1(b) violation is sustained. The petitioner is correct in that regard, the respondent has conceded the violation. There is ample evidence to support the other findings of fact made by the hearing court and, just as important, those factual findings justify the conclusions drawn from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">With regard to sanction, the petitioner recommends that the respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. Revisiting the Rule violations charged and found, it submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cThe serious consequences of Respondent\u2019s misconduct visited upon her client, compounded and aggravated by her failure to cooperate with the Petitioner militate! ] the recommendation of an indefinite suspension of the Respondent from the practice of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-6\"> It is now so well settled as not to require citation of authority, that the purpose of attorney disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public and not to punish the erring attorney. We have also been clear, the public is protected when the Court imposes sanctions commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). Thus, the facts and circumstances of a given case are critical in the decision whether to impose a sanction and, if so, what sanction. That decision, we have said, is informed and guided, however, by certain factors. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ashworth, </em>381 Md. 561, 577, 851 A.2d 527, 536 (2004). In addition to nature, gravity and intent, we identified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\u201cthe attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, including whether there have been prior disciplinary proceedings, the nature of the misconduct involved in those proceedings and the nature of any sanctions imposed, as well as any facts in mitigation ... whether the attorney is remorseful for the misconduct ... and the likelihood of the conduct being repeated.... With respect to the latter factor, the likelihood of recidivism, we have held that the voluntary termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>nation of the charged misconduct, when accompanied by an appreciation of the impropriety of having engaged in it and remorse for having done so, may be evidence that the attorney will not again engage in such misconduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 851 A.2d at 537 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The respondent did not respond to the Petition for Disciplinary Action and she never appeared in these proceedings. The nature of respondent\u2019s conduct is egregious and has cost her client an opportunity to pursue U.S. citizenship and possibly jeopardized her safety. Furthermore, the respondent\u2019s choice not to appear prevents this court from examining whether she is indeed remorseful. She, consequently, has not presented anything by way of mitigation for the Court to consider. Maryland Rule 16-757(b)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> places on the respondent the burden of establishing a matter of mitigation. There simply is nothing in this record that could, or would, mitigate the respondent\u2019s conduct. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Daskalopoulos, </em>383 Md. 375, 384, 859 A.2d 653, 658 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Under the circumstances, we accept the petitioner\u2019s recommendation and order the respondent indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. See <em>Ashworth, </em>381 Md. at 563, 851 A.2d at 527 (indefinite suspension, rather than disbarment, where, <em>inter alia, </em>respondent did not respond promptly to bar counsel\u2019s request for information and did not timely advise client of receipt of settlement check); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Macdougall, </em>384 Md. 271, 863 A.2d 312 (2004) (sanction for failing to keep estate representatives informed regarding estate and failing to respond to disciplinary inquiry, indefinite suspension with right to apply for readmission after sixty days).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>\n<em>IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715.C, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST BRENDA C.
