Sean Kelly, made a request to discharge counsel when he expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney during trial. If Campbell\u2019s statements constitute a request to discharge counsel, we also must determine whether the trial court properly denied the request. We conclude that under the circumstances of this case, Campbell\u2019s expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney qualified as a request to discharge counsel that was properly denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">On November 16, 2001, Destiny Campbell, then thirteen months old, was in the care and custody of her father, Bernard Campbell, when she suffered second degree burns to her lower torso and legs, a deep-colored bruise on her left cheek, a small cut across her nose, and a skull fracture. She was rushed to the hospital by her mother and treated by doctors, who called the Baltimore County Police Department to report Destiny\u2019s injuries. Baltimore County Police began an investigation of the incident, questioned Campbell, inspected his home, and obtained a warrant for Campbell\u2019s arrest. Campbell was arrested and charged with two counts of child abuse<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and three counts of assault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>Subsequently, Campbell\u2019s ease was set for trial but was interrupted after Campbell became disruptive during the course of the proceedings. The trial judge declared a mistrial after an evaluation of Campbell\u2019s competency yielded a conclusion that, in fact, Campbell was competent but exhibited a history of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">At the second trial, Campbell\u2019s attorney, who had been trial counsel for the first time as well, had the following colloquy prior to Campbell being brought into the courtroom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">[CAMPBELL\u2019S COUNSEL]: I[\u2019d] just like to just let the court be aware that I am a little bit apprehensive. I have a client that\u2019s off the hook, so to say. One of the reasons why we are still with that case is because when we were trying this case before Judge Cahill he went off and started throwing things and screaming and yelling in the court and the judge stopped the proceeding near the end of the State\u2019s case and had him NCR. He comes back with a high score in the history of malingering. That\u2019s what they said, Your Honor. So I told him today that we have to make an election [i.e., whether to elect a court or a jury trial]. THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">[CAMPBELL\u2019S COUNSEL]: And he is determined not to make an election, he has a lot of things he\u2019d like to say to the court. And he is threatening me and that\u2019s where my apprehension comes in, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Deputies escorted Campbell into the courtroom, and Campbell elected to be tried by a jury. Campbell then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>[CAMPBELL]: Okay \u2014 I say Your Honor \u2014 I would like a postponement because of the fact that this guy didn\u2019t come see me, talk to me about this case in nine months since the first case in April. And on the behalf that I have somebody in this very same townhouse complex that daughter had got burnt by the same hot water that my daughter got burnt in and she \u2014 would like for her to come to court to testify as a witness saying that her daughter got burnt by mistake at the same place in the hot water. And I got this defense on my side this man do not know nothing about. And I need a postponement for me to subpoena her to court to say this in front of the jury so, therefore, I have a lot of things going for me in my defense that I like to bring up as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Campbell\u2019s attorney responded that he had visited Campbell \u201cseveral times in the last month\u201d and that Campbell\u2019s witness was not material to the case. The trial court recessed the case to have the administrative judge consider Campbell\u2019s request for postponement, which was denied. Following the recess, Campbell told the court that he \u201cwould like to challenge the array of the jury,\u201d to which the court explained that such a challenge could not be made until \u201cthere was an array.\u201d When asked by the court whether there was anything else, Campbell replied: \u201cNo. Not until the trial starts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">While the judge discussed the questions to be asked during <em>voir dire </em>of the potential jury members, Campbell indicated that he wanted to address the court, and the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">THE COURT: What would you want to say if you came up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">[CAMPBELL]: I bring it up later. We bring it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">[CAMPBELL\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, Mr. \u2014 just to let the court know because it\u2019s going to come up, Your Honor, my client has done some attempt to acquaint himself with the law while he\u2019s been locked up. He has done some reading in the area of the law. And he\u2019s read just enough to think now that he can take over this ease. He wants to challenge the jury array. We don\u2019t know who is in the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>array. And he wants, he has some argument about conflict of interests. I \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">THE COURT: Who\u2019s conflict of interest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">[CAMPBELL\u2019S COUNSEL]: I can\u2019t see it, Your Honor, but that\u2019s what he wants to talk to you about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">THE COURT: I have no idea what it\u2019s about. [CAMPBELL]: That\u2019s \u2014 Your Honor, we bring it up, we will bring it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">[CAMPBELL]: We will bring it up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The trial proceedings continued and at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Campbell\u2019s counsel asked for a brief recess because Campbell was \u201cinterested in the plea [agreement] that was initially offered [by the State].\u201d After a short recess, Campbell\u2019s counsel stated that Campbell had refused the State\u2019s offer. Thereafter, Campbell again wanted to address the court and the following conversation ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">THE COURT: Yes sir. What do you want to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-12\">[CAMPBELL]: [My attorney], this guy right here, my public defender, Your Honor, he told me that just a few minutes ago that I already lost the case, the jury ain\u2019t like me, the jury, before even the case was started, the jury was already going to convict me any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-13\">I don\u2019t like this man as my representative. He ain\u2019t have my best interest at heart. He told me I am dumb just a few minutes ago, that I deserve this, that I should get all these years, and he is my representative. How is he going to tell me this and he representing me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-14\">THE COURT: Well, let me ask you this; Would you rather have a lawyer tell you, I mean, let\u2019s say you could pick anybody, and one lawyer will tell you exactly what you want to hear, not what the lawyer really thinks from their experience. They will tell you, Oh, you know, it is going to be fine, everything is okay, you have a great shot, and everything like that, what you want to hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Or, would you rather have a lawyer tell you what the lawyer honestly thinks from their experience. I would think I would want, if it was me, I would rather have somebody tell me the truth when I am facing, what you are facing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">Now, all [your attorney] can do is give you his advice. That is all a lawyer can do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">[CAMPBELL]: That is a conflict with the attorney. That is a conflict. We had conflicts way before this ever started, man in the first trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">THE COURT: Well, we are beyond that at this point, sir. We are now at the point where I guess we are ready to go to the jury if there is no other evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">[CAMPBELL]: This ain\u2019t no fair trial. The man told me he ain\u2019t going to represent me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">THE COURT: He is representing you. He hasn\u2019t done anything to not represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">[CAMPBELL]: Under force, because you all wouldn\u2019t let me fire him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, now, he says you do not want to testify; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">[CAMPBELL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-13\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. Is there any other evidence, [Campbell\u2019s Counsel], that you have to offer? [CAMPBELL\u2019S COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">The trial proceeded with instructions to the jury and closing arguments. On the same day, the jury returned its verdict and found Campbell guilty of child abuse and first-degree assault. Thereafter, on April 2, 2003, the trial judge imposed a fifteen-year sentence for child abuse and a consecutive twenty-five-year sentence for first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Campbell argued that the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of his request to discharge counsel should be reversed because the judge did not properly inquire about the reasons for his request. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with Campbell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>that the trial judge should have made further inquiry based upon Campbell\u2019s statements that his attorney did not have his \u201cbest interests at heart\u201d and that the two had \u201cconflicts way before this ever started.\u201d In the view of the Court of Special Appeals, the Circuit Court briefly opined on the quality of Campbell\u2019s attorney rather than assessing the reasons for the request, which amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">Did the Court of Special Appeals majority misapply <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996), to conclude that additional inquiry is required when a defendant raises a mid-trial complaint about his counsel, but does not explicitly ask to discharge counsel, and the trial court has responded to the complaint raised?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">We granted the petition and issued the writ of certiorari, 382 Md. 688, 856 A.2d 724 (2004). We reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, even though we agree that Campbell\u2019s request was adequate to trigger a mandatory inquiry by the trial judge about Campbell\u2019s reasons for seeking to discharge his counsel, because we hold that Campbell\u2019s request occurred after \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the request for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that an additional inquiry into the reasons for a discharge of counsel request was required in this case pursuant to our decision in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996). In the State\u2019s view, Campbell\u2019s statements to the trial court were \u201ccomplaints\u201d and did not rise to the level of a request to discharge counsel. Alternatively, the State argues that if Campbell\u2019s \u201ccomplaints\u201d are found to be a request to discharge counsel, the request was untimely because \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had commenced. Furthermore, the State asserts that the judge sufficiently acknowledged Camp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>bell\u2019s request and made a reasonable assessment that the request lacked merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Campbell argues that a request to discharge counsel is not required to be \u201cartfully worded or precisely espoused,\u201d and that his statements amounted to a request for new counsel, which was not properly addressed by the lower court. Campbell maintains that in assessing a request for discharge of counsel even when made after the trial begins, the judge must still determine the reason for the request before deciding whether a dismissal should be allowed. According to Campbell, if the judge had conducted the proper inquiry the request to discharge might have been granted. Therefore, Campbell argues that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in its conclusion that the trial court had not properly ascertained the reasons for Campbell\u2019s request to discharge counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">A. Request to Discharge Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">A defendant\u2019s request to discharge counsel implicates two fundamental rights that are guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the assistance of counsel and the right of self-representation. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 412-13, 676 A.2d 513, 517 (1996); <em>Fowlkes v. State, </em>311 Md. 586, 589, 536 A.2d 1149, 1151 (1988); <em>Parren v. State, </em>309 Md. 260, 262-63 523 A.2d 597, 598 (1987); <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 119, 486 A.2d 163, 166 (1985); <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 123, 406 A.2d 98, 99 (1979). The right to counsel may be waived by the defendant provided that \u201che knows what he is doing and his choice is made with his eyes open.\u201d <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 589, 536 A.2d at 1151 quoting <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 242, 87 L.Ed. 268, 275 (1942). A waiver of the right to counsel must \u201cordinarily [be] an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 119, 486 A.2d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In circumstances where a defendant elects to forego the assistance of counsel to represent himself, the court must permit the defendant to proceed <em>pro se </em>if the request is timely and unequivocal. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 413-14, 676 A.2d at 518; <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 589, 536 A.2d at 1151, citing <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2527, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Because a defendant, by choosing to represent himself, is waiving the right to counsel, the court must conduct an inquiry to ensure that the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is knowing and intelligent. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 414, 676 A.2d at 518, citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464-65, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938); <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 589, 536 A.2d at 1151; <em>Snead, </em>286 Md. at 130, 406 A.2d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Alternatively, a defendant may elect to discharge his counsel to obtain substitute counsel. Under these circumstances, the defendant must be afforded an opportunity to explain the reasons for the request and only may substitute counsel if good cause is shown, although the defendant is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>entitled to substitute a specific appointed attorney if represented by the Office of the Public Defender. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 414, 676 A.2d at 518; <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 199-204, 670 A.2d 398, 410-11 (1995); <em>Fowlkes, </em>311 Md. at 605, 536 A.2d at 1159.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">In this case we first must decide whether Campbell\u2019s statements should have been construed as a request to discharge counsel. Maryland Rule 4-215(e) outlines the procedures a court must follow when a defendant desires to discharge his counsel to proceed <em>pro se </em>or to substitute counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW5\">If a defendant requests permission to discharge an attorney whose appearance has been entered, the court shall permit the defendant to explain the reasons for the request. If the court finds that there is a meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court shall permit the discharge of counsel; continue the action if necessary; and advise the defendant that if new counsel does not enter an appearance by the next scheduled trial date, the action will proceed to trial with the defendant unrepresented by counsel. If the court finds no meritorious reason for the defendant\u2019s request, the court may not permit the discharge of counsel without first informing the defendant that the trial will proceed as scheduled with the defendant unrepresented by counsel if the defendant discharges counsel and does not have new counsel. If the court permits the defendant to discharge counsel, it shall comply with subsections (a)(l)-(4) of this Rule if the docket or files does [sic] not reflect prior compliance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>The Rule was designed to protect both the right to counsel and the right to self-representation and ensures that decisions to waive counsel would pass constitutional muster. <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 424, 676 A.2d at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The Rule, however, is silent as to what level of discourse is required to discharge counsel. This Court addressed that issue in <em>Snead v. State, </em>286 Md. 122, 406 A.2d 98 (1979), in which we considered whether a defendant\u2019s statements were sufficient to invoke the right of self-representation. At trial, the defendant, Richard Lee Snead, filed a motion for continuance and also orally expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney by stating: \u201cI feel as though that [sic] I would like to get a delay in this case to get my nephew and my family time to get another attorney. From my understanding, [my attorney], the way he is talking, I am guilty before I even come in the courtroom.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125, 406 A.2d at 100. The trial court denied Snead\u2019s motion for continuance and stated that his attorney would not be discharged, after which the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-6\">[SNEAD]: He told me every time he come to see me, he tell me I am guilty before I come in the courtroom. Why should I have a man \u2014 he feels that way, before I come into the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">THE COURT: Make your mind up [your attorney] is going to represent you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">[SNEAD]: I can\u2019t get time for my people to get me no attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">THE COURT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">[SNEAD]: I don\u2019t want no attorney then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 126, 406 A.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Snead was convicted, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, but this Court reversed, reasoning that, \u201cany statement by the defendant from which the court could reasonably conclude that the defendant desired self-representation would be sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 406 A.2d at 101. In so holding, we found that Snead\u2019s statements were sufficient to require an inquiry by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the trial court as to whether the defendant wanted to represent himself. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">We iterated this conclusion in <em>Leonard v. State, </em>302 Md. 111, 486 A.2d 163 (1985), in which, the defendant, Leonard, requested a continuance to discharge his attorney and proceed <em>pro se:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">THE COURT: I understand you want to conduct your own defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-7\">[LEONARD]: That\u2019s the only choice I got.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">THE COURT: I take it your answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-9\">[LEONARD]: It\u2019s got to be yes. It\u2019s the only choice I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-11\">THE COURT: Alright. I\u2019m going to allow [your current attorney] to stay....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-13\">[LEONARD]: I don\u2019t want you to allow him to do nothing. I have a right to do it [ ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 125, 486 A.2d at 170. Leonard further stated that his attorney was \u201cno legal advisor for [him]\u201d and that he did not want his attorney at the defense table. <em>Id. </em>The judge denied Leonard\u2019s request to represent himself, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, <em>id. </em>at 118, 486 A.2d at 165, but this Court reversed, holding that Leonard\u2019s statements were an obvious expression of his desire or inclination to represent himself. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 486 A.2d at 170. Quoting from <em>Snead, </em>we stated that \u201c[a]ny statement by the defendant from which the court could reasonably conclude that the defendant desired self-representation would be sufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 486 A.2d at 169. Moreover, we explained that \u201ca defendant is not required to utter a talismanic phrase so as to place the court on notice that he desires self-representation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-16\">Further, in <em>State v. Brown, </em>342 Md. 404, 676 A.2d 513 (1996), statements made by defense counsel were treated as a request to discharge counsel. The defendant stood indicted on various counts of drug distribution and possession, <em>id. </em>at 409-10, 676 A.2d at 516, and prior to testimony by the State\u2019s first witness, the following dialogue occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: My client wishes to dismiss me at this point in time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-5\">THE COURT: For what reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I guess on the advice of his father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-7\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S FATHER]: You can\u2019t represent him. You don\u2019t know nothing about his case, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-8\">THE COURT: We are in the middle of the trial. We will proceed. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Am I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-10\">THE COURT: You are still counsel, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 676 A.2d at 526. The judge denied the request to discharge counsel, which was reversed by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 676 A.2d at 516. This Court held that the trial judge was required to conduct an inquiry as to why the defendant made the request once \u201cthe defendant <em>indicate[d] a desire </em>to dismiss counsel.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 425, 676 A.2d at 523 (emphasis added); <em>see also Fowlkes v.

If possible I would rather get rid of her, get a new attorney\u201d were sufficient to warrant the trial court\u2019s inquiry of the defendant\u2019s desire of self-representation); <em>State v. Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 264, 347 A.2d 219, 224 (1975) (finding that the appropriate inquiry was made by the trial court when the defendant expressed no confidence in trial counsel and requested different counsel).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Campbell\u2019s statement regarding his dissatisfaction with his attorney, if timely, should have triggered an- inquiry by the court as to whether Campbell wanted to discharge his counsel. Campbell made several statements to the court about his dissatisfaction with his attorney: \u201cI don\u2019t like this man as my representative;\u201d \u201cWe had conflicts way before this ever started, man in the first trial;\u201d \u201cThe man told me he ain\u2019t going to represent me;\u201d \u201cHe ain\u2019t have my best interest at heart;\u201d \u201c[Y]ou all wouldn\u2019t let me fire him.\u201d As we noted in <em>Snead </em>and <em>Leonard, </em>Campbell\u2019s request did not need to be a talismanic phrase or artfully worded to qualify as a request to discharge, so long as a court could reasonably conclude that Campbell sought to discharge his counsel. <em>See Snead, </em>286 Md. at 127, 406 A.2d at 101; <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 124, 486 A.2d at 170. Based upon Campbell\u2019s expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney, a court reasonably could deduce that Campbell sought to discharge his counsel. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 429-30, 676 A.2d at 526; <em>Snead, </em>286 Md. at 127, 406 A.2d at 101; <em>Leonard, </em>302 Md. at 124, 486 A.2d at 170.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">B. Right to Discharge Counsel After Meaningful Trial Proceedings Begin</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Our focus now must shift to the logistical requirements imposed upon a request to discharge counsel. We have held that a defendant\u2019s right to waive counsel and proceed <em>pro se </em>or to substitute counsel is more limited once \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d have begun, because the mandatory nature of Rule 4-215(e) is inapplicable, and the \u201cdecision to permit discharge of counsel after trial has begun is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 420, 676 A.2d at 521. In the exercise of discretion, the judge is required to \u201cconduct an inquiry to assess whether the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>dant\u2019s reason for dismissal of counsel justifies any resulting disruption,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 428, 676 A.2d at 525, through consideration of the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">(1) the merit of the reason for discharge; (2) the quality of counsel\u2019s representation prior to the request; (3) the disruptive effect, if any, that discharge would have on the proceedings; (4) the timing of the request; (5) the complexity and stage of the proceedings; and (6) any prior requests by the defendant to discharge counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">In <em>Brown, </em>we examined what constitutes \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d and noted that \u201cthe exact point in time when the right to discharge counsel is curtailed,\u201d can differ. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 676 A.2d at 522.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Quoting from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>553 F.2d 886 (5th Cir.1977), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">A defendant must have a last clear chance to assert his constitutional right. If there must be a point beyond which the defendant forfeits the unqualified right to defend pro se, that point should not come before meaningful trial proceedings have commenced. We have not entered the age of \u201cstop-watch jurisprudence!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-9\"><em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">Since <em>Brown, </em>we have had occasion in <em>State v. Wischhusen, </em>342 Md. 530, 677 A.2d 595 (1996), to determine whether \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d had begun when a request to dismiss counsel was made. In <em>Wischhusen, </em>defense counsel was not present when the jury, during deliberations, asked the judge a clarification question. <em>Id. </em>at 533, 677 A.2d at 596. The judge, prior to reinstructing the jury, asked the defendant if he wanted to have his counsel present, to which the defendant replied in the negative. <em>Id. </em>at 535, 677 A.2d at 597. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>defendant was convicted, and the Court of Special Appeals, reversed holding that the judge should have obtained a waiver of counsel pursuant to Rule 4-215(e). <em>Id. </em>We reversed and held that \u201calthough Rule 4-215 applies <em>up to and including the beginning of trial, </em>the Rule does not apply after meaningful trial proceedings have commenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 677 A.2d at 601 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In the present case, Campbell made a request to discharge counsel at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief and after defense counsel had announced that Campbell had elected to remain silent. We find that \u201cmeaningful trial proceedings\u201d definitely had begun, rendering Rule 4-215(e) inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The trial judge did ask Campbell if he wanted to address the court after the State had rested its case, to which Campbell stated his reasons for wanting to discharge his attorney, which included alleged conflicts existing between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>himself and his attorney during the prior and current trials; and his lawyer\u2019s comments that he would not represent him, that the jury was going to convict him [Campbell], and that he should receive a long sentence. In addition, Campbell\u2019s attorney explained the problems that had existed between the two. Because Campbell\u2019s reasons for wanting to dismiss his counsel were apparent based upon his statements, the trial judge was not required to make any further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">After having the dialogue, the trial judge denied Campbell\u2019s request. Balancing the <em>Brown </em>factors against the countervailing considerations of permitting Campbell to discharge counsel compels us to agree. <em>See Brown, </em>342 Md. at 428-29, 676 A.2d at 525. The trial judge\u2019s response to Campbell\u2019s request reflected his assessment that the request lacked merit: that Campbell was incorrect in stating that his counsel did not act in his best interest because defense counsel had expressed a negative view to Campbell about the outcome of the case. The other <em>Brown </em>factors, whether the discharge of counsel would have a disruptive effect on the proceedings, the timing of the request, and the complexity and stage of the proceedings, likewise support the trial court\u2019s decision because Campbell\u2019s request came after the State had already concluded its case-in-chief and only the closing arguments and the jury instructions remained. The disruptive effect of Campbell dismissing his attorney and either proceeding <em>pro se </em>or substituting counsel so late in the proceedings supports our expression in <em>jBrown </em>that requests to discharge should not be used as \u201celeventh hour\u201d tactics to delay the trial or to confuse the jury, and \u201cmust be limited to prevent undue interference with the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>342 Md. at 414-15, 676 A.2d at 518. Consideration of the final <em>Brown </em>factor, whether any prior requests had been made, further yields the conclusion that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Campbell\u2019s request; the record does not reflect that prior requests to dismiss counsel were made, but that when Campbell had been given an opportunity to address the court he elected to \u201cbring it up later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Judge Raker, when speaking for this Court in <em>Brown, </em>was clear that \u201c[although the trial judge need not engage in a full-scale inquiry pursuant to Rule 4-215, the judge must at least consider the defendant\u2019s reason for requesting dismissal before rendering a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 676 A.2d at 526. Here, the trial judge considered the reasons for Campbell\u2019s request to discharge his counsel and articulated reasons for the denial of the request based upon the <em>Brown </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">We, therefore, conclude that Campbell\u2019s statements to the trial court qualified as a request to discharge counsel. When Campbell made the request after meaningful trial proceedings had commenced, the judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied Campbell\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">BELL, C.J. and RAKER, J., Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">RAKER, J., dissenting, in which BELL, C.J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and hold that under the circumstances of this case, the trial judge should have made further inquiry of the defendant as to the reasons he wished to discharge his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACIT\">\u201cIn this case, the circuit court did not determine the reason for the requested discharge of counsel. Appellant articulated that counsel \u2018ain\u2019t have my best interest at heart,\u2019 that the two had \u2018conflicts way before this ever started,\u2019 and that counsel \u2018told me he ain\u2019t going to represent me.\u2019 Although appellant\u2019s statements were made after he and counsel had discussed the plea offer, the circuit court did not determine if appellant\u2019s concerns resulted from counsel\u2019s assessment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the case and recommendation to plead guilty or from something entirely different. Instead, the circuit court briefly opined on the merits of an attorney who would \u2018tell me the truth [about] what I am facing.\u2019 Either the circuit court did not recognize the request to discharge counsel and did not exercise its discretion or, if it did, it made no inquiry as to the reason and did not provide the rationale for denying appellant\u2019s request. Therefore, we are constrained to reverse the judgments of the circuit court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The intermediate appellate court was right on in its analysis, especially when considered in context of the earlier colloquy between defense counsel and the court. Defense counsel told the court that he was apprehensive, that his client \u201cwas off the hook,\u201d and that \u201che is threatening me.\u201d Respondent told the court before the trial started that he wanted a postponement (which was denied subsequently by the administrative judge) and that \u201cthis guy [defense counsel] didn\u2019t come see me, talk to me about this case in nine months since the first case in April.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The record does not establish that the trial court considered the reasons for respondent\u2019s request to discharge his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Chief Judge BELL has authorized me to state that he joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\">.
