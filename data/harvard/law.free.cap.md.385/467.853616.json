The jury awarded Jasmine $500,000 that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was later reduced by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to $350,000, pursuant to the cap on non-economie damages. Both parties appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">While the matter was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, we decided <em>Brooks v. Lewin Realty III, Inc., </em>378 Md. 70, 835 A.2d 616 (2003), in which we held that \u201cin order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action, all that a plaintiff must show is: (a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621. <em>Brooks </em>overruled <em>Richwind Joint Venture 4 v. Brunson, </em>335 Md. 661, 645 A.2d 1147 (1994), which held that \u201ca landlord is not liable for a defective condition on the property unless the landlord knows or has reason to know of the condition and had a reasonable opportunity to correct it.\u201d <em>Richwind, </em>335 Md. at 673, 645 A.2d at 1153 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Polakoff and Chase argued to the Court of Special Appeals, as they do here, that <em>Brooks </em>should apply prospectively only. They claim that they relied on the notice standard enunciated in <em>Richwind </em>regarding lead paint and that it would be unfair to hold them to the \u201cnew\u201d notice standard of <em>Brooks. </em>The intermediate appellate court applied the general rule that a new holding applies to all pending cases and concluded that the <em>Brooks </em>decision and the notice requirement enunciated therein applied to the present case. <em>Polakoff v. Turner, </em>155 Md.App. 60, 69-70, 841 A.2d 406, 412 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>By petition for <em>writ of certiorari </em>to this Court, Polakoff and Chase challenge the ruling of the Court of Special Appeals asserting that <em>Brooks </em>should apply prospectively, that the intermediate appellate court erred in applying <em>Brooks </em>to the case at bar, that <em>Brooks </em>was wrongly decided, and that the trial court erred in denying their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because there was insufficient evidence to prove that they had reason to know of the flaking, loose, or peeling paint. We granted <em>certiorari </em>on May 14, 2004. <em>Polakoff v. Turner, </em>381 Md. 324, 849 A.2d 473 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">We reaffirm our holding in <em>Brooks </em>and hold that the standard for establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case based on a violation of the Baltimore City Housing Code (\u201cCode\u201d) as enunciated therein applies to all cases not final at the time <em>Brooks </em>was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">In March of 1985, Lelia Whittington (\u201cLelia\u201d) and her daughter, Crystal Whittington (\u201cCrystal\u201d), moved into a residential rental property located at 17 North Bentalou Street. 17 North Bentalou is a row house located in Baltimore City. It was built prior to 1950 and was later determined to contain lead-based paint. While residing at the property, Crystal gave birth to Jasmine on April 3, 1990. The women lived in the home for nine years until August of 1994 when Polakoff asked them to move out.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Polakoff was the owner of 17 North Bentalou from 1975 until June 30, 1992, when he transferred the property to C.F.A.S. Limited Partnership(\u201cCFAS\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While under his ownership, Polakoff hired a property manager to handle day-to-day management and maintenance. After the sale to CFAS on June 30, 1992, Chase Management (\u201cChase\u201d) took over the day-to-day operation of managing the property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>Lelia and Crystal testified that prior to moving into the Bentalou property they conducted a walk-through to inspect it. Both women testified that the windowsills, and baseboards had been freshly painted before they moved. The paint on the windowsills, however, was \u201cbumpy\u201d from having been applied on top of old chipping paint. Crystal testified that the majority of the walls had wallpaper on them but those that were painted had been freshly painted and were \u201csmooth.\u201d The women testified that during their tenancy they noticed that the paint around the windows had begun to chip and flake. Crystal testified that she noticed chipping and flaking paint about <em>W </em>years into the tenancy, while Lelia testified that she noticed the chipping \u201cabout two to three years\u201d into the tenancy. Crystal also testified that around the same period of time, l/t years into the tenancy, the wallpaper began to peel away from some of the walls, revealing painted walls with disintegrating plaster behind the wallpaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Prior to Jasmine\u2019s birth, a workman painted the two windowsills in the living room. The paint was applied again over top of the chipping and flaking paint without removing the old paint. According to testimony, the paint continued to chip. Other than the one time the windowsills were painted, no other painting or repairs to the chipping and flaking paint were made during the nine-year tenancy. There was testimony, however, that other repairs were made to the house, including work on the windows themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In early 1993, when Jasmine was almost three years old, a routine physical revealed that she had elevated levels of lead in her blood.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Doctors placed Jasmine on a special diet and gave her iron to treat the poisoning. Crystal was also in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>structed to remove anything from the home that could contribute to Jasmine\u2019s lead levels, e.g., lead containing dust.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Polakoff testified that at the time of the trial he had been in the real estate business for approximately thirty (30) years. He testified that at the time he leased the premises to the Whittingtons, he was aware of the following: that most housing in Baltimore City built before 1950 would probably contain some sort of lead-based paint; that deteriorating lead paint can be a potential danger to young children; that it was a violation of the Baltimore City Housing Code for a property to have peeling, chipping, or flaking paint; and that the Code requires flaking and chipping paint to be made smooth before repainting the surface. He also testified that he did not inspect 17 North Bentalou to see if it was \u201cfit for habitation\u201d before the Whittingtons moved in because \u201cI have a painter working for me who had probably 30 years experience painting Baltimore City houses, mostly row houses. He knew the process. He was experienced. He had a level of expertise and he knew how to prepare a home for painting and that\u2019s what he did on all the houses he painted for me including 17 North Bentalou Street.\u201d Polakoff further testified that he did not inform Ms. Whittington of the dangers of lead paint prior to her moving in; however, he did inform her of the procedure for reporting needed repair work.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">A. <em>Brooks v. Levnn Realty III, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">At the core of Polakoff and Chases\u2019s argument is the question of notice and whether we correctly decided <em>Brooks. </em>If we reaffirm <em>Brooks, </em>which we do, then the only remaining question is whether it applies to the case at bar. We therefore begin with a review of the <em>Brooks </em>opinion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">In <em>Brooks </em>we stated that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">under the common law and in the absence of a statute, a landlord ordinarily has no duty to keep rental premises in repair, or to inspect the rental premises either at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>inception of the lease or during the lease term. There are, however, exceptions to this general rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">Moreover, where there is an applicable statutory scheme designed to protect a class of persons which includes the plaintiff, another well-settled Maryland common law rule has long been applied by this Court in negligence actions. That rule states that the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily \u201cis prescribed by the statute\u201d or ordinance and that the violation of the statute or ordinance is itself evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 78, 835 A.2d at 620. We then cited an extensive list of cases that apply the \u201cstatute or ordinance\u201d rule. <em>See Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 78-9, 835 A.2d at 621 for cases cited therein. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">Under this principle, in order to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action, all that a plaintiff must show is: (a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of. Proximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent. It is the existence of this cause and effect relationship that makes the violation of a statute <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">Where there is evidence that the violation of the statute proximately caused the plaintiffs injury, evidence of such violation is sufficient evidence to warrant the court in submitting the case to the jury on the question of the [defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>dant\u2019s] negligence. The trier of fact must then evaluate whether the actions taken by the defendant were reasonable under all the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">Nevertheless, once it is established that there was a statutory violation, the tort defendant\u2019s knowledge that he or she violated the statute is not part of the tort plaintiffs burden of proof. It is the violation of the statute or ordinance alone which is evidence of negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\"><em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 79-80, 835 A.2d at 621-22 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Having determined the applicable rule, we turned to the Code itself. We began by noting that the Code \u201ccontains a comprehensive statutory scheme aimed at \u2018establishing] minimum standards governing the condition, use, operation, occupancy, and maintenance of dwellings ... in order to make dwellings safe, sanitary, and fit for human habitation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 81, 835 A.2d at 622 (quoting Baltimore City Code (2000 Repl.Vol.), Art. 13, \u00a7 103(a)(2)). It imposes \u201cnumerous duties and obligations upon landlords who rent residential property.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 81, 835 A.2d at 622. Section 702 of the Code imposes a duty on property owners to keep a dwelling in \u201cgood repair and safe condition.\u201d Section 702(a) provides that \u201c[ejvery building and all parts thereof used or occupied as a dwelling shall, while in use or at any time when the lack of maintenance affects neighboring property, be kept in good repair, in safe condition, and fit for human habitation.\u201d Section 703(b)(3) provides that \u201cgood repair and safe condition\u201d includes a requirement that \u201c[a]ll walls, ceilings, woodwork, doors, and windows shall be kept clean and free of any flaking, loose, or peeling paint and paper.\u201d The Code places the duty on the owner or operator of the property to keep it in compliance with all provisions of the Code. \u00a7 310(a)(1). It further provides the owner with access to the property during a tenancy \u201cfor the purpose of making such inspection and such repairs or alterations as are necessary to effect compliance with the provisions of this Code ....\u201d\u00a7 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Based on the language of the Code, we concluded that the landlord\u2019s duty to keep the property in compliance is continuous. \u201cThe landlord must take whatever measures are necessary during the pendency of the lease to ensure the dwelling\u2019s continued compliance with the Code.\u201d <em>Brooks, 378 </em>Md. at 84, 835 A.2d at 624. Consequently, because the Code prescribes the property owner\u2019s duty to keep the property continuously free of any flaking, loose, or peeling paint, the failure to keep the property in such a condition is itself evidence of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\"><em>Brooks </em>does not hold that a landlord will be held strictly liable for violations of the Code; rather it reaffirmed the long-standing common law rule that a violation of a statute or ordinance is <em>evidence </em>of negligence. As we repeatedly stated in <em>Brooks, </em>proof of a statutory violation, plaintiffs membership in the class of people designed to be protected by the statute, and causation, amount to <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence, not negligence <em>per se. See Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 78-81, 84-5, 85 n. 5, 89, 835 A.2d at 620-25, 625 n. 5, 627; <em>see also, Absolon v. Dollahite, </em>376 Md. 547, 831 A.2d 6 (2003) (stating that it is a \u201clong established general rule in Maryland that the violation of a statutory duty is only evidence of negligence, but does not establish negligence <em>per se </em>\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Bentley v. Carroll, </em>355 Md. 312, 325, 734 A.2d 697, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>704-05 (1999) (\u201cNot long ago we reaffirmed that [t]his Court has consistently held that the violation of a statutory duty may furnish evidence of negligence. The positive evidentiary value of the statutory violation, however, is subject to the condition that \u2018the person alleging the negligence is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the statute was intended, in general, to prevent.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bd. of County Commissioners v. Bell Atlantic-Maryland, Inc., </em>346 Md. 160, 179, 695 A.2d 171, 181 (1997)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Contrary to the view expressed in Polakoff and Chase\u2019s brief, evidence of negligence does not <em>ipso facto </em>equate to liability. Before a landlord can be found liable, the trier of fact must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>determine whether the defendant acted reasonably given the circumstances. As we stated in <em>Brooks, </em>\u201cour holding in the instant case does not impose a strict liability regime upon landlords. Whether [the landlord] is held liable for any injury to a child, based on leadpaint poisoning, will depend on the jury\u2019s evaluation of the reasonableness of the [landlord\u2019s] actions under all the circumstances.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 84-5, 835 A.2d at 624. Thus, liability will depend on the fact-finder\u2019s determination regarding whether the landlord acted reasonably under all the circumstances. <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 85 n. 5, 835 A.2d at 624 n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The issue of what qualifies as \u201creasonable\u201d will, as it does in all negligence cases, depend on the facts and circumstances of the case. As we noted in <em>Brooks, </em>the fact-finder\u2019s determination of reasonableness \u201cis the essence of a negligence action.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 85 n. 5, 835 A.2d at 625 n. 5 (\u201cnegligence is a failure to do what the reasonable [person] would do \u2018under the same or similar circumstances\u2019 \u201d (internal citation omitted)). - \u201c[I]t will be the duty of the trier of fact to determine whether the steps taken by the landlord to ensure continued compliance with the Code, i.e. the frequency and thoroughness of inspections, and the maintenance of the interi- or surfaces, of the dwelling, were reasonable under all the circumstances. The test is what a reasonable and prudent landlord would have done under the same circumstances.\u201d Brooks,.378 Md. at 86, 835 A.2d at 625. <em>See also, Juarez v. Wavecrest Management Team Ltd., </em>88 N.Y.2d 628, 649 N.Y.S.2d 115, 672 N.E.2d 135, 141 (1996) (interpreting a New York City Code similar to the Baltimore City Code and concluding that \u201c[w]here, however, a landlord establishes that it exercised due care, it will not be held liable. To avoid liability, a landlord must prove that, even though it violated [the local lead-paint statute], it was acting reasonably under the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Liability will depend on the reasonableness of the landlord\u2019s efforts to remain in compliance with the statute; therefore, it is incumbent upon the landlord to take such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>reasonable steps as may be necessary. One surefire way of avoiding lead-paint poisoning liability is to remove lead paint from the rental property. We recognize, however, that the current law does not require this action. Less extreme options may include: notifying the tenant in writing and orally of the possible presence of lead paint in the property and its potential danger; asking the tenant to notify the landlord or property manager immediately if flaking, loose, or peeling paint occurs; and inspecting the property at the inception and at regular intervals throughout the tenancy to ensure that there is no flaking, loose, or peeling paint. This list is by no means exhaustive nor is it a guarantee that a jury will find the landlord\u2019s actions reasonable. Our point is simply to show that there are reasonable ways of attempting to satisfy one\u2019s duty pursuant to the Code. <em>See also, </em>Md.Code (1996 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 6-801 <em>et seq. </em>of the Environment Article (entitled \u201cReduction of Lead Risk in Housing\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We expressly recognized in <em>Brooks </em>that our holding was in conflict with parts of our opinion in <em>Richwind, </em>335 Md. 661, 645 A.2d 1147. <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 86, 835 A.2d at 625. <em>Richwind </em>held that \u201ca landlord is not liable for a defective condition on the property unless the landlord knows or has reason to know of the condition and had a reasonable opportunity to correct it.\u201d <em>Richwind, </em>335 Md. at 673, 645 A.2d at 1153. Richwind argued to the Court that, despite the numerous statutory enactments that impact upon the relationship between the landlord and tenant, the statute does not \u201csuper-cede the common law requirement that a landlord\u2019s liability for negligence depends upon notice of a particular defect and a reasonable opportunity to correct it.\u201d <em>Richwind, </em>335 Md. at 670, 645 A.2d at 1151. We recognized that certain statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>enactments may alter the common law. We concluded, however, that based on \u00a7\u00a7 301 through 303, the Code and the common law notice requirement were consistent with each other and therefore the Code did not do away with the notice requirement. <em>Richwind, </em>335 Md. at 672-674, 645 A.2d at 1152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In <em>Brooks, </em>we specifically disapproved of this reasoning. <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 87, 835 A.2d at 626. We noted that \u201c[t]he flaw in the <em>Richwind </em>opinion\u2019s analysis is its extension of \u00a7\u00a7 301 and 303\u2019s notice requirement to occupants.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>We concluded that \u201c[t]he Housing Code provisions relied on in the <em>Richwind </em>opinion do not alter the requirements set forth by this Court for a plaintiff to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case based on [statutory] negligence. The Housing Code does not make the landlord\u2019s notice of a defective condition a factor with regard to the landlord\u2019s duty to the tenant.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>378 Md. at 88-89, 835 A.2d at 627.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>We remain committed to the analysis in <em>Brooks. </em>The law in this State regarding the breach of a statutory duty remains the same today as it has for over ninety years. To make out a <em>prima facie </em>case in a negligence action based on the breach of a statutory duty, a plaintiff must show \u201c(a) the violation of a statute or ordinance designed to protect a specific class of persons which includes the plaintiff, and (b) that the violation proximately caused the injury complained of.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>878 Md. at 79, 835 A.2d at 621. \u201cProximate cause is established by determining whether the plaintiff is within the class of persons sought to be protected, and the harm suffered is of a kind which the drafters intended the statute to prevent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We conclude, as we did in <em>Brooks, </em>that the Code places a continuous duty on landlords to maintain their properties in \u201cgood repair and safe condition,\u201d including keeping the premises free of flaking, loose, or peeling paint. If a landlord of property located in Baltimore City fails to maintain the premises in a safe condition and someone whom the Code was designed to protect, i.e., a resident child, is injured as a result of the landlord\u2019s failure to maintain the premises, the plaintiff will have successfully established a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. It will then be incumbent upon the finder of fact to determine whether the landlord\u2019s actions were reasonable under all of the circumstances. Pursuant to the established principles of Maryland tort law cited in <em>Brooks, </em>if Jasmine could establish a violation of the Code which proximately caused her injuries, she would be entitled to have the negligence count of her complaint submitted to the trier of fact for a determination of whether Polakoff and Chase acted reasonably under all of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>As previously discussed, the Code requires that occupied dwellings continuously be kept in good repair and safe condition, which includes keeping windows free of flaking, loose,. or peeling paint. \u00a7\u00a7 702(a) and 703(b)(3). Jasmine produced testimony that flaking, loose, or peeling paint existed as early as <em>Vk </em>years into the tenancy and that the paint on the windowsills was \u201cbumpy\u201d from the inception of the tenancy as a result of new paint being applied on top of old chipping paint. There was testimony that prior to Jasmine\u2019s birth, a workman repainted the windowsills in the living room but, again, the new paint was applied on top of the old chipping paint. There was also testimony that Jasmine spent much of her time at the \u201cbumpy\u201d windowsills looking out the window. Based on this testimony, Jasmine met her burden of production regarding the presence of flaking, loose, or peeling paint in violation of the Code. She established proximate cause by presenting evidence that she is a member of the class of people sought to be protected by the Code, and that her injury, lead-paint poisoning, is the type of injury the drafters of the Code sought to prevent. These two things taken together, a violation of the Code and proximate cause, establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence. Consequently, Jasmine was entitled to have her case presented to the trier of fact for a determination of whether Polakoff and Chase acted reasonably given the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">With regard to the issue of reasonableness, the jury heard testimony that Polakoff was aware of the following at the inception of the lease: that most housing in Baltimore City built before 1950 would probably contain some sort of lead-based paint; that deteriorating lead paint can be a potential danger to young children; that it was a violation of the Code for a property to have peeling, chipping, or flaking paint; and that the Code requires that flaking and chipping paint to be made smooth before repainting the surface. Polakoff testified that he did not inspect the premises at the inception of the lease but instead relied on the experience of a painter with whom he had worked for many years. He further testified that at no time during the nine-year tenancy did he or anyone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>working for him inspect the interior of the house to ensure its compliance with the Code. Polakoff instead relied on tenants to notify him of needed maintenance. He further testified that he did not inform Ms. Whittington of the dangers of lead paint prior to her moving into the property. Based on this information, a jury could reasonably conclude that, despite being aware of the danger and likely presence of lead paint in the house, as well as the Code\u2019s requirement that the house be kept free of flaking, chipping, or peeling paint, Polakoff did not inspect the inside of the residence at any point during the nine-year tenancy. The jury could reasonably conclude that Polakoff did not act as a reasonable landlord would have acted, given the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">III. Application of <em>Brooks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The final issue before the Court is whether the holding of <em>Brooks </em>applies to the present case. Polakoff and Chase argue that <em>Brooks </em>should apply to <em>Brooks </em>and to cases arising from facts that postdate our decision but not to all others which arise on facts predating the opinion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although they do not use the term, what they seek is \u201cselective prospectivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The U.S. Supreme Court identifies three types of application categories, retroactive, purely prospective, and modified or selective prospectivity. <em>James B. Beam Distilling Company v. Georgia, </em>501 U.S. 529, 535-37, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 2443-44, 115 L.Ed.2d 481, 488-89 (1991) (plurality opinion). Retroactive application applies to \u201cthe parties before the court and to all others by and against whom claims may be pressed, consistent with <em>res judicata </em>and procedural barriers such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>statute of limitations.\u201d <em>Beam, </em>501 U.S. at 535, 111 S.Ct. at 2443, 115 L.Ed.2d at 488. The Supreme Court noted that retroactivity is \u201coverwhelmingly the norm, and is in keeping with the traditional function of the courts to decide cases before them based upon their best current understanding of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Internal citations omitted.) Pure prospectivity is the \u201cmethod of overruling, under which a new rule is applied neither to the parties in the law-making decision nor to those others against or by whom it might be applied to conduct or events occurring before that decision. The case is decided under the old law but becomes a vehicle for announcing the new, effective with respect to all conduct occurring after the date of that decision.\u201d <em>Beam, </em>501 U.S. at 536, 111 S.Ct. at 2443, 115 L.Ed.2d at 488 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Modified or selective prospectivity is the method by which \u201ca court may apply a new rule in the case in which it is pronounced, then return to the old one with respect to all others arising on facts predating the pronouncement.\u201d <em>Beam, </em>501 U.S. at 537, 111 S.Ct. at 2444, 115 L.Ed.2d at 489. It is distinguishable from pure prospectivity in that the new pronouncement applies to the case in which it is made and not solely to cases arising after the pronouncement. This is the form of application sought by Polakoff and Chase in the current matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">With regard to selective prospectivity, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthis method ... enjoyed its temporary ascendancy in the criminal law during a period in which the Court formulated new rules, prophylactic or otherwise, to insure protection of the rights of the accused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Internal citations omitted.) The Supreme Court, however, has abandoned the use of selective prospectivity. <em>See Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 107 S.Ct. 708, 93 L.Ed.2d 649 (1987) (overruling <em>Linkletter v. Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965) on the grounds that \u201cthe integrity of judicial review requires that [the Court] apply [the new] rule to all similar cases pending on direct review\u201d and \u201cselective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>[parties] the same\u201d); <em>Harper v. Virginia Dept, of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 94-95, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 2516-517, 125 L.Ed.2d 74, 85 (1993); <em>Beam, </em>501 U.S. 529, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Our own cases have \u201cessentially followed the teaching of <em>Linkletter v. Walker in </em>deciding whether a new interpretation of a Maryland constitutional provision, statute, or rule, should receive retrospective effect.\u201d <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. Goldstein, </em>312 Md. 583, 591, 541 A.2d 955, 959 (1988) citing <em>State v. Hicks, </em>285 Md. 310, 336-38, 403 A.2d 356, 370-71 (1979); <em>see also, Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 471, 601 A.2d 633, 658 (1992) (\u201cWhen a prior case in this Court is overruled on the ground that it was erroneously decided, the question whether our holding is retrospective or only prospective is governed by the principles set forth in such opinions such as <em>American Trucking .. . Linkletter v. Walker </em>.... \u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The general rule in these cases is that even when a \u201cprospective\u201d application applies because of the <em>Linkletter </em>factors, \u201ca new interpretation of a constitutional provision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>statute, or rule has included the case before us and all other pending cases where the relevant question has been preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>American Trucking, </em>312 Md. at 592, 541 A.2d at 959 (citing <em>Potts v.

Regardless of how the application is classified, however, both the federal rule and the general rule in Maryland is that a new interpretation of a statute applies to the case before the court and to all cases pending where the issue has been preserved for appellate review. <em>See McClain v. State, </em>288 Md. 456, 463-64, 419 A.2d 369, 372 (1980) (applying the exclusionary rule of <em>Johnson v. State </em>retroac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>tively). Both rules are consistent with the view that the law can \u201cscarcely permit \u2018the substantive law to shift and spring\u2019 according to the particular equities of individual parties\u2019 claims of actual reliance on an old rule and of harm from retroactive application of a new rule.\u201d <em>Harper, </em>509 U.S. at 97, 113 S.Ct. at 2517, 125 L.Ed.2d at 86 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>in <em>Brooks </em>we held that our prior interpretation of the Code in <em>Richwind </em>was erroneous.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In doing so we applied the well-settled Maryland common law rule that when there is an applicable statute designed to protect a certain class of people, the defendant\u2019s duty ordinarily is prescribed by the statute. <em>Brooks </em>represented a different interpretation of a statute and the question of its application is governed by the standard discussed in <em>American Trucking. </em>Consequently, our decision in <em>Brooks </em>applies retroactively, and includes the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Moreover, our <em>per curiam </em>decision in <em>Gentry v. Ebersole, </em>378 Md. 612, 837 A.2d 924 (2003), makes it clear that <em>Brooks </em>applies retroactively. <em>Gentry </em>involved a lead paint case in which the defendant property owner was granted summary judgment on the issue of notice. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court and the plaintiff petitioned this Court for <em>certiorari </em>while <em>Brooks </em>was pending. Following the publication of our <em>Brooks </em>opinion, we issued the <em>per curiam </em>opinion which mandated that the case be remanded for further proceedings consistent with <em>Brooks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We further note that in the present case, the jury was instructed that it had to find that Polakoff and Chase had reason to know of the existence of flaking, loose, or peeling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>paint in order to find defendants liable. Presumably, because the jury found in favor of Jasmine, they concluded that Polakoff and Chase did have knowledge. Even assuming <em>Brooks </em>did not apply to the present case, there is no prejudice to Polakoff and Chase in that the Circuit Court required Jasmine to prove more than was necessary to establish liability, to wit, notice of the defect. In Maryland we give great deference to a jury\u2019s determination of a disputed fact, consequently the trial court properly denied Polakoff and Chase\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. <em>See Houston v. Safeway Stores Inc., </em>346 Md. 503, 521, 697 A.2d 851, 859 (\u201c \u2018As with respect to a judgment n.o.v .... [i]f there is any legally relevant and competent evidence, however slight, from which a rational mind could infer a fact in issue, then the trial court would be invading the province of the jury by declaring a directed verdict.\u2019 \u201d (Internal citation omitted.)). Here, there was testimony that repairs were made to the inside of the house during the tenancy, including work on the windows alleged to have been the source of the paint which poisoned Jasmine. From this testimony, a rational jury could conclude that Polakoff, through his agent, should have been on notice of the chipping paint on the windowsills.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Contracts are drafted based on what the law is; to upset such transactions even for the purpose of improving the law could be grossly unfair. Overruling prospectively is particularly appropriate when we are dealing with decisions involving contract law. The courts must protect an individual\u2019s right to rely on existing law when contracting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-5\">\u201cOrdinarily decisions which change the common law apply prospectively, as well as to the litigants before the court. <em>Williams v.

What is meant by \u2018prospectively\u2019 may depend on the fairness of applying the decision to cases or events occurring after the effective date of the decision. <em>See, e.g., Boblitz v.

It is reasonable to assume that landlords may have relied on the <em>Klawans </em>interpretation when entering into leases with \u2018silent consent\u2019 clauses. This reliance should be protected. Contracts should be interpreted based on the law as it existed when they were entered into. Therefore, whether the <em>Klawans </em>case or the instant case governs the interpretation of a \u201csilent consent\u201d clause depends on whether the lease being interpreted was executed before or after the mandate in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 10-11, 575 A.2d at 739-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Landlords in the City of Baltimore had a right to rely on the common law in this State and the law as set out in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>Richwind. </em>The landlords in the City had no reason to anticipate that they had an affirmative duty to inspect properties for peeling or flaking paint after the inception of the tenancy.

The court noted that \"the term prospective is sometimes used in the same manner as retroactive, i.e., to indicate that the new holding applies to the case which produced the new holding and to all pending cases in which the issue has been preserved for appellate review.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">. Contrary to the position taken by the dissent, <em>Brooks </em>did not involve a change in the common law. Judge Eldridge, writing for the Court, explained that the Court in <em>Richwind </em>misread the Housing Code in reaching its decision. <em>Brooks, </em>however, involved this Court\u2019s subsequent correction of that misinterpretation. Although, in the case at bar, we address the parties contentions with regard to the retrospective application of the <em>Brooks </em>decision, our application of the common law rule that violation of a statute is evidence of negligence does not necessarily give rise to a retroactive versus a prospective analysis. The real question is which law is applicable on direct appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
