Whether, in light of the wording of Article IV, \u00a7 22, of the Maryland Constitution, the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to entertain and decide the merits of the appeal from the court en banc, and, in this connection, whether the notation in <em>Estep v. Estep, </em>285 Md. 416, 420-421 n. 4, 404 A.2d 1040, 1042-1043 n. 4 (1979), is erroneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-6\">2. With regard to the ruling on the motion for a new trial, and if the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to decide the merits of the appeal from the court en banc, whether the Court of Special Appeals should review the single circuit judge\u2019s decision for abuse of discretion or should review solely the determination by the court en banc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">ORDERED, that the petitioner\u2019s supplemental brief shall be filed on or before December 15, 2003, and the respondent\u2019s supplemental brief shall be filed on or before January 14, 2004, and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">ORDERED, that the case shall be set for reargument during the February Session of Court at which the parties may argue the issues contained in their original briefs as well as the issues and arguments set forth in their supplemental briefs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
