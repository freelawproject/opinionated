Defendants submitted the report of their expert, who reviewed plaintiffs medical records and concluded that the accident did not cause plaintiff to lose the fetus. The expert noted the two-week delay between the accident and the loss of the fetus, and the fact that in the intervening time, both plaintiff and the fetus had normal examinations <em>(see generally Franchini v Palmieri, </em>1 NY3d 536, 537 [2003]).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">In opposition, plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact. Her treating obstetrician found that the accident caused her to lose the fetus, and that her prior pregnancies, births and abortions did not play a role in the miscarriage <em>(see Pisani v First Class Car &amp; Limousine Serv. Corp., </em>82 AD3d 596, 597 [2011]; <em>Tsamos v Diaz, </em>81 AD3d 546 [2011]). Given the conflicting evidence in the medical records, the matter should be resolved by the trier of fact.
