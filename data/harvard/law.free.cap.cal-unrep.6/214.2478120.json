In Kenney v. Parks, 120 Cal. 22, 52 Pac. 40, and 54 Pac. 251, and in Vermont Marble Co. v. Black (S. F. No. 1207; recently decided), 123 Cal. 21, 55 Pac. 599, it was held that an enforcement of the judgment by the plaintiff does not deprive the defendant of his right of appeal. The motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the orders appealed from .are not appealable was denied in department 2, September 12, 1898. The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
