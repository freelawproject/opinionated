Judgment, however, was this day rendered in said mandamus proceeding denying the writ. Such judgment disposes of the only defense to the present motion: See Kowalsky v. Kerrigan, 134 Cal. 590, 66 Pac. 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The motion is granted and the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
