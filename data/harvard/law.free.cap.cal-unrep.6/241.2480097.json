It is not at all apparent from an inspection of the check that the signature is \u201cNed Forestns.\u201d It might readily answer to the call of other signatures equally with that of \u201cForestns.\u201d There was expert testimony tending to show that the signature was \u201cForester,\u201d and, in addition to that testimony, the jury had the check before them for personal inspection. Under this evidence of the expert, and from personal inspection, the jury, by their verdict, declared the signature was \u201cForester,\u201d and this court will not disturb that finding of fact. No other point is made by defendant upon his appeal, and for the foregoing reasons the judgment and orders appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
