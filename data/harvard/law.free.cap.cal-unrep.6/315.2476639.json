Kasson, in his lifetime. For several years immediately preceding the death of Kasson he was afflicted with various disorders of body and mind which rendered it necessary that he should have th\u00e9 constant attention of someone to take care of his person and home. He engaged the plaintiff to perform this service for him, agreeing that she should be well paid. To show the value of her services, the plaintiff called as a witness Mrs. S. A. Hathaway, who testified to her acquaintance with deceased; that she had been at his house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the night before and on the morning of his death, and had observed what was necessary to be done to take care of him properly; and that she had occupied a position at the state insane asylum as a keeper of a ward, it being her duty to superintend the ward, and see that the work of caring for the patients was properly done. She was then asked, \u201cProm your experience at the asylum, and what you saw on the Kasson ranch, are you able to say what such services as Mrs. Cowdery rendered there were reasonably worth?\u201d to which the witness answered, \u201cWell, I am able to tell what I think.\u201d Plaintiff then asked her, \u201cWhat were the services rendered by Mrs. Cowdery upon the Kasson ranch reasonably worth, if you know?\u201d This question was objected to on the ground \u201cthat the witness has shown, by her own examination, that she is not competent to testify.\u201d It would seem that the court erred in sustaining this objection. The testimony of the witness shows that she was in a position to give an intelligent opinion as to the reasonable worth of the plaintiff\u2019s services in caring for her afflicted uncle, and the question objected to was therefore competent and proper. When plaintiff rested her case, no evidence had been elicited as to the value of her services; consequently the above ruling of the court was prejudicial to her rights. On account of this error we advise that the judgment and order denying a new trial be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">We concur: Britt, C.; Chipman, C.</p>\n<author id=\"b318-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AdL\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order denying a new trial are reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
