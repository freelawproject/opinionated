After his return he presented to the board of supervisors and filed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>the clerk his claim for said expenses, in proper form, which was thereupon allowed and approved by the said board, and ordered paid, and said order of allowance was properly certified to the defendant, who was the auditor of said county, and demand was thereupon made upon him by the plaintiff that he draw his warrant for said amount upon the county treasurer. The defendant refused to comply with said demand, and the plaintiff made his application to the superior court for a writ of mandate directing the defendant to draw said warrant. A demurrer to the petition was sustained by the court, and judgment entered dismissing the application. From this judgment the present appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">The principles involved under the facts in this case do not differ in any substantial respect from those presented in the case of Irwin v. Yuba Co., 119 Cal. 686, 52 Pac. 35, and upon the \u00abauthority of that case the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
