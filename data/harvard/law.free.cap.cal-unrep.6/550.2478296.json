Plaintiff was in defendants\u2019 store, and while engaged in examining goods and wares fell down an open stairway leading to the basement and broke her leg. The only point made by defendants\u2014and that is made in a most perfunctory way\u2014is that the evidence does not show any negligence upon the part of the defendants in maintaining the open stairway as it was maintained. While the evidence upon the point is quite meager, yet we are not prepared to say that it is so meager as to demand that this court should set aside the verdict by reason of its insufficiency. For the foregoing reasons the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
