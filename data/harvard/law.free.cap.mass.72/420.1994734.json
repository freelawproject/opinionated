agreement was executed by the persons whose signatures are attached to it; but the defendant denies that it was authorized or ratified by the town of Palmer. A warrant for calling a town meeting it Palmer, to be held on the 11th of March 1844, contained the following article : \u201c 7th. To see what course the town will take in relation to the support of Molly Ferry, a pauper, and act thereon.\u201d At such meeting, it was \u201c voted to choose a commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>tee of three to negotiate the Molly Ferry case.\u201d Directly under the record of this vote on the books of the town were entered the names of \u201cA. V. Blanchard, Cyras Knox, Elisha Converse, Committee; \u201d and a copy of the contract; but no vote of the town in relation to it appears. The town have since provided for the support of Molly Ferry according to the terms of the agreement; and the sum of twenty five dollars yearly was paid yearly by Oliver Ferry to the town until April 1853, but has not been paid since.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-4\"><em>R.

The contract which they made was not so executed by them as to bind the town, or to enable the town to enforce it. It only bound the committee personally. <em>Brinley </em>v. <em>Mann, 2 </em>Cush. 337. <em>Mussey </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>7 Cush. 216. <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>16 Mass. 47. <em>Abbey </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>6 Cush. 54. There was no express ratification of it by vote of the town. And no ratification can be implied from the acts of the parties under it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-7\">3. The contract was void. The town, as a corporate body, could not make such a contract, because it was not \u201c necessary and convenient for the exercise of their corporate powers,\u201d within the meaning of Rev. Sts. c. 15, \u00a7 11. <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>23 Pick. 71. <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>1 Met. 284. <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Kempton, </em>13 Mass. 279. It was also void, as against public policy; being in the nature of a speculation on the future ability of Oliver Ferry to support the pauper, and on the chances of two law suits; and a compromise of a claim upon her relations, instead of looking to the remedy against them given by Rev. Sts. c. 46, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6. <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Gower, </em>6 East, 116. Chit. Con.

Nor was this an unnatural or strained construction ; for one of the definitions of the word \u201c negotiate \u201d is \u201c to conclude by bargain, treaty or agreement.\u201d And as there is nothing illegal in that contract, and the town have hitherto performed their part of it, Oliver Ferry\u2019s representatives must perform their part of it. Indeed, we are not certain that the covenants of the parties to this contract are not independent; so that either party might maintain an action for breach thereof, without showing performance on his part. 1 Saund. 320, <em>note </em>4. We express no opinion, however, on that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiffs</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
