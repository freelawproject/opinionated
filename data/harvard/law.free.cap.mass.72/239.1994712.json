Received of Thomas Sumner the sum of seven hundred and eighty six dollars and seventy five cents, being the amount of net proceeds of oxen, stock and cattle attached and sold by him upon a writ in favor of Avery Wei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>lington against George Small. Said suit being ended, and the attachment thereby discharged, the proceeds are received, for and in behalf of George Small, by me as his attorney and agent.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b248-5\">The defendant contended that this receipt discharged him from all further claim to any damage occasioned by said attachment. In making up the net proceeds mentioned in the receipt, the defendant had deducted from the sum actually received by him certain charges and expenses for keeping the cattle, which the plaintiff now contended were unnecessary. A verdict was taken for the amount so deducted, and the case reported to the full court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-6\"><em>B. </em>Dean, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avf\">argued that the receipt was only for so much money, and not a receipt in full; and that if it were, it could not defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, because payment of part of a demand was not a satisfaction of the whole. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 Met. 283, and cases there cited. <em>Tuttle </em>v. <em>Tuttle, </em>12 Met. 554.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b248-7\"><em>G.

This settlement was made with a full knowledge of all the facts by both parties. No mistake is shown, and no fraud or deceit is alleged or proved. It was therefore a good accord and satisfaction, and the plaintiff cannot now go behind it, and recover in this action for money to which, after a full and fair settlement, in equity and good conscience he shows no claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">\n<em>Verdict set aside; plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>No counsel appeared for the plaintiff in review.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b251-6\"><em>B. </em>Dean, for the defendants in review.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
