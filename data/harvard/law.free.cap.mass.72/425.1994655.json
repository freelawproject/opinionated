But Mellen, C. J. instructed the jury, that \u201c for defects in the buildings, occurring after the commencement of the lease, the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for such want of repair from the time such defects occurred; it being the duty of the defendant, under this lease, to take notice of such defects or want of repair, and prevent damage to the plaintiff, by repairing the same, without notice from the plaintiff.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-8\"><em>H.

It is this: \u201c Where a party stipulates to do a certain thing in a certain specific event which may become known to him, or with which he can make himself acquainted, he is not entitled to any notice, unless he stipulates for it; but when it is to do a thing which lies within the peculiar knowledge of the opposite party, then notice ought to be given him.\u201d The case at bar comes within the first branch of this rule. The defendant stipulated to maintain the buildings in good condition during the term for which he demised them to the plaintiff, on the happening of a specific event, to wit, that they should not be in good condition, but should need repairs. He might have known, or made himself acquainted with the fact, that they needed repairs. And he did not stipulate for notice. See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goffe, </em>2 Ld. Raym. 1126, and 11 Mod. 48; 1 Saund. Pl. &amp; Ev. (2d ed.) 214; System of Pleading, 126, 127; Lawes Pl. in Assump. (Amer. ed.) 176 <em>&amp; seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">But if the defendant\u2019s agreement to maintain the buildings in good condition were not, of itself, sufficient to decide the question raised in this case, yet there is another clause in the lease which is decisive, namely, the reservation, by the defendant, of a right of entry upon the premises, \u201c to view and make improvements.\u201d He, therefore, having provided for himself the mean of ascertaining the contingency upon which he was to mala repairs, was not entitled to notice from the plaintiff that the contingency had happened. <em>Keys </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>2 A.
