The cow,\u2019 meaning the cow purchased of said Joiner, \u2018 was my property,\u2019 meaning the property of the said Johns. \u2018 I,\u2019 meaning the said Johns, \u2018drove the cow,\u2019 meaning the cow purchased of Joiner, \u2018home, and never stopped at the corner,\u2019 meaning North Egremont, \u2018at all. I,\u2019 meaning the said Johns, \u2018did not see or speak to Benjamin Baldwin nor Ephraim Baldwin nor any other person at all, on my way home with the cow,\u2019 meaning the cow purchased of said Joiner, \u2018 nor make any bargain with Benjamin Baldwin there,\u2019 meaning at North Egremont, \u2018 about the cow. I,\u2019 meaning the said Johns, \u2018 sold Benjamin Baldwin the gravestones to apply in part payment of the purchase money 1 had of him to buy the Joiner cow with,\u2019 meaning the cow purchased of said Joiner. Whereas in truth and in fact the said Johns did not buy the cow himself of Gordon <em>Joiner: </em>the cow purchased of said Joiner was not the property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>said Johns; the said Johns did, when he drove home the cow purchased of said Johns, stop at North Egremont, and did speak to Benjamin Baldwin, in presence of Ephraim Baldwin, and did make a bargain with said Benjamin Baldwin at North Egremont about said cow, to wit, did then and there agree with said Benjamin Baldwin to receive and keep said cow as the property of said Benjamin till he, said Johns, had paid said Benjamin what he then owed him and thirty dollars more for said cow; and the said Johns did not sell said Benjamin Baldwin said gravestones to apply in part payment of the purchase money had by said Johns of said Baldwin to buy said Joiner cow with.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">The defendant, after trial and conviction in the court of common pleas, moved in arrest of judgment. <em>Bishop, </em>J. ovemuled the motion, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-6\"><em>J. Price, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARG\">upon the sufficiency of the fourth assignment of perjury in the indictment, (which was the only one which the attorney general attempted to support,) argued that it was repugnant, inconsistent and uncertain, because the indictment, at most, only alleged that it became and was a material question whether certain gravestones were sold in part payment for the cow bought of Joiner or in part payment of a previous indebtedness, that is to say, whether the gravestones were sold in part payment of one of these two debts, or in part payment of neither of them, whereas the fourth assignment of perjury did not show that the gravestones were not sold in part payment of such previous indebtedness; and further, that the averment that \u201c it became and was <em>a material question </em>\u201d was only an averment that one question became material, and could not, without additional words, be extended to any question except the first stated ; and that the indictment was therefore fatally defective.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b284-7\"><em>J. H. Clifford, </em>(Attorney General;) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b284-8\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">When any one distinct assignment of perjury, in an indictment for that offence, is well made, and the defendant is found guilty, he must be sentenced on his conviction, however defective the other assignments may be. This is the settled law. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Rhodes, 2 </em>Ld. Raym. 887. <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number><em>Hascall, </em>6 N. H. 358. <em>De Bernie </em>v. <em>State, </em>19 Alab. 23. If therefore we find the last assignment, in this ease, to be sufficient, we shall not need to decide upon the sufficiency of either of the other assignments.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The indictment alleges that, upon the trial before the justice, \u201c it became and was a material question whether certain gravestones, purchased by said Baldwin of said Johns, were sold by said Johns to said Baldwin in part payment for the purchase money paid for the cow bought of said Joiner or in part payment for a previous indebtedness of said Johns to said Baldwin for another cow.\u201d The indictment then alleges that the defendant, on said trial, swore thus: \u201c I sold Benjamin Baldwin the gravestones to apply in part payment of the purchase money I had of him to buy the Joiner cow with.\u201d And the assignment of the perjury, on this point, is thus: \u201c The said Johns did not sell said Benjamin Baldwin said gravestones to apply in part payment of the purchase money had by said Johns of said Baldwin to buy said Joiner cow with.\u201d This, we think, is a good assignment of peijury committed by the defendant, on the trial of a question alleged in the indictment to have been material. In legal, as well as in grammatical construction of the indictment, that question is not, as contended for the defendant, whether the gravestones were sold in part payment of one of the two debts specified, or of neither; but the alternative is, whether they were sold in part payment of the one, or in part payment of the other. The averment, that the defendant falsely swore that they were sold in part payment of the first, is therefore sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">It is not a valid objection to this indictment, that it embraces, in a single count, all the particulars in which the defendant is alleged to have sworn falsely. See 4 Wentw. 273, 274; 2 Chit Crim. Law, 353; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>1 Chip. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">But it is objected that the indictment is bad, because it does not allege that more than one question became material\u2014it being alleged that \u201cit became and was a material question, whether a certain cow was bought \u201d &amp;c.; \u201c whether certain gravestones \u201d &amp;c.; \u201c whether said Johns, when he drove the cow,\u201d &amp;c.\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>whereas it ought to have been alleged that certain <em>questions </em>became material, to wit, whether a certain cow was bought &amp;c.; <em>and also </em>whether certain gravestones, &amp;c.; <em>and also </em>whethez said Johns, when he drove the cow, &amp;c. Upon examining the precedents, we find no uniformity in this matter. The usual form, when more than one question is relied on as material, is to aver that certain <em>questions </em>became and were material, to wit, whether, &amp;c., <em>and </em>whether, &amp;c., or <em>and also </em>whether, &amp;c. But this form is nowhere said to be essential; and the precedents show that an indictment is deemed sufficient, if it clearly avers that several matters were material on the trial in which the defendant testified, and that he committed perjury in his testimony concerning them or any of them. In 4 Wentw. 240, the form is, that \u201c it became a necessary <em>question </em>whether,\u201d &amp;c., \u201c <em>and also </em>whether,\u201d <em>&amp;c., and </em>whether,\u201d &amp;c. The same form was used in <em>Rex </em>v. Leefe, 2 Campb. 134, and in <em>Regina </em>v. Dunn, 1 Car. &amp; Kirw. 732, <em>note. </em>In the former case, the indictment alleged that the defendant \u201c deposed touching the said material <em>questions; </em>\u201d and his eminent counsel took no exception to the indictment. He was acquitted on other grounds. But in <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>the defendant was convicted and sentenced. This point came before the court of queen\u2019s bench, on a writ of error, in 1840, but was not decided ; the judgment being reversed on other grounds. Coleridge, J. said, however, (what we also say,) this is a mode of stating the material questions, which is not to be recommended.\u201d <em>Regina </em>v. Burraston, 4 Jurist, 697, 698, and cited in 2 Russ. on Crimes, (7th Amer. ed.) 641, 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Now if, when the averment is that \u201c a question \u201d became material, several questions may be well set forth, by using the copulative conjunction, why may this be done ? Because, on the face of the indictment, it is manifest to every reader who is at all acquainted with the laws of our language, and is certain to a legal intent, that more than one question is alleged <em>to </em>have become material, and that the word \u201c question \u201d is to be applied, distributively, to each of the several questions. And we deem the same equally manifest, on the face of this indictment, without any connective particle between the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
