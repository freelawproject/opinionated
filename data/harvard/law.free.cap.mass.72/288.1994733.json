E. Lang, the secretary of the company, testified that, in making the assessment, no member was assessed for losses occurring before his policy was issued or after it had expired; that the two last items were included in the assessment; that there was no by-law allowing a percentage on collection ; and that by \u201cbad debts\u201d was meant the assessments of those insured who were probably insolvent and unable to pay their assessments ; but no evidence that they were unable to pay was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-10\">In relation to the notice to the defendant of the assessment, Lang testified that he and the treasurer made a list of all the persons, two or three thousand in number, to whom notices were to be sent, and made a notice for every individual, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>addressed it to him at his place of residence ; that the defendant\u2019s name and address were on the list; that postage was paid on the notices sent; that Lang carried some of the notices to the post office, and the plaintiff carried some ; but that he had no recollection of taking a notice to the post office for the defendant, or for any particular person. There was no publica tion of the assessment, other than by this circular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that before this action was brought he demanded of the defendant payment of the assessment, and the defendant objected to paying on' the ground that he had doubts in regard to the security of the insurance company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-6\">Upon this evidence, the defendant objected that the plaintiff could not recover, for the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-7\">1st. Because this action for the whole amount of the note was an action for a penalty created by the laws of another state, which could not be enforced in this commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-8\">2d. Because this action, if it could be maintained at all, should not have been upon the note, but in the form of a special action on the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-9\">3d. Because the action, by \u00a7 9 of the charter of the company, must be brought by the directors, and not in the name of the treasurer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-10\">4th. Because the assessment was illegal, by reason of its including interest on money borrowed, and merely probable losses by bad debts, and ten per cent, for collection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-11\">5th. Because there was no publication of the assessment, as required by \u00a7 9 of the charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-12\">6th. Because there was no evidence to go to the jury, that the plaintiff gave the defendant any notice of the assessment, or that the defendant had received any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b301-13\">The presiding judge was of opinion that some of these objections were well taken, and the jury, by his direction, returned a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b301-14\"><em>J. D.

It was admitted thai this point was now taken for the first time. This objection comes too late. <em>Burnett </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Gray, 50. Where a defence to an action is taken at the trial in the court of common pleas, and evidence introduced thereon, without any question as to its being open under the answer, and the defence is sustained by the ruling of the presiding judge, the plaintiff cannot, at the hearing in this court on exceptions to that ruling, object for the first time that this defence was not open under the answer, even though the writ and answer be referred to in the bill of exceptions as a part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">1. It is objected that the defendant, if liable at all, is only liable for the amount of the assessment, and not for the amount of the note; that to hold otherwise would be to enforce a penal law of New Hampshire, as the recovery would be of a penalty for neglect of duty; and that the courts of Massachusetts cannot be required to enforce penal statutes of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">It is true that the provision, that if any member of the company shall neglect, for thirty days after due notice, to pay any assessment upon a deposit note, the whole note may be collected, is a provision found in a New Hampshire statute; but it is the statute incorporating this insurance company, frnd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>the defendant, by becoming a member of the company, has sub jected himself to the provisions of the charter, and of the by laws adopted by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The effect of such collection of the entire note is really only to withdraw the credit given to a member who has proved regardless of his obligation to pay an assessment, and change the place of deposit of the amount of the deposit note from the pocket of the defendant to the treasury of the company, to ensure more prompt payment of his future assessments ; as the money, when collected, is required to be held by the company as trustee for the defendant\u2019s use, to be applied, so far as is necessary, to pay assessments accruing from time to time, and the balance, not required for that purpose, to be repaid, at the expiration of the policy, to the person from whom it has been collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">2. It is then said that the action in such case should not be an action on the note, but a special action on the case, setting out all the facts necessary to show the liability to pay the whole amount of the deposit note. This objection is not well founded in fact. It is true that the declaration sets out the note, and, had it stopped there, might have been obnoxious to the objection taken ; but it further proceeds to set forth in detail the facts of an assessment, a demand thereof, and neglect to pay the same, and the liability to pay the whole amount of the note under the charter and by-laws of the company. The declaration is, as it seems to us, sufficient in form to embrace the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">3. It is objected that this action, if for the whole note, upon the ground of liability to pay the whole by reason of neglect to pay an assessment thereon, should not have been instituted in the name of the treasurer of the corporation, but in the name of the directors. This is supposed to result from the provision of the charter, \u00a7 9, wherein it is provided, that in case of such default and neglect to pay an assessment, \u201cthe directors may sue for and recover the whole amount of said deposit note.\u201d We do not understand this to relate to the form of the action, but to the authority to institute an action to recover the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>note. It is to be done by their order, but not in their names as parties to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">4. It is contended that the assessment was itself illegal, because the sum assessed upon the deposit notes includes not' only an assessment to the amount of actual losses by fire that the company were then liable to pay, but also interest on money borrowed, probable losses by bad debts, and an allowance for collecting assessments, in the form of an abatement for prompt payment of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The promise of the defendant, in his deposit note, is to pay the same \u201cin such portions and at such times as the directors of said company may agreeably to their act of incorporation and by-laws require.\u201d The act of incorporation, \u00a7 6, requires it to be paid, <em>\u201c </em>in part or the whole, at any time when the directors shall deem the same requisite for the payment of losses or other expenses.\u201d The seventh article of the by-laws authorizes the directors \u201c to borrow from time to time such sums of money as may be required to meet losses; and in making the next assessment, the sums thus borrowed, the interest thereon, and all necessary expenses, shall be included and assessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">No doubt the assessment must be limited to the legitimate objects declared in the charter and by-laws. But this will not prevent the directors from exercising a reasonable discretion in fixing the amount to be assessed. They may, we think, make a proper allowance for the deficiency that will result from insolvent members, making the assessments upon all members in proportion to the amount of their deposit notes. They may also properly include the necessary expenses of collection; and if, in their opinion, an allowance for prompt payment of the assessment to thefi treasurer directly will be more beneficial than to employ agents to collect these small sums thus assessed, they may make such an allowance, and consider that as a part of the expenses of collecting the assessments. If these allowances are reasonable, and consistent with the exercise of good faith on the part of the directors, they will not vitiate an assessment, made under a charter and by-laws such as exist in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>5. It is next objected that there was no publication of the assessment made by the directors, and no evidence that the defendant had proper notice of the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">No particular mode is prescribed, in which such publication and notice of an assessment are to be made and given. It would be sufficient to have given actual notice to each individual assessed, through a circular, if seasonably given. Whether such notice was given to the defendant, is a question upon which the parties are at issue, and that matter must be passed upon by a jury, if there was any competent evidence to go to the jury upon that point. We think there was evidence proper to be submitted to the jury, tending to show such notice to the defendant ; leaving to the jury to draw all proper inferences, and find as to the fact of notice. The facts testified to by Lang, as to the manner in which notices were made out and sent to the post office, is not alone sufficient to prove that the notices were deposited in the post office ; as the plaintiff, who is said to have carried a portion of -the notices to the post office, was not called as a witness. But the proof as to notice does not rest here. The facts testified to by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, as occurring at the time he made a demand upon the defendant for payment of the assessment, and the reason assigned by the defendant for not paying the same, are to be taken in connection with the other evidence, and submitted to the jury, who will pass upon the question, whether the notice of the assessment was given to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The result is therefore that the exceptions taken by the plaintiff to the ruling of the court of common pleas must be sustained, the verdict set aside, and a new trial had.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
