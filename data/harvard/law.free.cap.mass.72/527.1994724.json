Lamb on a writ in favor of one Knights, and delivered him to James M. Bancroft, taking a written receipt by which Bancroft promised to keep him safely, and deliver him to Baker on demand ; that Bancroft delivered the horse to Lamb \u201c to use for his keeping, and to redeliver whenever Bancroft should call for him to deliver to the plaintiff; \u201d and that Lamb, under an agreement for an exchange of horses, delivered him to the defendants, who had refused to give him up. The plaintiff offered to show \u201c that the places of business of Lamb and Bancroft were near together, and that Bancroft had a daily supervision of said horse.\u201d But <em>Mellen, </em>C.
