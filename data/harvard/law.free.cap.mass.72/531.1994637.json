The respondent offered evidence tending to show that $5 had been paid on the account; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>contended that, if $5 had been paid, the certificate filed was fatally defective, and the petitioner could not recover. But the judge instructed the jury that, if they believed that $5 had been paid, the petitioner would be entitled to recover the balance after deducting the $5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">The petitioner, in evidence of the number of days during which he worked on the building, was allowed by the judge, against the objection of the respondent, to introduce his book, containing the charges thereof, supported by Ms suppletory oath.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">The jury found a verdict for the petitioner in the sum of $19.06 ; and the respondent alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-7\"><em>Nl Wood, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-8\"><em>T. K. Ware, </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuT\">1. The omission to credit, in the certificate, all that was found by the jury to have been paid, is not fatal to the petitioner\u2019s claim. This statute, passed for the protection of mechanics and laboring men, would be of little avail, if an honest mistake as to a small amount of credit should be held to defeat the whole claim for the actual balance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b540-9\">2. The petitioner is entitled to use the same evidence, in supporting his lien, as in an action against the original debtor. The reasons for admitting book accounts with the suppletory oath are as strong in this form of proceeding as in that. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Haskell, </em>9 Cush. 218. <em>Mathes </em>v. Robinson, 8 Met. 269.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b540-10\">Shaw, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnD\">A majority of the court are of opinion that the exceptions must be sustained upon both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">1. The <em>St. </em>of 1851, <em>c. </em>343, \u00a7 2, expressly provides that the lien shaH be dissolved, unless the person, seeking to avail himself of it, files within sixty days, in the registry of deeds, \u201c a certificate, containing a just and true account of the demand justly due to him, after all just credits given.\u201d The amount of all just credits is a fact which lay particularly within the petitioner\u2019s own knowledge, and which he was bound to state truly. If the owner of the land had paid the amount thus stated, he would have lost four dollars upon settling with his contractor.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>2. The petitioner\u2019s book of account and suppletory oath were incompetent evidence. To admit them in this proceeding would be a step beyond any case yet decided. The statute creating a lien upon land, under a contract which may be made by a person other than the owner, is to be construed with at least reasonable strictness. The party has it in his power to secure other evidence of the work which he has performed, either by the testimony of the contractor, or of his own fellowworkmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>New trial in this court.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b540-12\"> Under the <em>St. </em>of 1855, c. 431, \u201cno inaccuracy\u201d in the certificate, \u201cin stating the amount due for labor, shall invalidate the proceedings, unless it fihall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>appear that the person filing the certificate has wilfully and knowingly claimed more than is his due.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
