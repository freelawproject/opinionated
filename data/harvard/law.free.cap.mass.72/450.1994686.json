Morse <em>vs. </em>Connecticut River Railroad Company.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b458-4\">In an action against a railroad corporation by a passenger for the loss of his trunk, the admissions of the conductor, baggage master or station master, as to the manner of the loss, made in answer to inquiries in behalf of the passenger the next morning after the joss, are admissible in evidence against the corporation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-5\">Action of tort by a passenger from Springfield to Chicopee on the defendants\u2019 railroad, for the loss of her trunk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-6\">At the trial in the court of common pleas, the plaintiff introduced the deposition of a man who accompanied her on that occasion, from which <em>Mellen, </em>C. J., at the defendants\u2019 suggestion, ordered the following statement to be stricken out: \u201c The next morning after the trunk was lost, in accounting for the trank, on my inquiry, either the conductor or baggage master told me that, the night before, a gentleman stepped up and claimed and took a trank of the same description. But the same morning the station agent told me he thought the trunk was carried to Northampton the night before with other baggage.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the defendants, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions to this ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-7\"><em>J Wells, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b458-8\"><em>C. W. Huntington, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIE\">The declarations of the defendants\u2019 agents were properly rejected, not having been made while acting within the scope of their authority, nor in relation to a transaction then depending. It was not the province of the conductor, at least, to do any thing about the baggage. The only transaction between the defendants and the plaintiff was the transportation from Springfield to Chicopee, and that was over. These declarations, therefore, were no part of the <em>res gestee.

It was part of the duty of those agents to deliver the baggage of passengers, and to account for the same, if missing, provided inquiries for it were made within a reasonable time. These declarations were therefore made by them as agents of the defendants, within the scope of their agency, and while it continued. They should therefore have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-10\"> Dewey, J. did not sit in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
