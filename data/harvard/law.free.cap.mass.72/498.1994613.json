When the contract shall be closed between the agent of said institution and the builder or builders of said college, we agree that our subscriptions may be converted into notes, payable upon the contingencies above stated. Worcester, July 19, 1850.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\">The case was submitted to the decision of the court upon the following facts: After this agreement was signed by the defendant and others, the plaintiffs commenced erecting a building for a medical college; the defendant paid the first two instalments ; and the plaintiffs occupied the building as a medical college for three years, and then, before the building was fully completed, on the 6th of September 1855 sold and conveyed the building and their land connected therewith to the Ladies Collegiate Institute, a corporation, whose intention it was to use the same for the education of females, and who now occupy it for that purpose, and have completed the building according to the plan and specifications referred to in the above agreement. In case the building had been thus completed before the plaintiffs so conveyed it away, they would have been entitled to recover in this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-6\"><em>H. </em>Chapin, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9U\">The contingency upon which the third payment was to become due was the completion of the building according to the plan and specification; and the building was so completed. Before the conveyance to the Ladies Collegiate Institute, it had been occupied as a medical college and the completion of it was a mere incident to the building which had acquired the name applied to it in the contract of subscription. The change from one public use to another will not defeat the right of the plaintiff to recover. <em>Willington </em>v <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>West Boylston, </em>4 Pick. 101. <em>Howland </em>v.

And it is very plain that it cannot. The subscription was for building a medical college for the Worcester Medical Institution. The third instalment was to be paid when it was completed for a medical college. It never was so completed, but was sold and conveyed by the plaintiffs, and then completed for another and very different purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendmt.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
