On the second day of September, 1892, certain of its creditors sued out of the Boone county circuit court writs of attachment in aid of suits in assumpsit against the company, and the sheriff, Albert T. Ames, one of these appellees, levied the same upon the personal property of the company. Thereupon Jacob Graff, one of the stockholders, as sole complainant, filed a bill in the Superior Court of Cook county, making only the attaching creditors, the corporation and the sheriff defendants. The bill alleges the existence of the corporation, engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling boots, shoes, etc., with a capital stock of $75,000, $9300 of which was owned by the complainant; that up to September 2, 1892, it had carried on its business, and then had on hand a large quantity of boots, shoes and other merchandise in its factory at Belvidere, and also owned the machinery, building and premises upon which its factory was located; that its plant and business were valuable; that it had acquired the good will and customers, to whom it had been furnishing goods, and to \u2019 whom it could in the future furnish goods, if permitted to do so, in the usual way of trade; that on September 2, 1892, the Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Chicago, and other creditors of the corporation, caused suits to be commenced against the company in the circuit court of Boone county, returnable at its September term, 1892, and on the same day, September 2, caused writs of attachment to be levied upon the merchandise and personal property of the company by the sheriff of said Boone county, who now holds the same ; that by reason of said levies the company has ceased doing business, and is thereby deprived of the benefits of its good will and the use of its property, to the injury of complainant, as a stockholder; that a large number of other suits had been brought against the company in said circuit court, to its September term, 1892, amounting to about $10,000; that if properly managed and handled, under the directions of the court, or of a receiver to be appointed by the court, the company assets will realize more than sufficient to pay its debts; that the company is indebted, in addition to the amount due the attaching creditors, in a large sum, which should be paid out of its assets ; that the assets, if permitted to be held by the sheriff, will be held for a long time by him without being used in any manner to the interest of the company, the machinery and plant of the corporation being out of use and rendered valueless ; that if said property so held by the sheriff were turned over to a receiver, the machinery and plant would be operated with benefits and advantages to the interest of all the stockholders, and would enable the corporation to pay its debts and return to the stockholders sufficient assets for a division among themselves, but otherwise the property will be wasted, the machinery become useless, the entire plant go to wreck and the said goods and merchandise become out of season and injured, so that there cannot be realized thereon their fair value for the purpose of liquidating the company indebtedness ; that there are a large number of orders on hand which should be filled, and for which the goods and merchandise are now in the hands of the sheriff, and for which payment could be made by the persons ordering the same, and a large sum of money, amounting to $10,000 or $15,000, realized to discharge and liquidate its debts; that the company has title to the land and buildings where its business is located, upon condition that its business is kept in motion and its employees kept employed, and that it would be able to do so but for the seizure of its property by the sheriff, but if he is permitted to retain possession thereof such title will be forfeited, to the injury of complainant and other stockholders and creditors; that a receiver can operate and run the business to the advantage of all concerned; that there is material on hand which could be used in the manufacture of boots, shoes and slippers, and a large quantity of boots and shoes which could be sold and used for the payment of debts; that the stock of merchandise and property now on hand are about $35,000; that unless the property and assets of the company should be used and administered under the directions of the court, there will not be sufficient to pay the creditors of the corporation, and the stockholders will be deprived of the benefits of any of its property; that if the same should be administered under the directions of this court, by a receiver, there would be realized more than sufficient to pay its obligations, and leave sufficient in the hands of 'the receiver for distribution to the stockholders therein. It is then again alleged that the company \u201chas not, since September 2, 1892, performed the functions for which it was incorporated; that it ceased doing business on said date, and is not now doing any business whatever;\u201d that the Merchants\u2019 National Bank had, at the time of suing out its attachment, and still has, a large quantity of boots and shoes of the company as security for its indebtedness, which was sufficient to discharge the same, etc.; that the company is the holder of a large number of notes, accounts and bills receivable, aggregating several thousand dollars, which should be collected by a receiver, and applied, under tide directions of the court, among the creditors and stockholders of the corporation. It concludes as follows :</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495(321) 496(58)\">\u201cInsomuch as complainant is remediless in the premises, save in a court of equity, he files this his bill of complaint against the Northwestern Shoe Company, Merchants\u2019 National Bank of Chicago, First National Bank of Elgin, Daniel Forbes &amp; Co., Albert T.

And it is further ordered that the defendant assign, transfer and deliver over to said receiver, under the direction of James R. Mann, master in chancery of this court, all and singular the property, real and personal, of and belonging to the said corporation, and that said defendant, its officers and agents, forthwith surrender and deliver to said receiver all the assets, materials, tools, machinery, fixtures, effects and property, of every nature and kind, of or belonging to said defendant, the Northwestern Shoe Company, and also all money, notes, drafts, bills of exchange, checks or other evidences of indebtedness due and owing to said corporation, the Northwestern Shoe Company, as well as all books of account, accounts, deeds, bonds, mortgages, certificates of stock, vouchers and papers, of every nature, belonging to said Northwestern Shoe Company.

On the 20th of September, Chick Bros., by appellees Weigley, Bulkley &amp; Gray, their attorneys, recovered a judgment against the corporation in the circuit court of Cook county, and on the 27th of the same month these attorneys caused an execution to be issued on that judgment and placed in the hands of said sheriff, Ames, with directions to levy the same upon certain boots and shoes belonging to the company, then in its freight house at Belvidere. The levy having been made as directed, the Superior Court entered a rule upon said attorneys and their clients, Chick Bros., to show cause why they should not turn that property over to the receiver, or be attached for contempt. Only the attorneys were served, and they refused to release the property, but answered the rule to show cause. Their answer was held insufficient, and on a trial they were each found guilty and sentenced to the county jail of Cook county for contempt. Contempt proceedings were at the same time, in like manner, commenced against the sheriff, Ames, for refusing to turn over the goods so levied upon by him, and he was also adjudged guilty of. contempt. These judgments were reversed by the Appellate Court and the People appealed to this-court. By agreement of parties the cases are consolidated, to be considered as one.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\" pgmap=\"497\">On a consideration of the record, and the errors assigned thereon, at our June term, 1893, we reached the conclusion that the judgments of the Appellate Court were right and should be affirmed, and an opinion to that</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b498-2\" pgmap=\"498\">effect was filed October 27, 1893.

That motion was overruled, on the ground that the attachments for contempt, being instituted upon the motion of a party to the chancery suit for the purpose of enforcing a decree in his favor, were in the nature of civil actions, as held in Leopold v. People, 140 Ill. 552, and People v. Diedrich, 141 id. 665, either party having a right to appeal. The correctness of that decision is not now questioned. The conclusion then reached on the merits of the case was, that the order which appellees were charged with violating was void for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter in the court to make it, and therefore the conviction for disobeying it was erroneous.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b498-4\" pgmap=\"498\">Moses, Pam &amp; Kennedy, for People :</attorneys><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\" pgmap=\"498\">Judicial proceedings are not void collaterally, when jurisdiction is taken by reason of a mistake of law in construing a statute or the common law.

It is true, those parties; in that answer, placed their denial of such jurisdiction upon the ground that the corporation was not, at the time of filing the bill, doing business in Cook county and had no \u2018property there. It is not denied that Ames, the other appellee, did in his answer specifically deny the \u201cpower or authority\u201d of the court, \u201cunder the bill filed then, to appoint a receiver for the defendant, the Northwestern Shoe Company,\u201d and as it has been stipulated that the two cases shall be considered as one, all parties are entitled to the benefit of that denial. We do not, however, understand that a party charged with contempt, in a case of this kind, is limited, upon his trial, to the defenses set up in his answer to the rule to show cause. The contempt proceeding, being for the benefit of the complainant in the chancery suit, partakes of that cause, and is according to the forms of practice in chancery. (People v. Diedrich, 141 Ill. 665. See, also, cases there cited.) The party accused is entitled to a trial. The charge in this case being the refusal of the defendants to respect and obey an order of court, the party bringing the accusation was, in the absence of an admission of that fact by the defendants, bound to prove the existence of such an order. Accordingly he offered in evidence the bill of complaint, summons and return, appearance and consent of the Northwestern Shoe Company to the appointment of the receiver, and the order appointing the receiver. If absolutely void, that decree was and is open to attack, directly or collaterally, whenever and wherever an attempt is made to set it up as the basis of a right of action. As was said in Buckmaster v. Carlin, 8 Scam. 108, speaking of the distinction between judgments and decrees which are void and those which are merely voidable : \u201cThe former are binding nowhere; the latter everywhere, until reversed by a superior authority.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b501-5\" pgmap=\"501\">It is assigned for error upon this record that the court below erred in holding it had jurisdiction to appoint a receiver of the property of the Northwestern Shoe Company, and in holding that it had jurisdiction to entertain the bill of Jacob Graff for any purpose, and we entertain no doubt that under these assignments of error the defendants below had the right to insist, in the Appellate Court, that the decree which they were charged with disobeying was a nullity, and have the same right here.</p> <p id=\"b501-6\" pgmap=\"501(83) 502(219)\">Much time is spent, in the argument of the case, discussing the question as to whether this is to be treated as a direct or collateral attack upon that order. It is well settled that a party charged with contempt of a judgment or decree may acquit himself by showing that such judgment or decree is a nullity, but cannot be heard to question it on the ground of irregularity, however erroneous. (Tolman v. Jones, 114 Ill. 147; Leopold v. People, 140 id. 552.) In the latter case we said: \u201cA party cannot be guilty of contempt of court for disobeying an order which the court had no authority of law to make. Want of power, as here used, is not, however, to be confused with mere irregularity in the exercise of power, for if the court has jurisdiction of the parties, and legal authority to render the order, then a party cannot stand in defiance of it, however improvidently or erroneously made.\u201d Whether the attack is said to' be direct, or merely collateral, is. immaterial. If the Superior Court had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter of the action in which the receiver was appointed, he became the officer of the court, and his possession of the property of the corporation was the possession of the court itself, \u201cand any unauthorized interference therewith, either by taking forcible possession of the property committed to his charge or by legal proceedings for that purpose, without the sanction of the court appointing him, is a direct and immediate contempt of court, and punishable by attachment.\u201d (Richards v. People, 81 Ill. 551.) It makes no difference that the party charged with the contempt was \u2022 not a party to the proceeding in which the receiver was appointed.</p> <p id=\"b502-5\" pgmap=\"502(142) 503(376)\">The vital question in the case then is, as stated in our former opinion, \u201cwhether the Superior Court in which the receiver was appointed, and in which the order was entered to turn over the goods, had jurisdiction of the subject matter of the bill.\u201d The relief sought by the bill in this case was the dissolution of the corporation and settlement of its business. The appointment of the receiver was a mere incident to that relief, to enable the court to take possession of the property and business of the company and finally wind up its affairs. It is clear, if the court was without jurisdiction to grant the ultimate relief prayed by the bill, it had no power to appoint the receiver and authorize him to assume possession and control of the corporation assets. It is well settled by the decisions of this court as well as the authorities generally, that courts of chancery are without jurisdiction to decree the dissolution of corporations, except in so far as that jurisdiction is conferred by statute; and we deem it too clear for argument, that if the Superior Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the subject matter of the bill of Jacob Graff and grant the relief therein prayed, that jurisdiction must be attributed to section 25, chapter 32, of our statute, and not to its general equity powers, sitting as a court of chancery. That section of the statute provides : \u201cIf any corporation or its authorized agents shall do, or refrain from doing, any act which shall subject it to a forfeiture of its charter or corporate powers, or shall allow any execution or decree of any court of record for a payment of money, after demand made by the officer, to be returned \u2018no property found,\u2019 or to remain unsatisfied for not less than ten days after such demand, or shall dissolve or cease doing business leaving debts unpaid, suits in equity may be brought against all persons who are stockholders at the time, or liable in any way for the debts of the corporation, by joining the corporation in such suits, and each stockholder may be required to pay his pro rata share of such debts or liabilities to the extent of the unpaid portion of his stock, after exhausting the assets of such corporation. And if any stockholder shall not have property enough to satisfy his portion of such debts or liabilities, then the amount shall be divided equally among all the remaining solvent stockholders. And courts of equity shall have full power, on good cause shown, to dissolve or close up the business of any corporation, to appoint a receiver therefor, who shall have authority, by the name of the receiver of such corporation (giving the name), to sue in all courts and do all things necessary to closing up its affairs, as commanded by the decree of such court.\u201d Does it confer general jurisdiction upon courts of equity in this State to dissolve corporations and settle their business affairs?</p> <p id=\"b504-4\" pgmap=\"504(371) 505(114)\">We held in Wheeler v. Pullman Iron and Steel Co. 143 Ill. 197, that the two clauses of the above section must be construed together, and that the \u201cgood cause\u201d which must be shown by the second clause to authorize courts of equity \u201cto dissolve or close up the business of any corporation, to appoint a receiver therefor, with authority to wind up its affairs,\u201d means some one, or more of the causes mentioned in the first clause,\u2014that is to say, courts of equity only have jurisdiction to so decree when certain causes exist, which are the doing or refraining from doing some act which shall subject the corporation to a forfeiture of its charter or corporate power, or allowing an execution or decree of any court of record for the payment of money, after demand made by the officers, to remain unpaid, or that the corporation has dissolved or ceased doing business, leaving, debts unpaid. It cannot be seriously contended that this bill shows the existence of any of these causes for dissolving the Northwestern Shoe Company at the time it was filed. The only reason shown for filing it is, that creditors of the corporation had commenced suits against the company to collect debts which it owed them, and had seized certain of its property by proper writs of attachment. All the other averments of the bill are to the effect that if creditors are permitted to so collect their debts great injury will result to the complainant as a stockholder. It is not even shown that the corporation could not have paid the debts for which it was sued, if it had desired to do so. The allegation \u201cthat said company has not, since September 2, 1892, performed the functions for which it was incorporated ; that it ceased doing business on said date and is not now doing any business whatever,\u201d is but a repetition of the averment \u201cthat by reason of the levy of said attachments upon the said property of said company the company has ceased doing business, and is thereby deprived of the benefit of its good will and the use of its property, to the-injury of complainant, as such stockholder.\u201d The writs of attachment were levied on the second day of September, 1892. The company ceased to do business on that day because the writs were levied, viz., because its creditors were proceeding, in a lawful manner, to enforce payment of their debts, and thereupon a stockholder seeks to make that ceasing to do business the ground of jurisdiction in a court of equity to postpone the creditors, place the corporation in the hands of a receiver and wind up its affairs. To hold that ceasing to do business under such circumstances is within the meaning of the statute, would be to defeat the very purpose for which the law was enacted.</p> <p id=\"b505-5\" pgmap=\"505\">We said in Hunt v. LeGrand Roller Skating Rink Co. 143 Ill. 118, speaking of this section 25: \u201cIt is manifest, however, that the statute provides a remedy in the nature of a creditor\u2019s bill, and is designed to aid creditors in the collection of their debts, and it is also plain, from the statute, that, as part of the relief afforded in such suit in equity, the chancery court has full power, for good cause shown, to close up the business of any corporation, or dissolve it.\u201d And again: \u201cWe think it clear that it was the intention of the legislature, by the enactment of said section 25, to afford remedies to creditors of corporations for the enforcement of their private and personal rights,\u2014and this even to the extent of permitting courts of equity, for good cause shown, to decree the dissolution of the corporation sued.\u201d To the same effect is Wheeler v. Pullman Iron and Steel Co. supra.</p> <p id=\"b505-7\" pgmap=\"505(89) 506(179)\">To hold that, under this statute, whenever creditors of a corporation attempt to collect their just claims against it by action at law, stockholders may invoke the jurisdiction of a court of equity to take charge of all the company assets, and thus defeat the creditors, because the enforcement of their rights by authorized processes of law would result in embarrassment or loss to the company, would be to not only violate its plain provisions, but to allow it to be used to defeat the very purpose for which it was enacted. Here is a bill by a single stockholder, other stockholders not being made parties. Only a part of the creditors are made parties, others being given no opportunity to question the jurisdiction of the court or the sufficiency of the bill. Hone of the causes for which, by the statute, courts of equity are authorized to take charge of corporations and close them up, are alleged. That the ultimate relief prayed for cannot be lawfully granted by the court upon this bill, it seems to us, must be conceded. Can it be said, nevertheless, the court, in making the interlocutory order appointing the receiver, only proceeded irregularly, and therefore the validity of that order cannot be questioned in this proceeding ? We think not. Having no general equity powers in the case, and the bill wholly failing to bring it within the provisions of section 25, the Superior Court exceeded its jurisdiction in making the order which appellees are charged with violating, and that order must therefore be held void.</p> <p id=\"b506-5\" pgmap=\"506\">The judgment of the Appellate Court will be affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b506-6\" pgmap=\"506\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
