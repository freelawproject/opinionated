Your orator further represents, that its predecessor, the partnership comprising the Elgin Butter Company, from the year 1876 and until its merger in your orator, adopted and used upon its letter-heads, price-lists and other stationery, in connection with the name \u2018The Elgin Butter Company,\u2019 the addition, \u2018Proprietor of the Elgin Creamery,\u2019 and that your orator, after its organization, made such use of said additions and continues so to do, and that said addition, since said date, has been extensively circulated upon said letter-heads, price-lists and other stationery, as well as by advertisement among the trade at large and throughout the United States, and that by virtue of such adoption, use and circulation your orator has become and is well known throughout the United States under and by said name, and is thereby entitled to claim the words \u2018The Elgin Butter Company, Proprietor of the Elgin Creamery,\u2019 as and for its own property for all trade purposes, and that no other person or corporation can lawfully use the same, or any substantial portion or similitude thereof, in such a way as has a tendency to mislead and deceive the general public, and induce the belief that any butter manufactured or placed upon the market by any such person or corporation, under any such words or similitude, is the product manufactured or placed upon the market by your orator. Your orator represents that, as a consequence of such adoption, use and circulation of said words for the past fifteen years, the trade and customers have confounded with and addressed orders to it as well by the names \u2018Elgin Creamery,\u2019 \u2018Elgin Creamery Company,\u2019 \u2018Elgin Creamery Butter Company,\u2019 as by its proper corporate name, \u2018The Elgin Butter Company. \u2019 * * * Your orator further represents, that if said Elgin Creamery Company continues, under its corporate name, that portion of its business contemplated by its articles of incorporation which involves the manufacture of and dealing in butter, dealers in the market and the public will be confused, and led into the false belief that the two corporations, to-wit, the Elgin Butter Company and Elgin Creamery Company, are the same, and that thereby great injury will result to the public, and your orator\u2019s said corporate name, and the aforesaid addition thereto, will thereby continue to be infringed upon, and the good will and trade-mark thereof and the property therein will be supplanted and destroyed, and the valuable business and trade which your orator has established by the expenditure of much money and labor, and which, by the most careful consideration and attention, it has been able to maintain under the said corporate name of \u2018The Elgin Butter Company,\u2019 and the aforesaid addition thereto, and the good will and trade-mark thereof attached to and connected 'with the butter manufactured and sold by your orator, as hereinbefore set forth, will be utterly lost or seriously impaired.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-4\" pgmap=\"131\">The prayer of the bill is, that the Elgin Creamery Company and the other defendants be restrained, by the order and injunction of the court, from manufacturing, offering to sell or selling, under the name of \u201cElgin Creamery Company,\u201d as manufacturer, owner or seller, any butter whatever. The Elgin Creamery Company, Sands, Potter and Sullivan, were made parties defendant. The Superior Court of Cook county sustained a demurrer to the bill, and dismissed the same for want of equity.

Averments of simple matters of evidence that do not amount to averments of the facts that they tend to prove, and of immaterial matters, and statements of mere opinions and conclusions of the pleader, are largely omitted therefrom. These may, properly, all be ignored. The demurrer admits only the facts that are well pleaded.</p> <p id=\"b133-9\" pgmap=\"133(31) 134(343)\">The bill, as we read it, is notable for that which it fails to charge. It may well be that the Elgin Creamery Company has no factory wherein butter is manufactured, by the name of \u201cElgin Creamery.\u201d Non constat, that it does not own and operate three creameries located within the territory of said township that are designated and known as \u201cCreamery A,\u201d \u201cCreamery B\u201d and \u201cCreamery C,\u201d or by other distinctive appellations, and still other creameries besides these, there located, that are not known by any special names. All that is contained in the bill of complaint may be true, and yet it be the fact that the Elgin Creamery Company is manufacturing all the butter that it sells, or offers for sale, at a factory or factories owned and operated by itself and located in the township of Elgin. Said allegations may all be true, and yet it be the fact that all the butter it deals in is butter that is made within the territorial limits of Elgin township by farmers living within that township, either at the respective creameries of each individual farmer, or at some creamery or creameries owned and operated in some other way. A creamery is simply a place where butter is made, and it is not the size or capacity of the factory that makes it a creamery. The defendant corporation is authorized by its charter \u201cto operate creameries and manufacture and deal in butter.\u201d By its-articles of incorporation, read in the light of its corporate name, it holds itself out to its customers and to the public as making and dealing in, or dealing in, genuine Elgin butter, or butter manufactured in Elgin or out of milk and dairy products that are known in the market as Elgin milk and dairy products. No averment in the bill shows that it is not so doing, or that it is not doing what it was incorporated to do and what it represents itself as doing. It must be regarded, then, for the purposes of this case, that the Elgin Creamery Company is manufacturing, dealing in and selling only genuine Elgin butter, made within the township and out of milk and dairy supplies there produced.</p> <p id=\"b134-3\" pgmap=\"134(24) 135(125)\">It is not charged or claimed in the bill that the promoters of or the owners of the stock in the Elgin Creamery Company adopted the corporate name by which it was incorporated, for the purpose of misleading or deceiving or otherwise wronging or injuring either its own customers, or the public, or the Elgin Butter Company, complainant herein. No fraud and no wrongful intention are alleged in the bill, and no facts are stated from which any inference of fraud naturally and necessarily arises. Fraud must always be alleged and proven. It is never presumed. Fair and healthy competition in business is beneficial to the public, and redounds to the welfare of the State. It is not justly to be regarded as an index of fraud. The case at bar, then, is to be considered as free from any question of fraud.</p> <p id=\"b135-4\" pgmap=\"135\">The gist of the complaint seems to be, that the use by the Elgin Creamery Company of its corporate name in its business of manufacturing, dealing in and selling butter has a tendency to, and does, confuse and mislead dealers in the market and the public at large, and lead them into the false belief that the corporation incorporated as \u201cElgin Creamery Company\u201d is one and the same with the corporation incorporated as \u201cThe Elgin Butter Company.\u201d The bill proceeds upon the theory that the name \u201cThe Elgin Butter Company,\u201d and the claimed addition thereto of the words \u201cProprietor of the Elgin creamery,\u201d are the trade name and trade-mark of complainant, and that it has the exclusive right and property in both said corporate name and said addition, and that no other person or corporation has a legal right to combine the word \u201cElgin\u201d with either the word \u201cbutter\u201d or the word \u201ccreamery,\u201d in conducting his or its business.</p> <p id=\"b135-5\" pgmap=\"135(66) 136(55)\">The act concerning corporations (chap. 32, sec. 2,) provides that the Secretary of State shall not issue license to form two corporations or companies having the same name. We think that the issuing of licenses to the two corporations involved in this controversy was not in disregard of this statutory provision. The Elgin Butter Company was the first of the two corporations to become incorporated. It has a right to demand protection in the exclusive use of its corporate name, \u201cThe Elgin Butter Company,\u201d which is both its corporate name and its trade name. But \u201cElgin Creamery Company\u201d is quite a different name from \u201cThe Elgin Butter Company.\u201d Ordinary attention will enable any one to discriminate between them.</p> <p id=\"b136-3\" pgmap=\"136\">It cannot be admitted that complainant, by using upon its letter-heads, price-lists and other stationery, in connection with its corporate name of \u201cThe Elgin Butter Company,\u201d the additional words \u201cProprietor of the Elgin Creamery,\u201d has acquired such a property in and monopoly of the words \u201cElgin,\u201d \u201cbutter\u201d and \u201ccreamery,\u201d as that no one else can lawfully use the first of said words in connection with either of the other two\u2014even when they can truthfully be so used. Nor can it be conceded that farmers in and around the city of Elgin cannot sell the butter that they make, as \u201cElgin butter,\u201d nor are they precluded from truthfully designating the places where they severally make their butter as creameries at Elgin. And no more can such a concession be allowed as against the right of any other person or corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing, dealing in or selling butter made at a creamery in Elgin, and out of milk and dairy supplies produced in Elgin. As was said by the Supreme Court of the United States in Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311: \u201cIt must, then, be considered as sound doctrine that no one can apply a name of a district or country to a well-known article of commerce, and obtain thereby such an exclusive right to the application as to prevent others inhabiting the district, or dealing in similar articles coming from the district, from using the same designation.\u201d Like doctrine has been announced by this court and in equally emphatic language. Candee, Swan &amp; Co. v. Deere &amp; Co. 54 Ill. 439 ; Bolander v. Peterson, 136 id. 215. And to the same effect are the cases of Glendon Iron Co. v. Uhler, 75 Pa. St. 467, Laughman\u2019s Appeal, 128 id.. 1, and Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer, 139 U. S. 540.</p> <p id=\"b137-4\" pgmap=\"137\">Even if the corporate names of the two corporations are somewhat similar, yet, in the absence of any intent, act or artifice to mislead dealers in the market or the public at large as to the identity of the corporations, the Elgin Creamery Company has the same right to use its corporate name in the transaction of its business that the Elgin Butter Company has to use its corporate name. It would seem that the same rule should apply to corporations, in this regard, that obtains in respect to natural persons, and in the absence of any fraudulent or wrongful intention or act, or any contract to prohibit it, every natural person has the absolute right to use his own name in his own business. Meneely v. Meneely, 62 N. Y. 427.</p> <p id=\"b137-5\" pgmap=\"137\">The cases of Merchants' Detective Ass. v. Detective Mercantile Agency, 25 Ill. App. 250, Montgomery v. Thompson, L. R. 16 App. Cas. (H. of L.) 217, Croft v. Day, 7 Beav. 84, and El Modello Cigar Manf. Co. v. Gato, 25 Fla. 886, are not here in point, since in each of those cases there was present the element of fraudulent acts and intention.</p> <p id=\"b137-6\" pgmap=\"137\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b137-7\" pgmap=\"137\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
