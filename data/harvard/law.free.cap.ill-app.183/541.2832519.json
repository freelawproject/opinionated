Master and servant, \u00a7 191<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014duty of master to warn servant. A master is not bound to warn a servant of dangers which are necessarily attendant upon the work he is about to do and of which he is warned by the very nature o\u00ed his employment, nor is he obliged to instruct a servant as to dangers which are obvious or known or ought to be known to him.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-7\" pgmap=\"564\">2. Mines and minerals, \u00a7 176<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show negligence in not warning servant. In an action for damages resulting from the death of a timberman employed in defendant\u2019s mine, a verdict for plaintiff held sustained by evidence showing that the deceased was inexperienced and that the manager was guilty of negligence in directing deceased to work in a dangerous place without warning him of the danger.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-8\" pgmap=\"564\">3.

Instruction telling the jury to give the testimony of witnesses \u201csuch weight and credit as they think the same justly entitled to receive,\u201d held not objectionable as allowing jury unlimited latitude in judging of credibility of witnesses and not requiring them to base their judgment on the evidence, where the instruction distinctly tells them that they must fairly and impartially weigh and consider all the evidence and circumstances in proof.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b565-5\" pgmap=\"565\">9. Negligence, \u00a7 213*\u2014when instruction not misleading. Instruction that question of negligence of defendant and due care on part of deceased are to be determined from the evidence, held not misleading because it does not inform the jury of the law applicable to the case where the theories of the law applicable are given in other instructions.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
