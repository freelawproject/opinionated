A broker was employed by a firm to sell lands and in order to effectuate a sale it was necessary to sell the land of a purchaser. Such purchaser\u2019s price could not be obtained and on making a sale for a less price the broker was charged on the firm books with the balance not obtained and he accepted a settlement with the firm on such basis. The broker claimed a member of the firm individually owed him the full commissions. A contract and letters were in the individual member\u2019s name, but both partners took part in the transactions and the use of one partner\u2019s name was a matter of convenience. Held, the broker could not recover from the individual member of the firm.</headnotes><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b213-18\" pgmap=\"213\">Mr. Justice Clark took no part in this decision.</p><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-6\" pgmap=\"213\">Error to the Municipal' Court of Chicago; the Hon.
