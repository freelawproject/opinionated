A broker suing to recover commission for effecting an exchange of property testified that defendant accepted an offer for a certain amount for his property and agreed to take in exchange incumbered property, assuming the mortgage, the equity being equal in value to his property, but did not testify that the owner of the incumbered property had made such an offer. Defendant testified he neither made nor accepted the offer, and the owner of the mortgaged property contradicted plaintiff.
