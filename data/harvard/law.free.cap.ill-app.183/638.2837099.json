Intoxicating liquors, \u00a7 225<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when right to recover for intoxication of husband. In an action by a wife under the Dram-shop Act, \u00a7 9, J. &amp; A. j[ 4609, for injury to her person and means of support occasioned by two saloon keepers selling her husband intoxicating liquors, the evidence showed that the husband lost his position by being habitually drunk, failed to support her, struck her when drunk and constantly bought liquors at defendant\u2019s saloon after notice not to sell him. One defendant did not dispute the facts and the other offered evidence that the wife quarreled with her husband and that no sales were made after notice to desist. Held, a verdict for defendants was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-5\" pgmap=\"660\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Madison county; the Hon.

Where a declaration charges and the Dramshop Act, \u00a7 9, J. &amp; A. If 4609, authorizes recovery for injuries to the person or property of a wife from the intoxication of her husband, and there is evidence of acts of personal violence by the husband against his wife, an instruction practically limiting a right of recovery to injury to the means of support is misleading.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
