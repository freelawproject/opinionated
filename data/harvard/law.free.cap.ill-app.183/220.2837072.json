Evidence, \u00a7 331<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014receipt may be explained by parol evidence. Where a voucher and receipt, reciting a payment in full, is a receipted bill or statement of account, oral evidence as to the circumstances under which the voucher and receipt was given is admissible for the purpose of showing the real intention of the parties and that the money was not-received.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-9\" pgmap=\"243\">2. Payment, \u00a7 37<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>-\u2014when instruction is misleading. An instruction referring to the giving of notes or a receipt as though it were claimed by defendant that the receipt was given and the notes accepted \u201cin full settlement of the debt in controversy\u201d is misleading when the debt in controversy had no existence at such time.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-10\" pgmap=\"243\">3. Payment, \u00a7 36<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instruction is confusing. An instruction to find for the plaintiff if defendant had not paid for a part of the work, and further if a receipt was given for notes ip payment which were not paid is misleading and confusing where there is no claim that the notes were paid but it is claimed that the debt was paid by a third party.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-11\" pgmap=\"243\">4. Instructions, \u00a7 87<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014weight of evidence. An instruction requiring a defendant to \u201csatisfy\u201d the jury by a fair preponderance of evidence as to a certain payment requires an improper degree of proof.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-12\" pgmap=\"243\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1639<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when improper instruction is not cured. An instruction improperly requiring defendant to \u201csatisfy\u201d the jury as to a certain payment is not harmless where there is no other language which can be construed as correcting or explaining the statement.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b243-13\" pgmap=\"243(20) 244(33)\">6. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1526<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014improper instruction not harmless where verdict may not be proper. Error in instructions cannot be considered harmless on the grounds that the merits of the controversy are with the appellee where there is evidence which, if believed by the jury, would have justified a different verdict.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b243-4\" pgmap=\"243\">Stein, Mayer &amp; Stein, for appellant; Harry M.
