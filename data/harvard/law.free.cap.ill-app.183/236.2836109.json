Where it appears in an action of forcible detainepthat the occupant is in possession under a lease voidable under the statute of frauds and is a tenant from month to month and thirty days\u2019 notice has been given, the question is one of law and a verdict for the plaintiff may be directed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b258-15\" pgmap=\"258(44) 259(24)\">3.

Where a written lease under seal for five years is signed by the lessor\u2019s agent, having only verbal authority, receipt of rent by the lessor amounts to nothing more than a partial performance of a contract invalid under the statute of frauds, which will not, in a court of law, avoid the statute.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\" pgmap=\"258\">Error to the Municipal Court of Chicago; the Hon.

In the absence of any fiduciary relations between parties, neglect to notify a tenant that the agent of landlord had no written authority to execute a lease for five, years is not a fraud, and coupled with the fact that the lessor supposed the lease was for one or two years will not support a contention that to permit a recovery of the possession of the premises, after thirty days\u2019 notice to the tenant as a monthly tenant under an invalid lease, permits the statute of frauds to be used to perpetrate a fraud.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"b259-6\" pgmap=\"259\">5.
