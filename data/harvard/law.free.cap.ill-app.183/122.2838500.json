The original hill was filed by Holinger, trustee, and Chipman in No. 18,535, May 15,1911, against Harriet E. and Arthur W. Dickinson, Julius Stichert and others to foreclose a trust deed in the nature of a mortgage given by the Dickinsons to Holinger, trustee, to secure their principal note for one thousand seven hundred dollars and certain interest notes, payable to their own order, by them indorsed and held by complainant Chipman. The bill alleged that Julius Stichert claimed some interest in the mortgaged premises subsequent to the lien of said trust deed. June 27, 1911, Julius Stichert filed his cross-bill in the cause, alleging that he had entered into a contract with Arthur W. Dickinson for the purchase of the mortgaged premises and had made certain payments on such contract. June 28 the cause was referred to a master to take and report the proofs with his conclusions. The complainants demurred to the cross-bill, the other defendants thereto were defaulted, and July 11 the demurrer of the complainants to the cross-bill was sustained and the cross-complainant electing to stand by his cross-bill, the same was dismissed. July 18 a final decree of foreclosure and sale was entered and on the same day an appeal was prayed by' Julius Stichert and allowed to the Supreme Court, \u201cfrom said final decree this day entered,\u201d on his giving bond, etc. The appeal bond recites that complainants \u201con July 18 recovered a decree against Stichert and others for the foreclosure of a deed of trust in the nature of a mortgage, etc,\u201d from which decree Stichert had prayed an appeal to the Supreme Court. The appeal was perfected, but the Supreme Court transferred the cause to this court. The clerk of that court transmitted to the clerk of this court the record, but the appellant refused to pay the advance costs demanded by the clerk and the clerk refused to docket the cause without the payment of such costs. The appellees on March 30, 1912, filed in this court a transcript of a \u201cShort Record\u201d of the cause and moved that the appeal be dismissed. This proceeding was docketed as case No. 18,513. The court denied the motion to dismiss the appeal and directed the clerk to file without payment of advance costs the record transmitted to him by the clerk of the Supreme Court, and the same was filed and docketed as case No. 18,535.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-6\" pgmap=\"146\">G.

No appeal was taken from the order entered July 11 sustaining\u2019 the demurrer of Holinger, trustee, and Chip-man to the cross-bill and dismissing the same, but the appeal, by the terms of the order allowing it and of the appeal bond, was from the decree of foreclosure entered July 18 on the original bill. The general rule as to what is brought up by an appeal from a final decree is that, \u201cWhile an appeal from a final decree in equity ordinarily brings up the whole cause upon its merits, including interlocutory orders connected with the decree, such an appeal does not bring up a question which was definitely adjudicated and disposed of prior to the making and entering of the final decree appealed from.\u201d 3 Cyc. 228. \u201cAn appeal from the final decree only, cannot bring up a question which had been definitely adjudicated and disposed of previous to the time of making such decree.\u201d Walworth, Chancellor, in Mapes v. Coffin, 5 Paige (N. Y.) 296. In Siegel v. Andrews &amp; Co., 181 Ill. 350, it was contended that the chancellor erred in dismissing the cross-bill as to defendants who had answered and had a hearing on the cross-bill and their respective answers, and it was said (p. 356): \u201cThe contention is not tenable, because appellants have not appealed from the decree dismissing the cross-bill as to defendants who had a hearing on the bill and answers. This decree was entered January 5, 1893, and the decree appealed from was entered November 13, 1897. Appeals are purely statutory, and no one can, on appeal, complain of a decree from which he has not appealed.\u201d \u201cThe cross-bill was no part of the original proceeding, and it in no wise depended upon it.\u201d Myers v. Manny, 63 Ill. 211.</p> <p id=\"AmV\" pgmap=\"147\">The record is a praecipe record.
