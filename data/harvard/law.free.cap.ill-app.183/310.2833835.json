Bills and notes, ,\u00a7 450<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence shows notice of nonpayment. In an action against the indorser of a promissory note the manager of the collecting bank testified that he wrote letters to each indorser notifying him of dishonor, that he gave the letters to a boy whose duty it was to. copy them and take them to the mailing department, and the book copy was introduced. Another indorser testified that the letters were received and recited a conversation to that effect with defendant. Defendant denied the conversation, the receipt of the letter and other evidence. Held, a finding that notice of dishonor was given would be sustained.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-11\" pgmap=\"333\">5. Evidence, \u00a7 134<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014what preliminary proof is sufficient to admit secondary evidence of note. The evidence of the manager of a collecting bank that notices of dishonor of a promissory note should have been mailed to indorsers in due course of business, and of an indorser of receipt of the notice, is sufficient to admit secondary evidence of the contents of the notice against another indorser, when considered with the fact that his attorney when asked to produce the original notice stated in open court: \u201cWe are unable to produce it.\u201d</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b333-14\" pgmap=\"333\">6. Appeal and errob, \u00a7 1489*\u2014admission of incompetent evidence otherwise established is harmless. In an action on a promissory note, the admission of evidence as to mailing a notice of dishonor is harmless, though it may not, when considered alone, be sufficient to show mailing, where there is sufficient evidence in the entirety to show mailing and receipt of notice by the defendant.</headnotes><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b333-3\" pgmap=\"333\">Ode L.
