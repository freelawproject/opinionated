C. Fisher, Five Thousand Dollars at the National White River Bank, Bethel, Vermont, value received with interest from date, \u2019 \u2019 signed by both defendants who are, and were at the time, husband and wife. Plea, the general issue. Trial by the court, and judgment for plaintiff against both defendants. The sole defense was that Pauline signed the note as surety for her husband\u2019s debt and in no other capacity, and so is not liable thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"> Two questions are briefed and discussed: (a) Whether the defendant Pauline E. Fisher, who signed the note with her husband as a joint maker, could, in view of the form of the note, be permitted to show by parol evidence that she signed it solely as surety for her husband\u2019s debt; and (b) whether she could make that defense as against the plaintiff who is found, in effect, to have taken the note in good faith and for value before maturity, in due course of business, and had no notice of any infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">The court in effect has found as a fact that the note was signed by Pauline E. Fisher as surety for her husband\u2019s debt and in no other capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The first question was- involved in the case of <em>National Bank of Newbury </em>v. <em>Carrie M. Hale, </em>98 Vt. 481, 129 Atl. 155, in which an opinion has been handed down in favor of the defendant. The second was involved in the ease of <em>Wetmore &amp; Morse Granite Co. </em>v. <em>Ryle et al., </em>93 Vt. 245, 107 Atl. 109. These cases are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>controlling as to the disposition .of this case and any further discussion of the law can serve no good purpose at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to .dismiss the exceptions was fully treated in this case when it was first before this Court. <em>Seaboard National Bank </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>98 Vt. 20, 124 Atl. 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>Judgment reversed as to Pauline E. Fisher, and judgment for her to recover costs. </em>As <em>to defendant E. A. Fisher, judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
