The defendant used 18 barrels of this flour without paying for it. Shortly after, he went into bankruptcy, scheduled this claim as a liability, and in due course was discharged. The plaintiff did not prove his claim or take any part in the bankruptcy proceedings. He brought this tort action in the form of trover, and the defendant answered his discharge as a bar. The trial below was in the Caledonia County municipal court, and the defendant had judgment on facts found by the court. The plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The claim is barred by the discharge unless the defendant\u2019s use of the flour amounted to a \u201cwilful and malicious injury\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s property, within the meaning of section 17 (2) of the national Bankruptcy Act (U. S. Comp. St., \u00a7 9601). On this question, the plaintiff has the burden of proof. <em>Bailey\u2019s Admx. </em>v. <em>Gleason, </em>76 Vt. 115, 56 Atl. 537; <em>In re Peterson, </em>77 Vt. 226, 59 Atl. 828; <em>In re Grout, </em>88 Vt. 318, 92 Atl. 646, Ann. Cas. 1917A, 210. It may be admitted that the fact that a defendant has converted a plaintiff\u2019s property is not, alone, enough to save the claim therefor from a discharge in bankruptcy. <em>In re Ennis &amp; Stoppani, </em>171 Fed. 755, 22 Am. B. R. 679; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Sault, </em>93 Vt. 412, 108 Atl. 267, 18 A. S. R. 1426. But when the conversion is the result of a deliberate and intentional disregard' of another\u2019s legal rights, it is a wilful and malicious injury to his property. It is wilful, because it is voluntary (Webster\u2019s New Internat. Dict.); and it is malicious, because it is intentional. <em>In re Cote, </em>93 Vt. 10, 106 Atl. 519; <em>Wellman </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>93 Vt. 322, 107 Atl. 396; <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Colwell, </em>193 U. S. 473, 48 L. ed. 754, 24 Sup. Ct. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\"> If the question before us was a question of fact depending upon an inference to be drawn from facts found, in support of the judgment, we should have to assume that the inference was drawn below in defendant\u2019s favor. This would accord with our time-honored rule. But the facts being found, the question here presented is one of law.' This sufficiently appears from <em>Tinker </em>v. <em>Colwell, supra, </em>wherein Mr. Justice Peckham says that the averment that the judgment there in question was not recovered for a wilful and malicious injury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the person or property of the plaintiff was \u201ca mere conclusion of law and not an averment of fact.\u201d So the question is, Do the facts found, when considered with reference to their legal effect, bring the case within the exception made in the Act? The record admits of one construction only: The defendant deliberately and knowingly appropriated the plaintiff\u2019s property without the latter\u2019s knowledge or consent; therefore, the discharge in bankruptcy does not bar the plaintiff\u2019s claim. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Kavanaugh, </em>242 U. S. 138, 61 L. ed. 205, 37 Sup. Ct. 38; <em>In re Cote, </em>93 Vt. 10, 106 Atl. 519; <em>Wellman </em>v. <em>Mead, </em>93 Vt. 322, 107 Atl. 396; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Sault, </em>93 Vt. 412, 108 Atl. 267, 18 A. L. R. 1426; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Bryant Fertilizer Co., </em>(C. C. A.) 271 Fed. 473; <em>In re Stenger </em>(D. C.) 283 Fed. 419; <em>Heaphy </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>232 N. Y. 526, 134 N. E. 557; <em>Schwen </em>v. <em>Kerr, </em>232 N. Y. 527, 134 N. E. 557; <em>Clair </em>v. <em>Colmes et al., </em>245 Mass. 281, 139 N. E. 519. See, also, <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>54 Vt. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Nor are the plaintiff\u2019s rights prejudiced by what took place at the interview with the defendant set forth in the findings. There was' then some of the flour on hand, and the plaintiff refrained from taking it, relying upon the defendant\u2019s promise to pay up the amount he was in arrear. This was not a waiver of the plaintiff\u2019s title or of his rights; it was a mere delay granted on the defendant\u2019s promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\"> The plaintiff asks for a certified execution. The judgment below being against the plaintiff, this is his first opportunity to move for such an execution, and the motion is properly made to this Court. <em>Darling </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>54 Vt. 101; <em>Oben </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>89 Vt. 158, 94 Atl. 506. From what we have already said, it necessarily follows that the cause of action arose from the wilful and malicious acts of the defendant, within the meaning of G-. L. 2384, and that the plaintiff is entitled to a close-jail execution \u2014 and we so find and determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff for $181.43, with interest thereon from May 20, 1924, and costs. Lei a certified execution issue.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
