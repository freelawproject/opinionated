J.</author>\n<p id=\"As6\">This is an appeal from the decision of the probate court for the District of Fair Haven allowing Hannah Flory, the widow of Adolphus Flory, deceased, an extension of time for waiving the pecuniary provisions made for her in her husband\u2019s will. An appeal was taken from the decision by the executor of the estate to the Rutland county court. In the latter court the widow moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the executor had no such interest in the estate as is essential by statute to the right of appeal; that the executor\u2019s appeal raised the question of jurisdiction in the county court, for if the appeal was not within the right of the executor by statute, it could not give that court jurisdiction. The motion was denied and the widow excepted. Thereupon the cause was passed to the Supreme Court under the statute before final judgment. The question being raised by motion to dismiss, it must be determined on what appears of record. <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Grand Trunk Ry. Co., </em>76 Vt. 313, 57 Atl. 104.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The petition of the executor praying for an appeal sets forth that he is the duly qualified executor of the last will and testament of Adolphus Flory, deceased, \u201cand as such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>executor is interested in his estate.\u201d That \u201cas executor,\u201d he \u201cobjects to the judgment and order of the said court on the ground that said widow was barred by the Statute of Limitations and that such judgment and order was contrary and against the weight of the evidence.\u201d The record contains nothing showing or alleging that Pelkey has any interest in the estate as an individual, or otherwise than in his representative capacity as executor. In such capacity he has no legal right or liability affected by the decree and judgment from which the appeal was attempted to be taken. He therefore had no right of appeal under the statute, and his attempt in this respect could give the county court no jurisdiction of the matter. The denial of the motion to dismiss was error. <em>In re Vincent\u2019s </em>Estate, 84 Vt. 89, 78 Atl. 714; <em>Peck\u2019s Admr. </em>v. <em>Peck\u2019s Admr., </em>91 Vt. 91, 99 Atl. 635; <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Simonds\u2019 Estate, </em>96 Vt. 110, 117 Atl. 103, 28 A.

And when such an appeal is taken the appellant shall file in the county court to which the appeal is granted \u201ca certified copy of the record of the proceedings appealed from, of the application for and the allowance of the appeal\u201d with evidence of notice to the adverse party, etc. G. L. 3465; <em>Lynde </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>57 Vt. 597. It is to be presumed <em>that the </em>probate court correctly performed its duty in this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>gard, and that the certified copies furnished by it to the appellant for the purpose of the appeal in question were true copies of record, and of the application, nothing to the contrary appearing.
