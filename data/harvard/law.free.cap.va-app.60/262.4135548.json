Garcia asks the Court to reverse his convictions, arguing that the trial court erred when it refused to strike a prospective juror for cause. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Garcia was charged with assault and battery of a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest, two counts of obstruction of justice, and appearing intoxicated in public. He elected to be tried by a jury. During the process of jury selection, the trial court asked the following question of the venire: \u201c[n]ow is there any other reason that we have discussed ... why you can\u2019t give this case your full and undivided attention and render a fair and impartial verdict?\u201d A member of the venire, Ms. Bergy, indicated that she did and that she \u201cwould rather share it privately.\u201d She explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">I am just concerned that I live very close to the area where the events in question occurred. I am just a little concerned that there would be family members or friends who would be seeking me out since I am on the jury, or, you know\u2014I don\u2019t know if that is a reasonable\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">THE COURT: Oh, I see. Your concern is about if you sat in judgment in this case because you live close by.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>MS. BERGY: I don\u2019t think I know anybody who knows the man on trial, but I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">THE COURT: Did you have questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: No, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">THE COURT: Questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">[DEFENDANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Do you believe that that may affect your ability to pay attention to the case? Would your mind be with your family and your safety concerns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">MS. BERGY: Slightly. I just thought I should bring it up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">THE COURT: If you live close to the area, do you feel you really feel\u2014on a scale of 1 to 10 that you would be a 10?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">MS. BERGY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">THE COURT: Do you go there quite often or familiar with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">MS. BERGY: Yes. I would just be concerned if we lived in the same neighborhood or something possibly and I don\u2019t know if we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-15\">MS. BERGY: Does that make sense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">THE COURT: It does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-17\">MS. BERGY: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-18\">THE COURT: I understand what you are saying. Did you have any other questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-19\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I understand and appreciate your concerns, but do you believe you could provide your full time and attention to the testimony in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-20\">MS. BERGY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-21\">[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And, would you decide the case based on the evidence in the courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-22\">MS. BERGY: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>[COMMONWEALTH\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And would you be fair and impartial to the Commonwealth and the Defendant, Mr. Garcia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">MS. BERGY: Yes. Most definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">THE COURT: Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Counsel for the defendant argued that he \u201ccould see some visible fear in her, and the fact that she has indicated that she is fearful for her family, I think that is a hard thing for her to overcome and to sit on this jury.\u201d The court responded that while Bergy appeared nervous, she did not appear fearful, and she had obviously \u201ccalmed herself down when she got up here after a while.\u201d Defense counsel argued that \u201cshe has revealed a fear for her family\u201d and that constituted \u201creason enough to strike her for cause.\u201d The court declined to strike her for cause, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-8\">[s]he said she can be fair. She said she would sit. She was concerned. I think her honesty is appreciated. I\u2019m not sure all jurors don\u2019t have some concerns about sitting as a juror in judgment of their peers. I think her candor was, frankly, refreshing in the case. I am not going to strike her for cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Bergy ultimately was removed by a peremptory strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">Following his trial, Garcia was found not guilty of the appearing intoxicated in public charge and was convicted on all other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">The constitutions of the United States and of Virginia protect a defendant\u2019s right in criminal cases to be tried by an impartial jury. U.S. Const, amend. VI; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. Virginia law goes beyond the protections afforded under federal law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by further providing that \u201c[i]t is prejudicial error for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the trial court to force a defendant to use peremptory strikes to exclude a venireman from the jury panel if that person is not free from exception.\u201d <em>Townsend v. Commonwealth, </em>270 Va. 325, 329, 619 S.E.2d 71, 73 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In assessing potential jurors, trial courts must resolve \u201cany reasonable doubt as to a juror\u2019s qualifications ... in favor of the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 297, 298, 227 S.E.2d 734, 735 (1976). Once a trial court has resolved any such doubt and satisfied itself that a prospective juror will afford both parties a fair trial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">[o]n appellate review, this Court must give deference to the circuit court\u2019s determination whether to exclude a prospective juror because that court was able to see and hear each member of the venire respond to questions posed. The circuit court is in a superior position to determine whether a prospective juror\u2019s responses during <em>voir dire </em>indicate that the juror would be prevented from or impaired in performing the duties of a juror as required by the court\u2019s instructions and the juror\u2019s oath.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\"><em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 105, 115, 546 S.E.2d 446, 451 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">The United States Supreme Court has aptly noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAh\">[djemeanor plays a fundamental role not only in determining juror credibility, but also in simply understanding what a potential juror is saying. Any complicated <em>voir dire </em>calls upon lay persons to think and express themselves in unfamiliar terms, as a reading of any transcript of such a proceeding will reveal. Demeanor, inflection, the flow of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>questions and answers can make confused and conflicting utterances comprehensible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1038 n. 14, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 2892 n. 14, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). For this reason, a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to strike a juror for cause \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless there has been manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 826, 553 S.E.2d 731, 732 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Appellant argues that Bergy evinced \u201ca certain bias against [him].\u201d He contends that Bergy \u201cprejudged the case and found the Appellant guilty\u201d and, moreover, that her fear was that \u201cAppellant\u2019s friends and family would seek her out for revenge because she served on the jury [that] convict[ed] him.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. These arguments do not withstand scrutiny. The compound question Bergy was asked was whether there existed a reason \u201c[1] why you can\u2019t give this case your full and undivided attention and [2] and render a fair and impartial verdict.\u201d In response, Bergy then expressed a \u201cconcern\u201d that she \u201clive[s] very close to the area where the events in question occurred.\u201d This concern was hypothetical: she did not know whether she lived near the crime scene and she did not think that she knew anybody who knew the defendant, but she was \u201cnot sure.\u201d Her \u201cconcern\u201d was that \u201cfamily members or friends who would be seeking me out since I am on the jury.\u201d In short, her concern was directed at the first part of the court\u2019s compound question, whether she could give the case her full and undivided attention, not the second part of the question, whether she would be fair and impartial. Bergy\u2019s responses on their face do not lend themselves to extrapolations of bias and a predisposition to convict. Nothing in Bergy\u2019s statements suggests that she would reflexively vote to convict. None of her statements exhibit any bias. A hypothetical \u201cconcern\u201d about being approached by persons who are family or friends of a litigant, including the defendant himself, is not tantamount to bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Popular movies and fiction at times depict jurors being approached by persons who seek to influence their deliberations\u2014a rare circumstance in actuality, but one that layper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>sons unfamiliar with the legal system easily might misapprehend.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nothing in Bergy\u2019s comments can be construed as bias or as prejudging the case for or against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In assessing Bergy\u2019s responses, we find apt the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">[prospective jurors represent a cross section of the community, and their education and experience vary widely. Also, unlike witnesses, prospective jurors have had no briefing by lawyers prior to taking the stand. Jurors thus cannot be expected invariably to express themselves carefully or even consistently. Every trial judge understands this, and under our system it is that judge who is best situated to determine competency to serve impartially.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\"><em>Patton, </em>467 U.S. at 1039, 104 S.Ct. at 2893. The trial court, based on its observations of Bergy\u2019s demeanor and the totality of her responses, concluded that she was simply being candid about her concern about living in proximity to the crime scene and the possibility that she might be approached by outsiders. The trial court accepted as true her statement that she would consider the case based on the evidence presented in the courtroom and that she \u201c[m]ost definitely\u201d would \u201cbe fair and impartial to the Commonwealth and the Defendant.\u201d We find the trial court\u2019s assessment of Bergy\u2019s responses persuasive, and discern no manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to strike her for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Appellant seeks to analogize the facts at hand to <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. 297, 227 S.E.2d 734, where a juror believed \u201cthe fact that [the defendant] is here is [a] strong indication that he is guilty.\u201d <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300 n. *, 227 S.E.2d at 736 n. * \u201cIt was in the face of this obviously impermissible statement of bias that the prosecutor\u2019s \u2018long, complex, leading questions\u2019 failed to rehabilitate the juror.\u201d <em>Hopson v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 144, 157 n. 2, 662 S.E.2d 88, 95 n. 2 (2008) (citing <em>Breeden, </em>217 Va. at 300 n. *, 227 S.E.2d at 736 n. *). Here, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>contrast, Bergy never manifested a bias against appellant or any notion that the defendant would have to establish his innocence. <em>Breeden </em>is plainly inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Finally, appellant contends that Bergy was not suitably \u201crehabilitated.\u201d First, the record does not reveal any objection on this point. Accordingly, the issue is not properly before us. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. <em>See also Bell v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 172, 196, 563 S.E.2d 695, 711 (2002) (failure to object to trial court\u2019s use of leading questions to rehabilitate a juror waived the issue). Moreover, the premise behind the argument is mistaken. A juror who initially signals a basis for disqualification, perhaps due to ignorance, can be rehabilitated, provided that \u201cproof of a prospective juror\u2019s impartiality ... come[s] from his own mouth [rather than from the] predictable responses to persuasive suggestions from the attorney who attempts to rehabilitate the prospective juror.\u201d <em>Bennett v. Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 448, 469, 374 S.E.2d 303, 316 (1988). By the same token, suggestive questions from the trial court may not suffice in rehabilitating the member of the venire who has expressed a bias. <em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 237, 242-43, 391 S.E.2d 597, 600 (1990). Proper rehabilitation is necessary only after a prospective juror has expressed a disqualifying comment. An abstract concern about living near the crime scene or the possibility of being contacted by outsiders does not stand on the same footing as comments that evince bias or partiality. The trial court correctly discerned that Bergy was simply being candid about her concern. In this situation, the strictures necessary for a proper rehabilitation are not implicated. Bergy\u2019s overall responses to the court\u2019s questions, combined with her assurance that she would \u201cmost definitely\u201d be fair and impartial to the Commonwealth and to the defendant established her impartiality. No further rehabilitation was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The trial court did not err in refusing to strike Bergy from the venire and we, therefore, affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-13\">. <em>See United States v.
