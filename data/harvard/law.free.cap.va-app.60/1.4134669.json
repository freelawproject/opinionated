On appeal, Tiz\u00f3n challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the denial of her mistrial and suppression motions, and two jury instructions. Finding none of Tizon\u2019s challenges persuasive, we affirm her convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">On appeal, we review the evidence in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth v. Hudson, </em>265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). This principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Parks v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted). In determining whether there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, moreover, an appellate court must consider \u201call the evidence\u201d admitted at trial that is contained in the record. <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 94, 103, 688 S.E.2d 168, 173 (2010) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 147, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">From this perspective, the evidence at trial proved Tiz\u00f3n referred to Ahmed Chouaib as her boyfriend. In early 2009, Tiz\u00f3n told a neighbor that her boyfriend had hit her after a quarrel. In July 2009, Tiz\u00f3n purchased a .38 caliber revolver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>and a box of ammunition. Five weeks later, on August 15, 2009, Tiz\u00f3n shot Chouaib to death in her condominium. One shot hit him in the side, the other in the back. Either wound, a medical examiner testified, would have been fatal. The medical examiner also determined the revolver was fired less than three feet from Chouaib\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">After shooting Chouaib, Tiz\u00f3n went to her neighbor\u2019s condominium. Visibly upset, Tiz\u00f3n said she had just killed her boyfriend and showed her neighbor the revolver she used to shoot him. The neighbor took Tiz\u00f3n inside and called 911. During the call, the neighbor asked Tiz\u00f3n if Chouaib had hurt her. Tiz\u00f3n said he \u201chit\u201d or \u201cpushed\u201d her \u201cin the heart.\u201d App. at 681-32. While saying this, Tiz\u00f3n placed her hand on her chest in a pushing motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Accompanied by other officers, Fairfax County Police Officer William Coulter arrived while the neighbor was still on the phone with the 911 operator. Armed with a shotgun in the \u201cready position,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 711, Officer Coulter first attempted to determine the location of the revolver. The neighbor pointed to the handgun which Tiz\u00f3n had dropped outside the residence. Officer Coulter then asked what had happened. In reply, the neighbor relayed Tizon\u2019s statement that she had just shot her boyfriend. \u201cHe messed with my head,\u201d Tiz\u00f3n added. <em>Id. </em>at 697. Tiz\u00f3n appeared to the officer to be distraught but physically unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The neighbor then directed the officer to Tizon\u2019s residence. Officer Coulter found Chouaib on the floor, motionless, with a bullet hole in his chest. Concluding Chouaib was probably dead, Officer Coulter allowed other officers to secure the murder scene. He returned to the neighbor\u2019s condominium to speak with Tiz\u00f3n. Officer Coulter holstered his shotgun in a sling on his back so it was no longer visible to the neighbor. He asked again what was \u201cgoing on\u201d and whether everyone was okay. <em>Id. </em>at 702. The neighbor again told him Tiz\u00f3n had said she shot her boyfriend. Tiz\u00f3n interjected, \u201cHe messed with my head. He takes my car and never returns it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 703. She repeated this explanation two or three times. See<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>ing no evidence that Tiz\u00f3n had been attacked or injured, Officer Coulter arrested Tiz\u00f3n and read her <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Officer Coulter secured Tiz\u00f3n in a police cruiser and later drove her to the station house. En route, Tiz\u00f3n volunteered, \u201cHe takes my car. He messes with my head.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705. During this time, the officer asked no questions of Tiz\u00f3n.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">At the police station, a detective again read Tiz\u00f3n her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Tiz\u00f3n asked for a Spanish translator. She also asked to use the bathroom. The detective tested Tizoris hands for gunshot primer residue and called for a female officer. Before going to the bathroom, Tiz\u00f3n asked for a lawyer. Accompanied by a female officer in the bathroom, Tiz\u00f3n said she was dizzy, her heart was racing, and she found it difficult to breathe. The female officer called for a rescue squad and waited with Tiz\u00f3n in the bathroom. During the wait, the female officer asked Tiz\u00f3n about her physical condition but asked no questions concerning the investigation. Tiz\u00f3n nonetheless volunteered additional incriminating statements before the rescue squad arrived and transported her to the hospital.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Back at the scene of the crime, investigating officers observed no signs of a struggle. They found the box for Tizoris revolver along with a box of bullets. When purchased, the ammunition box contained fifty bullets. Only forty-five bullets were still in the box. Tiz\u00f3n used two bullets to kill Chouaib and three remained in the cylinder of Tizoris revolver. No other weapons or ammunition were found in Tizoris residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>At trial, a weapons expert testified Tizoris revolver could be fired in only two ways. Tiz\u00f3n had to either cock the hammer and thereafter squeeze the trigger (the single action method), or she could squeeze the trigger hard enough to bring back the hammer and release it (the double action method). The single action method required three and one-half pounds of pressure on the trigger, while the double action required fourteen pounds of pressure. In neither scenario could a single squeeze of the trigger fire two rounds. The revolver was also equipped with an internal safety device, referred to as a transfer bar, which prevented the handgun from accidently firing if dropped or knocked about.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">A jury convicted Tiz\u00f3n of second-degree murder and of using a firearm to commit the murder. She now appeals to us, contending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u00ae the evidence was insufficient to prove her guilt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u2022 the trial court should have declared a mistrial because the prosecutor improperly commented on her invocation of the right to counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u2022 the trial court should have suppressed her incriminating statements to police because she was arrested without probable cause and her statements to the police violated her <em>Miranda </em>rights; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u2022 two of the jury instructions misstated the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">A. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">An appellate court does not \u201cask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>see also Cavazos v. Smith, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2, 3, 181 L.Ed.2d 311 (2011) (reaffirming <em>Jackson </em>standard).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cRather, the relevant question is Whether <em>\u2018any </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>278 Va. at 193, 677 S.E.2d at 282 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). Thus, when a jury has rendered its verdict, \u201cit is not for this court to say that the evidence does or does not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt because as an original proposition it might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Cobb v. Commonwealth, </em>152 Va. 941, 953, 146 S.E. 270, 274 (1929). Suffice it to say, an \u201cappellate court is no substitute for a jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">This deferential appellate standard \u201capplies not only to findings of fact, but also to any reasonable and justified inferences the fact-finder may have drawn from the facts proved.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 63-64 (2010); <em>see also Clanton v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 561, 566, 673 S.E.2d 904, 907 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc). Thus, a factfinder may \u201cdraw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 1, 10, 602 S.E.2d 402, 406 (2004) (citation omitted), unless doing so would push \u201cinto the realm of <em>non sequitur,\u201d Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Applying this standard of review, we find ample evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdicts finding Tiz\u00f3n guilty of second-degree murder and of using a firearm during the commission of that murder. \u201cIn Virginia, every unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>homicide is presumed to be murder of the second degree.\u201d <em>Pugh v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 663, 667, 292 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1982). \u201cMurder at common law is a homicide committed with malice, either express or implied.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Canipe v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 629, 642, 491 S.E.2d 747, 753 (1997). Second-degree murder does not require a specific intent to kill. <em>See Rhodes v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 480, 486, 384 S.E.2d 95, 98 (1989). \u201cIt is quite clear that one may slay maliciously without actually intending to kill.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses </em>339 (2011-12). If he acts with malice, the accused need only intend \u201cto perform the conduct\u201d causing the victim\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Malice inheres in the \u201cdoing of a wrongful act intentionally, or without just cause or excuse, or as a result of ill will.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. Commonwealth, </em>186 Va. 55, 61, 41 S.E.2d 500, 503 (1947). \u201cImplied malice may be inferred from \u2018conduct likely to cause death or great bodily harm, wilfully or purposefully undertaken.\u2019 \u201d <em>Canipe, </em>25 Va.App. at 642, 491 S.E.2d at 753 (quoting <em>Essex v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 273, 281, 322 S.E.2d 216, 220 (1984)). It necessarily follows that malice may be \u201cinferred from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon.\u201d <em>Luck v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 827, 834, 531 S.E.2d 41, 44 (2000); <em>see also Tucker v. United States, </em>151 U.S. 164, 169-70, 14 S.Ct. 299, 301, 38 L.Ed. 112 (1894) (\u201cBy the common law, ... malice may be implied from the use of a deadly weapon.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In this case, Tiz\u00f3n purchased a handgun five weeks before using it to kill her boyfriend. She fired twice at point blank range, once in the right side of his chest and once in his back. Because the handgun was a revolver, its trigger had to be manually squeezed for each shot. Because of its safety features, the revolver could not accidentally fire even once, much less twice. Tiz\u00f3n admitted she killed her boyfriend and repeatedly explained her motive: \u201cHe messed with my head. He takes my car and never returns it.\u201d App. at 703. The scene of the homicide revealed no evidence of a struggle. Nor was there any indication that her boyfriend was armed. In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>totality, the evidence justifies the jury\u2019s conclusion that Tiz\u00f3n maliciously killed her boyfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On brief, Tiz\u00f3n argues the jury arbitrarily rejected the hypothesis that the shooting was an \u201caccident\u201d in which Tizon\u2019s boyfriend was \u201chandling the gun\u201d and somehow ended up getting shot twice (including once in the back) during a \u201cstruggle between the parties.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 15. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Under settled principles, \u201cthe Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that <em>flow from the evidence, </em>not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Scott v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 166, 172, 684 S.E.2d 833, 837 (2009) <em>(en </em>banc) (emphasis added and citation omitted). No evidence suggested Tiz\u00f3n accidently shot her boyfriend during a struggle. Moreover, even if some evidence supported this theory, \u201cthe reasonable-hypothesis principle is not a discrete rule unto itself.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>53 Va.App. 671, 681, 674 S.E.2d 571, 576 (2009) (quoting <em>Haskins, </em>44 Va.App. at 8, 602 S.E.2d at 405). \u201cWhether the hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is itself a \u2018question of fact,\u2019 subject to deferential appellate review.\u201d <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>54 Va.App. 558, 573, 680 S.E.2d 361, 368 (2009) (quoting <em>Clanton, </em>53 Va.App. at 572-73, 673 S.E.2d at 910).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Stated another way, \u201c[mjerely because defendant\u2019s theory of the case differs from that taken by the Commonwealth does not mean that every reasonable hypothesis consistent with his innocence has not been excluded.\u201d <em>Clanton, </em>53 Va.App. at 573, 673 S.E.2d at 910 (quoting <em>Miles v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 462, 467, 138 S.E.2d 22, 27 (1964)). Thus, \u201cthe question is not whether \u2018some evidence\u2019 supports the hypothesis, but whether a rational factfinder could have found the incriminating evidence renders the hypothesis of innocence unreasonable.\u201d <em>James, </em>53 Va.App. at 682, 674 S.E.2d at 577 (citing indirectly <em>Hudson, </em>265 Va. at 513, 578 S.E.2d at 785). In practical terms, this means that\u2014even if not <em>\u201cinherently </em>incredible\u201d\u2014a defendant\u2019s exculpatory version of events need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>not be accepted by the factfinder. <em>Montgomery v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 188, 190, 269 S.E.2d 352, 353 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">For these reasons, a rational factfinder could find Tiz\u00f3n guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of second-degree murder and of using a firearm during the commission of that murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">B. REQUESTS FOR MISTRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Tiz\u00f3n contends the prosecutor \u201cmade deliberate reference on multiple occasions throughout the trial to [her] assertion of her right to counsel.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. She claims these improper remarks occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement, during her direct examination of one of the detectives, and during closing argument. <em>Id. </em>at 21. The trial court erred, Tiz\u00f3n contends, by not declaring a mistrial. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement advised the jurors that Tiz\u00f3n \u201cmade no statements\u201d at police headquarters. App. at 615. Tizon\u2019s counsel did not object to this remark, ask for a curative instruction, or request a mistrial. Counsel later explained he chose not to do so for tactical reasons. <em>See id. </em>at 1547; Oral Argument Audio at 10:23 to 10:43. \u201cA motion for a mistrial \u2018must be made at the time an objectionable element is injected into the trial of the case.\u2019 It is too late to move for a mistrial after the Commonwealth and defense have rested, after the jury has retired, or at the conclusion of counsel\u2019s opening or closing statement.\u201d Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 17:26, at 545 (2011-12) (footnotes omitted). Having made no timely motion for a mistrial, Tiz\u00f3n waived any appellate challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper remark during opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">During the testimony of one of the detectives, the prosecutor asked: \u201cWhile you were in there collecting the [gunshot residue] did she say anything at that time?\u201d App. at 787. The detective answered, \u201cYeah. She asked\u2014she wanted an attorney.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Tizon\u2019s counsel objected to the detective\u2019s statement and moved for a mistrial. The trial court sustained the objection and instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>A person who is in custody and is being questioned regarding possible criminal behavior has an absolute right to refuse to answer questions and to have the assistance of an attorney. Any request by that person to have an attorney is an assertion of that absolute constitutional right. And that\u2014and you shall not draw any inference or conclusion or negative connotation from such a request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 794-95. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial, however, concluding the curative instruction sufficed to address Tizon\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the motion for a mistrial under these circumstances. Except in the rarest of cases, criminal judgments will not be reversed for \u201cthe improper admission of evidence that a court subsequently directs a jury to disregard because juries are presumed to follow prompt, explicit, and curative instructions.\u201d <em>Elliott v. Commonwealth, </em>267 Va. 396, 418, 593 S.E.2d 270, 284 (2004) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhether improper evidence is so prejudicial as to require a mistrial is a question of fact to be resolved by the trial court in each particular case,\u201d <em>id., </em>subject to the \u201cmost deferential standard of appellate review,\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>48 Va.App. 521, 531, 633 S.E.2d 188, 193 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">These principles apply to objections concerning requests for counsel no less than any other objectionable evidence. <em>See Pulley v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 600, 602-06, 525 S.E.2d 51, 52-54 (2000) (distinguishing between objectionable \u201cright to counsel\u201d testimony erroneously <em>admitted </em>into evidence, <em>e.g., Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), and the same type of testimony <em>excluded </em>from evidence, <em>e.g., Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987)). Because the record reveals no reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>doubt the efficacy of the trial judge\u2019s curative instruction in this case, we reject Tizon\u2019s argument that the trial court erred by not declaring a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Finally, Tiz\u00f3n claims the prosecutor improperly stated during closing argument that \u201cthe evidence as a whole must exclude every reasonable theory of innocence,\u201d and \u201cI submit there hasn\u2019t been a reasonable theory of innocence yet.\u201d App. at 1459. Tizon\u2019s counsel objected to this remark but did not timely request a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial. \u201cWhen contesting a prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper argument, a \u2018timely motion for a mistrial or a cautionary instruction is required to preserve the issue for appeal even if an objection was properly made to the conduct or comments and improperly overruled by the trial judge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>44 Va.App. 741, 751 n. 2, 607 S.E.2d 738, 742 n. 2 (citation omitted), <em>adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, </em>45 Va.App. 811, 613 S.E.2d 870 (2005).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">C. DENIAL OF SUPPRESSION MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citation omitted). In doing so, we \u201cconsider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u201d <em>Morris v.

We find this argument meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As we recently observed, the <em>\u201cvery </em>phrase \u2018probable cause\u2019 confirms that the Fourth Amendment does not demand all possible precision.\u201d <em>Joyce v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 646, 658, 696 S.E.2d 237, 243 (2010) (quoting <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 139, 129 S.Ct. 695, 699, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009)). Courts employ a \u201ccommon sense approach\u201d and not a \u201chypertechnical, rigid, and legalistic analysis\u201d when reviewing probable cause determinations. <em>Powell v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 329, 335-36, 701 S.E.2d 831, 833 (2010) (citation omitted). The standard is not calibrated to \u201cdeal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 106, 582 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2003) (citation omitted). Nor does it \u201cdemand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.\u201d <em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 659, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 106, 582 S.E.2d at 450).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Consequently, \u201c[f]inely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of the evidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the probable-cause decision.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Pringle, </em>540 U.S. 366, 371, 124 S.Ct. 795, 800, 157 L.Ed.2d 769 (2003) (citation and internal brackets omitted); <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>669 F.3d 439, 446 (4th Cir.2012) (holding probable cause \u201cis less demanding than a standard requiring a preponderance of the evidence\u201d). Not even a <em>\u201cprima facie </em>showing\u201d of criminality is required. <em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 659, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Illinois v.

Instead, probable cause \u201crequires only a probability or substantial chance of criminal activity, <em>not an actual showing of such activity.\" Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 243 n. 13, 103 S.Ct. at 2335 n. 13 (emphasis added). \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d after all, \u201cdoes not guarantee that only the guilty will be arrested.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>Joyce, </em>56 Va.App. at 659, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (quoting <em>Baker v.

And this means less than evidence which would justify condemnation or conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 107, 582 S.E.2d at 451). \u201cIn other words, even though probable cause means more than a \u2018mere suspicion,\u2019 it is not necessary for the facts to be \u2018sufficient to convict\u2019 the accused of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659-60, 696 S.E.2d at 243. \u201cUnlike a factfinder at trial,\u201d therefore, \u201creasonable law officers need not resolve every doubt about a suspect\u2019s guilt before probable cause is established.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 660, 696 S.E.2d at 243 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Given the evidence in this case, the trial court had ample reason to find probable cause existed to arrest Tiz\u00f3n. Officer Coulter arrived on the scene of a reported shooting. He found what appeared to be a dead body with gunshot wounds, discovered the handgun dropped by Tiz\u00f3n, and learned from Tizon\u2019s neighbor that Tiz\u00f3n had moments before admitted shooting her boyfriend. Tiz\u00f3n claims the officer lacked any \u201cinformation regarding any malicious intent, motive, or premeditation\u201d sufficient to justify an arrest for murder. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 23-24. We disagree with the legal assumption underlying this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Under settled principles, the \u201cabsence of probable cause to believe a suspect committed the <em>particular crime </em>for which he was arrested does not necessarily invalidate the arrest if the officer possessed sufficient objective information to support an arrest on a <em>different </em>charge.\u201d <em>Slayton, </em>41 Va.App. at 109, 582 S.E.2d at 452 (emphasis added); <em>see also McGuire v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 584, 596-97, 525 S.E.2d 43, 49 (2000); <em>Golden v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 618, 625, 519 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">The quantum of probable cause justifying Tizon\u2019s arrest, therefore, need not be specific to a first-degree murder charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>(requiring premeditation), or a second-degree murder charge (requiring malice), or, for that matter, any murder charge. Probable cause to believe she had committed any arrestable offense suffices.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That said, we do not suggest the facts did <em>not </em>constitute probable cause for murder. Our point is simply that it does not matter. The facts known to the arresting officer established probable cause for voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, discharging a firearm in a dwelling, malicious or unlawful wounding, or any number of other arrestable offenses. We thus reject Tizon\u2019s challenge to the trial court\u2019s denial of her suppression motion on probable cause grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">(ii) <em>Violation of Miranda Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In her pretrial motion to suppress, Tiz\u00f3n also argued the officers violated her rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), by questioning her at the scene of the crime without first warning her of her rights, then by obtaining a statement in the police cruiser after her arrest, and later by \u201cinterrogating\u201d her in the bathroom at the police station after she had invoked her right to counsel. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 24-28. Like the trial court, we find none of these assertions persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">As the United States Supreme Court recently reaffirmed, under <em>\u201cMiranda </em>case law, \u2018custody\u2019 is a term of art that specifies circumstances that are thought generally to present a serious danger of coercion.\u201d <em>Howes v. Fields, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1181, 1189, 182 L.Ed.2d 17 (2012). That degree of coercive danger does not exist \u201csimply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect\u201d as the perpetrator of the crime. <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 1188 (summarizing in parenthetical the holding of <em>Oregon v. Mathi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>ason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 494, 97 S.Ct. 711, 713, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) <em>(per curiam)). </em>All the more, it is not dispositive merely that the person questioned is not free to leave:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">Determining whether an individual\u2019s freedom of movement was curtailed, however, is simply the first step in the analysis, not the last. Not all restraints on freedom of movement amount to custody for purposes of <em>Miranda. </em>We have decline[d] to accord talismanic power to the freedom-of-movement inquiry, and have instead asked the additional question whether the relevant environment presents the same inherently coercive pressures as the type of station house questioning at issue in <em>Miranda. </em>Our cases make clear ... that the freedom-of-movement test identifies only a necessary and not a sufficient condition for <em>Miranda </em>custody.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\"><em>Howes, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 1189-90 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Instead, <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only when an officer interrogates a suspect subject to \u201ca formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with a formal arrest.\u201d <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 90, 96, 712 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2011) (citation omitted). Consequently, <em>Miranda </em>\u201cdoes not apply to a temporary investigatory detention\u201d short of \u201ca <em>de facto </em>arrest.\u201d <em>Testa v. Commonwealth, </em>55 Va.App. 275, 283 n. 5, 685 S.E.2d 213, 217 n. 5 (2009) (citation omitted). \u201cFidelity to the doctrine announced in <em>Miranda </em>requires that it be enforced strictly, but only in those types of situations in which the concerns that powered the decision are implicated.\u201d <em>Howes, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 1192 (quoting <em>Maryland v. Shatzer, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1213, 1224, 175 L.Ed.2d 1045 (2010)). \u201cVoluntary confessions,\u201d after all, \u201care not merely a proper element in law enforcement, they are an unmitigated good, essential to society\u2019s compelling interest in finding, convicting, and punishing those who violate the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shatzer, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 1222).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>Applying these principles, we conclude Tizoris scene-of-the-crime argument fails because her incriminating statements preceded any custodial arrest or any degree of detention approximating a custodial arrest. As the trial court found, the investigating officer merely arrived on the scene of a reported shooting and did what any trained officer would: ask questions of anyone who might know something about it. He did not tell Tiz\u00f3n she was not free to leave, place her in any physical restraints, remove her from her neighbor\u2019s condo, engage her in a series of prolonged accusatory questions, or threaten her with any show of force. Until Tiz\u00f3n was formally arrested, she was under no custodial restraint of any nature. We thus reject Tizoris argument that the trial court should have suppressed the incriminating statements she made prior to her formal arrest.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Even so, Tiz\u00f3n continues, the statement she made following her arrest while being transported by the officer to the police station should have been suppressed. We disagree. Tiz\u00f3n did not make the statement in response to any interrogation. She volunteered it. \u201cEven when otherwise applicable, <em>Miranda </em>bars from evidence only a suspect\u2019s responses to police <em>interrogation </em>and has no impact on a suspect\u2019s volunteered statements.\u201d <em>Testa, </em>55 Va.App. at 283, 685 S.E.2d at 217 (footnote omitted). \u201c Wolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment,\u2019 <em>Miranda </em>explained, \u2018and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 478, 86 S.Ct. at 1630).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Finally, Tiz\u00f3n claims she specifically invoked her right to counsel at the police station and was thereafter subjected to a custodial interrogation while using the bathroom. This assertion fails on several grounds. Most prominent among them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>however, is that her statements while in the bathroom were never admitted at trial\u2014a conspicuous circumstance not mentioned in Tizon\u2019s brief on appeal. Because the challenged evidence had no effect on the trial, we decline to offer an opinion on this moot issue. <em>See Yeatts v. Commonwealth, </em>242 Va. 121, 132, 410 S.E.2d 254, 261 (1991) (observing \u201cthe Commonwealth never offered any of the [objected-to] articles into evidence, so the point is moot\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">D. JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON INFERRING INTENT</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Over Tizon\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jurors that they \u201cmay infer that every person intends the natural and probable consequences of his acts\u201d and they \u201cmay, but are not required to, infer malice from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon unless, from all the evidence, [they] have a reasonable doubt as to whether malice existed.\u201d <em>Va. Model Jury Instructions: Criminal </em>Nos. 2.600 &amp; 33.240 (2011). Tiz\u00f3n argues these instructions misstated the law and unconstitutionally shifted to her the burden of proving her innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The Virginia Supreme Court has already addressed the \u201carguments with regard to the constitutionality of instructing the jury\u201d on the \u201cdeliberate use of a deadly weapon,\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 131, 160-61, 688 S.E.2d 220, 236-37 (2010), and has repeatedly rejected the assertion that the \u201cnatural and probable consequences of his acts\u201d instruction unconstitutionally \u201cshifts the burden of proof,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 166, 688 S.E.2d at 239.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court, therefore, did not err by giving these jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Finding no error in the trial court\u2019s decisions or the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts, we affirm Tizon\u2019s convictions for second-degree murder and for use of a firearm during the commission of that murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-8\">. <em>See </em>App. at 388 (\"[H]e said to Maria, 'Maria ...
