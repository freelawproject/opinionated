On appeal she contends: 1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain her conviction where the Commonwealth failed to prove that appellant committed the offense, knew that another committed the offense, or failed to provide the necessary care; 2) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts; 3) the trial court erred in precluding appellant from asking an expert witness on cross-examination whether he agreed or disagreed with specific scientific literature on the profile of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>abusive head trauma perpetrators; and 4) the trial court erred in admitting autopsy photos because the cause of death was not in dispute. We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">On appeal, we view \u201cthe evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing in the circuit court, and we accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences deducible from the evidence.\u201d <em>Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 573, 667 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2008) (citing <em>Jay v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 510, 524, 659 S.E.2d 311, 319 (2008); <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\n<em>A. Events of September 2, 2008</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">So viewed, the evidence indicated that on the morning of September 2, 2008, appellant took her eight-month-old daughter, M.B., to Dr. Anastasia Ketany\u2019s office, where Dr. Ketany examined M.B. and diagnosed her with an upper respiratory infection and ear infection. Dr. Ketany later testified at trial that the child appeared alert and appropriate during the examination and was observed drinking from a cup. Dr. Ketany also testified that appellant seemed rushed and angry at M.B.\u2019s father, Adam Davis, during the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Following the doctor\u2019s appointment, appellant returned to the home she shared with Joshua Cheek, her boyfriend, and left M.B. with Cheek while she went to the pharmacy to get a prescription filled for M.B.\u2019s ear infection. While appellant was out, Cheek gave M.B. a bath, during which time he noticed she \u201cdid not look there at all,\u201d like she was \u201cin a daze.\u201d While M.B. was seated in her bath chair, Cheek saw her head fall forward and then back.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Cheek removed M.B. from the tub, dressed her, and placed her in her swing. While M.B. was in the swing, Cheek noticed she appeared to have a seizure. Cheek stated that M.B. shook for three to five seconds and her eyes rolled toward the back <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>of her head. Cheek removed M.B. from her swing, made multiple calls to appellant\u2019s cell phone, and, upon reaching appellant, described what happened. Appellant told Cheek \u201cnot to worry about it\u201d and that she would be home in a minute. Appellant returned home forty-five minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">After giving M.B. her medication and attempting to feed her, appellant placed M.B. back in her swing, where she remained most of the afternoon and appeared to be asleep. Around 3:30 p.m., appellant called the Child Protective Services employee previously assigned to a case involving M.B., asking if she planned to do a home visit that day. Appellant stated during the phone call that she did not want the employee to visit because M.B. was sick. Around 5:30 p.m., appellant left with Cheek\u2019s grandmother to pick up her car while Cheek played video games with M.B. next to him in her swing. While appellant was gone, Cheek saw M.B. shake again, and her eyes rolled back in her head, and she went \u201clifeless.\u201d After being unable to reach appellant, Cheek called his mother and then 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Paramedics arrived and rushed M.B. to the nearest hospital, where physicians examined M.B. before transferring her to a hospital specializing in pediatric care. At the second hospital, physicians discovered that M.B. had sustained severe head trauma. Dr. Donald Kees examined M.B. and determined that she was brain dead. Doctors placed M.B. on life support, where she remained until September 4, 2008, when life support was removed and she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\n<em>B. The Police Investigation and Grand Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">Doctors who treated M.B. alerted police, who came to the hospital and interviewed appellant and Davis. During this time, appellant consistently informed doctors and police officers that she was not aware of any head trauma suffered by M.B. During these various conversations, appellant did not mention to any medical professionals that M.B. had previously experienced seizures or exhibited seizure-like activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>Kevin Young, an investigative officer, interviewed appellant the day after her daughter was hospitalized. After being told that someone had shaken M.B. to death, appellant told Young that the only thing she could think of was that something had happened when she left M.B. with Cheek so she could get M.B.\u2019s prescriptions. Appellant speculated that maybe when M.B. \u201cwent over into the bathtub,\u201d Cheek had \u201cgrabbed her, freaked out and started shaking her.\u201d Appellant also mentioned for the first time that Cheek stated over the phone when he called appellant that he was scared and that M.B. did not \u201clook right.\u201d Young then asked appellant when did M.B. first have a seizure, and appellant stated that it was when Cheek was bathing M.B. the day she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Tim Stanley, an investigative officer, also interviewed appellant the day after her daughter was hospitalized and on several other occasions. Appellant initially informed Stanley that M.B. lost consciousness at appellant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, but almost immediately backtracked and said that it happened at her home, because Stanley \u201cknew it happened [at her home].\u201d Appellant told Stanley that her grandmother watched M.B. while appellant went to get the child\u2019s prescription on September 2, 2008. Appellant also told Stanley that later in the afternoon a \u201cfriend\u201d came over who was going to take her to get her vehicle, and she left M.B. with the \u201cfriend's son,\u201d Cheek. Appellant told Stanley that when she returned, Cheek was standing in the driveway screaming that M.B. was not breathing and \u201cthey called 911.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Stanley informed appellant that her story did not match what she told the first investigating officer and that he knew she was lying. Appellant apologized for lying and said she lied because she was in a messy custody battle with Davis. Appellant then admitted that Cheek was watching M.B. when appellant was getting the prescription. Appellant also informed Stanley that Cheek called her four or five times while she was getting the prescription, telling her to hurry up and get home. When appellant returned home, she gave M.B. a dose of the new medicine, attempted to feed her, and placed her in her swing.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>Stanley interviewed appellant a second time shortly thereafter on September 9, 2008. During the second interview, appellant first mentioned that M.B. had bumped her head on a table the day she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In January 2009, appellant testified before a grand jury about the events leading up to M.B.\u2019s death. During her testimony, appellant stated that Cheek told her that M.B. had a seizure-like episode on September 1, 2008, the day before M.B. was rushed to the hospital, while appellant was at work. Appellant stated she did not seek medical attention at that time because she thought Cheek was overreacting. Stanley, who was present during appellant\u2019s grand jury testimony, later testified at trial that appellant\u2019s grand jury testimony was the first time he heard anything about the child having a seizure on the day before she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Appellant also claimed during her grand jury testimony that she told Dr. Ketany or her nurse during M.B.\u2019s September 2, 2008 appointment that M.B. \u201cwas having ... these episodes of going unconscious.\u201d Dr. Ketany later testified at trial, asserting that appellant never mentioned M.B. having any seizures or exhibiting seizure-like behavior. According to Dr. Ketany, appellant also did not mention that M.B. hit or bumped her head before coming to the office. Dr. Ketany\u2019s nurse also testified that appellant never mentioned head traumas or seizures when she was examining M.B. prior to Dr. Ketany entering the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Police arrested appellant on October 2, 2009, on indictments for murder in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-32 and felony child abuse in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">After appellant was arrested, Stanley interviewed appellant again. Appellant admitted to lying during her grand jury testimony. Appellant also informed Stanley for the first time that M.B. bumped her head on the sink and again \u201chard\u201d on the changing station in Dr. Ketany\u2019s office bathroom on the morning of September 2, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\n<em>C. Jury Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Appellant was tried by a jury beginning on March 15, 2011. Among other witnesses, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Cheek, Stanley, and Young, describing the events of September 2, 2008, and the investigation into the child\u2019s death, as described above. Cheek specifically denied ever shaking or hurting the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">1. Medical Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Dr. Kees, an expert in pediatrics, testified at appellant\u2019s trial. He opined that M.B.\u2019s injuries were caused by rapid acceleration and deceleration of the head. Dr. Kees testified he performed a CT scan on M.B., which revealed blood around M.B.\u2019s brain and retinal hemorrhages that were too numerous to count, indicating a lethal amount of force, consistent with shaking, was applied to the child. Dr. Kees testified that M.B.\u2019s injuries would have produced immediate symptoms, such as a decreased level of responsiveness or change in mental status that would progressively worsen over time. He also noted other common symptoms included vomiting, sleepiness, irritability, abnormal crying, decreased feeding or no feeding at all, and lethargy.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Dr. Robin Foster testified as an expert in pediatrics. He agreed with Dr. Kees\u2019 conclusion that M.B. died from \u201cabusive head trauma.\u201d He explained that abusive head trauma can only result from violent shaking or throwing or the child being thrown from a car in an accident. He emphasized that the lack of bruising and other evidence of external injuries indicated that M.B.\u2019s injury was not caused by bumping her head. Dr. Foster opined that on his review of the medical records and history, M.B.\u2019s fatal injuries occurred on the same day she presented to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">During cross-examination of both expert witnesses, appellant attempted to ask whether each witness agreed or disagreed with scientific literature showing that the profile of a shaken baby perpetrator is predominantly male, the first person to call 911, and the last person who is with the victim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>The Commonwealth objected to the proposed line of questioning. The trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, stating that the testimony was outside the scope of the witness\u2019 domain and would invade the province of the jury to determine the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Dr. Paul Benson, the medical examiner who performed M.B.\u2019s autopsy, also provided testimony concerning the cause of M.B.\u2019s death. Benson opined that the injuries he observed while performing the autopsy were inconsistent with accidental injuries. In describing the severity of M.B.\u2019s injuries, Benson referenced two photographs taken during the autopsy, one showing M.B.\u2019s face and another showing the inside of the skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The trial court admitted the autopsy photographs into evidence over appellant\u2019s objection. Appellant objected to the introduction of the photographs, arguing they were more prejudicial than probative and that the cause of death was not in dispute. The Commonwealth responded that it was required to prove each element of the charged offense and could not \u201cstipulate away\u201d any element; therefore, the photographs were necessary to prove both that M.B. was the subject of the autopsy and that M.B. died from the internal injuries depicted in the photograph of her brain. The trial court overruled the objection, stating that the law allowed the Commonwealth to introduce autopsy photographs even when the cause of death had been stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">2. Evidence of Prior Bad Acts</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">At the beginning of trial, appellant made a motion <em>in limine </em>asking that any evidence of prior bad acts by appellant be excluded, referring specifically to a prior Child Protective Services complaint because of bruises on M.B. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">At trial, the Commonwealth introduced testimony from Davis, Brenda Lacey, the child\u2019s daycare provider, and Tomi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Turner, an employee for Child Protective Services, regarding previous injuries to M.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Davis testified that he and appellant alternated custody of M.B., but both he and appellant used the same babysitter, Lacey. Davis testified that Lacey called him approximately one month before M.B. died, asking him to come to her house to look at bruises on M.B.\u2019s face and arm after appellant had dropped M.B. off one morning. Davis called social services in response to the bruises and discussed the matter with appellant. Appellant informed Davis that the bruises on M.B.\u2019s arm were from a food allergy and the bruises on her face were from fingernail clippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Lacey also testified at trial, stating that on August 6, 2008, when appellant dropped off M.B. at daycare, she noticed bruises on M.B.\u2019s arm and cheek. When Lacey inquired about these marks, appellant told her they were the result of a food allergy. Appellant never mentioned that M.B. had injured her face with a pair of fingernail clippers. Turner also testified, indicating that appellant told her that the mark on M.B.\u2019s arm came from a Popsicle causing a hive and that the bruise to M.B.\u2019s face occurred when the child hurt herself with a pair of fingernail clippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Cheek also provided testimony concerning appellant\u2019s past treatment of M.B. He testified that on a prior occasion when he returned to the house he shared with appellant, appellant threw M.B. at him from a few yards away as he walked through the door. After throwing M.B., appellant said, \u201cI can\u2019t get her to stop crying, can you get her to stop crying?\u201d Cheek also testified that he recalled the bruise on M.B.\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">3. Motion to Strike</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, appellant moved to strike the evidence as insufficient, arguing that there was no direct evidence proving that appellant was the one who inflicted M.B.\u2019s fatal injuries or that she knew Cheek inflicted the injuries and did nothing to prevent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>abuse. After the Commonwealth\u2019s argument in response, the trial court denied the motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">At the conclusion of all of the evidence, appellant renewed her motion to strike. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">4. Verdict and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The jury acquitted appellant of murder but convicted her of felony child abuse and recommended a sentence of eight years along with a $75,000 fine. The trial court sentenced appellant in accordance with the jury\u2019s recommendation. Following sentencing, appellant moved to set aside the verdict, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction of felony child abuse because there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the individual who committed the offense, knew that another committed the offense before the fact, or failed to provide necessary care. The trial court denied the motion. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A) states that a parent who \u201cby willful act or omission or refusal to provide any necessary care for the child\u2019s health causes or permits serious injury to the life or health of [her] child shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.\u201d On appeal, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction for felony child abuse because the Commonwealth failed to prove that appellant committed the offense, knew that another committed the offense, or failed to provide necessary care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject appellant\u2019s argument and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>find based upon the applicable standard of review that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for felony child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">When reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the prevailing party below, granting to it all reasonable inferences drawn from that evidence. <em>See Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). This Court will not disturb a trial court\u2019s judgment \u201cunless it is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barlow v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 421, 429, 494 S.E.2d 901, 904 (1998) (quoting <em>Beavers v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 268, 282, 427 S.E.2d 411, 421 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to exclude a reasonable hypothesis of innocence that someone other than appellant was the criminal agent. Specifically, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that appellant, rather than Cheek, inflicted the injuries upon M.B. Appellant contends that in a case relying on circumstantial evidence, \u201c \u2018[a]ll necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence,\u2019 \u201d which is accomplished only when the chain of circumstances is unbroken. <em>Christian v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 1078, 1082, 277 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1981) (quoting <em>Webb v. Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 34, 129 S.E.2d 22, 29 (1963)). Citing <em>Christian, </em>appellant asserts that the chain of circumstances is broken where there is another person present who had the opportunity to commit the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Christian </em>is misplaced. In <em>Christian, </em>the defendant was convicted of felony child neglect after a daycare worker discovered injuries to the defendant\u2019s daughter. <em>Id. </em>However, unlike the present case, at least five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>people had an opportunity to handle the child during the period in which her injuries occurred, and the Commonwealth failed to present evidence that these individuals did not cause the injuries. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court overturned the defendant\u2019s conviction for felony child neglect because the evidence raised only the suspicion that the defendant injured her child during the night, since numerous individuals had contact with the child the next morning without discovering the child\u2019s painful fractures. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In the present case, the evidence at trial indicated that M.B. died from rapid acceleration and deceleration of her head, which was consistent with violent shaking or throwing and inconsistent with accidental head bumps. The evidence also established that M.B.\u2019s injuries occurred on the same day that she was rushed to the hospital, September 2, 2008. After initially lying about who was watching M.B. on September 2, 2008, appellant later admitted that she and Cheek were the only individuals caring for the child that day until Lynette Cheek, Joshua Cheek\u2019s mother, administered CPR just before emergency personnel arrived. Accordingly, appellant contends that the evidence shows merely that either appellant or Cheek (or both) fatally injured the child. Appellant also argues that the evidence suggests that Cheek inflicted the injuries upon M.B. because Cheek was alone with the child when both seizures occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Appellant is correct that, as in <em>Christian, </em>the evidence showed that both appellant and Cheek had the opportunity to inflict the injuries upon M.B., though both denied causing the injuries. However, unlike in <em>Christian, </em>the Commonwealth in the instant case presented evidence that Cheek did not cause the injuries through Cheek\u2019s specific testimony that he had never shaken or hurt M.B. \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 133, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995) (citing <em>Schneider v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 379, 382, 337 S.E.2d 735, 736-37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>(1985); <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 528, 532, 290 S.E.2d 865, 867 (1982)). Because credibility determinations are solely the province of the fact' finder, <em>Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989), the jury was entitled to accept Cheek\u2019s denial and, having done so, could reasonably infer that appellant fatally injured M.B. <em>See Collado v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 356, 365, 533 S.E.2d 625, 630 (2000) (finding evidence supporting conviction sufficient where child was \u201ccriminally assaulted during the period appellant had sole custody and control of the child\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The jury was particularly entitled to accept Cheek\u2019s testimony and reject appellant\u2019s explanations for M.B.\u2019s injuries here, as the Commonwealth introduced numerous examples where appellant lied to the police and doctors,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>appellant\u2019s admission that she perjured herself in front of the grand jury. <em>See Covil v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 692, 696, 604 S.E.2d 79, 82 (2004) (finding \u201c[a] false or evasive account is a circumstance ... the fact-finder may properly consider as evidence of guilty knowledge\u201d). Moreover, the jury was also free to credit or discredit appellant\u2019s explanation for asking Child Protective Services not to come to the house on the day M.B. was injured. And, in discrediting appellant\u2019s explanation, the jury was free to perceive the call as an attempt by appellant to conceal her guilt. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Emmett v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 364, 372, 569 S.E.2d 39, 45 (2002)) (\u201c[Hjaving rejected a defendant\u2019s attempted explanation as untrue, [a fact finder] may draw the reasonable inference that his explanation was made falsely in an effort to conceal his guilt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Appellant\u2019s argument that the evidence suggests that Cheek inflicted the injuries upon M.B. because Cheek was alone with the child when both seizures occurred is also unavailing. To the contrary, this circumstance further distinguishes the present case from <em>Christian. </em>Unlike <em>Christian, </em>where numerous individuals were in contact with the child before her painful fractures were noticed, Cheek testified that both episodes occurred shortly after appellant left M.B. with him and after appellant had custody of M.B. Accordingly, unlike <em>Christian, </em>this is not a case of mere opportunity used to prove guilt. Rather, we are presented with opportunity \u201creinforced by other incriminating circumstances\u201d to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Christian, </em>221 Va. at 1082, 277 S.E.2d at 208 (finding opportunity reinforced by other incriminating evidence may be sufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We cannot say this evidence was so deficient that only an unreasonable trier of fact could have concluded that appellant caused M.B.\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, we determine the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\n<em>B. Evidence of Prior Bad Acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Appellant next assigns error to the admission of evidence of prior bad acts at trial. The prior bad acts evidence consists of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>earlier Child Protective Services involvement in M.B.\u2019s care, prior suspicious injuries to M.B., such as bruises and marks on her body, and an incident where appellant tossed M.B. to Cheek.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant contends that these events are improper character evidence, and, even if they were proper, they were so remote and inflammatory that their probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. For the reasons identified below, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of prior bad acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u201cAs a general rule, evidence of other offenses is inadmissible to prove guilt of the crime for which the accused is on trial. Exceptions to this general rule, however, are as well established as the rule itself.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 72, 76, 278 S.E.2d 822, 824 (1981) (internal citations omitted). \u201cEvidence of other offenses is admitted if it shows the conduct and feeling of the accused toward his victim, if it establishes their prior relations, or if it tends to prove any relevant element of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Kirkpatrick v.

Further, the admission of such \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is prohibited when its only purpose is to show that the defendant has a propensity to commit crimes or a particular type of crime and, therefore, probably committed the offense for which he is being tried. <em>Kirkpatrick, </em>211 Va. at 272, 176 S.E.2d at 805.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Guill v.

Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 570, 576, 643 S.E.2d 497, 500 (2007) (citing <em>Blain v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 10, 16, 371 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The evidence shows M.B. suffered injuries to her face and arm while in appellant\u2019s and Cheek\u2019s custody. Both appellant and Cheek denied injuring M.B., though in doing so appellant provided inconsistent explanations for the child\u2019s injuries. The injuries were first discovered by Lacey, M.B.\u2019s babysitter, who immediately informed the child\u2019s father, Davis. Davis questioned appellant, who told him that the bruises were from a food allergy (arm) and fingernail clippers (face). Lacey also questioned appellant, who stated that the injuries were the result of a food allergy. Appellant never mentioned to Lacey that M.B. injured her face with fingernail clippers. In response to the injuries, Davis called social services. Child Protective Services interviewed appellant, and appellant stated that the mark on M.B.\u2019s arm came from a popsicle causing a hive and the bruise on M.B.\u2019s face occurred when the child hurt herself with a pair of fingernail clippers.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The evidence of the bruising and scratches and the resulting involvement of Child Protective Services in M.B.\u2019s care, considered together with appellant\u2019s inconsistent explanations as to how the injuries occurred, possessed significant probative value as it demonstrated appellant\u2019s prior relationship with and feelings toward M.B. <em>See Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 609, 614, 212 S.E.2d 268, 272 (1975) (finding evidence of prior violence admissible when \u201cmotive, intent or knowledge of the accused is involved\u201d); <em>Ortiz v.

Whether the jury believed appellant\u2019s explanation that M.B. injured herself was a determination solely in their discretion. <em>Myers v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 634, 635, 400 S.E.2d 803, 804 (1991) (citing <em>Barker v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 373, 337 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1985)). Similarly, the jury was free to find Cheek\u2019s testimony that he never hurt M.B. credible and, having done so, could reasonably infer that appellant caused M.B.\u2019s prior injuries. The record established that the child was in the custody of appellant and Cheek when the prior injuries occurred, though both denied ever injuring the child. The jury was entitled to consider and resolve this conflict in the evidence against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we find the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence of prior injuries or Child Protective Services involvement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>\n<em>C. Evidence on Profile of Abusive Head Trauma Perpetrators</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Under her third assignment of error, appellant asserts the trial court erred in precluding appellant from asking an expert witness on cross-examination whether he agreed or disagreed with specific scientific literature on the profile of abusive head trauma perpetrators. Appellant contends this was a critical, line of questioning that the trial court should have permitted, because appellant\u2019s defense was that Cheek had hurt M.B., and the scientific literature supported this theory. Specifically, appellant wanted to question Dr. Kees and Dr. Foster about the \u201coverwhelming\u201d scientific consensus that the profile of a shaken baby perpetrator is (1) a white male, (2) the person who first calls the emergency number 911, and (3) the person who is last with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In a criminal case, an expert may give an opinion based on his \u201c \u2018own knowledge of facts disclosed in his testimony or ... upon facts in evidence assumed in a hypothetical question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simpson v.

Without more than Dr. Kees\u2019 brief statement that he speaks in public about child abuse, the trial court had no basis upon which to conclude that Dr. Kees had expertise in the typical profile and activities of abusive head trauma perpetrators. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">\n<em>D. Admission of Autopsy Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Finally, under her fourth assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting graphic autopsy photos where the cause of death was not in dispute. We reject appellant\u2019s argument and hold that the trial court did not err in admitting the two autopsy photographs into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">In addressing appellant\u2019s assignment of error, we note that appellate courts will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, including autopsy photographs, unless the trial court abused its discretion in that decision. <em>See Teleguz v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 458, 482, 643 S.E.2d 708, 723 (2007). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">[ajccurate photographs of a crime scene are not rendered inadmissible solely because they are gruesome, and autopsy photographs of the victim are admissible to show the atrociousness or vileness of a crime. <em>Juniper [v.

A defendant\u2019s stipulation with regards to the cause of the victim\u2019s death does not allow the appellant to sanitize the evidence and thus preclude the Commonwealth from introducing photographs showing the dead victim, even if the pictures may be considered gruesome. <em>See Orbe v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 390, 402, 519 S.E.2d 808, 815 (1999) (citing <em>Chichester v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 311, 326, 448 S.E.2d 638, 648 (1994)) (allowing photographs because they were probative of motive, intent, malice, premeditation and the atrociousness of the crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Here, the admitted photographs possessed probative value beyond simply identifying the cause of the victim\u2019s death. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced the photographs through the medical examiner, who used the photos to demonstrate the hemorrhages to the victim\u2019s brain, too numerous to count, which supported the Commonwealth\u2019s inferences of malice and intent; proof of both requirements was necessary to support the charge of second-degree murder. Moreover, the photos were probative to demonstrate M.B.\u2019s injuries, which were mostly internal, to corroborate each expert\u2019s testimony about the cause of the M.B.\u2019s death, and to indicate appellant\u2019s method in killing the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">We find, therefore, the trial court did not err in admitting the two autopsy photographs into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">For these reasons, we find that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction for felony child neglect and that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence of appellant\u2019s prior bad acts, precluding appellant from asking Dr. Kees about scientific literature on the profile of abusive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>head trauma perpetrators, and admitting autopsy photos of M.B. Therefore, appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-10\">. . Appellant concedes on brief that \"[t]he evidence shows that [M.B.] was intentionally killed and that the mortal injuries would certainly constitute child abuse,\u201d Appellant's Br. at 9, and questions only whether sufficient evidence was presented to find appellant caused M.B.'s injuries. Accordingly, we find the \"willful act resulting in serious injury\u201d element of the statute satisfied and focus our review on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>the evidence was sufficient to find that appellant, as opposed to someone else, committed the offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-5\">. Appellant contends the Commonwealth improperly relied on appellant's false explanations of the circumstances surrounding the child's death. Appellant asserts that the Commonwealth failed to prove \u201cby the facts or the circumstances, or both, that beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime charged against [her].\" <em>Hyde v. Commonwealth, 217 </em>Va. 950, 955, 234 S.E.2d 74, 78 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Hyde </em>is misplaced. In <em>Hyde, </em>a rape victim in a mental hospital claimed that a tall, white man who had offered her a cigarette had taken her into the woods and raped her. <em>Id. </em>at 951, 234 S.E.2d at 76. The victim later died from a ruptured intestine she sustained during the ordeal. <em>Id. </em>The evidence in <em>Hyde </em>demonstrated that two other men, in addition to Hyde, were present with the victim shortly before the rape occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 951, 234 S.E.2d at 76. One of the two men later confessed to having sex with the victim and repeatedly hitting her in the stomach on the day she died. <em>Id. </em>at 953, 234 S.E.2d at 77. On this basis, the Court held appellant\u2019s false statements, alone, were insufficient to support his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 954, 234 S.E.2d at 77 (stating that \u201cto assume that [the defendant] was the only tall, white man who had given [the victim] a cigarette that day would be to assume too much\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The present case is distinguishable. Here, the evidence at trial demonstrated that M.B.'s injuries occurred on the day she was rushed to the hospital. On that day, appellant and Cheek had exclusive custody of the child. Witnesses also testified that appellant seemed rushed and angry the morning M.B. was injured. Cheek testified during trial that he never injured M.B. Finding Cheek\u2019s testimony credible, the jury was free to reasonably infer that appellant caused M.B.\u2019s injuries. In this light, appellant\u2019s false explanations provided the jury an additional reason to find appellant\u2019s explanations for M.B.'s injuries less credible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b525-7\">. Appellant conceded during oral argument that evidence that appellant once threw M.B. to Cheek because M.B. would not stop crying was appropriately admitted under an exception to the rule generally prohibiting the admission of prior bad acts. Because appellant has conceded the admissibility of this evidence, we do not consider whether the trial court erred in admitting it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">. Even if the trial court erred in admitting the evidence of prior bad acts, such error was harmless. An error is harmless \"[i]f, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>jury, or had but slight effect____\" <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 260, 546 S.E.2d 728, 731-32 (2001) (citing <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764-65, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). Here, the evidence of prior bad acts would have had but a slight effect on the jury. The evidence clearly established that M.B. was injured while in the custody of appellant and Cheek. The evidence also demonstrated that appellant lied to investigators and to doctors about the events on the day M.B. was injured. And, irrespective of the actions that led to Child Protective Services involvement, appellant contacted Turner on the day M.B. was injured and encouraged her not to visit the house. In light of these facts, evidence of prior injuries had slight effect on the conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b529-8\">. In finding the trial court did not abuse its discretion by precluding appellant\u2019s evidence, we note that numerous jurisdictions have held that profile evidence is categorically inadmissible, though the underlying rationales differ widely. Some courts have excluded profile evidence on relevancy grounds. <em>See Commonwealth v. Day, </em>409 Mass. 719, 569 N.E.2d 397, 399 (1991) (finding profile evidence \"does not meet the relevancy test, because the mere fact that a defendant fits the profile does not tend to prove that a particular defendant physically abused the victim\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>370 So.2d 547, 554 (La. 1979)); <em>Duley v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 275, 467 A.2d 776, 780 (1983) (finding child battering profile \u201ctotally irrelevant because it does not tend to prove that [the defendant] committed the acts of abuse attributed to him\u201d); <em>State v.

Other courts have considered profile evidence impermissible character evidence. <em>See Gruwell v. State, </em>254 P.3d 223 (Wyo.2011) (finding profile evidence constitutes inadmissible character evidence). Still others have noted that such evidence invades the province of the jury, <em>see State v. Jaco, </em>156 S.W.3d 775, 780 (Mo.2005) (finding the proposed profile evidence invaded the jury province by expressing an opinion on the guilt or innocence of the defendant), and that such evidence is highly prejudicial, <em>see Brunson v. State, </em>349 Ark. 300, 79 S.W.3d 304 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
