Because the evidence is sufficient to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>port Jordan\u2019s conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we re-view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). So viewed, the evidence establishes that on the evening of June 28, 2009, thirteen-year-old Matthew Arrowood drove his father to a 7-Eleven and parked in front of the store. His father exited the vehicle and entered the store, at which time Jordan approached the driver\u2019s side window of the truck and began asking Arrowood questions. When Arrowood refused to respond, Jordan pointed an object appearing to be a firearm at Arrowood\u2019s temple, ordered Arrowood out of the truck, entered the vehicle, and drove away. Arrowood gave the police a description of Jordan and identified him as the assailant when the police arrested him. When the police apprehended Jordan, they did not recover a firearm or any object resembling a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">At Jordan\u2019s trial, Arrowood testified that the incident lasted between thirty to sixty seconds, Jordan was six inches to a foot away, and Arrowood had five seconds to look at the gun through the mirror as Jordan approached. Arrowood testified as follows on direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">[Arrowood:] [Jordan] pointed a gun at me and told me to get out of the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">[Commonwealth:] Could you describe the gun that he pointed at you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-11\">[Arrowood:] Like a small pistol. It was silver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Arrowood also testified on direct and redirect examination that he was familiar with guns and had fired handguns before and that the instrument Jordan pointed at his head looked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>him like a \u201csemi-automatic pistol,\u201d possibly a \u201cRaven.\u201d After Jordan pointed the gun at Arrowood\u2019s head, he said, \u201cGet out of the truck.\u201d Arrowood acknowledged that he exited the truck and fled because Jordan was pointing a \u201cRaven semiautomatic\u201d pistol at him. When asked by the Commonwealth on redirect examination whether the instrument \u201clook[ed] like a toy gun,\u201d Arrowood responded, \u201cA really detailed toy gun if it was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The Commonwealth entered into evidence without objection a certified copy of a prior felony conviction for Jordan. Jordan moved to strike the evidence on the firearm charge, which motion the trial court denied. At the conclusion of all the evidence, the jury found Jordan guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">\u201cWhen considering a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction, [an appellate court] reviews \u2018the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial and consider^] all inferences fairly deducible from that evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 636, 640, 691 S.E.2d 786, 788 (2010) (quoting <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 121, 124, 661 S.E.2d 412, 414 (2008)). Where there is a conflict in the evidence, this standard of review requires us to resolve that conflict in favor of the Commonwealth, <em>Rodgers v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 605, 614, 318 S.E.2d 298, 303 (1984), and we \u201cwill not set aside the factual findings of the trial court unless those findings are \u2018plainly wrong or without supporting evidence,\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 194, 197, 662 S.E.2d 627, 628-29 (2008) (quoting <em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 549, 554, 567 S.E.2d 547, 549 (2002)). Further, the jury, \u201cwho has the opportunity to see and hear the witnesses, has the sole responsibility to determine their credibility, the weight to be given their testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>proven facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Taylor, </em>256 Va. 514, 518, 506 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A) prohibits a convicted felon from \u201cknowingly and intentionally possessing] or transporting] any firearm or ammunition for a firearm.\u201d For the purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, a firearm must be \u201can instrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 584, 562 S.E.2d 139, 145 (2002). \u201cIt is not necessary that the Commonwealth prove the instrument was \u2018operable,\u2019 \u2018capable\u2019 of being fired, or had the \u2018actual capacity to do serious harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the fact found by the jury is that what Jordan pointed at Arrowood was a firearm as defined by <em>Armstrong </em>and this fact is supported by evidence in the record. The jury was properly instructed on the law and obviously credited Arrowood\u2019s testimony that supports the fact that what Jordan possessed and used in a carjacking was a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Furthermore, Arrowood\u2019s testimony that he was familiar with firearms and recognized the object Jordan possessed as such is not the only evidence that what Jordan displayed was a firearm designed to expel a projectile. This Court reviews \u201cthe totality of the evidence to determine whether it was sufficient to prove an offense.\u201d <em>Bowling v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 102, 107, 654 S.E.2d 354, 356 (2007). Arrowood\u2019s testimony describing the gun in some detail was corroborated by, and must be coupled with, Jordan\u2019s actions in pointing it at Arrowood\u2019s head while concurrently demanding that he get out of the truck. The jury could have fairly drawn an entirely reasonable inference from this evidence that the object Jordan held that appeared to be a firearm functioned as such. <em>See Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 672, 676, 701 S.E.2d 61, 63-64 (2010) (An appellate court\u2019s deference to the fact-finder \u201capplies not only to findings of fact, but also to any reasonable and justified inferences the fact-finder may have drawn from the facts proved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>In <em>Redd v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 256, 259, 511 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1999), the defendant\u2019s implied assertion that the object functioned as a weapon corroborated the victim\u2019s description that the object was a gun and this evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. In <em>Redd, </em>the appellant entered a convenience store, placed a \u201clong black gun\u201d on the counter, and ordered the clerk to give her all the money from the register. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 511 S.E.2d at 437. Redd added that she would kill the clerk if she set off the alarm and told her not to call the police. <em>Id. </em>The clerk\u2019s only testimony about the instrument displayed was, \u201c T just know it was a long black gun. I am not familiar with guns.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no substantial difference between the evidence found sufficient in <em>Redd </em>and that reflected in this record. While <em>Redd </em>involved the appellant\u2019s express statement that she would kill the victim if she set off the alarm, <em>id., Redd </em>does not stand for the proposition that evidence that an object is an operable firearm cannot be established by the totality of the evidence, including circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The issue before us is whether what Jordan, concededly a convicted felon, \u201cpossessed\u201d was, in fact, a firearm designed to operate as such, and the manner of \u201cdisplay\u201d in this case is highly probative on that point. Jordan did not casually wave the instrument around in the air without purpose, but rather pointed it directly at Arrowood\u2019s head and concurrently demanded that he part with possession of the vehicle. Even without actually saying the words, \u201cor I will shoot you,\u201d a reasonable fact-finder could have certainly concluded that Jordan\u2019s words and actions implied as much and that what he pointed at Arrowood was a firearm and not a replica or a toy as suggested by the dissent. The totality of the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the party that prevailed below is that what Arrowood recognized as a \u201csmall,\u201d \u201csilver,\u201d \u201csemi-automatic pistol,\u201d \u201cpossibly a Raven\u201d was pointed at his temple and when coupled with Jordan\u2019s words and actions supported Arrowood\u2019s conclusion that a gun and not a toy was pointed at his head. These facts provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. We hold that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the object Jordan displayed was intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion, and we affirm the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b722-15\">.

Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 584, 562 S.E.2d 139, 145 (2002). Because I believe this ruling effectively nullifies the distinction the Supreme Court has drawn between the definition of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 (which prohibits the use or display of a firearm in the commission of certain specific felonies) and the definition of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 (which prohibits convicted felons from \u201cknowingly and intentionally possessing] or transporting] any firearm or ammunition for a firearm\u201d), I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">\u201c[I]n order to sustain a conviction for possessing a firearm in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the evidence need show only that a person subject to the provisions of that statute possessed an instrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. This differs from the definition of a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 ... is to deter violent criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Holloman v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 196, 198, 269 S.E.2d 356, 358 (1980). That Code section \u201cnot only is aimed at preventing actual physical injury or death but also is designed to discourage criminal conduct that produces <em>fear </em>of physical harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). A victim can be put in fear of physical harm \u201cjust as readily from employment of an instrument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>gives the appearance of having a firing capability as from use of a weapon that actually has the capacity to shoot a projectile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.1 includes \u201can instrument which [gives] the <em>appearance </em>of having a firing capability, whether or not the object actually ha[s] the capacity to propel a bullet by the force of gunpowder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 269 S.E.2d at 858 (emphasis added); <em>see Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 681, 687, 492 S.E.2d 460, 463 (1997) (holding that the BB pistol used by the defendant to commit a robbery was a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 because the evidence supported the conclusion that it was an instrument that gave the appearance of having a firing capability and not merely a \u201ctoy pistol\u201d). \u201cCode \u00a7 18.2-53.1 encompasses a broader definition\u201d of a firearm to \u201cinclude[ ] any instrument that \u2018gives the appearance of being a firearm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Startin v. Commonwealth, </em>281 Va. 374, 382, 706 S.E.2d 873, 878 (2011) (quoting <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 582, 562 S.E.2d at 144).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">By contrast, \u201c[t]he definition is more narrowly construed under the possession statute, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381, 706 S.E.2d at 878. A firearm for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 must be \u201can instrument which was designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. Indeed, \u201cthe conduct proscribed by Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, being a felon in possession of a firearm, focuses on the General Assembly\u2019s determination that certain individuals\u2014felons\u2014are unfit to possess firearms, even for lawful purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 562 S.E.2d at 144. \u201c[T]he legislative intent underlying Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 is not directed toward proscribing \u2018criminal conduct that produces fear of physical harm\u2019 to an individual victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582-83, 562 S.E.2d at 144 (quoting <em>Holloman, </em>221 Va. at 198, 269 S.E.2d at 358).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">With these principles in mind, I believe the majority places too much emphasis on Arrowood\u2019s testimony describing the instrument Jordan used while ordering him out of the vehicle. Although Arrowood was able to identify the model of the \u201cfirearm\u201d and gave a detailed description of the instrument, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>other account of this object exists in the record. Therefore, the record contains, at most, evidence that the object used during the commission of the crimes <em>appeared </em>to have firing capability. As the Supreme Court has made very clear, Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 \u201chas no element of perception by a victim that would warrant applying the same broad construction to the term \u2018firearm\u2019 in that statute as is applicable to the same term in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 583, 562 S.E.2d at 144. By focusing on Arrowood\u2019s detailed observation of the instrument, the majority ignores the reasonable hypothesis that Jordan used a replica that lacked the capability to expel a projectile.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In addition, the majority looks to Jordan\u2019s \u201cmanner of \u2018display\u2019 \u201d of the object as \u201chighly probative\u201d evidence that the instrument in Jordan\u2019s possession had the capability to expel a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>projectile by means of an explosion. I concur that in some circumstances, the record can sufficiently support a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 if additional circumstantial evidence corroborates an eyewitness description of an instrument as an object appearing to be designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion. <em>See Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 735, 737, 536 S.E.2d 922, 922-23 (2000) (relying on circumstantial evidence to \u201cprove whether a particular firearm functions\u201d in the context of possession of a firearm while in possession of certain contraband in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.4). Such circumstantial evidence may include \u201cthe trial court\u2019s examination of the gun, ammunition magazine, and bullets at trial,\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>277 Va. 171, 182, 670 S.E.2d 727, 734 (2009); the observations of the officers who seized the firearm and determined that it was loaded, <em>see id. </em>at 175, 670 S.E.2d at 729; and the defendant\u2019s \u201cimplied assertion that the object was a functioning weapon,\u201d <em>Redd v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 256, 259, 511 S.E.2d 436, 438 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">In <em>Redd, </em>the defendant, a previously convicted felon, entered a convenience store and placed a \u201clong, black gun\u201d on the counter. 29 Va.App. at 258, 511 S.E.2d at 437. She ordered the store clerk to give her all the money from the register and warned the clerk that she \u201cwould kill her if she set off the silent alarm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that the testimony of a victim that a convicted felon brandished a firearm is insufficient, standing alone, to support a conviction for violating Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. However, we also held that the defendant\u2019s threat to kill the clerk constituted an implied assertion that the object was a functioning weapon in the absence of evidence to the contrary. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 511 S.E.2d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Similarly in <em>Taylor, </em>the defendant was conversing with an undercover police officer while conducting a drug transaction. During the transaction, the defendant told the officer about a state trooper having stopped him when he was \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201chad a couple of thousands [sic] of dollars ... [and] a 38 in his pocket.\u201d <em>Taylor, 33 </em>Va.App. at 737, 536 S.E.2d at 922. As the defendant mentioned the .38, he raised his shirt, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>undercover officer saw the \u201csilver part of what appeared to be a firearm\u201d tucked in his waistband. <em>Id. </em>We held that \u201c[g]iven the context of the events, a reasonable person could infer the gun was real\u201d because \u201c[i]t would be unreasonable to conclude in this situation the defendant talked about, carried, and displayed something that looked like a gun but could not function as one.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 738-39, 536 S.E.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The majority extends <em>Redd </em>and <em>Taylor </em>to hold that the act of displaying an apparent firearm constitutes an \u201cimplied assertion\u201d sufficient to prove that the object was \u201can instrument ... designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. What the majority fails to consider is that pointing an object at a victim in a threatening manner may be intended solely to instill fear in a victim just as much as it is an expression of the object\u2019s operability as a firearm. Unlike the defendant in <em>Redd, </em>Jordan made no direct threat to harm or kill Arrowood if he failed to comply with Jordan\u2019s demand to get out of the vehicle.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And unlike the defendant in <em>Taylor, </em>Jordan did not make additional statements or engage in additional actions implying that his apparent firearm functioned as one. I believe the majority makes the logical progression that pointing an object directly at a victim\u2019s head has the same effect as saying the words, \u201cor I will shoot you,\u201d but it is a step too far. The evidence does not exclude the reasonable hypothesis of innocence that Jordan merely brandished an object <em>appearing </em>to be a functioning weapon. It is axiomatic that when the Commonwealth relies on circumstan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>tial evidence, \u201call necessary circumstances proved must be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence and exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>Cordon v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 691, 694, 701 S.E.2d 803, 805 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The majority\u2019s holding that the testimony in this case is sufficient to prove the object in Jordan\u2019s possession during the carjacking was designed to expel a projectile for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 effectively nullifies the distinction the Supreme Court has drawn between the definition of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 and the definition of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. Evidence that demonstrates merely that an object appeared to observers to be an operable firearm shows nothing more than that the object meets the broad definition of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Consequently, I believe the evidence fails to show that the object meets the narrower definition of a firearm under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b729-6\">. In <em>Startin, </em>the defendant displayed a \"replica [that] ha[d] the same size, weight and shape of an operational firearm designed to expel .45 caliber ammunition by explosion\" during the commission of a robbery. 281 Va. at 377, 706 S.E.2d at 876. Although the replica was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the Supreme Court noted that \"the replica at issue here ... would be [insufficient to convict a person under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2 for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon because [it was] not 'designed, made, and intended to fire or expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 382, 706 S.E.2d at 878 (quoting <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 583, 562 S.E.2d at 145).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">Similarly in <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 529, 664 S.E.2d 528 (2008), the defendant was convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2(A). However, a certificate of analysis was issued after the defendant\u2019s conviction became final that proved beyond a doubt that the instrument did not meet the definition of a \"firearm\u201d under that subsection because it was not designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion. <em>Id. </em>at 531, 664 S.E.2d at 529. We therefore granted the defendant\u2019s petition for writ of actual innocence and vacated his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">The common thread between these two cases underscores my qualm with the majority\u2019s holding. No matter how certain the outward description of the instrument, the Commonwealth must still provide additional evidence that supports a finding that the instrument was in fact designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion. The fact that an object appearing to be a firearm is brandished to effectuate a robbery does not exclude the reasonable hypothesis that the object was not designed and made as an operable firearm. <em>Accord </em>Lynn Considine Cobb, Annotation, <em>Robbery by Means of Toy or Simulated Gun or Pistol, </em>81 A.L.R.3d 1006 (2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">. The link between drug transactions and firearms is well recognized. <em>See, e.g., Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 654 S.E.2d 584 (2008); <em>McCain v.

I recognize that the Supreme Court in <em>Armstrong </em>did not overrule our decision in <em>Redd., </em>and, thus, that <em>Redd </em>remains binding precedent. However, when viewed in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the differing policy objectives of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-53.1 and 18.2-308.2, I believe <em>Redd </em>defines the outer limit of what kind of circumstantial evidence is sufficient to support a finding that the object used was a \"firearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
