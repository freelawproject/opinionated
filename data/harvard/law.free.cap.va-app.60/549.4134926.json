Person (defendant) appeals his conviction for use of a sawed-off shotgun in the commission of a crime of violence in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300. In this appeal, defendant contends that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the weapon used met the statutory definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-299. Finding no error, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\u201cWhen examining a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at trial and consider any reasonable inferences from the facts proved.\u201d <em>Viney v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 296, 299, 609 S.E.2d 26, 28 (2005) (citing <em>Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 384, 386, 585 S.E.2d 538, 539 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">So viewed, the evidence indicated that defendant, Deon Walker, Raymond Moore, and Bobby Hill decided to rob the players at a poker game taking place at a residence in Surry County on May 22, 2010. When the men arrived at the residence, Walker, Hill, and defendant left Moore in the car parked \u201cdown a little path\u201d nearby the residence. According to Hill, defendant was carrying a \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Sometime between midnight and 1:00 a.m., Hill entered the residence and joined Nancy Overton, Daneen Overton, and Rantavis Evans to play cards. Defendant and Walker entered the house forty-five minutes later, clad in masks and carrying guns. During the course of the robbery, Evans shot and killed Walker. Defendant left the residence and returned to the car, where he told Moore to \u201cdrive.\u201d Moore saw defendant with a \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d and observed defendant bury the gun in the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Later that morning, Officer William Thomas of the Surry County Sheriffs Department interviewed Moore regarding the robbery. Moore initially told Officer Thomas that defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>had disposed of the gun at a stop sign after the men left the residence. However, after Officer Thomas checked stop signs near the residence and did not find the gun, Moore told Officer Thomas that the gun was at \u201cthe old L.P. Jackson school site,\u201d approximately 125 yards from the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Using a tracking dog, Officer Thomas found the gun at the school, buried under a pile of sand and rocks. The gun was wrapped in a piece of camouflage cloth from a jacket with Walker\u2019s name tag. At trial, Officer Thomas described the gun he recovered wrapped in the cloth with Walker\u2019s name tag on it as a \u201csawed-off shotgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Defendant was indicted for burglary in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-89, robbery in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58, wearing a mask to conceal his identity in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-422, use of a sawed-off shotgun while committing armed robbery after having been previously convicted of a similar violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, and use of a sawed-off shotgun in the commission of a crime of violence in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Moore, Nancy Overton, Officer Thomas, and Hill. The Commonwealth also introduced a picture<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the gun recovered by Officer Thomas as well as the gun itself into evidence. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, defendant moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to strike, arguing that the Commonwealth had failed to prove that the gun in question met the definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-299. The trial court denied the motion, stating that it \u201cpersonally observed the shotgun\u201d and identified it as a \u201cRemington 1100 sawed-off shotgun,\u201d although the trial court noted that it \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell the gauge because the barrel was missing.\u201d Defendant presented no evidence, rested his case, and renewed his motion to strike. The trial court again denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Defendant then filed a written motion to strike, raising the same argument. Following consideration of jury instructions, the trial court considered defendant\u2019s motion and once again denied it. The trial court stated that the weapon was introduced into evidence and seen by the jury and that the jury could \u201cmake a determination whether or not it was a sawed[-]off shotgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The trial court then instructed the jury regarding the statutory definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun.\u201d The instruction stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">A \u201csawed-off\u2019 shotgun is any weapon, loaded or unloaded, originally designated as a shoulder weapon, utilizing a self-contained cartridge from which a number of ball shot pellets or projectiles may be fired simultaneously from a smooth or rifle bore by a single function of the firing device and which has a barrel length of less than eighteen (18) inches for smooth bore weapons and sixteen (16) inches for rifled weapons. A weapon of less than .225 caliber is not a sawed-off shotgun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">After deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of burglary, robbery, wearing a mask to conceal his identity, and use of a sawed-off shotgun in the commission of a crime of violence. The trial court sentenced defendant to a total of 46 years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On appeal, defendant alleges the evidence was insufficient to prove the gun introduced into evidence met the statutory definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d in Code \u00a7 18.2-299.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-300(A) provides: \u201cPossession or use of a \u2018sawed-off shotgun or \u2018sawed-off rifle in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of a crime of violence is a Class 2 felony.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-299 defines \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMQ\">any weapon, loaded or unloaded, originally designed as a shoulder weapon, utilizing a self-contained cartridge from which a number of ball shot pellets or projectiles may be fired simultaneously from a smooth or rifled bore by a single function of the firing device and which has a barrel length of less than 18 inches for smooth bore weapons and 16 inches for rifled weapons. Weapons of less than .225 caliber shall not be included.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\u201cWhether [a] weapon met the statutory definition [of a sawed-off shotgun] was a factual issue for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 301, 387 S.E.2d 279, 280 (1990). Accordingly, this determination \u201cshall not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that such judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Reference to the case of <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 260, 391 S.E.2d 592 (1990), is helpful to the resolution of the issue presented in this appeal. In <em>Taylor, </em>the defendant was convicted in a bench trial of possession of a sawed-off shotgun in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-300(B). <em>Id. </em>at 262, 391 S.E.2d at 593. On appeal, Taylor argued that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the weapon was a sawed-off shotgun within the statutory definition. <em>Id. </em>This Court affirmed, holding that the evidence was sufficient. We noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>[T]he gun was admitted into evidence as Commonwealth\u2019s exhibit number one. The trial court, as the trier of fact, stated that \u201cthe gun speaks for itself,\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s a .20 gauge shotgun and a shotgun shoots shells. It\u2019s been cut here, the barrel has been cut off, it\u2019s less than the prescribed length.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 269, 391 S.E.2d at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As the Supreme Court of Virginia and this Court have repeatedly stated, \u201c \u2018[a] jury is presumed to have followed the instructions of the trial court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Prieto v. Commonwealth, </em>283 Va. 149, 169, 721 S.E.2d 484, 496 (2012) (quoting <em>Muhammad v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 451, 524, 619 S.E.2d 16, 58 (2005)); <em>see also Hsiu Tsai v. Commonwealth, </em>51 Va.App. 649, 653, 659 S.E.2d 594, 595 (2008). Moreover, \u201c[jurors] may make use of their reason and common sense, and the knowledge and experience gained by them in everyday life.\u201d Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 19-20 (6th ed.2003) (citing <em>Troutner v. Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 750, 755, 115 S.E. 693, 694 (1923); <em>Thurpin v. Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 709, 715, 137 S.E. 528, 530 (1927) (allowing jurors to employ their sense of smell in a case involving whiskey)).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The gun in this case was admitted into evidence. The trial court properly instructed the jury on the definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d under the statute. The statutory definition of \u201csawed-off shotgun\u201d cited in the instruction required the jury to determine both the barrel length of a weapon and that the weapon was .225 caliber or greater,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> among other specifications. Using their reason, common sense, knowledge, and experience, the jury could determine from examining the gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>whether it met the statutory definition, and, in finding defendant guilty, the jury necessarily determined that it did. Because the gun was admitted into evidence, it was not an evidentiary prerequisite for the Commonwealth to present testimony regarding the gun\u2019s characteristics in order for the jury to reach this conclusion. Moreover, the jury\u2019s determination was not plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">. The picture of the gun admitted into evidence at trial is reproduced here for illustrative purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">[[Image here]]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-9\">. Defendant's petition for appeal was granted in part and denied in part by a judge of this Court. The sufficiency of the evidence in support of defendant's conviction for use of a sawed-off shotgun in the commission of a crime of violence is the only assignment of error before us in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>appeal. Assignments of error regarding a witness\u2019 identification of defendant, the Commonwealth's alleged failure to disclose a confession or admission made by defendant, and a double jeopardy claim were previously denied by a per curiam decision of this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">. \" 'Caliber' is defined as 'the diameter of a bore of a gun usually expressed in modem U.S. and British usage in hundredths or thousandths of an inch and typically written as a decimal fraction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dillard v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 340, 347 n. 1, 504 S.E.2d 411, 414 n. 1 (1998) (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary </em>157 (1977)). Thus, the diameter of the bore of a gun with a .225 caliber is .225 inches. Notably, the jury in the instant case was not required to determine the exact caliber of the gun at issue, but only that it was .225 caliber <em>or greater.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
