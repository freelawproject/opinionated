Washington appeals, claiming the trial court erred by denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence collected following a warrantless entry into his home. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">When reviewing a denial of a suppression motion, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, giving it the benefit of any reasonable inferences.\u201d <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>49 Va.App. 413, 416, 642 S.E.2d 282, 283 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>275 Va. 123, 654 S.E.2d 910 (2008). This standard requires us to \u201cgive due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Malbrough v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 163, 169, 655 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2008) (citations omitted). \u201cIn doing so, we \u2018consider facts presented both at the suppression hearing and at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tizon v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 1, 15, 723 S.E.2d 260, 267 (2012) (quoting <em>Morris v. City of Va. Beach, </em>58 Va.App. 173, 176, 707 S.E.2d 479, 480 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">On January 8, 2011, Jerome and Cheryl Henderson called the Mecklenburg County Sheriffs Office around 11:45 a.m., believing someone had just broken into their home. They waited for the deputies to arrive before entering their residence. It had snowed earlier that morning, but not in the preceding days. Deputy Tim Garner arrived at the Hendersons\u2019 home at 12:03 p.m. He observed that a window had been broken out of one of the Hendersons\u2019 vehicles. He also discovered someone had broken a window leading into the kitchen. The Hendersons reported various things had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>stolen from inside their home, including food, liquor, a tool box, and other household items.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Deputy Garner observed a single set of footprints in the snow, leading from the damaged vehicle to the Hendersons\u2019 home. The footprints had a distinct checkered pattern. Given the sharpness of the footprints and the recent snowfall, Deputy Garner concluded the footprints were fresh and believed the suspect had recently left the scene of the crime. He and another deputy followed the checkered-patterned footprints across the street directly to the front door of a residential trailer. The trail of footprints provided a continuous, uninterrupted path from the Hendersons\u2019 residence to the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">When one of the deputies knocked on the trailer\u2019s front door, it immediately swung open. Fearing the suspect was in the process of burglarizing the trailer, the deputies announced their presence and ordered anyone in the trailer to come out. There was no reply. The deputies then entered the trailer to perform a protective sweep. \u201cWe were just clearing it to see if anybody was there,\u201d the deputies later testified. App. at 37. While doing so, they saw the toolbox that had been taken from the Hendersons\u2019 home. They also looked under a bed where a suspect might be hiding. While attempting to \u201cclear under the bed,\u201d one of the deputies \u201cknocked a pair of shoes out of the way\u201d to get a better look and noticed the shoes had the same checkered pattern as the footprints previously observed in the snow. <em>Id. </em>at 38. After determining no one was in the trailer, the deputies left the trailer, taking no evidence with them, and secured a search warrant from a magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Pursuant to the warrant, the deputies reentered the trailer that afternoon and discovered nearly all of the items stolen from the Hendersons\u2019 home, including stolen food items (still frozen) in a non-working freezer. After the search, Garner encountered Washington walking up the driveway of the trailer. Washington acknowledged that he lived alone at the residence and asked the deputy what was going on. Deputy Garner told him \u201csomething had occurred in the area, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>neighborhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 148. In response, Washington volunteered that he \u201chadn\u2019t done anything. He hadn\u2019t broken into anybody\u2019s house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">After Washington\u2019s arrest, a grand jury indicted him for burglary with intent to commit larceny, grand larceny, and destruction of property. Prior to trial, Washington moved to suppress the incriminating evidence found in his trailer. The trial court denied the motion, heard the evidence, and found Washington guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">On appeal, Washington claims the trial court erred by denying his suppression motion. He acknowledges the deputies collected the incriminating evidence pursuant to a search warrant, but contends they obtained the warrant based on observations they made during the initial warrantless entry. This initial entry, Washington argues, violated the Fourth Amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">A. THE SUPPRESSION STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Though the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>appellate scrutiny, \u201cwe defer to the trial court\u2019s findings of \u2018historical fact\u2019 and give \u2018due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glenn, </em>49 Va.App. at 418, 642 S.E.2d at 284 (citations omitted). \u201cTo prevail on appeal, \u2018the defendant must show that the trial court\u2019s denial of his suppression motion, when the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution, was reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slayton v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 101, 105, 582 S.E.2d 448, 450 (2003) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Faced with a suppression motion, neither a trial court nor an appellate court should \u201climit itself to what the \u2018officer says or to evidence of his subjective rationale\u2019 \u201d in assessing the legality of his actions. <em>Morris, </em>58 Va.App. at 179, 707 S.E.2d at 481 (quoting <em>Raab v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 577, 583 n. 2, 652 S.E.2d 144, 148 n. 2 (2007) <em>(en </em>banc)). If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>the police officer\u2019s actions are objectively reasonable, the Fourth Amendment authorizes the action, <em>\u201cwhatever </em>the subjective intent\u201d motivating the officer. <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2080, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Examining the subjective intent of the officer \u201cis fundamentally inconsistent with our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence,\u201d <em>Kentucky v. King, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1849, 1859, 179 L.Ed.2d 865 (2011), because \u201cthe Fourth Amendment regulates conduct rather than thoughts,\u201d <em>al-Kidd, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2080-81 (noting narrow exceptions); <em>see also Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>273 Va. 26, 37, 639 S.E.2d 217, 223 (2007) (holding the officer\u2019s \u201csubjective motivation is irrelevant\u201d). \u201cStated another way, we do not consider allegations of the officer\u2019s real motive for his actions if they otherwise satisfy the objective reasonableness standard adopted by the Fourth Amendment. An officer\u2019s ulterior motive, whatever it might be, does not nullify an objectively valid legal justification for his actions.\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 267, 274, 701 S.E.2d 87, 91 (2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Overarching this standard is our recognition that the suppression remedy imposes \u201csubstantial social costs\u201d that sometimes include \u201csetting the guilty free and the dangerous at large.\u201d <em>Echavarry v. Commonwealth, </em>60 Va.App. 177, 184, 725 S.E.2d 151, 155 (2012) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Michigan, </em>547 U.S. 586, 591, 126 S.Ct. 2159, 2163, 165 L.Ed.2d 56 (2006)). Thus, suppression of evidence should be \u201cour last resort, not our first impulse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hudson, </em>547 U.S. at 591, 126 S.Ct. at 2163). Standing alone, the \u201cfact that a Fourth Amendment violation <em>occurred\u2014ie., </em>that a search or arrest was unreasonable\u2014does not necessarily mean that the exclusionary rule applies.\u201d <em>Herring v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 135, 140, 129 S.Ct. 695, 700, 172 L.Ed.2d 496 (2009). Though the Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, it \u201csays nothing about suppressing evidence obtained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>violation of this command.\u201d <em>Davis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 2419, 2426, 180 L.Ed.2d 285 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Because \u201cthe exclusionary rule is not an individual right,\u201d prior precedent has \u201crepeatedly rejected the argument that exclusion is a necessary consequence of a Fourth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Herring, </em>555 U.S. at 141, 129 S.Ct. at 700. \u201cTo trigger the exclusionary rule,\u201d therefore, the challenged \u201cpolice conduct must be sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144, 129 S.Ct. at 702. The criminal defendant must shoulder the burden of demonstrating this justification for suppressing evidence and, in doing so, he \u201cfaces \u2018a high obstacle\u2019 in demonstrating that exclusion is appropriate.\u201d <em>Fitchett v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 741, 746, 697 S.E.2d 28, 31 (2010) (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>547 U.S. at 591, 126 S.Ct. at 2163).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">B. WARRANTLESS ENTRY INTO A RESIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u201cAmong the many interests served by the Fourth Amendment, the privacy interest in one\u2019s home has few equals.\u201d <em>Kyer v. Commonwealth, </em>45 Va.App. 473, 480, 612 S.E.2d 213, 217 (2005) <em>(en banc); see generally Kyllo v. United States, </em>533 U.S. 27, 31, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 2041-42, 150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001). As a general rule, \u201csearches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>King, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1856 (citation omitted). \u201cBut even on this topic the Fourth Amendment\u2019s text endorses no absolutes. It instead condemns only \u2018unreasonable\u2019 searches and seizures.\u201d <em>Kyer, </em>45 Va.App. at 480, 612 S.E.2d at 217. The \u201cpresumption may be overcome in some circumstances\u201d because the \u201cwarrant requirement is subject to certain reasonable exceptions.\u201d <em>King, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 1856 (citations omitted). \u201cOne well-recognized exception applies when \u2018the exigencies of the situation\u2019 make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that a warrantless search is objectively reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Coupled with a showing of probable cause, there are \u201cseveral exigencies that may justify a warrantless search of a home.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 592, 598, 696 S.E.2d 211, 214 (2010). One such exigency occurs where officers \u201creasonably believe that the premises have recently been or are being burglarized.\u201d 3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search &amp; Seizure </em>\u00a7 6.6(b), at 470-72 (4th ed.2004). \u201cIf it is possible the burglar is still at the scene, the police may look in places where he might be hiding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">We addressed just this situation in <em>Hill v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 1, 441 S.E.2d 50 (1994). In that case, a neighbor telephoned the police and reported a possible burglary at a nearby residence. The front door of the residence was open, and the owner had been gone for two days. The police arrived on the scene, rang the doorbell, and shouted several times through the open door for anyone inside to respond. \u201cStill receiving no response, the officers entered the house to investigate the possibility of a burglary. They again announced themselves and, receiving no response, searched the house in places where a burglar might hide, including closets and under beds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2, 441 S.E.2d at 51. They did not find the burglar but observed contraband, which they later retrieved pursuant to a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We held in <em>Hill </em>that the officers had probable cause to believe the home had been \u201cunlawfully entered\u201d and they \u201creasonably suspected that the burglar might still be in the house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4, 441 S.E.2d at 51. \u201cThe circumstances required prompt action,\u201d we emphasized. <em>Id. </em>The officers had a duty to determine whether the \u201chouse had, in fact, been burglarized, to apprehend the burglar, and to resecure the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt would have been impractical for one officer to go for a warrant while the other attempted to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>premises from all sides. The circumstances created a situation of exigency, requiring immediate, warrantless entry.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Singer, </em>687 F.2d 1135, 1144 (8th Cir.1982) (\u201cit would defy reason to suppose that [officers] had to secure a warrant before investigating, leaving the putative burglars free to complete their crime unmolested\u201d), <em>adopted in relevant part, </em>710 F.2d 431 (1983) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">C. ENTRY INTO WASHINGTON\u2019S TRAILER</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The information known by the deputies in this case supports the trial court\u2019s finding of probable cause and exigent circumstances. The deputies had just received a report of a recent burglary of the Hendersons\u2019 home. Fresh footprints in the snow led from the broken kitchen window to the damaged vehicle to the doorstep of Washington\u2019s trailer. The snow had fallen that morning, but not during the preceding days. The distinct checkered footprint left a clean and sharp trail from one clearly burglarized home to another residence that the deputies reasonably suspected was in the process of being burglarized. The door to the trailer opened simply upon knocking on it, further confirming the deputies\u2019 suspicions. Hearing no reply to their request that anyone inside should come out, the deputies could have reasonably feared a burglar had incapacitated anyone living in the trailer or threatened them to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Washington contends the deputies could not be certain a burglary suspect was still in the trailer. True, but the deputies were \u201cnot required to possess either the gift of prophecy or the infallible wisdom that comes with hindsight. Their conduct in making a warrantless search must be judged by the circumstances confronting the officers at the time they act.\u201d <em>Hill, 18 </em>Va.App. at 3, 441 S.E.2d at 51 (quoting <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 430, 437, 388 S.E.2d 659, 664 (1990)). In Fourth Amendment cases, the \u201ccalculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments\u2014in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>Ryburn v. Huff, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 987, 992, 181 L.Ed.2d 966 (2012) (quoting <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 1872, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)). Police officers must often make an \u201con-the-spot judgment based on incomplete information and sometimes ambiguous facts bearing upon the potential for serious consequences.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>624 F.3d 626, 634 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Martins, </em>413 F.3d 139, 147 (1st Cir.2005)). When they do so, courts should not \u201cengage in \u2018should have/could have/would have\u2019 hindsight\u201d to second-guess their objectively reasonable judgments. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">For these reasons, the trial court correctly denied Washington\u2019s motion to suppress the incriminating evidence obtained from the later search pursuant to the warrant. The deputies\u2019 initial warrantless entry did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against unreasonable searches, and thus, the observations made during their protective sweep did not taint the application for the search warrant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Because probable cause and exigent circumstances justified the deputies\u2019 warrantless entry into Washington\u2019s trailer, the trial court did not err in denying his motion to suppress. We thus affirm Washington\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">. <em>See also Hunsberger v.
