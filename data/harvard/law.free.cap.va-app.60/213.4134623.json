Lillian Callender </em>(Nos. CR10-01420, CR10-01421, and CR10-01422) [hereinafter <em>Callender </em>] to remove original photographs and an autopsy report, admitted into evidence during the <em>Callender </em>trial, from the public court file in that case, and placing photocopies of the exhibits that were retained in the court file under seal. Appellants assert the trial court failed to make the required findings under <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, </em>478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986), prior to ordering the exhibits and photocopies sealed, that the order was not the least restrictive means of protecting the interests identified by the trial court, and that the order violated appellants\u2019 right to access public judicial records, in violation of the United States and Virginia Constitutions and Code \u00a7 17.1-208.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">On August 9, 2010, a grand jury in the City of Newport News indicted Lillian Callender and Michael Stoffa for felony child neglect of Callender\u2019s seventeen-month-old and twenty-seven-month-old daughters, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-371.1(A), and for second-degree murder of Callender\u2019s seventeen-month-old daughter, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-33. Following a bench trial on January 24, 2011, the trial court convicted Callender of second-degree murder of her seventeen-month-old daughter and felony child neglect of both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>daughters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court sentenced Callender on July 21, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">In March 2011, Kelly, a reporter for The Daily Press, Inc., requested permission from the clerk of the trial court to review the public court file related to Callender\u2019s trial. The clerk denied appellants\u2019 request. On March 28, 2011, without notice or hearing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court entered an order sealing the entire court file \u201cfrom the public until the conclusion of [Callender\u2019s and Stoffa\u2019s] cases.\u201d On April 12, 2011, appellants filed a consolidated motion to intervene in <em>Callender </em>and for the trial court to unseal the court file in that case. Appellants argued that the trial court\u2019s order to place the public court file under seal violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, provisions of the Virginia Constitution, and Code \u00a7 17.1-208.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">On April 20, 2011, at a hearing on appellants\u2019 motions, the trial court granted appellants\u2019 motion to intervene in <em>Callender </em>without hearing argument, \u201cfinding that [appellants] [are] a proper party to this hearing.\u201d The trial court further \u201c[found] that the [o]rder entered March 28, 2011 was over-broad in sealing the <em>entire </em>file.\u201d After hearing argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>from the parties, the trial court stated that \u201cthe exhibits, the pictures, [and] the medical reports\u201d admitted into evidence during Callender\u2019s bench trial \u201chave not, to my knowledge, been open to the public other than by submission to this [c]ourt.\u201d The trial court stated its concern for Stoffa\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d rights and his interest in \u201cnot allow[ing]\u201d the exhibits and photographs admitted into evidence in <em>Callender </em>\u201cto be disseminated until [they are] properly introduced by the Commonwealth and accepted by th[e] [trial] [c]ourt against [Stoffa].\u201d The trial court stated that \u201c[t]he [c]ourt\u2019s consideration is the dissemination and publication of information contained in the original exhibits prior to the introduction of those documents by the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The trial court, over appellants\u2019 objections, ordered the clerk of the court \u201cto secure the withdrawal of the original exhibits [admitted into evidence at Callender\u2019s trial] and to place <em>under seal </em>the photocopies of same to be retained in the Callender file.\u201d It further ordered the clerk of the court to release the original exhibits to the Commonwealth and Callender\u2019s counsel for use at Stoffa\u2019s upcoming trial. It ordered the Commonwealth and Callender\u2019s counsel to return the original exhibits \u201cto the Callender file should an appeal be noted in her case\u201d and, in any event, to return the exhibits to the court file \u201cafter the trial of Michael Stoffa has concluded.\u201d Finally, the trial court ordered \u201cthat the remainder of [the court] file shall be available for public inspection,\u201d and \u201c[o]ther than the exhibits withdrawn as authorized above, as well as copies thereof secured by the clerk, and other reports customarily deemed confidential and not available for public inspection, the [c]ourt\u2019s [March 28, 2011] [o]rder to seal is rescinded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On May 6, 2011, appellants petitioned this Court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the trial court to vacate its April 22, 2011 order in which it permitted the Commonwealth and Callender\u2019s counsel to withdraw the original trial exhibits from the <em>Callender </em>court file and sealed the photocopies of the exhibits that were retained in that file. We denied appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>petition for a writ of mandamus by order on May 24, 2011, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-4\">[t]he trial court had no duty to seal the trial exhibits, and its decision to do so involved an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See [Perreault v. The Free Lance-Star, </em>276 Va. 375, 389, 666 S.E.2d 352, 360 (2008) ]. Accordingly, mandamus does not lie to order the trial court to reverse a decision reached in its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><em>In re The Daily Press and Ashley Kelly, </em>No. 0924-11-1 (Va.Ct.App. May 24, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On August 26, 2011, appellants petitioned this Court for appeal from the trial court\u2019s order permitting the removal of the original trial exhibits by the Commonwealth and Callender\u2019s counsel and sealing the photocopies of the exhibits retained in the <em>Callender </em>court file. We granted appellants\u2019 petition for appeal on October 27, 2011. In addition to the two assignments of error raised in appellants\u2019 petition, we ordered additional briefing from the parties addressing (i) whether appellants\u2019 assignments of error were waived under Rule 5A:18 and (ii) whether we had jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the order of the trial court sealing the file in part in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">The threshold question presented is whether Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i) confers jurisdiction on this Court to hear an appeal from an order of the trial court permitting the Commonwealth and Callender\u2019s counsel to withdraw original trial exhibits from the <em>Callender </em>court file and placing photocopies of the exhibits that were retained in that file under seal. Appellants assert that this Court is the proper venue for their appeal because, as third-party interveners in <em>Callender, </em>they constitute an \u201caggrieved party\u201d petitioning for appeal from a \u201cfinal conviction in a circuit court,\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i). The Commonwealth contends this Court is not the proper venue for this appeal because appellants merely chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>lenge an ancillary or procedural order of the trial court; are not aggrieved by Callender\u2019s conviction in the trial court; and do not challenge Callender\u2019s conviction or sentence. Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved party may present a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals from (i) any final conviction in a circuit court of ... a crime, except where a sentence of death has been imposed____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\n<em>(i) Interpreting Code \u00a7 17.1-I06(A)(i)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">When interpreting statutory language that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai\">\u201cis plain and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that statutory language. Thus, when the General Assembly has used words that have a plain meaning, courts cannot give those words a construction that amounts to holding that the General Assembly meant something other than that which it actually expressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\"><em>Beck v. Shelton, </em>267 Va. 482, 488, 593 S.E.2d 195, 198 (2004) (quoting <em>Lee County v. Town of St. Charles, </em>264 Va. 344, 348, 568 S.E.2d 680, 682 (2002)). Where bound by the plain meaning of the language used in a statute, we are not permitted \u201cto add to or subtract from the words used in the statute.\u201d <em>Posey v. Commonwealth, </em>123 Va. 551, 553, 96 S.E. 771, 771 (1918). We adhere to the principle that \u201cwe must ... assume ... the legislature chose, with care, the words it used when it enacted the relevant statute.\u201d <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, Inc., </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990). It is incumbent upon us to give reasonable effect to every word. <em>Moyer v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 8, 35, 531 S.E.2d 580, 593 (2000) <em>(en banc). </em>In giving reasonable effect to every word, we presume the legislature used the word in its ordinary sense in the absence of a specific, statutory definition. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">The legislature chose to use the words \u201cfrom a final <em>conviction </em>in a circuit court of ... a crime\u201d in delineating our jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i). (Emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>335 (7th ed.1999) defines the word \u201cconviction\u201d as \u201c[t]he act or process of judicially finding someone guilty of a crime; the state of having been proved guilty.\u201d Here, appellants do not appeal from the process utilized in \u201cfinding [Callender] guilty of a crime,\u201d nor do they appeal from Callender\u2019s \u201chaving been proved guilty\u201d of felony child neglect and second-degree murder. <em>Id. </em>It would strain the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cconviction,\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 17.1\u2014406(A)(i), to interpret the Court as having jurisdiction over an appeal that arises by virtue of an order of the trial court that is wholly ancillary to, and has no bearing at all on, Callender\u2019s conviction. <em>See Melanson v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 178, 183, 539 S.E.2d 433, 435 (2001) (\u201c\u2018The plain, obvious, and rational meaning of a statute is to be preferred over any curious, narrow, or strained construction.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. Zamani, </em>256 Va. 391, 395, 507 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1998))).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Further, in demarcating our appellate jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(ii)-(iv), not in issue here, the General Assembly authorized this Court to entertain appeals from, respectively, \u201cany final <em>decision </em>of a circuit court,\u201d \u201cany final <em>order </em>of a circuit court,\u201d and \u201cany final <em>order </em>for declaratory or injunctive relief.\u201d (Emphases added). \u201cWhen the General Assembly uses different terms in the same act, it is presumed to mean different things.\u201d <em>Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 33, 38, 409 S.E.2d 21, 24 (1991). The General Assembly could have authorized appeals to this Court from parties aggrieved by certain \u201corders\u201d or \u201cdecisions\u201d of the trial court in criminal cases under Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i), but it chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>(ii) Supreme Court Precedent</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The Supreme Court\u2019s holdings in <em>Commonwealth v. Southerly, </em>262 Va. 294, 551 S.E.2d 650 (2001), and <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 191, 557 S.E.2d 230 (2002), support a narrow interpretation of our jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)\u00ae.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>In <em>Southerly, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that this Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the circuit court\u2019s denial of his motion, filed seven years after his conviction as an adult in circuit court, asserting that his conviction was void because the juvenile and domestic relations district court (\u201cJDR court\u201d) failed to comply with the notice requirements of former Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and -264. The Supreme Court initially stated that \u201cthe statute governing the Court of Appeals\u2019 appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases is what really controls.\u201d <em>Southerly, </em>262 Va. at 299, 551 S.E.2d at 653. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[t]he statutory language [of Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i) ] is restrictive, limiting the Court of Appeals\u2019 appellate jurisdiction to appeals from final criminal convictions and from action on motions filed and disposed of while the trial court retains jurisdiction over the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>That entire process is purely criminal in </em>nature....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis and footnote added). The Supreme Court concluded that Southerly\u2019s motion fell outside the purview of this Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i) because it was \u201c \u2018in no sense a continuation of the criminal prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. Crowley, </em>227 Va. 254, 262, 316 S.E.2d 439, 443 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">In <em>Green, </em>263 Va. 191, 557 S.E.2d 230, the Supreme Court held that the petitioner in that case properly appealed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>circuit court\u2019s revocation of his suspended sentence to this Court because the circuit court retained jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 19.2-306<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to revoke all or part of his suspended sentence. The Supreme Court emphasized that the \u201ccircuit court\u2019s jurisdiction to revoke a convict\u2019s probation and suspension of sentence is part of th[e] <em>purely criminal process </em>\u201d over which this Court may exercise appellate jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 194, 557 S.E.2d at 232 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Here, as in <em>Southerly, </em>262 Va. 294, 551 S.E.2d 650, the trial court\u2019s decision to seal a portion of the <em>Callender </em>court file from public inspection was neither a continuation of the criminal prosecution of Callender, nor a process that \u201c[was] purely criminal in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 299, 551 S.E.2d at 653. The trial court\u2019s order to seal a portion of the <em>Callender </em>court file was civil in nature, notwithstanding the fact that Callender\u2019s \u201cunderlying charge [was] criminal in nature.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 298, 551 S.E.2d at 652 (\u201cThis is not to say that if the underlying charge is criminal in nature, the appeal is automatically criminal in nature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Consistent with the principles of statutory construction and the rationale articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Southerly </em>and <em>Green, </em>we conclude that this Court does not have jurisdiction to consider appellants\u2019 appeal from the trial court\u2019s order directing the removal of original exhibits from the <em>Callender </em>court file and placing photocopies of those exhibits under seal. Appellants were not aggrieved by and do not appeal \u201cfrom a final conviction\u201d in the trial court. Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i). The trial court\u2019s order to remove exhibits and place under seal photocopies of those exhibits was not a purely criminal matter falling under the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, we transfer this appeal to the Supreme Court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-677.1, for further proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\n<em>Transferred.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-8\">.

In <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v.

In isolation, this statement might be read as suggesting that this Court has jurisdiction over appellants' appeal from the trial court's order as one that arises \"from [an] action on motions filed and disposed of while the trial court retainfed] jurisdiction over [the <em>Callender </em>] case.\u201d <em>Southerly, </em>262 Va. at 299, 551 S.E.2d at 653. However, when read in context of the entire <em>Southerly </em>opinion, it is clear that the Supreme Court held that this Court has jurisdiction over appeals \"from action on motions filed and disposed of while the trial court retainfed] jurisdiction over the case\u201d only when that action falls within the \"purely criminal\u201d conviction process, <em>id., </em>and otherwise embodies \" 'a continuation of the criminal prosecution,' \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Corrections v.

This Court has no authority to exercise appellate jurisdiction under Code \u00a7 17.1\u2014 406(A)(i) where, as here, the trial court action complained of was neither a continuation of the criminal prosecution nor part of the \u201cpurely criminal process\u201d of conviction. <em>Green, </em>263 Va. at 194, 557 S.E.2d at 232.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">.

Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The Commonwealth asserts that appellants' reliance on <em>Hertz </em>is misplaced because the Supreme Court never purported to identify which appellate court would have jurisdiction over an appeal of a trial court's sealing order. <em>See Hertz, </em>259 Va. at 610, 528 S.E.2d at 464 (noting only that, had the media outlets intervened in the JDR courts, they \u201cwould have been required to appeal any adverse order that may have been entered by the [JDR] court[s]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">We agree with the Commonwealth. Nothing in <em>Hertz, </em>a case decided before <em>Southerly </em>and <em>Green, </em>suggests that an appeal from a circuit court\u2019s sealing order in a noncapital case constitutes a criminal appeal, much less an appeal from a \"final conviction ... of ... a crime\u201d over which this Court could exercise appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b269-9\">.

Times-World Corp., </em>259 Va. 599, 528 S.E.2d 458 (2000) , does not govern our resolution of the jurisdictional issue. However, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Commonwealth v. Southerly, </em>262 Va. 294, 551 S.E.2d 650 (2001), and <em>Green v.

Thus, I respectfully dissent. Because I believe this Court has jurisdiction over the appeal, I would reach appellants\u2019 remaining assignments of error, and I would reverse the circuit court\u2019s order sealing a portion of the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">A. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">This Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction in criminal matters is defined by Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A), which provides that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved party may present a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals from ... any final conviction in a circuit court of a traffic infraction or a crime, except where a sentence of death has been imposed.As a general rule, the Supreme Court of Virginia has appellate jurisdiction in civil matters. <em>See </em>\u00a7 8.01-670. Interpreting Code \u00a7 17.1-406(A), the Supreme Court has explained</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-11\">it is the nature of the method employed to seek relief from a criminal conviction and the circumstances under which the method is employed that determine whether an appeal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>civil or criminal in nature. If the method consists of an appeal from the conviction itself or <em>from action on motions filed and disposed of while the trial court retains jurisdiction over the case, </em>the appeal is criminal in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><em>Southerly, </em>262 Va. at 299, 551 S.E.2d at 652-53 (emphasis added); <em>see also Green, </em>263 Va. at 194, 557 S.E.2d at 232. Because the trial court granted appellants\u2019 motion to intervene and ruled on their request to obtain access to the exhibits as part of the criminal matter against Callender while it retained jurisdiction, I would hold, contrary to the position taken by the majority, that appellants fall within the broadly worded category of \u201c[a]ny aggrieved parties]\u201d authorized by Code \u00a7 17.1\u2014 406(A) to \u201cpresent a petition for appeal to the Court of Appeals from ... any final conviction in a circuit court of ... a crime.\u201d Thus, I would reach the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">B. MOOTNESS</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s order, when Callender noted her appeal, the original exhibits were returned to the case file and the sealing order was lifted. Thus, the Commonwealth contends the appeal is now moot. However, the opportunity for appellants to review those exhibits <em>contemporaneously </em>with Callender\u2019s convictions (and prior to Stoffa\u2019s trial) has passed. <em>See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 574, 584, 281 S.E.2d 915, 920 (1981) (\u201c \u2018The knowledge that every criminal trial is subject to <em>contemporaneous </em>review in the forum of public opinion is an effective restraint on possible abuse of judicial power.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Gannett Co. v.

This case, therefore, presents a classic example of an issue \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review,\u201d a well-established exception to mootness doctrine. The United States Supreme Court considered a very similar issue in <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v.

Because the entire order expired with the completion of the rape trial at which the defendant was acquitted, we must consider at the outset whether a live controversy remains. Under Art.

Although the trial court said its ruling applied to this case only, it failed to articulate a rationale that was unique to this case, stating only generally as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">The Court\u2019s consideration is the dissemination and publication of information contained in the original exhibits prior to the introduction of those documents by the Commonwealth [in Stoffa\u2019s subsequent trial, which the trial court believed was scheduled for the next month] ... so as to not violate or prejudice or bias the interest of the Commonwealth or a defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">[U]ntil those exhibits are properly introduced against another defendant, there are issues regarding discovery [and] admissibility as to their effectiveness against other defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">Certainly anyone can get a transcript as to what occurred in the trial ...

In <em>In re National Broadcasting Co. (United States v. Myers), </em>635 F.2d at 953, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held the public\u2019s right of access to trial exhibits (videotapes) admitted in \u201cthe Myers cases\u201d outweighed any \u201crisk to a fair trial of ... others facing trial on other Abscam indictments.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Relying in part on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s First Amendment holding in <em>Richmond Newspapers, </em>the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">[Djespite the extensive publicity about Abscam ..., about half of those summoned for jury selection had no knowledge of Abscam, and only a handful had more than cursory knowledge.

We do not believe the public at large must be sanitized as if they all would become jurors in the remaining Abscam trials. The alleged risk to a fair trial for the Abscam defendants yet to be tried is too speculative to justify denial of the public\u2019s right to inspect ... evidence presented in open court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">If <em>voir dire </em>examination should reveal that at a particular time and location there is genuine difficulty assembling an impartial jury, or even that the effort to do so risks unduly narrowing the cross-section from which the trial jury will be selected, trial courts can take additional protective measures through the granting of a continuance or change of venue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 953-54 &amp; n. 9 (citations omitted) (also approving copying of the evidence), <em>cited with approval in Charlotte Observer, </em>882 F.2d at 855-56 (\u201c[The magistrate\u2019s assessment] gives much too short shrift to the capability of <em>voir dire </em>to guard against the potential prejudice of pretrial publicity, including ...

Even the prosecutor in the Callender and Stoffa matters conceded that the possibility of tainting the jury pool, in the event Stoffa changed his mind and decided to exercise his right to trial by jury, probably was not enough to justify sealing the exhibits admitted in Callender\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The Commonwealth argues on brief that \u201cit appears ... appellants intended, not just to examine the exhibits, but to make copies of them for their own use.\u201d It contends that the decision in <em>Smith v. Richmond Newspapers, </em>261 Va. 113, 540 S.E.2d 878 (2001), drew a clear distinction between these rights, \u201crepeatedly emphasizing] that it was addressing only the intervening newspaper\u2019s attempt to listen to [certain] tapes, not to obtain copies of them.\u201d Thus, the Commonwealth contends <em>Smith </em>provides additional support for the trial court\u2019s ruling refusing access. I would conclude this argument is a red herring, as I see nothing in the record clearly indicating appellants sought leave to make copies of these exhibits. The closest appellants come is the request in their motion to \u201cfull and unfettered access to the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Whether the First Amendment guarantees a right to copy exhibits capable of being duplicated appears to be an open question in Virginia. <em>See Smith, </em>261 Va. at 118-19 &amp; n. 2, 540 S.E.2d at 881-82 &amp; n. 2 (upholding public right to \u201cinspect\u201d audiotapes of criminal trial by listening to them but <em>expressly not addressing </em>\u201c[t]he release of the audio tapes\u201d); <em>see also Globe Newspaper Co., </em>264 Va. at 629-30, 570 S.E.2d at 812-13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>(rejecting the notion that, in a trial in which DNA test results have been admitted, the First Amendment right of \u201caccess\u201d to admitted evidence includes the right to have additional DNA testing performed on the biological sample tested to produce the result already in evidence). Even if appellants sought to duplicate and publish and this Court were to conclude the applicable law did not require it to permit such activity, a more narrowly tailored approach the court should have considered, in lieu of sealing the exhibits, would have been to permit examination without duplication or publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The record contains no other basis for the trial court\u2019s decision to seal the exhibits in Callender\u2019s case which is any stronger than the weak \u201cpotential jury bias\u201d argument already evaluated. Although the trial court here did not articulate a basis for sealing specifically tied to the facts of this case, it said generally that \u201cuntil those exhibits are properly introduced against another defendant, there are issues regarding <em>discovery, </em>there are issues regarding <em>admissibility </em>as to their effectiveness against other defendants.\u201d (Emphasis added). The exhibits at issue here\u2014the autopsy report and related photos of the deceased child\u2014were admitted against Callender, the deceased child\u2019s mother, in Callender\u2019s bench trial based on allegations she failed to protect the child. Nothing articulated in the record indicates those exhibits would not also have been admissible against Stoffa, whom the Commonwealth contended was the party more directly responsible for the child\u2019s death. In addition, Rule 3A:ll(ii) expressly permitted Stoffa, \u201cupon written motion,\u201d \u201cto inspect and copy or photograph any relevant ... written reports of autopsies.\u201d The record in this case contains no evidence concerning discovery requests defendant Stoffa may or may not have made in his related case. However, even assuming Stoffa failed to request the autopsy report in a timely fashion, any tactical desire of the Commonwealth to prevent Stoffa from obtaining, via the record in Callender\u2019s trial, an autopsy report he failed to request in his own case would not provide a sufficiently compelling justification under the First Amendment for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>trial court\u2019s refusing to make the exhibits from Callender\u2019s trial public.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The trial court noted a legitimate concern about preserving the physical integrity of the exhibits so as to \u201cnot allow[ ] a member of the public to come in and damage [an exhibit] in any way or destroy it or remove it from the file.\u201d Counsel for appellants argued a narrowly tailored method of addressing this concern would be to require the parties to substitute photocopies for any exhibits removed from the file. The trial court directed the parties to follow this procedure of submitting photocopies for the withdrawn exhibits but then sealed the photocopies, clearly not the narrowest method of protecting the physical integrity of the evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Nixon v. Warner Commc\u2019ns, </em>435 U.S. 589, 609, 98 S.Ct. 1306, 1317-18, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978) (in applying \u201cthe common-law right of access to judicial records,\u201d upholding restriction on access to audiotapes admitted into evidence which prevented <em>\u201cphysical </em>access\u201d to the tapes but permitted the press \u201cto listen to the tapes\u201d and have ongoing access to transcripts of the tapes).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Thus, I would hold the trial court\u2019s sealing of the exhibits at issue was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">D.

This code section is \u201cbroad,\u201d \u201cmakes no distinction between criminal and civil proceedings,\u201d and \u201cprovides a rebuttable presumption of public access ... to judicial records\u201d including duly filed trial exhibits. <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 368 S.E.2d at 255; <em>see Worrell Enters., </em>14 Va.App. at 680, 419 S.E.2d at 277 (noting, in contrast, that no common-law right of access exists to <em>discovery </em>documents). \u201c[T]o overcome the presumption, the moving party ... bear[s] the burden of establishing an interest so compelling that it cannot be protected reasonably by some measure other than a protective order, and ... any such order must be drafted in the manner least restrictive of the public\u2019s interest.\u201d <em>Fanning, </em>235 Va. at 258-59, 368 S.E.2d at 256 (relying on federal and state cases involving the constitutional issue). The statute, like the constitutional standard, requires \u201cspecific factual findings ... to support a decision to restrict public access to court records.\u201d <em>Perreault Adm\u2019x v.

Thus, the statutory issue requires an analysis similar to the constitutional analysis but is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">The record establishes that under the statute, like under the Constitution, the trial court abused its discretion both in refusing the requested inspection and in failing to make the specific findings required to support that refusal, including an evaluation of less restrictive alternatives.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">In sum, I respectfully dissent from the ruling transferring the appeal. Thus, I would reach the merits of the appeal and conclude that the trial court, by sealing the exhibits without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>making specific findings which support that action or considering less restrictive alternatives, violated both the Constitution and Code \u00a7 17.1-208.</p>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b270-12\">.
