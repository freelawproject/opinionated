(\u201cthe College\u201d) appeals the Circuit Court of the City of Salem\u2019s (\u201ccircuit court\u201d) order, on remand from this Court\u2019s opinion, <em>Nat\u2019l College of Bus. and Tech., Inc. v. Davenport,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>57 Va.App. 677, 705 S.E.2d 519 (2011), finding that the asbestos-related violations were properly classified as \u201cother than serious\u201d violations with no penalties imposed. On appeal, the College contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the alleged violations were properly classified as \u201cother than serious\u201d violations, rather than \u201cde minimis\u201d violations, because the Commissioner failed to produce credible evidence of a direct and/or immediate relationship to the occupational safety and health of the College\u2019s employees. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>For the following reasons, this Court affirms the circuit court\u2019s holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On appeal, \u201c[w]e view the facts in this case \u2018in the light most favorable to sustaining the [Commissioner\u2019s] action and take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the [Commissioner], and the purposes of the basic law under which the [Commissioner] has acted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l College, </em>57 Va.App. at 680-81, 705 S.E.2d at 521 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Sentara Norfolk Gen. Hosp. v. State Health Comm\u2019r, </em>30 Va.App. 267, 279, 516 S.E.2d 690, 696 (1999)). So viewed, the evidence is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The Virginia Department of Labor and Industry Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cVOSH\u201d) received an anonymous complaint concerning dust from the renovation of the College in Salem. Doug Wiggins (\u201cWiggins\u201d), a VOSH asbestos/lead compliance officer, investigated the complaint at the College. He initiated the inspection on January 20, 2004. During the inspection, Wiggins was told there had been an asbestos inspection and report prior to the renovation work.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">On one side of the gymnasium, Wiggins noticed four-inch diameter holes cut through the concrete floor. The holes were for an electrical conduit to pass through the floor to the basement. He was told there was an old boiler room beneath that area.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Wiggins then inspected the boiler room located in the basement, and observed some damaged pipe insulation suspected to contain asbestos, approximately seven to eight feet above the floor. Wiggins photographed insulation material found on the pipes and ducts in the boiler room. He found asbestos-containing material in some of the insulation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>response to questioning if amosite and chrysotile asbestos caused mesothelioma, Wiggins affirmatively responded that both of them will cause mesothelioma.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wiggins also testified it takes an expert to identify asbestos. Wiggins indicated most asbestos material is covered by a cloth-like material to \u201ckeep the asbestos materials in and to insulate,\u201d but several pipes had damaged insulation, revealing the asbestos material. One photograph showed a pipe with new insulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Wiggins observed a valve or faucet-like handle in the boiler room, used to regulate the boiler\u2019s temperature. In response to a question by the circuit court, Wiggins indicated that the presence of the heat valve would cause employees to go to the boiler room. Wiggins also observed boxes containing College records being stored in the boiler room.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Upon the conclusion of the inspection, Wiggins recommended that the College be cited for certain violations related to the asbestos found in the boiler room. VOSH, based on the recommendations, issued a citation with three subparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Item 1 charged the College with not determining the quantities of the asbestos pipe insulation and other asbestos material in the facility, in violation of 29 C.F.R. 1910.1001(j)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Item 2a charged the College with failure to post signs at the entrance of the boiler room where damaged asbestos materials were located, in violation of 29 C.F.R. 1910.1001(j)(3)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Item 2b charged the College with failure to place warning labels on the products (pipe insulation, old boiler, etc.) that contained asbestos, in violation of 29 C.F.R. 1910.1001(])(4)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Wiggins explained the rationale of the Item 1 citation. The College was required to inspect all areas where renovation occurred for presumed asbestos-containing material (\u201cPACM\u201d) and asbestos-containing material (\u201cACM\u201d). Specifically, the College would have been required to inspect the boiler room where the damaged asbestos material was found. Wiggins concluded employees had access to the boiler room because the College records were stored there and because employees must go to the boiler room to adjust the temperature.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Referring to Item 2a of the citation, Wiggins testified the College had a duty to post signs at the entrance to the boiler room to identify the asbestos materials present. There were no such signs. As to item 2b, the College was obligated to affix warning labels to all products containing asbestos fibers (or to their containers). No such labels were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Wiggins then addressed the range of penalties associated with the violations. There are three grades of severity: high, medium, and low. There are two grades of probability: greater and lesser. The levels of severity and probability are combined to reach a \u201cgravity-based\u201d penalty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because asbestos is carcinogenic,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> meaning it \u201cmay cause cancers, may cause mesothelioma, [and] may cause asbestosis,\u201d Wiggins classified the severity as \u201chigh.\u201d He classified the probability of expo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>sure as \u201clesser\u201d based on the potential for employees to be in the area and with what frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Wiggins applied the same calculation to arrive at the penalties for Items 2a and 2b, which he grouped together to arrive at a proposed penalty. He calculated the penalties based on the criteria for \u201cserious\u201d violations set forth in the Field Operations Manual (\u201cFOM\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">The circuit court affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s citations and the penalties imposed. The College appealed to this Court alleging that the circuit court erred in finding \u201c(1) that the College\u2019s employees were exposed to the asbestos hazard and (2) that the violations were \u2018serious,\u2019 as defined by Code \u00a7 40.1-49.3.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l College, </em>57 Va.App. at 680, 705 S.E.2d at 521. On February 15, 2011, this Court affirmed the circuit court holding that there was evidence that the employees were exposed to asbestos at the College. <em>Id. </em>at 691, 705 S.E.2d at 526. This Court, however, reversed the circuit court\u2019s finding that the evidence in the record was sufficient to show a finding of a serious violation in that there was no evidence that a person exposed to asbestos is likely to suffer serious injury or death. <em>Id. </em>at 691-92, 705 S.E.2d at 526. This Court then remanded the second issue to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the Commissioner \u201cfor a re-determination of the penalty consistent with this opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 692, 705 S.E.2d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Upon remand, the Commissioner filed a memorandum on re-determination of the penalty in the circuit court, and proposed that the citations be classified as \u201cother than serious\u201d violations without penalty, pursuant to Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(G), based on the fact that the violations have a direct relationship to the occupational safety and health of the College\u2019s employees. The Commissioner acknowledged in the memorandum that since the diseases resulting from exposure to asbestos do not appear immediately, the question was not whether the relationship was immediate but rather whether the relationship was direct.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>The College filed its response contesting the Commissioner\u2019s proposed classification of the violations. The College argued that the violations should have been classified as \u201cde minimis\u201d since there was no proof of a direct and/or immediate relationship between the violations and the occupational safety and health of the College\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">On June 29, 2011, the circuit court issued a letter opinion finding that \u201cthe -violations committed by [the College] are classified as \u2018other than serious\u2019 violations. They are not \u2018de minimis\u2019 violations.\u201d In the letter opinion, the circuit court \u201cadopt[ed] the 6/10/11 \u2018Memorandum on Re-determination of the Penalty\u2019 as filed by the Commissioner ..., as the opinion of this [c]ourt.\u201d On July 21, 2011, the circuit court issued a final order and specifically held that, \u201cthe [circuit court] finds that the asbestos related violations, ..., are properly classified as \u2018other than serious\u2019 violations with no penalties imposed.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">On appeal, \u201c[t]he burden is upon the party complaining of an agency action to demonstrate an error of law subject to review.\u201d <em>Roanoke Mem\u2019l Hosps. v. Kenley, </em>3 Va.App. 599, 603, 352 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1987) (citation omitted). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">[o]n appeal, findings of fact made by the trial judge are presumed to be correct and are \u201cgiven the same effect as a jury verdict, settling all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Richmond v. Beltway Properties, </em>217 Va. 376, 379, 228 S.E.2d 569, 572 (1976). In reviewing such a factual finding, we view the evidence in a light most favorable to the finding. <em>See, e.g., Rudder v. Housing Authority, </em>219 Va. 592, 595, 249 S.E.2d 177, 178 (1978), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>441 U.S. 939 [, 99 S.Ct. 2154, 60 L.Ed.2d 1040] (1979). A contention that the evidence does not support the court\u2019s factual finding will be sustained only when the finding is plainly wrong or is without credible evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Floyd S. Pike Electr. Contr., Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, Dep\u2019t of Labor &amp; Indus., </em>222 Va. 317, 322, 281 S.E.2d 804, 807 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On appeal, the College contends that the circuit court erred in finding that the alleged violations were properly classified as \u201cother than serious\u201d violations, rather than \u201cde minimis\u201d violations. Specifically, the College contends that 1) \u201c[u]nder the FOM, the violations did not have a direct and immediate relationship to the occupational safety and health of [the] College\u2019s employees\u201d; and 2) \u201cthe Commissioner failed to establish that [the] College\u2019s violations had either a direct or immediate impact on the occupational safety or health of its employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">A. \u201cDirect and Immediate Relationship\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The College first contends that the circuit court erred and was plainly wrong in classifying the violations as \u201cother than serious\u201d when \u201c[u]nder the FOM, the violations did not have a direct and immediate relationship to the occupational safety and health of [the] College\u2019s employees.\u201d The College specifically asserts this on the basis that the Commissioner expressly acknowledged there was no \u201cimmediate\u201d harm to the College\u2019s employees from exposure to the asbestos, and thus the violations should be classified as \u201cde minimis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">As noted by the College, the FOM provides that an \u201c[o]therthan-[s]erious [violations\u201d causation has a \u201cdirect and immediate relationship to [an employee\u2019s] safety and health.\u201d FOM, Chapter 10, II.A. This Court, however, looks to the FOM only for guidance as the FOM does not establish substantive law. <em>See Nat\u2019l College, </em>57 Va.App. at 683 n. 6, 705 S.E.2d at 522 n. 6 (\u201cIt must be noted that the FOM is an operational manual setting forth procedures to investigate violations. It is not and does not purport to establish substantive law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In turning to the substantive law, the Virginia Administrative Code defines an \u201c[o]ther [than serious] violation\u201d as \u201ca violation which is not, by itself, a serious violation within the meaning of the law but which has a direct <em>or </em>immediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>relationship to occupational safety or health.\u201d 16 VAC 25-60-10 (emphasis added). Under the Administrative Code, the requirements are disjunctive requirements rather than conjunctive requirements. Therefore, contrary to the College\u2019s assertion in reliance on the FOM, an \u201cother [than serious] violation\u201d can occur if there is either a \u201cdirect or immediate relationship\u201d to the employees\u2019 safety and health. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the circuit court did not err in applying the law, as the College alleges, to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">B. \u201cDe Minimis\u201d or \u201cOther [Than Serious] Violation\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The College also contends that the circuit court erred because \u201cthe Commissioner failed to establish that [the] College\u2019s violations had either a direct or immediate impact on the occupational safety or health of its employees.\u201d Specifically, the College asserts that even though the College failed to inspect the boiler room and post warnings about asbestos, there is no evidence of the level or frequency of exposure to ACM that would have a direct relationship to its employees\u2019 safety and health. In other words, the College argues that there is no evidence of causation between the employees\u2019 health and safety and the violations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Under the VOSH plan, VOSH inspects private industry workplaces, and issues a citation to the employer based upon \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that a violation has occurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Code \u00a7 40.1-49.4(A)(1). In addition to a \u201cserious\u201d violation, VOSH also classifies a violation as either \u201cde minimis\u201d or \u201cother [than serious].\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 40.1-49.3; 16 VAC 25-60-10; FOM, Chapter 10, II.A. The Virginia Administrative Code defines \u201cde minimis\u201d as \u201ca violation which has no direct or immediate relationship to safety and health.\u201d 16 VAC 25-60-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">As noted above, an \u201c[o]ther [than serious] violation\u201d is \u201ca violation which is not, by itself, a serious violation<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> within the meaning of the law but which has a direct or immediate relationship to occupational safety or health.\u201d 16 VAC 25-60-10. The FOM describes an \u201c[o]ther-than-[s]erious [violation\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-5\">This type of violation, defined in regulation as \u201cOther Violation\u201d in \u00a7 10 of the VOSH Administrative Regulations Manual, shall be cited in situations where the most serious injury or illness that would be likely to result from a hazardous condition cannot reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm to exposed employees but does have a direct and immediate relationship to their safety and health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">FOM, Chapter 10, II.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">In its memorandum submitted to the circuit court, the Commissioner conceded that the violations in this case have no immediate relationship to the safety and health of the College\u2019s employees in that mesothelioma or asbestosis do not \u201cappear immediately upon an exposure but can take many years to manifest themselves.\u201d Furthermore, the circuit court adopted the Commissioner\u2019s \u201c \u2018Memorandum on Re-determi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>nation of the Penalty[,\u2019 which included the concession,] ... as the opinion of [the circuit court].\u201d In addition, although the record contains no evidence of the level of exposure or frequency of exposure that leads to injury or death as noted by this Court\u2019s previous opinion, this is not the question in the present case. <em>Ncit\u2019l College, </em>57 Va.App. at 691, 705 S.E.2d at 526. Rather, based on the Commissioner\u2019s concession and the circuit court\u2019s subsequent adoption of that concession, the question in this case is whether the record contains sufficient credible evidence that there is a direct relationship between an employee\u2019s exposure to asbestos materials and an employee\u2019s health and safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The record in this case contains sufficient credible evidence to support the circuit court\u2019s holding that employees\u2019 exposure to asbestos has a direct relationship to their safety and health\u2014i.e. an \u201cother [than serious] violation.\u201d As this Court held in the previous appeal, the College\u2019s employees were exposed to the asbestos material in the boiler room. With regard to the asbestos material Wiggins testified that several pipes had damaged insulation that revealed the asbestos material and that he took samples of the insulation material. The laboratory analysis of the samples taken indicated that every sample contained at least ten percent to thirty percent of amosite and/or chrysotile asbestos. In response to questioning regarding whether amosite and chrysotile asbestos caused mesothelioma, Wiggins affirmatively responded that both of them will cause mesothelioma. Wiggins further testified that asbestos is a \u201ccarcinogenic\u201d that \u201cmay cause cancers, may cause mesothelioma, [and] may cause asbestosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Based on the foregoing, the evidence in the record is sufficient to prove that the violations in this case have \u201ca direct ... relationship to [the College\u2019s employees\u2019] occupational safety and health.\u201d 16 VAC 25-60-10. Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in holding that the violations in this case are properly classified as \u201cother than serious\u201d violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that the violations were \u201cother than serious violations\u201d\u2014not simply \u201cde minimis violations\u201d\u2014and we affirm the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-10\">.
