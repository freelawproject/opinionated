Appellant argues on appeal that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress these illegal drugs from the evidence admitted at trial. We disagree with appellant\u2019s argument, and, for the following reasons, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">I. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">During the overnight hours of June 19, 2010, Sergeant Lee Tennis of the Norfolk Police Department conducted a routine patrol of that city\u2019s Lexington Park area\u2014a high-crime area noted for drug activity, gun violence, and homicides. Sergeant Tennis was very familiar with the Lexington Park area, and he had made narcotics arrests, recovered weapons, and responded to calls of shots being fired there.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>At about 3:30 a.m., while driving his patrol car near the 900 block of Goff Street, Sergeant Tennis noticed a blue minivan that was legally parked on the street in front of the rental office of the Lexington Square apartment complex. Sergeant Tennis observed that there was a person in the driver\u2019s seat (Lawson) and a person in the back seat on the passenger\u2019s side (Bowman). In addition, Sergeant Tennis also noticed that a person wearing a long-sleeve white shirt and jeans was walking toward the minivan. At the time Sergeant Tennis noticed him, this person was \u201c[i]n the parking lot towards the rental office, right around the mailbox.\u201d According to Sergeant Tennis, the area surrounding the apartment complex was clearly marked with no trespassing signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Sergeant Tennis continued on his patrol of the Lexington Park area\u2014returning within five minutes to find that the minivan was still parked in the same place on Goff Street. From his vantage point in his patrol car, Sergeant Tennis observed Lawson, the driver of the minivan, appear \u201cto bend down towards the center console of the van or where the center console would be.\u201d Sergeant Tennis testified that Lawson\u2019s act of bending down in this way \u201ckind of alerted me a little bit\u201d given that the minivan was parked in a high-crime area. Sergeant Tennis then \u201cilluminated the [minivan\u2019s] interior\u201d with his patrol car\u2019s \u201cright side alley light\u201d and noticed that Lawson \u201cwas still bent down towards the center console.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Sergeant Tennis\u2019s suspicions were also raised because he could see that there were now <em>three </em>people inside the minivan\u2014Lawson in the driver\u2019s seat, Bowman in the back seat on the passenger\u2019s side of the vehicle, and, in addition, appellant in the front passenger\u2019s seat. Appellant was wearing a long-sleeve white shirt and jeans\u2014the same type of clothes as the clothing worn by the person who had been walking towards the minivan a few moments earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Sergeant Tennis exited his patrol car and approached the driver\u2019s side of the minivan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Illuminating the interior of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>minivan somewhat with his hand-held flashlight, Sergeant Tennis observed appellant \u201creaching underneath his shirt.\u201d Appellant also reached down with his right hand \u201ctowards the side of his seat, towards the back of the minivan.\u201d Sergeant Tennis could not see what was in appellant\u2019s right hand from his vantage point.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u201cAt that exact moment,\u201d Sergeant Tennis testified, \u201cI noticed that Mr. Bowman, who was seated right behind [appellant], began to reach towards the seat where\u201d appellant was sitting. Bowman \u201cwas also reaching with his right hand towards [appellant\u2019s] right hand.\u201d Sergeant Tennis testified that these \u201cfurtive movements\u201d made him \u201cvery uneasy and very suspicious\u201d because appellant and Bowman \u201cwere moving their hands all around\u201d\u2014raising the suspicion that \u201cthey had a gun.\u201d In his \u201cextensive experience,\u201d Sergeant Tennis explained to the trial court, when people move their hands in this type of furtive manner, \u201cthey have either had narcotics or a weapon in the vehicle. Mainly a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Sergeant Tennis told the minivan\u2019s occupants, \u201cLet me see your hands. Put your hands in your laps.\u201d Appellant initially complied with this instruction\u2014as did the other two occupants. However, while Sergeant Tennis was waiting to determine if any of the minivan\u2019s occupants had outstanding arrest warrants,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the sergeant \u201cnoticed, once again, [appellant] take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>his hands and mov[e] [them] around.\u201d Sergeant Tennis testified that appellant \u201conce again tried to drop his hand down towards the right side of the seat,\u201d like \u201che was going to reach towards the back once again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Sergeant Tennis repeated his instruction to appellant \u201cto put his hands back on his lap\u201d where the sergeant could see them. However, Sergeant Tennis then \u201cnoticed that the passenger side window was down\u201d and that appellant \u201chad his hand rested slightly outside of that window.\u201d Sergeant Tennis directed appellant, for a third time, to \u201cput his hands on his lap and keep them that way.\u201d At that point, according to Sergeant Tennis, appellant \u201ccomplied.\u201d Sergeant Tennis testified that appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t move his hands anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">When Officer Simpson and Officer Folston arrived on the scene, Sergeant Tennis decided to conduct a pat down of the minivan\u2019s occupants to determine if they were carrying any weapons. The occupants were ordered out of the minivan so that the limited pat-down search for weapons could be conducted. However, appellant did not comply with Officer Folston\u2019s directions for conducting the pat down. According to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s testimony, appellant was not spreading his feet apart and was keeping his hands tense so that they could not be interlocked, contrary to Officer Folston\u2019s instructions to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Sergeant Tennis directed his flashlight at appellant\u2019s feet and noticed that there was a small, black, \u201cchange-type bag\u201d mostly underneath appellant\u2019s right foot. Sergeant Tennis told appellant to lift his foot, but appellant refused. Sergeant Tennis tried \u201cto slightly push his foot out,\u201d but appellant \u201chad his foot firmly planted on the ground.\u201d When appellant ignored another command to move his foot, Sergeant Tennis then \u201cused a lot more force\u201d and \u201cpushed his foot out, spreading his feet.\u201d Sergeant Tennis then recovered the small bag, which contained heroin and cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Appellant moved to suppress the illegal drugs from the trial evidence\u2014contending that he was seized without reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity (and, therefore, that the illegal drugs must be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d). Sergeant Tennis was the only witness at the suppression hearing. At the conclusion of the suppression hearing, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress based on all of the circumstances presented in Sergeant Tennis\u2019s testimony\u2014including the \u201cfurtive movement\u201d that the sergeant observed, which the trial court found significant based on Sergeant Tennis\u2019s \u201clengthy experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review and General Fourth Amendment Principles</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">This Court reviews appellant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress under settled principles. The Virginia Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">When reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress evidence, an appellate court considers the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and will accord the Commonwealth the benefit of all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence. <em>Sidney v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 517, 520, 702 S.E.2d 124, 126 (2010). The defendant has the burden of showing that even when the evidence is reviewed in that light, denying the motion to suppress was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 702 S.E.2d at 127. We review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the particular facts of the case. <em>Glenn v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 123, 130, 654 S.E.2d 910, 913, (2008).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-8\"><em>Branham v. Commonwealth, </em>283 Va. 273, 279, 720 S.E.2d 74, 77 (2012). On appeal from the denial of a suppression motion, an appellate court should \u201c \u2018give due weight to inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reittinger v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 232, 236, 532 S.E.2d 25, 27 (2000) (quoting <em>Ornelas v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment guarantees, in relevant part, \u2018[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks v. Commonwealth, </em>282 Va. 90, 95, 712 S.E.2d 464, 466 (2011) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. IV).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">However, \u201c[n]ot every encounter that the police have with a member of the public is a seizure.\u201d <em>Washington v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 5, 10, 509 S.E.2d 512, 514 (1999). A consensual encounter between the police and an individual \u201cwill not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny unless it loses its consensual nature\u201d and renders the person seized under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2386, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991). Moreover, case law makes clear that a person is seized for Fourth Amendment purposes only when the person \u201cis either physically restrained or has submitted to a show of authority.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 199, 487 S.E.2d 259, 262 (1997) (en banc) (citing <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 625, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 1550, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\n<em>Moss v. Commonwealth is Not Controlling Here</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Appellant argues that he was seized under the Fourth Amendment before the encounter with Sergeant Tennis actually occurred\u2014i.e., when Sergeant Tennis illuminated the interior of the minivan with the \u201cright side alley light\u201d of his patrol car prior to approaching the minivan on foot. In support of this argument, appellant relies on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 305, 373 S.E.2d 170 (1988). However, <em>Moss </em>is not controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In <em>Moss, </em>the flashlight that the police officer pointed <em>directly </em>at Moss was, according to the officer, \u201cbright and ha[d] an effect of blinding the other parties, which stuns them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 373 S.E.2d at 172. This Court explained that \u201c[t]he blinding and stunning effect of the flashlight in the hands of a uniformed officer who is asking questions amounts to a \u2018show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>of official authority\u2019 such that a reasonable person would conclude he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307-08, 373 S.E.2d at 172. Thus, this Court held that the manner in which the police officer \u201csuddenly confronted\u201d Moss with this flashlight \u201camounted to a \u2018seizure\u2019 of Moss\u2019s person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307, 373 S.E.2d at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">This Court\u2019s decision in Moss\u2014which was based on the specific circumstances of that case\u2014certainly is not controlling on the very different circumstances that are presented in this case. Unlike in <em>Moss, </em>the record here does not indicate how bright the \u201cright side alley light\u201d of the patrol car was or indicate what its effect (if any) on the occupants of the minivan was. \u201cViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as we must since it was the prevailing party in the trial court,\u201d <em>Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 330, 601 S.E.2d 555, 574 (2004), nothing in this record supports the conclusion that the \u201cright side alley light\u201d of Sergeant Tennis\u2019s patrol car was so intensely bright as to blind and stun the occupants of the minivan. Accordingly, the circumstances in <em>Moss </em>are readily distinguishable from the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\n<em>No Seizure Occurs Until Appellant Submits to the Officer\u2019s Show of Authority</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Instead, the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cochran v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 604, 521 S.E.2d 287 (1999), is controlling for determining whether and when appellant was seized under the Fourth Amendment in this case. In <em>Cochran, </em>the Court discussed the test for determining whether a seizure has occurred that the United States Supreme Court formulated in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980), and subsequently interpreted in <em>Hodari D. </em>According to the <em>Mendenhall </em>test, \u201ca person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877. However, as the Virginia Supreme Court held in <em>Coch</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>ran, </em>the <em>Mendenhall </em>test \u201cis not applicable <em>until the person submits </em>to the officer\u2019s show of authority.\u201d <em>Cochran, </em>258 Va. at 608, 521 S.E.2d at 289 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">This principle stated in <em>Cochran </em>reflects the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Hodari D. </em>that a seizure of a person requires either physical force by the police officer or, \u201cwhere that is absent, <em>submission </em>to the assertion of authority.\u201d <em>Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. at 626, 111 S.Ct. at 1551 (emphasis in original); <em>see Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 401, 405, 429 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993) (\u201cThus, as in <em>Hodari D., </em>because Woodson did not submit to [Detective] Carter\u2019s command, we must focus upon what Woodson did, not what a reasonable person would have assumed under the circumstances.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s clear holding in <em>Cochran </em>that a person must first submit to the police officer\u2019s show of authority before being seized for Fourth Amendment purposes is well established in Virginia\u2019s case law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consistent with <em>Cochran </em>and other binding case law, this Court must consider what appellant \u201cactually did in response to the police officer\u2019s show of authority\u201d and when appellant actually <em>submitted </em>to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s show of authority in order to determine when appellant was seized for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>Woodson, </em>245 Va. at 405, 429 S.E.2d at 29. This Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, 52 </em>Va.App. 548, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>665 S.E.2d 261 (2008),\u2014-which, like this case, dealt with instructions by the police for an individual to keep his hands where they could be seen\u2014is highly instructive on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In <em>Jones, </em>two police officers observed Jones sitting alone in a vehicle parked in the parking lot of a hotel known for drug transactions. The officers approached the vehicle and initiated a consensual encounter with Jones. During this encounter, the officers observed Jones reaching toward the floorboard of the vehicle. Concerned that a weapon was within Jones\u2019s reach, one of the officers instructed Jones to keep his hands on the steering wheel. Although Jones <em>initially </em>complied with this instruction, Jones then began reaching toward the floorboard again, prompting the officer to repeat the instruction to keep his hands on the steering wheel. When Jones reached for the floorboard a third time, the officer drew his firearm and ordered Jones to exit the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 551-54, 665 S.E.2d at 263-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On appeal, this Court held that neither Jones\u2019s initial compliance with the officer\u2019s instruction to keep his hands on the steering wheel nor the officer\u2019s repeating of this instruction multiple times transformed the consensual encounter into a seizure. This Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">As noted, after the officers approached Jones and [Officer] Tovar initiated conversation, Jones reached down to the floorboard and Tovar asked him to put his hands on the wheel of the vehicle. Then, on three occasions, Jones refused to comply with that command and reached for the floorboard. Thus, he did not submit to Tovar\u2019s assertion of authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 557, 665 S.E.2d at 265-66; <em>see also Woodson, </em>245 Va. at 405, 429 S.E.2d at 29 (explaining that \u201cit is apparent that Woodson had not been seized when [Detective] Carter ordered him to place his hands where Carter could see them because <em>Woodson did not submit </em>to Carter\u2019s authority\u201d (emphasis added)). Therefore, this Court held in <em>Jones </em>that the seizure occurred when the officer drew his weapon and ordered Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>to exit the vehicle\u2014but <em>not </em>before then. <em>Jones, </em>52 Va.App. at 557, 665 S.E.2d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Here, like in <em>Jones, </em>Sergeant Tennis instructed appellant (as well as Lawson and Bowman, the minivan\u2019s other occupants) to keep his hands where they could be seen, i.e., on his lap. As in <em>Jones, </em>neither this instruction nor appellant\u2019s initial but very temporary compliance with this instruction was enough, by itself, to transform a consensual encounter into a seizure. After this very brief, initial moment of compliance, appellant (like the defendant in Jones) then felt free to ignore Sergeant Tennis\u2019s instructions and continued moving his right hand in a furtive manner. Therefore, appellant was not seized for Fourth Amendment purposes simply because Sergeant Tennis issued a second and third command that appellant keep his hands on his lap where they could be seen. Up to that point, appellant had not yet actually submitted to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s show of authority within the meaning of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Appellant only <em>actually submitted </em>to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s show of authority when <em>appellant </em>stopped moving his hands furtively following the sergeant\u2019s third instruction to keep his hands on his lap where they could be seen. Significantly, according to Sergeant Tennis, appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t move his hands anymore.\u201d By placing (and keeping) his hands where they could be seen, appellant thereby submitted to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s show of authority\u2014and, therefore, became seized for Fourth Amendment purposes at that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Accordingly, based on the specific facts and circumstances of this case, we hold that appellant was seized under the Fourth Amendment when he finally actually submitted to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s instructions to keep his hands on his lap where they could be seen once appellant did not \u201cmove his hands anymore.\u201d Furthermore, by the time appellant was seized for Fourth Amendment purposes, enough facts and circumstances had sufficiently accumulated so that reasonable, articulable suspicion of possible criminal activity existed to detain appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\n<em>Reasonable Articulable Suspicion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Adv\">Under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny, a police officer \u201cmay constitutionally conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.\u201d <em>Bass v. Commonwealth, </em>259 Va. 470, 474-75, 525 S.E.2d 921, 923 (2000) (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 30, 88 S.Ct. at 1884-85).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">A \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d requires only \u201csome minimal level of objective justification\u201d for making such a stop. <em>I.N.S. v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 217 [104 S.Ct. 1758, 1763, 80 L.Ed.2d 247] (1984). Whether an officer has a reasonable suspicion to justify such a detention is \u201cbased on an assessment of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 689, 695, 668 S.E.2d 141, 145 (2008). That assessment \u201callows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \u2018might well elude an untrained person.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273 [122 S.Ct. 744, 750-51, 151 L.Ed.2d 740] (2002) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418 [101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621] (1981)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ago\"><em>Branham, </em>283 Va. at 280, 720 S.E.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Here, as discussed <em>supra, </em>appellant was seized under the Fourth Amendment when he actually submitted to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s third instruction to keep his hands on his lap where they could be seen. (Until that point, appellant\u2019s interaction with Sergeant Tennis had actually been consensual.) A number of factors\u2014within the sergeant\u2019s knowledge by the time appellant was actually seized\u2014provided the sergeant with the required reasonable, articulable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">First, the encounter occurred during the middle of the night in an area (Lexington Park) that is known for narcotics transactions and gun crimes, according to Sergeant Tennis. Second, the area surrounding the Lexington Square apartment complex in Lexington Park is marked with no trespass<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ing signs\u2014and Sergeant Tennis observed that a man wearing the same type of clothing that appellant was wearing (a long-sleeve white shirt and jeans) had been walking in the parking lot of the apartment complex, heading in the direction of the minivan, mere moments before the encounter, which, as noted, occurred around 3:30 a.m. Third, appellant\u2014who appeared quite likely to be the same man who had been observed by Sergeant Tennis walking toward the minivan\u2014was sitting in the front passenger\u2019s seat of the minivan that was parked on Goff Street when Sergeant Tennis returned to the area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Fourth, Lawson, the driver of the minivan, reached toward the center console when the patrol car approached the minivan\u2014a movement that concerned the experienced Sergeant Tennis. Fifth, when Sergeant Tennis approached the minivan on foot, he could see appellant reach his hand underneath his shirt\u2014a furtive gesture that also concerned Sergeant Tennis. Sixth, Sergeant Tennis then observed appellant and Bowman (the man in the rear passenger\u2019s seat) moving their right hands in a furtive manner toward each other. Seventh, Sergeant Tennis testified, without objection, that, based on his extensive experience, people who move their hands in such a furtive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>manner are likely attempting to hide illegal drugs or weapons from the police. Eighth, appellant resumed moving his right hand in a furtive manner after Sergeant Tennis had instructed the minivan\u2019s occupants to place their hands on their laps. Ninth, appellant continued moving his right hand in a furtive manner despite yet another instruction from Sergeant Tennis to stop this behavior. Tenth, Sergeant Tennis then observed that appellant\u2019s right hand was sitting outside of the front passenger\u2019s side window\u2014suggesting perhaps that appellant was attempting to discard an object out the window. These accumulating factors, in their totality, provided a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot involving appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">On brief, Beasley refers to certain appellate opinions where denials of motions to suppress in the trial courts were reversed on appeal. However, what those cases have in common is that they involve one or some, <em>but not all, </em>of the <em>many </em>circumstances supporting reasonable, articulable suspicion that are present here. Accordingly, those cases do not control the analysis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">For example, unlike in <em>Riley v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 494, 412 S.E.2d 724 (1992), <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1100, 407 S.E.2d 49 (1991), and <em>Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 363, 398 S.E.2d 690 (1990), the facts in this case point to far more than a quick, furtive gesture in the presence of the police officer that gave the officer no more than a hunch of criminal activity. Here, unlike in those cases, Sergeant Tennis observed <em>many </em>furtive gestures\u2014including several by appellant himself even after the sergeant instructed him to keep his hands on his lap where they could be seen. Furthermore, based on his extensive experience, Sergeant Tennis also explained the significance of those furtive gestures in the trial court as suggestive of possession of illegal drugs, a concealed firearm, or both. <em>See Bandy v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 510, 518, 664 S.E.2d 519, 523 (2008) (\u201cCourts have often recognized that \u2018the connection between illegal drug operations and guns is a tight one.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jones v. Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>monwealth, </em>272 Va. 692, 701 n. 3, 636 S.E.2d 403, 407 n. 3 (2006))).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Appellant also relies on <em>Ewell v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 214, 491 S.E.2d 721 (1997), where the police lacked reasonable, articulable suspicion that the defendant was trespassing. However, the possibility that appellant had been trespassing on the grounds of the Lexington Square apartment complex, while certainly a factor among the totality of the circumstances present here, was not Sergeant Tennis\u2019s \u201cmain concern,\u201d according to the sergeant\u2019s testimony in the trial court. Instead, Sergeant Tennis testified that he was mainly concerned by the suspicious and furtive hand movements made by appellant and the other occupants of the minivan\u2014contrasting this case with <em>Ewell, </em>where the Virginia Supreme Court specifically held that \u201cnothing about Ewell\u2019s conduct was suspicious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 491 S.E.2d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Appellant\u2019s further reliance on <em>Asble v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 643, 653 S.E.2d 285 (2007), is also misplaced. In that case, Asble\u2019s vehicle was simply sitting on the shoulder of an interstate highway\u2019s entrance ramp. Unlike the situation here, none of Asble\u2019s actions gave rise to a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and \u201c[tjhe location was not a high crime area or an area known for illegal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 653 S.E.2d at 288. \u201c[W]hile a suspect\u2019s presence in a high crime area, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable particularized suspicion, it is a relevant contextual consideration in a <em>Terry </em>analysis.\u201d <em>Whitaker v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 268, 276, 687 S.E.2d 733, 737 (2010); see <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (\u201c[0]fficers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Here, the accumulation of many circumstances that are present in the record certainly gave Sergeant Tennis a reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant was involved in potential criminal activity, such as a drug transaction, the possession of a concealed weapon, or both. Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>detention of appellant was permissible under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\n<em>Seizure of the Small Bag Containing the Illegal Drugs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AfL\">During oral argument in this Court, appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the illegal drugs in the trial court was based <em>entirely </em>on his assertion that the investigatory detention of appellant violated the Fourth Amendment\u2014and, therefore, was also based on his argument that any evidence obtained from the investigatory stop was required to be suppressed as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we do not address any other issues potentially related to the seizure of the small bag containing the illegal drugs because consideration of such issues is barred under Rule 5A:18 due to his failure to raise them in the trial court, because appellant has not requested that this Court invoke any exception to Rule 5A:18, and because this Court will not invoke an exception to Rule 5A:18 <em>sua sponte. See Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>57 Va.App. 341, 347, 702 S.E.2d 260, 263 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">By the time that appellant finally actually submitted to Sergeant Tennis\u2019s show of authority\u2014and, therefore, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>seized for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment\u2014several circumstances within the sergeant\u2019s knowledge had accumulated. They all contributed to providing a reasonable police officer with reasonable, articulable suspicion that appellant was connected with criminal activity that was afoot. Thus, the investigatory detention of appellant did not violate the Fourth Amendment, and the trial court did not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the illegal drugs that were obtained during that investigatory detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of heroin with intent to distribute (third or subsequent offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\">. \"On appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we consider the evidence adduced at both the suppression hearing and the trial, <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987), and we view it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, as the party that prevailed below. <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991).\u201d <em>Blevins v.

Lawson, the driver of the minivan, briefly exited the minivan before Sergeant Tennis directed him back inside the vehicle. We offer no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>opinion whether <em>Lawson </em>was seized at that point, and appellant never argued below that Lawson\u2019s submission to this order somehow resulted in <em>all </em>the occupants of the minivan being seized. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. This was not a traffic stop, as the minivan was legally parked at the time of the encounter. Furthermore, at the point when Lawson re-entered the minivan, Sergeant Tennis had not yet encountered appellant, who was still inside the minivan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">. All three of the minivan\u2019s occupants provided identification or identifying information upon Sergeant Tennis\u2019s request. However, case law makes clear that the Fourth Amendment \"is not implicated when a person voluntarily responds to a police request to produce identification\u201d provided that \"the police do not convey, by word or deed,\u201d that compliance is mandatory. <em>Montague v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 532, 538, 684 S.E.2d 583, 587 (2009). The United States Supreme Court has explained, \"While most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact that people do so, and do so without being told they are free not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of the response.\u201d <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service v.

Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 491, 545 S.E.2d 541, 546 (2001), the Virginia Supreme Court reiterated that \u2018\u2018[a] seizure does not occur in the absence of physical force used by a law enforcement officer or a defendant\u2019s submission to an officer\u2019s assertion of authority.\u201d Similarly, this Court has explained, \"[T]here is a condition precedent to a seizure: The individual must submit to the officer\u2019s force or authority.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>52 Va.App. 548, 557, 665 S.E.2d 261, 265 (2008); <em>see also Brown v.

Sergeant Tennis testified that he was especially familiar with the Lexington Park area because he also provided security services for the Lexington Square apartment complex during his off-duty hours. Responding to the trial court's own questions during the suppression hearing, Sergeant Tennis confirmed to the trial court that the person he saw walking in the Lexington Square parking lot at that very late hour \"would have been trespassing\u201d on the apartment complex's property unless he lived there (or otherwise was lawfully on that property). Sergeant Tennis testified that he did not know whether or not this person lived at the apartment complex, adding \"[tjhat\u2019s kind of what my investigation was\u201d at that point. (Sergeant Tennis also testified that trespassing was not his \"main concern\u201d after he observed all of the furtive movements that appellant (and the other occupants of the vehicle) made moments later, but the suspicion of trespassing was still a factor within the sergeant's consideration as the situation here was evolving.) The fact that Sergeant Tennis noticed that a person who was wearing the same clothing as the individual who was possibly trespassing was then sitting in the minivan with its two occupants further raised the sergeant\u2019s suspicions, given the very late hour of 3:30 a.m. and the sergeant\u2019s familiarity with the area as a high-crime area noted for drug transactions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\">. Although appellant on appeal has not specifically challenged the legality of the attempted pat-down search for weapons, we note that a reasonable suspicion that appellant possessed a concealed weapon <em>\"ipso facto </em>rendered [appellant] potentially armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>52 Va.App. at 560-61, 665 S.E.2d at 267; <em>see Andrews v.

Appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged in oral argument that appellant never asserted in the trial court that Sergeant Tennis lacked probable cause to seize the small bag containing the illegal drugs\u2014which Sergeant Tennis first observed on the ground, partially covered by appellant's foot, when appellant was not complying with the procedures for the officer\u2019s pat-down search of him for weapons and was actively attempting to prevent Sergeant Tennis from moving his foot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
