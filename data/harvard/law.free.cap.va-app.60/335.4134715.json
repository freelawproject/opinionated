Crews (\u201cclaimant\u201d), the sole dependent of James E. Crews (\u201cdecedent\u201d), who died in a work-related accident. Insurer asserts the commission erred in awarding claimant compensation calculated at the minimum weekly wage rate of $223.75, arguing there was no evidence before the commission that decedent earned any wages in the fifty-two weeks preceding his death. Claimant assigns cross-error to the commission\u2019s decision, contending that the commission erred by not calculating decedent\u2019s average weekly wage based on the following testimony: (i) that decedent worked seventy to eighty hours per week; (ii) that decedent withdrew money each week from his business, a sole proprietorship, to pay for personal and other expenses; and (iii) that claimant paid wages to other employees to perform some of decedent\u2019s work after he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">\u2018We view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to [claimant], the prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 255, 656 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Evidence presented to the deputy commissioner proved that decedent, a self-employed individual, was the sole proprietor for Crews Home Sales, a business engaged in the sale and delivery of prefabricated homes. On July 23, 2009, decedent died in a motor vehicle accident while transporting a prefabricated home to West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Claimant, decedent\u2019s widow, filed a claim for compensation benefits and funeral expenses on August 5, 2009. At the hearing before the deputy commissioner on August 20, 2010, the parties agreed that the death presumption<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> applied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that claimant was decedent\u2019s sole dependent, that the accident occurred as described in the state trooper\u2019s accident report and deposition testimony, that decedent\u2019s death occurred in the course of his employment, and that decedent\u2019s death arose out of his employment, subject to insurer\u2019s defense of willful misconduct.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties disputed whether decedent had an average weekly wage and the amount of any average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Claimant worked as a bookkeeper and general manager for decedent\u2019s sole proprietorship. She testified that, because decedent was a sole proprietor and did not collect a salary, she and decedent established a \u201cdraw account\u201d from which decedent paid himself each week. She testified that decedent withdrew monies each week from that account, from the time he bought the business in 1991 until his death in 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Claimant explained that the sole proprietorship generated annual profits from 1991 to 2007 and that, during that time, decedent\u2019s draws from the business account constituted his wage earnings. From 2007 until his death in 2009, however, the sole proprietorship operated at a loss.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During that time, any money decedent withdrew from the draw account, either for himself or for personal and family expenses, was treated as a loan from the business. Claimant conceded that the Crews-es\u2019 2008 joint federal income tax return did not reflect any wages for decedent because his weekly draws merely eonsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>tuted loans from the sole proprietorship. Accordingly, claimant confirmed, there was no earned income to report on the tax return as wages. Claimant also conceded that the 2008 and 2009 joint federal income tax returns indicated that the sole proprietorship operated at a loss and that it had continued to operate at a loss after decedent\u2019s death.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Leslie Robson, a forensic accountant, testified for insurer. He stated that he reviewed Schedule C of the Crewses\u2019 2008 and 2009 joint federal income tax returns, which reflected the income and expenses for the sole proprietorship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He told the deputy commissioner that he analyzed that information on both a \u201cnet income or loss level\u201d and on a \u201ccash flow level.\u201d He testified that, based on a net income or loss analysis, the sole proprietorship generated a net loss during 2008 and 2009 and, because it operated at a net loss, decedent did not collect any wages during that period. He stated that the business generated an $8,146 operating cash flow deficit for 2008 and a $21,148 cash flow deficit for 2009, based on an operating cash flow analysis. He testified that analysis reflected revenues, including depreciation, minus cash expenses paid. Based on these cash flow deficits, Robson again concluded that the sole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>proprietorship generated no profits during those periods and that decedent did not receive any wages from employment. Robson confirmed on cross-examination that decedent received no wages from employment during the relevant time frame, regardless of which approach Robson used to calculate the sole proprietorship\u2019s finances.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Robson\u2019s report dated August 6, 2010 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">Based upon our analysis, we found no evidence supporting the wages represented on [decedent\u2019s] wage worksheets. Instead, we found that the records supported no wages at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">As a self-employed individual, [decedent\u2019s] wage consisted of the profit or cash flow he generated from his efforts operating Crews Home Sales &amp; Transport. Based on our analysis of [decedent\u2019s] income 2008 and 2009 income tax returns, his business did not generate any profits or positive cash flow in either year. To the contrary, during 2008 the business generated a $21,642 net loss and $8,146 of negative cash flow (Schedule 2). The 2008 weekly averages were a $416 weekly net loss and $157 of weekly negative cash flow (Schedule 1). During the period January 1 [through] July 23, 2009 the business generated a $22,805 net loss and $21,148 of negative cash flow. The January through July 2009 weekly averages were a $727 weekly net loss and $784 weekly negative cash flow. <em>The combined weekly averages for January 1, 2008 through July 23, 2009 were a $361 net loss and $54-8 of negative cashflow </em>(Schedule 1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">The deputy commissioner found that the evidence presented failed to prove that decedent earned any wages from his employment during the fifty-two-week period prior to his death. The deputy commissioner explained that the federal income tax records for decedent\u2019s business showed that it was operating at a loss over one year prior to his death and that the weekly draws decedent paid to himself were taken \u201cwith the hope that his business would earn enough to allow him to draw a wage.\u201d He concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the records failed to establish that his business earned income in the year prior to his death <em>in order to provide a wage </em>for [decedent]. Accordingly, we find the evidence fails to establish any loss of income as the result of [decedent\u2019s] death and therefore the claim for compensation benefits pursuant to [Code] \u00a7 65.2-512(A) is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Claimant appealed the deputy commissioner\u2019s denial of her benefits claim to the full commission. On appeal, the commission reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s ruling. The commission agreed with the deputy commissioner that the weekly draws from the business did not constitute wages or earnings because, \u201cto the extent that there was insufficient money to cover the draws, the draws were treated as loans.\u201d The full commission also concluded that \u201cthe money received in draws was taken, not based upon existing profits from the business, but instead upon the expectation, or hope,\u201d never realized in this case, \u201cthat there would be sufficient profits to cover the draws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The commission nonetheless concluded that \u201cthe facts of this case bring it within the provisions of [Code] [\u00a7 ] 65.2-101 (l.b.),\u201d which provides that the commission, in \u201cexceptional\u201d cases, may resort to an alternative method of calculating the average weekly wage an employee would earn \u201c \u2018were it not for [his] injury.\u2019 \u201d Notwithstanding its determination that decedent\u2019s weekly draws did not constitute wage earnings, the commission concluded \u201c[i]t would be inherently unfair and inconsistent with the spirit of the [Act] ... to find that [claimant] is not entitled to any indemnity benefits simply because the family business had no profit as a result of economic conditions outside of their control.\u201d The commission then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">However, in light of the <em>complete absence of evidence </em>of what a similar employee would have earned in wages, we must limit [decedent\u2019s] earnings to $6.55, the minimum hourly wage at the time of his accident, multiplied by a 40-hour work week, which provides an average weekly wage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>$262, resulting in a compensation rate of $223.75, the minimum compensation rate at the time of the accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aec\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The commission ordered insurer to pay compensation to claimant at the minimum weekly rate of $223.75 for a period of 500 weeks beginning July 23, 2009 and continuing, or until circumstances warranted otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Dissenting, Commissioner Williams \u201cagree[d] that [Code] [\u00a7 ] 65.2-101(l.b.) provides significant discretion in determining the average weekly wage,\u201d but concluded that \u201cinherent in this provision is the requirement that the employee actually be earning some wages or income during the [fifty-two] weeks before the accident.... It does not allow the [c]ommission to establish an average weekly wage when the employee was not earning wages during the relevant period.\u201d Commissioner Williams stated that, moreover, \u201cin using the \u2018exceptional reasons\u2019 method, the [c]ommission is required to use the method which \u201cwill most nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury.\u2019 \u201d Commissioner Williams concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">Here, there is simply no evidence that the weekly amount [decedent] would have earned but for the accident is equal to [forty] hours at the minimum hourly wage. This is a figure simply picked out of the air without regard to the evidence before us. Since [decedent] was a sole proprietor, there was no guarantee that he would receive any wages or income, his earnings being totally dependent upon the profitability of his business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A0t\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Insurer seeks reversal of the commission\u2019s decision awarding claimant compensation benefits. It argues the commission erred by imputing to decedent an average weekly wage based on the federal minimum hourly wage in effect at the time of his accident. Insurer asserts that the evidence presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>proved decedent had no wage earnings during the covered period and that the commission\u2019s application of Code \u00a7 65.2-lOl(l.b), under the circumstances presented on this record, was error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">In reviewing the commission\u2019s decision, we are guided by well-settled principles. \u201cIt is fundamental that a finding of fact made by the commission is conclusive and binding upon this [CJourt on review.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Powell, 2 </em>Va.App. 712, 714, 347 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1986). <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-706. \u201c[T]hat contrary evidence may be in the record is of no consequence <em>if there is credible evidence to support the [cjommission\u2019s findings.\u201d Russell Loungewear v. Gray, </em>2 Va.App. 90, 95, 341 S.E.2d 824, 826 (1986).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><em>Sneed v. Morengo, Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 199, 204-05, 450 S.E.2d 167, 170-71 (1994) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u201cUnder the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, awards of compensation benefits are based upon the average weekly wage.\u201d <em>Dinwiddie Co. School Board v. Cole, </em>258 Va. 430, 432, 520 S.E.2d 650, 651 (1999). The determination of an employee\u2019s \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d constitutes a \u201cquestion of fact to be determined by the [c]ommission which, if based on credible evidence, will not be disturbed on appeal.\u201d <em>Pilot Freight Carriers, Inc. v. Reeves, </em>1 Va.App. 435, 441, 339 S.E.2d 570, 573 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Code \u00a7 65.2-101 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cAverage weekly wage\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">l.a. The earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury during the period of [fifty-two] weeks immediately preceding the date of the injury, divided by [fifty-two]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">b. When for exceptional reasons the foregoing would be unfair either to the employer or employee, such other method of computing average weekly wages may be resorted to <em>as will most nearly approximate the amount which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>the injured employee would he earning were it not for the injury.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Here, pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l.b), the commission chose to use \u201csuch other method of computing average weekly wages\u201d to \u201cmost nearly approximate the amount which [decedent] would be earning were it not for [his] [death].\u201d It found \u201c[i]t would be inherently unfair ... to find that [claimant] is not entitled to any indemnity benefits simply because the family business had no profit\u201d for several years, including the fifty-two weeks preceding decedent\u2019s death. However, the record on appeal lacks <em>any evidence </em>to support the commission\u2019s finding that, were it not for his death, decedent, a sole proprietor, \u201cwould be earning\u201d the federal minimum wage in effect at the time of his death, multiplied by a forty-hour work week. Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l.b). Neither insurer nor claimant produced any evidence that decedent paid himself the federal minimum wage in effect during the fifty-two weeks preceding his death, or that he would have earned the federal minimum wage in the future \u201cwere it not for [his] [death].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, claimant testified that decedent paid himself fluctuating amounts from the draw account in the fifty-two weeks preceding his death and that the family business had continued to operate at a loss after decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The commission\u2019s authority under Code \u00a7 65.2-lOl(l.b) to use \u201csuch other method of computing average weekly wages\u201d to \u201cmost nearly approximate the amount which the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury\u201d does not permit it to award compensation that is not supported by some credible evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Georgia Pac. Corp. v. Dancy, </em>17 Va.App. 128, 135, 435 S.E.2d 898, 902 (1993) (\u201cFactual findings of the commission will not be dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>turbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or without credible evidence to support them.\u201d). Accordingly, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision awarding claimant compensation benefits at the weekly rate of $223.75 for a period of 500 weeks beginning July 23, 2009 and continuing, or until circumstances warranted otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">In claimant\u2019s assignments of cross-error, she contends the commission erred by not calculating decedent\u2019s average weekly wage based on the following testimony: (i) that decedent worked seventy to eighty hours per week; (ii) that decedent withdrew money each week from his business, a sole proprietorship, to pay for personal and other expenses; and (iii) that claimant paid wages to other employees to perform some of decedent\u2019s work after he died.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Claimant asserts that her testimony that decedent worked seventy to eighty hours per week was uncontroverted. She thereby asserts that the commission erred by calculating decedent\u2019s average weekly wage by multiplying the federal minimum hourly wage, in effect at the time of his death, by a forty-hour work week. However, because we hold that the commission erred by calculating decedent\u2019s average weekly wage based on the minimum hourly wage, when the record was devoid of any evidence that decedent paid himself that amount or would have earned that amount were it not for his death, the number of hours decedent worked each week is irrelevant. Accordingly, we need not address whether the commission erred in using a forty-hour work week, rather than a seventy or eighty-hour work week, to calculate decedent\u2019s average weekly wage under Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l.b).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">Claimant also asserts that the commission erred in calculating decedent\u2019s average weekly wage based on the federal minimum wage in effect at the time of his death, rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the amount he withdrew from the sole proprietorship\u2019s draw account in the fifty-two weeks preceding his death. Claimant asserts that, as a matter of law, decedent\u2019s weekly withdrawals constituted his \u201cwages\u201d and reflected what he \u201cwould be earning were it not for [his] [death]\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-lOl(l.b).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">We review questions of law <em>de novo, Wal-Mart v. Poorman, </em>60 Va.App. 84, 90, 724 S.E.2d 212, 215 (2012), \u201cwithout deference to the decision under review,\u201d <em>Thorpe v. Clary, </em>57 Va.App. 617, 628, 704 S.E.2d 611, 613 (2011), <em>aff'd sub nom. Thorpe v. Ted Bowling Constr., </em>238 Va. 808, 724 S.E.2d 728 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The commission rejected claimant\u2019s assertion that decedent\u2019s weekly draws (i) constituted wages in the fifty-two weeks preceding his death and (ii) reflected what he would be earning were it not for his death because, \u201cto the extent that there was insufficient money to cover [his] draws, the draws were treated as <em>loans </em>\u201d to decedent, not wage earnings. (Emphasis added). Relying on its previous unpublished decision in <em>Shaat v. Atlast Bus. Group, LLC, </em>No. 227-81-80 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Oct. 3, 2007), the commission concluded that \u201cthe money received in draws was taken, not based upon existing profits from the business, but instead upon the expectation, or hope,\u201d never realized in decedent\u2019s case, \u201cthat there would be sufficient profits to cover the draws.\u201d In <em>Shaat, </em>the commission concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">[t]he evidence is clear that the claimant did not earn $2500 per week even though he received payments in that amount____The guaranteed draw of $2500 does not most closely approximate the claimant\u2019s economic loss. It is a fictional wage, given to the claimant against the hope that the partnership would earn enough to realize that wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Similarly, the commission here found that decedent\u2019s weekly draws were not earnings, and at most constituted \u201ca \u2018fictional wage.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>We find no error in the commission\u2019s determination that decedent\u2019s weekly withdrawals from the draw account did not constitute wages under Code \u00a7 65.2-101. This Court has previously held that \u201cwages\u201d is a term applied to compensation paid to an employee as consideration for work, which constitutes a real economic gain for the employee. <em>Southwest Architectural Products v. Smith, </em>4 Va.App. 474, 480, 358 S.E.2d 745, 748 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Claimant testified that decedent\u2019s withdrawals from the draw account in the fifty-two weeks preceding his death constituted loans. She conceded that decedent reported no wage earnings on their 2008 joint federal income tax return precisely because his withdrawals were loans. Leslie Robson, forensic accountant, confirmed that the sole proprietorship operated at a net loss each week in the fifty-two weeks preceding decedent\u2019s death and that decedent collected \u201cno wages at all.\u201d Under the circumstances present on this record, where decedent\u2019s weekly income consisted solely of borrowed funds, we cannot say such income constituted \u201cearnings\u201d for purposes of calculating his average weekly wage under Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l.b). <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 479, 358 S.E.2d at 748 (only \u201callowances which constitute an economic gain to the employee, as opposed to mere reimbursement for expenses, are included as part of the employee\u2019s wage\u201d). Accordingly, the commission did not err in declining to calculate decedent\u2019s average weekly wage based on the amount of his weekly draws.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">(hi)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Finally, claimant asserts that the commission erred in not considering the salary of an employee she hired to perform some of decedent\u2019s job duties as a basis for calculating decedent\u2019s weekly wage. The Court will not consider claimant\u2019s third assignment of cross-error because of claimant\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 5A:21.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Here, claimant produced no evidence that decedent, a sole proprietor, had any wage earnings or its equivalent in the fifty-two weeks preceding his death, or that he would have earned any wages in the future \u201cwere it not for [his] [death].\u201d Code \u00a7 65.2-101(l.b).
