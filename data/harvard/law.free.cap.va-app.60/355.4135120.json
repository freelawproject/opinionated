Spence assigns the following errors to the judgment of the trial court: (1) the trial court abused its discretion in denying Spence\u2019s motion for a mistrial after a particular statement by one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses; (2) the trial court erred in denying Spence\u2019s motions to strike and upholding his convictions in accordance with the verdicts of the jury, as the testimony and evidence at trial failed to prove that Spence was the perpetrator of the crimes in question; and (3) the trial court erred in denying the public defender\u2019s motion to withdraw and to relieve the entire Public Defender\u2019s Office from representing Spence, as Spence made a serious threat against a senior assistant public defender that should have been imputed to the entire office. For the reasons set forth below, we disagree with Spence\u2019s arguments and therefore affirm his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u201cOn appeal, Ve review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">On March 2, 2010, a man wearing a mask entered a Super-Mart in Chesapeake, pointed a gun at the store owner and the two employees who were present at the time, and told them to put their hands up. One of the employees ran to a back room, but the robber went and brought him back into the main room at gunpoint. The other employee gave the robber money out of both cash registers, in the approximate amount of $4,100 to $4,200. The surveillance camera photographs introduced into evidence show the robber wearing a dark, hooded jacket or sweatshirt of some type, with a tag or label on the lower left front side, as well as distinctively marked gloves. The photographs also show the robber pointing a dark handgun in various directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">On the evening of March 11, 2010, the police received a call from the owner of the SuperMart regarding a suspicious car parked near his store.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chesapeake Police Officer Timothy L. Donahue responded<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and saw Spence in the vicinity of the SuperMart, in front of a nearby apartment complex between two large fern trees. When Officer Donahue first encountered Spence, Spence was wearing a dark jacket, zipped up, with a knit cap on his head and the hood of his jacket pulled over his head. The jacket also had a tag or label on the lower left front side. Officer Donahue asked Spence how he got where he was, and Spence pointed to his car nearby. The car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>had obviously been parked there before it had started raining. After leaving Spence with Officer Bruce E. Ilapit by Spence\u2019s car, Officer Donahue walked back over to the trees in front of the apartment and found a pair of gloves and a handgun behind one of the trees. Officer Ilapit also subsequently went and saw the gloves and gun. Although Officer Ilapit acknowledged that he did not know how long the gloves and gun had been there, he did point out that they were dry and that it was raining outside. A third officer subsequently placed a nearby chair over the area where the gloves and gun were lying, in an effort to protect them, since he saw that it was drizzling rain at the time and that there was \u201ca lot of water run-off coming off the roof [of the apartment building].\u201d The police photographs show that the gloves and gun were lying on the ground in a haphazard fashion, as if someone had quickly or carelessly tossed them there.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Prior to trial, the senior assistant public defender who had been appointed to represent Spence moved to withdraw as counsel for Spence, and the trial court granted this motion, due to some type of threat that Spence had apparently made to this attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The senior assistant public defender asked that the entire Chesapeake Public Defender\u2019s Office be relieved from representing Spence, and the trial court scheduled another hearing to have the public defender appear personally and argue why another attorney in her office could not represent Spence. After hearing argument from the public defender, the trial court took the matter under advisement. Two weeks later, the trial court issued a letter to counsel in which it re-appointed the Chesapeake Public Defender\u2019s Office for the public defender to assign the case to a different attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">At trial, the store owner testified that he could identify the robber by his height and voice, and he stated that Spence\u2019s height was \u201cabout the same\u201d as the height of the robber. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>owner also testified that the robber\u2019s eyes were not covered by the mask and that the robber was African-American. Furthermore, the DNA expert testified that based on her analysis of the gloves, Spence \u201ccould not be eliminated as a contributor to the DNA mixture profile developed from the gloves.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Significantly, the gloves had the same color and distinctive markings as the gloves worn by the robber. Likewise, the handgun was of a similar color and appearance to the handgun used by the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the store owner, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">[Defense Counsel:] So you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s this man wearing those gloves in that picture?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-7\">[Witness:] Like I said, I could identify him by his height and his voice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">[Defense Counsel:] But you don\u2019t know if it was this man wearing those gloves on that day, March 2, 2010, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">[Witness:] Well, when they caught him the second time, he had the gloves on already.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">After this statement, defense counsel moved for a mistrial outside the presence of the jury, arguing that the store owner\u2019s statement indicated to the jury that Spence had committed a second offense. During the discussion accompanying this motion, the trial court proposed the idea of instructing the jury to disregard the store owner\u2019s statement. Defense counsel expressed his appreciation for the trial court\u2019s \u201cwillingness to caution the jury,\u201d yet reiterated his motion for a mistrial. The trial court denied his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Subsequently, after conversing with the witness and conferring further with counsel, the trial court decided to permit counsel for the Commonwealth \u201cto make further inquiry to allow [the store owner] to clarify his testimony.\u201d Once the jury returned, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>[Commonwealth:] [W]hen you talked about the second time, were you talking about a second time when you thought you saw the guy that robbed this store?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">[Witness:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\">[Commonwealth:] So the first time, March 2, the day of the robbery, the second time about a week or so later?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AcO\">[Witness:] A week later. Maybe a little bit les [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">[Commonwealth:] Did you call the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">[Witness:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">[Commonwealth:] And did you see the police come?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQC\">[Witness:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-9\">[Commonwealth:] Did you see the police take someone into custody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-10\">[Witness:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">The store owner also clarified that he did not actually see the person the police took into custody on March 11, acknowledging that \u201c[h]e was far away.\u201d The trial court did not give the jury any special instruction regarding the store owner\u2019s earlier statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">Later in the trial, defense counsel renewed his motion for a mistrial and asked the trial court \u201cto consider again a cautionary instruction to the jury.\u201d The judge acknowledged, \u201cI initially was inclined to offer a cautionary instruction to the jury.\u201d However, the judge proceeded to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-13\">After hearing additional examination of [the store owner], I felt that I would draw attention to something that did not deserve attention to be drawn to and would, perhaps, create a greater problem than it cured. I don\u2019t think there has been any indication to this jury that there was another offense that was committed, but rather, a second day that [the store owner] saw Mr. Spence, or in his mind saw Mr. Spence a second time, not the date of a second robbery or second criminal action by Mr. Spence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">Accordingly, the trial court concluded that neither a mistrial nor a cautionary instruction was appropriate. The judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>I believe that a cautionary instruction would draw attention to something that doesn\u2019t deserve attention being drawn to and would be to the detriment, quite frankly, of Mr. Spence because it might imply to the jury that there\u2019s something they need to think about, was there a prior offense, was there another crime that was committed by this defendant, and thereby prejudice this jury against Mr. Spence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Spence was convicted of two counts of robbery, one count of abduction, three counts of the use or display of a firearm in the commission of a felony, and one count of unlawfully wearing a mask in public. He was sentenced to a total of seventy-six years imprisonment with eleven years suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\n<em>A. Motion for Mistrial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">Spence first argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The standard for reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial is well established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-9\">\u201cThe decision whether to grant a motion for mistrial lies within a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. When a motion for mistrial is made, based upon an allegedly prejudicial event, the trial court must make an initial factual determination, in the light of all the circumstances of the case, whether the defendant\u2019s rights are so indelibly prejudiced as to necessitate a new trial. Unless we can say that the trial court\u2019s determination was wrong as a matter of law, we will not disturb its judgment on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-10\"><em>Blanton v. Commonwealth, </em>280 Va. 447, 455, 699 S.E.2d 279, 284 (2010) (quoting <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>266 Va. 81, 102, 580 S.E.2d 834, 846 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">During defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the store owner, the owner stated that \u201cwhen they caught him the second time, he had the gloves on already.\u201d Spence contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>that this statement constituted inadmissible evidence of a separate crime. According to Spence, this statement suggested to the jury that Spence had committed and was caught for a second robbery. However, as the trial court noted, the store owner\u2019s statement about Spence being caught \u201cthe second time\u201d did not necessarily imply that Spence had committed another crime. After conversing with the witness outside the presence of the jury and conferring with counsel, the trial court decided to permit counsel for the Commonwealth to ask the store owner follow-up questions in the presence of the jury to clarify his testimony. Accordingly, the prosecutor asked the owner, \u201c[Wjhen you talked about the second time, were you talking about a second time when you thought you saw the guy that robbed this store?\u201d The owner responded, \u201cYes.\u201d The prosecutor asked, \u201cSo the first time, March 2, the day of the robbery, the second time about a week or so later?\u201d The store owner replied, \u201cA week later. Maybe a little bit les [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">This clarification of the store owner\u2019s testimony was sufficient to remove any ambiguity in his earlier testimony that the jury might conceivably have interpreted as referring to criminal conduct on another occasion. In light of this clarification, we certainly cannot say that the trial court erred as a matter of law in failing to find that Spence\u2019s rights were \u201c \u2018so indelibly prejudiced as to necessitate a new trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Blanton, </em>280 Va. at 455, 699 S.E.2d at 284 (quoting <em>Green, </em>266 Va. at 102, 580 S.E.2d at 846). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Spence\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Additionally, Spence argues that the trial court erred in failing to give a cautionary instruction to the jury to disregard the store owner\u2019s statement. \u201cThe decision whether to give a cautionary instruction is a matter lying within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record shows an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 465, 470 S.E.2d 114, 129 (1996) (citing <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 598, 605, 847 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1986)); <em>see also Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 267, 389 S.E.2d 871, 884 (1990) (holding that \u201cthe trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in denying [a] motion for mistrial or in failing to instruct the jury to disregard [an improper statement by the prosecutor during closing argument]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defense counsel\u2019s request for a cautionary instruction. Before talking with the store owner, the trial court itself had proposed the idea of instructing the jury to disregard the owner\u2019s statement. Defense counsel expressed his appreciation for the trial court\u2019s \u201cwillingness to caution the jury.\u201d However, after interacting with the witness and conferring further with counsel, the trial court decided to permit counsel for the Commonwealth \u201cto make further inquiry to allow [the store owner] to clarify his testimony.\u201d When defense counsel brought up the issue of a cautionary instruction again later in the trial, the judge explained that in light of the follow-up testimony from the store owner, he felt that a cautionary instruction to the jury regarding the store owner\u2019s earlier statement would perhaps engender more prejudice than it would prevent. The trial court did not believe that the store owner\u2019s testimony indicated to the jury \u201cthat there was another offense that was committed, but rather, a second day that [the owner] saw Mr. Spence, or in his mind saw Mr. Spence a second time, not the date of a second robbery or second criminal action by Mr. Spence.\u201d Because the store owner\u2019s testimony did not clearly communicate to the jury the idea that Spence had committed other criminal acts, the trial court was within its discretion when it decided not to draw further attention to the owner\u2019s particular statement and thereby risk creating unnecessary prejudice against Spence.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>B. Motions To Strike</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Spence next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motions to strike and upholding his convictions in accordance with the verdicts of the jury. Spence contends that none of the witnesses identified him as the perpetrator of the robbery, as having been in possession of a firearm, or as having worn a mask, and he points out that the DNA testing indicated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>presence of more than one person\u2019s DNA on the gloves worn by the robber. We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Spence\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u201c When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, [this] Court will affirm the judgment unless the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mayfield v. Commonwealth, </em>59 Va.App. 839, 850, 722 S.E.2d 689, 695 (2012) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Bolden v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 144, 148, 654 S.E.2d 584, 586 (2008)). In our review, we have \u201ca duty to examine all the evidence that tends to support the conviction.\u201d <em>Bolden, </em>275 Va. at 147, 654 S.E.2d at 586. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e \u2018must discard all evidence of the accused that conflicts with that of the Commonwealth and regard as true all credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences reasonably deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holcomb v. Commonwealth, </em>58 Va.App. 339, 346, 709 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2011) (quoting <em>Lea v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 300, 303, 429 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Moreover, \u201c[a]n appellate court does not \u2018ask itself whether <em>it </em>believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d <em>Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>278 Va. 190, 193, 677 S.E.2d 280, 282 (2009) (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). \u201cRather, the relevant question is whether <em>\u2018any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). \u201c \u2018This familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 178, 185, 692 S.E.2d 271, 274 (2010) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">It is also well established that \u201c[c]ircumstantial evidence, if convincing, is entitled to the same weight as direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>testimony.\u201d <em>Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>276 Va. 569, 573, 667 S.E.2d 763, 765 (2008); <em>accord Riner v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 296, 303, 601 S.E.2d 555, 558 (2004). Furthermore, \u201c \u2018[w]hile no single piece of evidence may be sufficient, the combined force of many concurrent and related circumstances, each insufficient in itself, may lead a reasonable mind irresistibly to a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dowden v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 459, 470, 536 S.E.2d 437, 443 (2000) (quoting <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 273, 257 S.E.2d 808, 818 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to consider the evidence in this case. Although no witness was able to identify Spence by facial recognition, as the robber was wearing a mask during the robbery, the surveillance camera photographs show the robber wearing a dark, hooded jacket or sweatshirt of some type, with a tag or label on the lower left front side, as well as distinctively marked gloves. The photographs also show the robber pointing a dark handgun in various directions. The store owner testified that he could identify the robber by his height and voice, and he stated that Spence\u2019s height was \u201cabout the same\u201d as the height of the robber. He also testified that the robber\u2019s eyes were not covered by the mask and that the robber was African-American, as is Spence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">When Officer Donahue saw Spence in the vicinity of the SuperMart nine days after the robbery, Spence was in front of a nearby apartment complex between two large fern trees. When Officer Donahue first encountered Spence, Spence was wearing a dark jacket, zipped up, with a knit cap on his head and the hood of his jacket pulled over his head. The jacket also had a tag or label on the lower left front side. Behind one of the two trees in front of the apartment complex, Officer Donahue discovered a pair of gloves and a handgun lying on the ground in a haphazard fashion, as if someone had quickly or carelessly tossed them there. Furthermore, the fact that the gloves and gun were dry even though it was raining outside indicates that they had been tossed there very recently. Spence\u2019s DNA profile was consistent with that found on the gloves. Significantly, the gloves had the same color and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>distinctive markings as the gloves worn by the robber. Likewise, the handgun was of a similar color and appearance to the handgun used by the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">In light of this evidence, we cannot say that the conclusion of the jury that Spence was the person who robbed the SuperMart on March 2, 2010 was plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. \u201c \u2018[Giving] full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts,\u2019 \u201d <em>Brown, </em>56 Va.App. at 185, 692 S.E.2d at 274 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>448 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789), we conclude that a \u201c \u2018rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,\u2019 \u201d <em>Williams, </em>278 Va. at 193, 677 S.E.2d at 282 (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789). Thus, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Spence\u2019s motions to strike and upholding his convictions in accordance with the verdicts of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\n<em>C. Motion To Withdraw</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Finally, Spence argues that the trial court erred in denying the public defender\u2019s motion to withdraw and to relieve the entire Public Defender\u2019s Office from representing Spence. Spence contends that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because of a conflict of interest that he contends applied to every attorney in the Public Defender\u2019s Office.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u201cMotions for counsel to be permitted to withdraw ... are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 460, 473, 357 S.E.2d 500, 508 (1987). The Sixth Amendment to the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Constitution provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. As the United States Supreme Court has recognized, \u201c\u2018the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 686, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (quoting <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n. 14, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449 n. 14, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970)). Furthermore, the Court has explained that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are violated by \u201can actual conflict of interest [that] adversely affect[s] his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1719, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980); <em>see also Mickens v. Taylor, </em>535 U.S. 162, 172 n. 5, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 1244 n. 5, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002) (\u201cAn \u2018actual conflict,\u2019 for Sixth Amendment purposes, is a conflict of interest that adversely affects counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d). In <em>Mickens, </em>the Supreme Court expressly rejected the argument that a defendant \u201cneed only show that his lawyer was subject to a conflict of interest, and need not show that the conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d 535 U.S. at 170, 122 S.Ct. at 1243. Instead, the Court held that \u201c \u2018an actual conflict of interest\u2019 mean[s] precisely a conflict <em>that affected counsel\u2019s </em>performance\u2014as opposed to a mere theoretical division of loyalties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171, 122 S.Ct. at 1243 (emphasis in original). In sum, \u201cthe <em>Sullivan </em>standard ... requires proof of effect upon representation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173, 122 S.Ct. at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">In light of the foregoing principles, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the public defender\u2019s request to relieve the entire Public Defender\u2019s Office from representing Spence. There was no evidence presented to the trial court at the pretrial hearing that demonstrated something beyond a mere theoretical concern that another attorney\u2019s performance <em>might </em>be affected by his knowledge of Spence\u2019s threat to his previous attorney.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Amendment did not require the trial court to relieve the entire Public Defender\u2019s Office from representing Spence, and the trial court was fully within its discretion to deny the public defender\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We note that we need not decide whether the conflict between Spence and his original attorney was a conflict of interest that should have been imputed to the entire Public Defender\u2019s Office under Virginia Rule of Professional Conduct 1.10.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court has pointed out, the ethical standards a particular state chooses to adopt do not constitute the standard for the Sixth Amendment guarantee of effective assistance of counsel. <em>Nix v. Whiteside, </em>475 U.S. 157, 165, 106 S.Ct. 988, 993, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986). Rather, \u201cthe Sixth Amendment inquiry is into whether the attorney\u2019s conduct was \u2018reasonably effective,\u2019 \u201d and \u201c[ujnder the <em>Strickland </em>standard, breach of an ethical standard does not necessarily make out a denial of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the Court warned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">When examining attorney conduct, a court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct and thereby intrude into the state\u2019s proper authority to define and apply the standards of professional conduct applicable to those it admits to practice in its courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\"><em>Id. </em>Essentially then, an \u201cactual conflict of interest\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment is not to be confused with the mere existence of a \u201cconflict of interest\u201d as defined by a particular jurisdiction\u2019s set of ethical rules. Therefore, we need not consider the question of whether the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>properly understood and applied the Rules of Professional Conduct in this particular instance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Spence argues that \u201cthe trial court should have conducted an inquiry into the extent and effect of the [alleged] conflict of interest.\u201d In certain circumstances, a trial court is obligated to inquire into a situation where a conflict of interest may be present. <em>See Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 569, 573, 400 S.E.2d 540, 543 (1991) (\u201c \u2018[I]f the possibility of a conflict of interest is apparent, a trial court has a duty to conduct further inquiry to determine if an actual conflict exists.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Dowell v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 555, 559, 351 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1987))); <em>cf. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. at 347, 100 S.Ct. at 1717 (\u201cUnless the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists, the court need not initiate an inquiry.\u201d). Here, however, we need not address whether the trial court had such an obligation in this case. As the Commonwealth points out, the trial court in fact held a special hearing at which the public defender presented her arguments for why she believed her entire office should have been relieved from representing Spence. The trial court took the matter under advisement and subsequently denied the public defender\u2019s request in a letter to counsel two weeks after the special hearing. Thus, the trial court did inquire into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>nature of the alleged conflict of interest, and Spence\u2019s argument that the trial court failed to do so is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">In sum, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate Spence\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights in denying the public defender\u2019s request to relieve the entire Public Defender\u2019s Office from representing Spence.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Spence\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\">. Officer Bruce E. Ilapit, the first officer to arrive, testified that the store owner pointed out the location of the car to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\">. Although there was no testimony regarding the exact time of the police dispatch, the police photographs indicate that the events occurred after dark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">. For purposes of this opinion we will assume that this threat created a conflict between Spence and the personal interest of the senior assistant public defender. <em>See </em>Virginia Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b408-12\">. A \"DNA mixture profile\u201d denotes the presence of at least two contributors to the DNA found in a particular area.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\">. To the extent Spence argues that we should reverse his convictions based simply on an alleged failure to comply with Virginia Rule of Professional Conduct 1.10, we find no merit in such a contention. A violation of a particular rule of professional conduct does not <em>ipso facto </em>require reversal of a criminal conviction. Rather, we will devote our attention to Spence\u2019s constitutional claim that his Sixth Amendment right was violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b416-6\">. Indeed, Spence\u2019s appellate counsel at oral argument expressly declined to argue that Spence\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was in fact deficient in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b417-8\">. Rule 1.10 is the general rule regarding imputed disqualification. Section (a) of Rule 1.10 provides, \"While lawyers are associated in a firm, none of them shall knowingly represent a client when any one of them practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so by Rules 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, or 2.10(e).\u201d Rule 1.7, in turn, is the general rule regarding conflicts of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. We also note that the Public Defenders\u2019 Offices in Virginia are obligated to represent \"indigents charged with jailable offenses ... unless (i) the public defender is unable to represent the defendant or petitioner by reason of conflict of interest or (ii) the court finds that appointment of other counsel is necessary to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-163.4. Here, the conflict of interest that Spence alleges is not a direct conflict of interest, but an imputed one. The threat Spence made to his original attorney was personal to that attorney and was not directed to other attorneys in the Public Defender's Office. It is unclear whether imputed conflicts of interest\u2014especially those that a trial court may reasonably believe will have no perceivable effect on an attorney\u2019s representation of a particular defendant\u2014are encompassed by the language of Code \u00a7 19.2-163.4. Because it is unnecessary for us to address this particular question to resolve this appeal, we decline to do so. The question of whether Code \u00a7 19.2-163.4 was violated is not the same as whether Spence\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was violated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
