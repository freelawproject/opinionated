ARTHUR KELSEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In this case, the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission enforced a reimbursement guideline issued by the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program and denied a request by the claimants for reimbursement of covered expenses. We reverse, finding the Program\u2019s guideline cannot be justified under the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 38.2-5000 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">John and Julie Kavanaugh, parents of John Kavanaugh, Jr., filed a petition with the commission pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-5004. The petition claimed their son was born with a birth-related neurological injury, resulting in medical expenses covered by the Act. The petition alleged facts qualifying their son for benefits but did not itemize any medical expenses subject to reimbursement. \u201cMedical bills and insurance claims payment documentation,\u201d the petition stated, \u201chave been withheld pending determination of John Kavanaugh\u2019s qualification for compensation under the Act.\u201d Petition for Benefits II18, at 5 (App. at 5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program filed a reply conceding the child\u2019s injury qualified for benefits under the Act. On November 7, 2007, a deputy commissioner issued a consent order stating: \u201cIt is hereby ORDERED that the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program shall be and is hereby directed to pay all amounts and expenses provided by Virginia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-5009 for the benefit of the infant, John Kavanaugh.\u201d App. at 7 (entered Nov. 7, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In 2010, the Kavanaughs forwarded to the Program a request for reimbursement of $16,071.99 in medical expenses arising out of treatment received between 2004 to 2010. The Program reimbursed only $3,481.99 in expenses and denied the remaining $12,590.00 of the request because it failed to comply with a guideline issued by the Program requiring requests for reimbursement within certain fixed deadlines: two years from the date of admission (for pre-admission expenses) and one year from incurring the expense (for post-admission expenses). <em>Id. </em>at 14 (citing Program Guidelines at 21-22 (approved Oct. 14, 2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Kavanaughs objected to the denial, claiming the expenses were covered under the Act and nothing in the statute authorized the Program to impose fixed limitation periods for reimbursement requests. The Kavanaughs filed a supplemental petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission seeking full reimbursement of their covered expenses. The parties stipulated that the \u201ctreatments at issue were rendered, that the expenses at issue were incurred, and that the treatments were medically necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188. The Commission, however, enforced the reimbursement guideline and denied the supplemental petition. The Kavanaughs now appeal to us, arguing the Commission and the Program erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 38.2-5000 <em>et seq., </em>\u201cprovides claimants with a no-fault remedy for compensation for qualified injuries.\u201d <em>Cent. Va. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Assocs., P.C. v. Whitfield, </em>42 Va.App. 264, 271, 590 S.E.2d 631, 635 (2004) (citing Code \u00a7 38.2-5009). The Act divides the responsibility for implementing its provisions to three separate entities: The Program, governed by its board of directors, the State Corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>ration Commission (SCC), and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In its role as administrator, the Program has authority to adopt \u201crules ... not related to the health care provided for claimants\u201d consistent with the Virginia Public Procurement Act, Code \u00a7 2.2-4300 <em>et </em>seg., for contracting for goods and services. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5002.1(B); <em>see, e.g., Request for Proposal, </em>21 Va. Regs. Reg. 43 (Sept. 20, 2004). Outside this context, however, the Act does not directly authorize the Program to promulgate general administrative rules and regulations. Even so, the Act arguably implies such authority by providing that the \u201cprocedure for adoption of rules and regulations by the board of directors of the Program shall be consistent with the provisions of Article 2 (\u00a7 2.2-4006 <em>et seq.) </em>of the Administrative Process Act.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5002.1(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">The Act also gives the State Corporation Commission an oversight role. In a comprehensive review of the Program, the Judicial Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC) listed the \u201cthree primary duties\u201d of the SCC with regard to the birth injury program: \u201c(1) to review and approve the program\u2019s plan of operation, (2) to provide a review of the actuarial soundness of the fund, and (3) if the fund is determined to be actuarially unsound, to impose assessments on liability insurers and physicians who do not participate in the program.\u201d Review of the Virginia Birth-Related Neurological Injury Compensation Program 8 (Jan.2003).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to the Act, the Program has authority to seek amendments to its initial \u201cplan of operation\u201d which provides, among other things, for efficient administration and for \u201cprompt processing of claims\u201d following awards by the Commission. Code \u00a7 38.2-5017(B). The proposed amendments, however, have no efficacy of their own. They must be reviewed and approved by the SCC. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 38.2-5017(D); 14 Va. Admin. Code \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The Act grants the adjudicatory function entirely to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission by authorizing it to \u201chear and pass upon all claims\u201d for compensation. Code \u00a7 38.2-5003. The Act requires claimants to file a petition that includes considerable information, including \u201c[djocumentation of expenses and services incurred to date, which indicates whether such expenses and services have been paid for, and if so, by whom.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2\u20145004(A)(l)(i). Thereafter, Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(A)(4) \u201cdirects the commission to determine the amount of any \u2018compensation\u2019 awardable under Code \u00a7 38.2-5009.\u201d <em>Spicer v. Birth Related Neuro. Injury Comp. Program, </em>48 Va.App. 613, 618-19, 633 S.E.2d 732, 734 (2006).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is, the <em>Commission </em>decides both \u201cWhether\u201d and \u201cHow much\u201d compensation is due under the Aet.Code \u00a7 38.2-5008(1) &amp; (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">In 2004, the Program issued a \u201cguideline\u201d that precludes reimbursement of covered expenses \u201cif submitted after one year from the date they are incurred\u201d or, if incurred prior to acceptance, were not \u201csubmitted within two years of entry into the Program.\u201d Program Guidelines at 17 (approved Apr. 13, 2004).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Kavanaughs assert that the Program acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>outside its delegated authority by issuing this guideline and that the Commission erred by enforcing it. These arguments present \u201cpure questions of law which we review <em>de novo.\u201d Spicer, </em>48 Va.App. at 618, 633 S.E.2d at 734. Applying this standard of review, we hold the Program exceeded its authority by issuing the reimbursement deadlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Code \u00a7 38.2-5009 governs the scope of an award. Subsection A(l) authorizes awards of myriad forms of medical and incidental expenses and precludes an award for a host of other specific items, such as expenses reimbursed by governmental programs, prepaid health plans, and the like. In both instances, the statute is emphatic: The Commission \u201cshall\u201d award covered expenses and \u201cshall not\u201d award uncovered expenses. <em>Id. </em>Nothing in Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(l) precludes a reimbursement award for covered medical expenses incurred beyond a fixed time period prior to the reimbursement request. The only statutory time limitation in the Act is Code \u00a7 38.2-5013, entitled \u201cLimitation on claims,\u201d which provides: \u201cAny claim under this chapter that is filed more than ten years after the birth of an infant alleged to have a birth-related neurological injury is barred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The Program contends it may supplement the Act by issuing guidelines<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pursuant to Code \u00a7 38.2-5002.1(D)\u2014which states the \u201cprocedure for adoption of rules and regulations by the board of directors of the Program shall be consistent with the provisions of Article 2 (\u00a7 2.2-4006 <em>et seq.) </em>of the Administrative Process Act.\u201d This provision, the Program asserts, gives it plenary authority to issue administrative rules and regulations to complement the Act\u2019s provisions. The Kavanaughs disagree, arguing the delegation of power to issue administrative rules and regulations under subsection D of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Code \u00a7 38.2-5002.1 relate only to the Program\u2019s procurement authority granted by subsection B.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We need not resolve in this case the debate over the ultimate scope of the Program\u2019s power to issue administrative rules and regulations. No matter the scope, the Program could not issue a \u201cguideline\u201d inconsistent\u2014directly or indirectly\u2014with the text and structure of the enabling legislation. Administrative rules and regulations \u201cmay not conflict with the authorizing statute,\u201d <em>Manassas Autocars v. Couch, </em>274 Va. 82, 87, 645 S.E.2d 443, 446 (2007), or in any material way be \u201cinconsistent with the authority of the statutes that govern it,\u201d <em>Judicial Inquiry &amp; Review Comm\u2019n v. Elliott, </em>272 Va. 97, 115, 630 S.E.2d 485, 494 (2006). <em>Accord Woods v. Va. Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>26 Va.App. 450, 458-59, 495 S.E.2d 505, 509-10 (1998) (invalidating \u201cguidelines\u201d that are \u201cinconsistent with the statute\u201d). \u201cWhether a regulation is inconsistent with its enabling legislation is properly a subject of judicial review.\u201d <em>Manassas Autocars, </em>274 Va. at 87, 645 S.E.2d at 446. In exercising this review, courts take into account the text as well as the context of the underlying statute, \u201cviewing it as a \u2018symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., </em>535 U.S. 81, 86, 122 S.Ct. 1155, 1160, 152 L.Ed.2d 167 (2002) (quoting <em>Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., </em>513 U.S. 561, 569, 115 S.Ct. 1061, 1067, 131 L.Ed.2d 1 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The Program\u2019s reimbursement deadline purports to limit the emphatic directive of Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(l), which states the Commission \u201cshall\u201d award covered expenses and \u201cshall not\u201d award uncovered expenses.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Despite the many differences between the two, none involves a fixed time dead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>line between the date the expense was incurred and the date it was submitted for reimbursement. The conspicuous absence of any fixed reimbursement deadline in the Act, particularly given the comprehensive provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-5009, suggests the Program lacked the authority to unilaterally add one on its own.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Equally important, the Program\u2019s reimbursement guideline also unwittingly usurps the Commission\u2019s exclusive adjudicatory function under Code \u00a7\u00a7 38.2-5003, 38.2-5004(A)(l)(i), and 38.2-5008(A)(4). <em>Cf. United Mine Workers v. Kleppe, </em>561 F.2d 1258, 1262 (7th Cir.1977) (upholding a regulation that \u201cconditions petitioner\u2019s access to the agency\u2019s forum\u201d but \u201cdoes not even purport, as would a statute of limitations, to bar enforcement of petitioner\u2019s right to compensation in any other forum\u201d). Determining whether a particular invoice is so stale as to render it unpersuasive evidence of a covered expense\u2014thereby implicating the requirement that post-admission expenses \u201cbe paid as they are incurred,\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-5009(A)(1)\u2014involves a case-by-case application of factfinding discretion. <em>Accord Berglund Chevrolet v. Landrum, </em>43 Va.App. 742, 755, 601 S.E.2d 693, 699 (2004) (noting \u201cno rigid rule can be laid down as to what delay will constitute laches; every suit must depend upon its own circumstances\u201d (quoting <em>Stewart v. Lady, </em>251 Va. 106, 114, 465 S.E.2d 782, 786 (1996))). Only the Commission, not the Program, has the statutory authority to exercise that discretion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Because the Program lacked authority to issue the reimbursement guideline and the Commission erred in enforcing it, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-9\">.
