The commission found Bernard\u2019s injury occurred in the course of his employment but not as a result of an actual risk of employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Agreeing with the commission\u2019s legal reasoning and deferring to its factfinding, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">We view the evidence on appeal in the light most favorable to Bernard\u2019s employer, \u201cthe prevailing party before the commission.\u201d <em>Dunnavant v. Newman Tire Co., </em>51 Va.App. 252, 255, 656 S.E.2d 431, 433 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In 2010, Bernard worked as a host and waiter at a TGI Friday\u2019s (TGIF) restaurant. When new food selections came out, he and other employees often sampled the food so they could make recommendations to customers. The commission found Bernard \u201cwas not required to taste anything\u201d and \u201cdid not anticipate being disciplined\u201d if he chose not to sample the food. <em>Bernard v. Carlson Cos.-TGIF, </em>2011 Va. Wrk. Comp. Lexis 401 (Nov. 23, 2011). In January 2010, Bernard sampled a quesadilla. Though he had never before had problems swallowing food, Bernard choked on a partially chewed bite of the quesadilla. The strenuous process of dislodging it damaged his esophagus.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Bernard filed a worker\u2019s compensation claim, contending the injury occurred in the course of his employment and arose out of an actual risk of his employment. He did not allege the quesadilla was unusual or defective in any way. Bernard has had Crohn\u2019s disease since childhood. But he did not claim, nor did the evidence prove, that some peculiar quality of the quesadilla triggered his underlying Crohn\u2019s disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The deputy commissioner denied the claim, finding the injury occurred in the course of the employment but did not arise out of an actual risk of the employment. Relying on precedent from the commission,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the deputy held no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>suggested the quesadilla was in any way unusual or defective. On review, the majority of the commissioners agreed. Relying on its own precedent, as well as our caselaw, the commission held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">[W]e find that the claimant\u2019s injury did not arise out of a risk of his employment. In cases of injury due to food provided by the employer, we have found compensable injuries only when there was something unusual or abnormal about the food, i.e. it was spicy, hot in temperature, or contained a hard object. Here, there was no problem documented with the quesadilla which became stuck in the claimant\u2019s throat and caused his injury. The claimant did not assert that it was something that he should not eat because of his medical condition. The claimant would have been equally exposed to any risk connected with eating an ordinary quesadilla had he eaten it apart from his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-5\"><em>Id. </em>Commissioner Diamond dissented on the ground that TGIF exposed Bernard to the risk of eating \u201cnovel foods\u201d like a quesadilla. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">On appeal to us, Bernard concedes he \u201cattempted to swallow a piece of quesadilla that was too big for his esophagus.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. The incident should be covered by the workers\u2019 compensation statute, Bernard argues, because TGIF \u201cprovided\u201d the quesadilla and \u201cencouraged\u201d him to eat it. <em>Id. </em>We agree TGIF provided Bernard with the quesadilla, while he was working, and encouraged him to eat it\u2014thus his injury occurred <em>in the course of </em>his employment. We disagree, however, that his failure to fully chew the quesadilla and his resulting injury <em>arose out </em>o/his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">A. BASIC ARISING-OUT-OF PRINCIPLES</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act applies when the claimant \u201csatisfies both the \u2018arising out of and the \u2018in the course of prongs of the statutory requirements of compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>bility.\u201d <em>Butler v. S. States Coop., Inc., </em>270 Va. 459, 465, 620 S.E.2d 768, 772 (2005). \u201cThe concepts \u2018arising out of and \u2018in the course of employment are not synonymous and both conditions must be proved before compensation will be awarded.\u201d <em>Clifton v. Clifton Cable Contracting, LLC, </em>54 Va.App. 582, 539, 680 S.E.2d 348, 352 (2009) (quoting <em>Grand Union Co. v. Bynum, </em>226 Va. 140, 143, 307 S.E.2d 456, 458 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">No matter how tempting it is to conflate the two concepts, we must be vigilant \u201cto maintain the distinction between arising \u2018out of and arising \u2018in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Cnty. of Chesterfield v. Johnson, </em>237 Va. 180, 186, 376 S.E.2d 73, 76 (1989). Failing to do so transforms the analysis into an assessment of \u201cpositional risk,\u201d which asks only if the injury occurred during the course of employment. <em>Id. </em>at 185, 376 S.E.2d at 75-76. Arguments like this\u2014overlooking \u201cthe difference between the concepts of \u2018arising out of and \u2018in the course of the employment\u201d\u2014are little more than efforts to \u201ceradicate the distinction which exists under Virginia law between these expressions\u201d and, if successful, \u201cwould mean an acceptance of the \u2018positional risk\u2019 doctrine in cases of this type and amount to a rejection of the \u2018actual risk\u2019 test long-recognized in Virginia.\u201d <em>Baggett &amp; Meador Cos. v. Dillon, </em>219 Va. 633, 640, 248 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1978) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">To this end, Virginia follows the \u201cactual risk\u201d doctrine which \u201cexcludes \u2018an injury which comes from a hazard to which the employee would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Taylor v. Mobil Corp., </em>248 Va. 101, 107, 444 S.E.2d 705, 708 (1994) (quoting <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 183, 376 S.E.2d at 75, and <em>United Parcel Serv. v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985)). An \u201c \u2018actual risk\u2019 of employment\u201d is \u201cnot merely the risk of being injured while at work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Reversing one of our opinions for \u201c[i]n effect\u201d applying the \u201cdoctrine of positional risk,\u201d the Virginia Supreme Court repeated that it has \u201cconsistently rejected\u201d the doctrine. <em>Hill City Trucking v. Christian, </em>238 Va. 735, 740, 385 S.E.2d 377, 380 (1989). The \u201cactual risk\u201d standard, the Court emphasized, necessarily excludes an injury caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>by <em>\u201ca hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. </em>The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739, 385 S.E.2d at 379 (emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Baggett &amp; Meador Cos., </em>219 Va. at 638, 248 S.E.2d at 822).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Virginia courts have applied this understanding of the actual risk doctrine in numerous cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The first premise of the actual risk doctrine requires a \u201chazard\u201d or \u201cdanger\u201d <em>not </em>equally present \u201capart from the employment\u201d but rather one \u201cpeculiar to the work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Without this precondition, any injury\u2014of any kind no matter the cause\u2014would be covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This would be unfair to employers (by greatly expanding their no-fault liability for worker injuries) and equally unfair to employees (by greatly expanding the employer\u2019s immunity to fault-based tort recoveries). Policing the line between coverage and noncoverage is critical to the \u201csocietal exchange\u201d that underlies the <em>\u201cquid pro quo </em>\u201d of the statute. <em>Roller v. Basic Constr. Co., </em>238 Va. 321, 327, 384 S.E.2d 323, 325 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Perhaps the most common examples of the arising-out-of principle are the cases involving tripping on steps. An employee who trips while walking up a staircase at work cannot recover compensation unless something about the steps (or some other condition of the workplace) presented a hazard or danger peculiar to the worksite. Even though the employer provided the steps, and encouraged the employee to use them, if there is \u201cnothing unusual about or wrong with the steps,\u201d an employee who trips over them cannot show the accident \u201carose out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 185-86, 376 S.E.2d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">On the other hand, if the steps are \u201cunusual\u201d because they are \u201cslightly higher than normal\u201d or otherwise peculiar, then tripping over them would involve an accident arising out of the employment. <em>Id. </em>(pointing out these \u201cfacts were crucial\u201d to cases like <em>Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Hosey, </em>208 Va. 568, 159 S.E.2d 633 (1968)). In such cases, the steps present an <em>enhanced </em>risk,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> qualitatively different from the steps most people walk up and down on and off the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">It does not matter that the employee must walk up and down the steps as a mandatory part of his employment. That obligatory fact\u2014like the fact that Bernard ate the quesadilla to be a better waiter\u2014only establishes the injury occurred during the course of employment. \u201cThe fact that the injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>occurred at work adds nothing and answers nothing, when the inquiry is, did the injury arise out of the employment. It simply helps prove the \u2018in the course of prong of the compensability test.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 185, 376 S.E.2d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">B. THE INAPPLICABLE STREET-RISK EXCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Virginia courts have carved out of these general principles one notable exception. Under the \u201cstreet-risk rule,\u201d <em>Marketing Profiles, Inc. v. Hill, </em>17 Va.App. 431, 435, 437 S.E.2d 727, 730 (1993) <em>(en banc), </em>the generally applicable principles\u2014 excluding coverage for unpeculiar risks, common to everyone\u2014do not necessarily apply to vehicle accidents caused by ordinary street risks. \u201cAn <em>exception to the rule </em>that the risk of employment must be a risk to which the common neighborhood is not exposed is the \u2018Street Risk Doctrine.\u2019 This principle recognizes compensable injuries that occur in vehicular collisions while an employee is on his or her master\u2019s business.\u201d Lawrence J. Pascal, <em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Practice in Virginia </em>H 2.401, at 58 (8th ed.2011) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The cases applying the street-risk doctrine represent a departure from traditional principles. Statements in our opinions suggesting \u201cthe fact that the general public may be exposed to the same risk is not dispositive,\u201d <em>post, </em>at 414, 728 S.E.2d at 515, originated in the street-risk cases. <em>See Lucas v. Lucas, </em>212 Va. 561, 186 S.E.2d 63 (1972); <em>Immer &amp; Co. v. Brosnahan, </em>207 Va. 720, 152 S.E.2d 254 (1967); <em>Dreyfus v. Meade, </em>142 Va. 567, 129 S.E. 336 (1925).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Extending the reasoning of those cases outside their unique context impli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>cates policy judgments best left for legislative, not judicial, innovation. We thus decline the opportunity to extend the street-risk exception to cases where, as here, the employee sustains injury eating at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">C. THE COMMON AND UNPECULIAR QUESADILLA</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Bernard\u2019s quesadilla was neither a hazard nor a danger\u2014it was simply a quesadilla. No evidence suggested it had unusual properties or was made with defective ingredients. It could not be distinguished (for purposes of presenting a choking risk) from any other quesadilla or, for that matter, any food that requires chewing before swallowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Even if we could call a flawless quesadilla a \u201chazard\u201d or a \u201cdanger,\u201d <em>Hill City Trucking, </em>238 Va. at 739, 385 S.E.2d at 379, we could hardly conclude it was one \u201cpeculiar\u201d to TGIF and \u201cnot common to the neighborhood\u201d of quesadilla eaters, <em>id. </em>Nor could we say the risk of Bernard choking on under-chewed food was something other than <em>\u201ca hazard to which the workman would have been equally exposed apart from the employment.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Baggett &amp; Meador Cos., </em>219 Va. at 638, 248 S.E.2d at 822). Only a court applying the positional risk doctrine could hold otherwise.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In sum, the commission correctly concluded Bernard\u2019s choking injury occurred in the course of his employment. TGIF provided the quesadilla, and Bernard tried to eat it to be a better waiter. Even so, the commission was also right to conclude the injury did not arise out of an actual risk of the employment. The quesadilla was not a hazard or danger, much less one peculiar to TGIF. Swallowing partially chewed food was a risk Bernard faced equally on and off the job. Nothing about the TGIF quesadilla or Bernard\u2019s work environment increased that risk.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Bernard\u2019s argument to the contrary confuses the separate concepts of in-the-course-of and arising-out-of, and in the process, invites us to apply <em>de facto </em>the positional risk doctrine. To do so would undermine \u201cthe distinction between arising \u2018out of and arising \u2018in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>237 Va. at 186, 376 S.E.2d at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Because the commission correctly applied the actual risk test to the facts of this case, we affirm its denial of Bernard\u2019s compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-9\">. <em>Ellis v.

Claimant worked for employee as a host/server. Part of his work responsibilities was to make food recommendations to the guests. To that end, employer periodically conducted food tasting demonstration programs to introduce staff to new menu items. Staff would then be able to describe the taste to customers and to recommend the new menu items. Claimant indicated these recommendations actually assist guests in selecting their food.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Prior to the food demonstration, staff would be briefed on the ingredients, food preparation, and what items accompany the selection. Staff would then taste whatever foods they chose to eat. These tastings were at no cost to the employees and occurred while employees were \u201con the clock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Browning Bridges, claimant\u2019s supervisor, testified the food tasting activity was to familiarize staff with the taste of new foods so they could explain those tastes to guests. Part of a host/server\u2019s employment responsibilities is to \u201csell the food.\u201d While attendance at the food tasting activities is mandatory, no employee is required to eat anything they do not want to eat.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, all host/servers are evaluated on the effectiveness of their recommendations to guests, and failure to make such recommendations can result in counseling by management.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Employer even employs \u201csecret shoppers\u201d to assess staff members\u2019 performance, including recommendations of menu items.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On January 4, 2010, during a food tasting demonstration, claimant tasted rice and then a quesadilla. The quesadilla <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>lodged in his throat and perforated his esophagus. Claimant was taken to an emergency room and was diagnosed with esophageal perforation and collapsed lung. He underwent emergency surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The deputy commissioner found claimant\u2019s injuries did not arise out of his employment. The full commission affirmed, summarizing the deputy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">The Deputy Commissioner analogized these cases to the cases of employees traversing stairs and found that all of the foods in the cited cases were unusual or defective. Finding that there was no evidence of a defect in the quesadilla, he found that the act of eating an employee meal, \u2022with no other factors involved, is not a risk of the employment, and he denied the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">On [rjeview, we find that the claimant\u2019s injury did not arise out of a risk of his employment. In cases of injury due to food provided by the employer, we have found compensable injuries only when there was something unusual or abnormal about the food, i.e. it was spicy, hot in temperature, or contained a hard object. Here, there was no problem documented with the quesadilla which became stuck in the claimant\u2019s throat and caused his injury. The claimant did not assert that it was something that he should not eat because of his medical condition. The claimant would have been equally exposed to any risk connected with eating an ordinary quesadilla had he eaten it apart from his employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">The question before this Court is whether an injury caused by claimant choking on food supplied by employer during a food tasting demonstration arises out of the course of his employment. When we are presented with \u201cessentially undisputed facts,\u201d as we are here, a <em>de novo </em>standard of appellate review governs the question whether the injury satisfies the \u201cactual risk\u201d test. <em>Hilton v. Martin, 275 </em>Va. 176, 180, 654 S.E.2d 572, 574 (2008) (characterizing the \u201carising out of\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>issue as a \u201cquestion of law\u201d when the parties present undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, an employee must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his injury arose \u201cout of and in the course of [his] employment\u201d to qualify for compensation benefits. Code \u00a7 65.2-101; <em>see also Marketing Profiles v. Hill, </em>17 Va.App. 431, 433, 437 S.E.2d 727, 729 (1993) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The phrase \u201carising out of and in the course of the employment\u201d covers those accidents which cause injury to an employee while he is discharging some duty he is authorized to perform in furtherance of his employer\u2019s business, either directly or indirectly. <em>Cohen v. Cohen\u2019s Dep\u2019t Store, </em>171 Va. 106, 110, 198 S.E. 476, 477 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Virginia employs the \u201cactual risk\u201d test to determine whether an injury \u201carises out of\u2019 the employment. <em>Green Hand Nursery, Inc. v. Loveless, </em>55 Va.App. 134, 141, 684 S.E.2d 818, 822 (2009). The Supreme Court of Virginia has held that an injury is not compensable if it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201ccannot fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workmen would have been equally exposed apart from the employment. The causative danger must be peculiar to the work and not common to the neighborhood. It must be incidental to the character of the business and not independent of the relation of master and servant. It need not have been foreseen or expected, but after the event it must appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational consequence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-8\"><em>Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938) (quoting <em>In re McNicol, </em>215 Mass. 497, 102 N.E. 697, 697 (1913)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The commission found that claimant, by eating the quesadilla, would have been equally exposed to such injury apart from his employment. Employer argues on appeal that claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>faced a risk no different than a risk to which the general public is equally exposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">However, in <em>Green Hand Nursery </em>we held \u201cthe fact that the general public may be exposed to the same risk is not dispositive in the analysis of whether the injury arose out of the employment.\u201d 55 Va.App. at 144, 684 S.E.2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In <em>Green Hand Nursery, </em>claimant was struck by a vehicle while manually shutting off a series of water sprinklers located twenty-seven feet from a highway. The sprinklers were located in a display section of the nursery which was open to the nursery\u2019s customers who could walk among the plants. Claimant testified that her task of turning off the sprinklers \u201coccupied\u201d her attention. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 684 S.E.2d at 820. When she heard car tires screech, she tried to move out of the car\u2019s path, but potted plants prevented her from retreating in a straight course toward the trees. She had to jump a ditch, taking a less direct route. <em>Id. </em>at 139, 684 S.E.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">This Court concluded in that case that claimant\u2019s performance of her job increased the risk of injury by diverting her attention from the danger of the approaching vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 143, 684 S.E.2d at 823. We explained if the injury can \u201c \u2018fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause,\u2019 \u201d it matters not that the danger is common to the neighborhood. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 684 S.E.2d at 823 (quoting <em>R &amp; T Invs. v. Johns, </em>228 Va. 249, 253, 321 S.E.2d 287, 290 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Thus, our inquiry here is limited to whether there is a causal connection between the choking injury and claimant\u2019s work responsibilities. Is the injury fairly traceable to employment as a contributing proximate cause? I conclude that it is and agree with the dissenting commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Here the commission concluded that claimant\u2019s injury was not compensable because there was \u201cno problem documented with the quesadilla\u201d and that the claimant would have been equally exposed to any risk associated with eating an ordinary quesadilla apart from his employment. The commission explained that in \u201ccases of injury due to food provided by the employer, we have found compensable injuries only when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>there was something unusual or abnormal about the food----\u201d However, the cases cited by the deputy and relied upon by the commission do not support such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In <em>Pead v. Busara Restaurant, </em>00 WC UNP 1947693 (2000), cited in the commission\u2019s opinion, claimant ate a spicy meal prepared by employer for the employees, became ill, and was treated for gastroenteritis. The employer prepared three meals daily for the employees, separate from meals prepared for customers. In finding claimant\u2019s injury arose in the course of employment, the commission\u2019s analysis was not based on the nature of the food, but on the fact that employer provided the meals for employees before, during, and after their shift, and were provided free of charge \u201cwhich is a characteristic of the employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\"><em>Ellis v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>08 WC UNP 2320759 (2008), cited in the commission\u2019s opinion, involved claimant, a flight attendant, who was a passenger on employer\u2019s plane traveling to employer-sponsored training. During the flight, claimant purchased an on-board candy snack. As claimant bit down, a hard object broke one of his teeth. In finding the injury arose out of employment, the commission again did not analyze the nature of the object in the snack, but on the fact that employer controlled what snacks were offered for purchase. The claimant was limited to the on-board food/snacks offered by employer. \u201c[Claimant] could not go anywhere else to obtain food or snacks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">The commission\u2019s opinion also cites <em>Caprio v. West Point School Board, </em>98 WC UNP 1894516 (1998), to support its finding. Again, this case fails to do so. Claimant, a school teacher, broke a tooth while eating soup purchased from the school cafeteria. Claimant was required by the school to remain on the school premises during lunch. The commission, in its analysis, did not discuss the nature of the food that caused the injury, but only the circumstances in which claimant ate the food. The commission concluded claimant consumed food provided by employer and she was required to remain on the school premises. Under those facts, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>mission concluded claimant\u2019s employment was a proximate cause of her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In each of the above cited cases, the commission analyzed not whether the food was unusual or defective, but whether eating the food was characteristic of claimant\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">As the Supreme Court of Virginia opined in <em>Lucas v. Lucas, </em>212 Va. 561, 186 S.E.2d 63 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">\u201cIf the voluntary act of an employee which causes an injury is sufficiently related to what the employee is required to do in fulfilling his contract of service, or is one in which someone in a like capacity may or must do in the interest of his employer\u2019s business, the fact that the employee was not actually required to perform the act will not impair his right to recover compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 564, 186 S.E.2d at 64 (quoting 7 Sneider, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation </em>\u00a7 1662(a), at 264 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Walking up or down stairs, or any walking, sitting, standing, bending, eating food or drinking are ordinary occurrences of every job and are not risks unique to a particular job. In cases involving stairs, \u201c[i]t is well established that a fall does not arise out of the employment without evidence of a defect in the stairs <em>or </em>evidence that a condition of the employment caused the fall.\u201d <em>Grayson Sch. Bd. v. Cornett, </em>39 Va.App. 279, 287, 572 S.E.2d 505, 509 (2002) (emphasis added). In those cases, the steps need not be unusual or defective for a fall to be compensable. While an unusual or defective set of steps is a basis for compensation, those factors are not exclusive. The defect or unusual condition of the steps is only relevant to determine whether the causative danger is peculiar to the work and incidental to the character of the business. <em>United Parcel Service v. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. 257, 258, 336 S.E.2d 892, 893 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Clearly, the step cases do not exclude other conditions unique to that particular employment. For example, in <em>Marion Correctional Center v. Henderson, </em>20 Va.App. 477, 458 S.E.2d 301 (1995), a prison guard fell down steps in a prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>because his attention was focused on several inmates, not because of any defect or unusual condition of the step.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">Observation of the guard towers was one of the security functions of his employment. The way in which he performed this aspect of his job increased his risk of falling on this occasion and directly contributed to cause his fall and injury. <em>Cf. Fetterman, </em>230 Va. at 259, 336 S.E.2d at 893. He would not have been equally exposed to the risk apart from his duty to observe the guard towers and provide security at the facility. <em>Cf. Bradshaw v. Aronovitch, </em>170 Va. 329, 335, 196 S.E. 684, 686 (1938). Henderson\u2019s injury occurred because of the performance of his job duties in a particular manner. Therefore, the cause of the injury was not \u201cunrelated to any hazard common to the workplace.\u201d <em>Fetterman, </em>230 Va. at 259, 336 S.E.2d at 893.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-6\"><em>Henderson, </em>20 Va.App. at 481, 458 S.E.2d at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In the defective or unusual step cases, or in <em>Henderson, </em>the risks were unique to that particular job, not activities common to all jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The mere act of traversing a set of stairs, or climbing a ramp does not, by itself, involve a work-related risk justifying compensation. <em>Nurses 4 You, Inc. v. Ferris, </em>49 Va.App. 332, 341, 641 S.E.2d 129, 133 (2007). \u201cSimple acts of walking, bending, or turning, without any other contributing environmental factors, are not risks of employment.\u201d <em>Southside Virginia Training Ctr. v. Ellis, </em>33 Va.App. 824, 829, 537 S.E.2d 35, 37 (2000). Accordingly, an injury does not arise out of the employment \u201cmerely because it occurred during the performance of some employment duty if the act performed by the employee is not a causative hazard of the employment.\u201d <em>Ferris, </em>49 Va.App. at 341, 641 S.E.2d at 133. By way of example, if a claimant\u2019s job is to test the spacing of steps by walking up and down stairs, and suffers an injury while doing so, we need not evaluate if the steps were defective or unusual because testing stairs is not a normal occurrence of all jobs, but is a causative hazard of that particular employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Applying these principles to the facts presented here, I disagree with employer that claimant\u2019s consumption of the quesadilla was simply a \u201ccommon, human experience\u201d and therefore not arising out of his employment. I conclude that sampling the quesadilla was a causative hazard of claimant\u2019s employment because claimant was \u201cdischarging some duty he [was] authorized or directed to perform\u201d in furtherance of his employer\u2019s business. <em>Cohen, </em>171 Va. at 110, 198 S.E. at 477. Therefore, I need not discuss whether there was a defect in the food he was consuming.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Here, claimant as a host/server, was evaluated partially on the manner in which he recommended food to customers. The food tasting demonstration allowed employees to sample new menu items so they could make these recommendations to customers. Part of the host/server\u2019s job function is to \u201csell the food.\u201d Claimant\u2019s tasting the quesadilla was to further employer\u2019s goal to \u201csell the food.\u201d The briefing and the tasting enabled claimant to explain to the customers the new menu items. Claimant\u2019s food sampling fulfilled \u201chis contract of service,\u201d was done in furthering employer\u2019s business, and was incidental to claimant\u2019s work as a host/server. Clearly, claimant\u2019s exposure to the quesadilla was occasioned by the nature of his employment, thus satisfying the \u201cactual risk\u201d test. <em>Green Hand Nursery, </em>55 Va.App. at 141, 684 S.E.2d at 822. As stated above, it is irrelevant that others outside the workplace might have been exposed to the same injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the decision of the commission denying claimant benefits and remand for entry of an award.</p>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b457-7\">. Claimant had Crohn\u2019s disease and was not able to eat certain foods. However, claimant's illness was not a causative factor in claimant\u2019s injury. Employer stipulated choking on the quesadilla was the cause of claimant's injuiy, and the medical treatment the claimant received was causally related to the choking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\">. While this program was initiated after claimant\u2019s injury, claimant testified the standards of evaluation fairly represented expectations at the time of the injury. Browning Bridges, claimant\u2019s supervisor, confirmed there was a \u201cquality check\u201d in place at the time of claimant\u2019s injury which included an employee's performance in recommending foods to guests.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
