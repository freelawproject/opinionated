First, she claims the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law. Second, she contends the circuit court violated her due process rights by considering a certificate filed by the juvenile and domestic relations district court pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459. We disagree with both assertions and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Parham appeared <em>pro se </em>at a hearing in a child custody case pending in the Richmond Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (the JDR court). During the hearing, Parham was found guilty of summary contempt. No court reporter was present to record the hearing. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-459, the JDR court filed a \u201ccertificate of the conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The certificate explained that \u201cParham appeared on March 23, 2011 in a contested custody case.\u201d App. at 4. At the end of the hearing, the JDR judge \u201cadvised\u201d the parties she was \u201cgranting sole legal custody\u201d to the father. <em>Id. </em>As the court clerk prepared the order, a court deputy handed a child support summons to Parham. In response, \u201cParham balled the paper up.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the judge asked Parham \u201cwhat she had just done,\u201d Parham replied \u201cshe didn\u2019t need the papers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAt that point,\u201d the judge stated, \u201cI took a brief recess.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the recess, the judge repeated her ruling granting sole legal custody to the child\u2019s father. The court\u2019s custody orders were then handed to Parham. As before, \u201cParham proceeded to ball up these orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge found her in summary contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Parham appealed the summary contempt finding to the circuit court. Parham argued the circuit court could not consider the JDR court\u2019s certificate under Code \u00a7 18.2-459 because doing so violated her due process right to confront the witness against her\u2014the JDR judge. She also contended her actions could not \u201cbe considered either insulting to the judge or misbehavior or resistance or disobeying an order of the Court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. After the circuit court overruled her objections, Parham took the stand in her own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Parham testified she balled up the \u201cfirst piece of paper\u201d (the summons) and conceded: \u201cSo I could take the contempt of court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26. She admitted she was \u201cupset\u201d at the court\u2019s ruling. <em>Id. </em>at 25. Balling up the summons, she agreed, was \u201ccontemptuous\u201d on her part. <em>Id. </em>at 30. Immediately after balling up the summons, Parham recalled, the JDR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>judge breathed \u201caahhhh\u201d into the microphone on the bench and announced the court would be in recess. <em>Id. </em>at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">Parham denied balling up the second set of papers (the custody orders), claiming the JDR judge made up that part of the story simply out of spite. Parham asserted that the only thing she did with this set of papers was to \u201cfold it up\u201d in open court. <em>Id. </em>at 30. On cross-examination, Parham acknowledged she had been previously convicted of perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The circuit court affirmed the JDR court\u2019s finding of summary contempt. The circuit court construed the JDR court\u2019s recess as an effort to \u201ccalm down\u201d the situation before issuing its written orders to Parham. <em>Id. </em>at 24. The circuit court also found that Parham\u2019s actions in open court were purposefully \u201cinsulting,\u201d <em>id., </em>giving rise to the JDR court\u2019s contempt authority to maintain the \u201cdignity\u201d of the proceeding, <em>id. </em>at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">On appeal, Parham challenges the sufficiency of the evidence as well as the admissibility of the JDR court\u2019s certificate. We find no merit in either contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Virginia courts have long recognized that the \u201cpower to punish for contempt is inherent in, and as ancient as, courts themselves.\u201d <em>Carter v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 392, 395, 345 S.E.2d 5, 7 (1986) (citations omitted). This \u201cinherent\u201d power is conferred upon Virginia courts \u201cby the very act of their creation. It is a trust confided and a duty imposed upon us by the sovereign people which we cannot surrender or suffer to be impaired without being recreant to our duty.\u201d <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>96 Va. 791, 809, 32 S.E. 780, 783 (1899).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The underlying rationale rests not only on the need to enforce judicial orders but also on the basic need to \u201cpreserve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>confidence and respect of the people without which the rights of the people cannot be maintained and enforced.\u201d <em>Carter, 2 </em>Va.App. at 395, 345 S.E.2d at 7 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">Under Virginia law, \u201c[i]t is elementary that any act which is calculated to embarrass, hinder, or obstruct the court in the administration of justice is contempt.\u201d <em>Potts v. Commonwealth, </em>184 Va. 855, 859, 36 S.E.2d 529, 530 (1946). This includes any \u201cact in disrespect of the court or its processes, or which obstructs the administration of justice, or tends to bring the court into disrepute.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Commonwealth, </em>41 Va.App. 137, 142-43, 583 S.E.2d 60, 63 (2003) (quoting <em>Carter, 2 </em>Va.App. at 396, 345 S.E.2d at 7). As Sir William Blackstone put it, contempt includes anything that demonstrates \u201ca gross want of that regard and respect, which, when once courts of justice are deprived of, their authority (so necessary for the good order of the kingdom) is entirely lost among the people.\u201d <em>Burdett v. Commonwealth, </em>103 Va. 838, 843, 48 S.E. 878, 880 (1904) (quoting 4 William Blackstone, <em>Commentaries on the Laws of England </em>*285-86 (1769)). When \u201cvindicating the dignity and authority of the court,\u201d a judge discharges a \u201csolemn duty\u201d and is not \u201cengaged in a personal and private controversy.\u201d <em>Branch v. Branch, </em>144 Va. 244, 252, 132 S.E. 303, 306 (1926) (quoting <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>96 Va. at 812, 32 S.E. at 784).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Under the common law, acts of contempt \u201care either direct, which openly insult or resist the powers of the courts, or the persons of the judges who preside there; or else are consequential [indirect], which (without such gross insolence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>or direct opposition) plainly tend to create an universal disregard of their authority.\u201d Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at *283-84. Although the common law established the power to punish contempt, <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>96 Va. at 806-07, 32 S.E. at 781-82, constitutional and statutory law set the procedural standards governing the imposition of a contempt conviction. In this respect, \u201cthe substantial difference between a direct and [indirect] contempt is one of procedure.\u201d <em>Burdett, </em>103 Va. at 845, 48 S.E. at 880. \u201cAlthough the \u2018power of the court to punish is the same,\u2019 there are two distinct types of contempt, direct and indirect.\u201d <em>Scialdone v. Commonwealth, </em>279 Va. 422, 442, 689 S.E.2d 716, 727 (2010) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Direct contempt usually arises \u201c \u2018in the face of the court\u2019 as by rude and contumelious behavior; by obstinacy, perverseness, or prevarication; by breach of the peace, or any willful disturbance whatever.\u201d Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at *285; <em>see also </em>John B. Minor, <em>Exposition of the Law of Crimes and Punishments </em>\u00a7 IV(ii)(v.), at 147 (1894) (direct contempt includes \u201crude and contumelious behavior towards the court or judge\u201d). In such circumstances, \u201cimmediate punishment is essential to prevent \u2018demoralization of the court\u2019s authority\u2019 before the public.\u201d <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 U.S. 257, 275, 68 S.Ct. 499, 509, 92 L.Ed. 682 (1948) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The governing \u201cform of procedure\u201d for summary contempt \u201cdispenses with any further proof or examination and a formal hearing.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 291, 294, 142 S.E.2d 746, 749 (1965). Since ancient times, if \u201cthe contempt be committed in the face of the court, the offender may be instantly apprehended and imprisoned, at the discretion of the judges, without any farther proof or examination.\u201d Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at *286.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cWhere misconduct oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>curs in open court, the affront to the court\u2019s dignity is more widely observed, justifying summary vindication.\u201d <em>Pounders v. Watson, </em>521 U.S. 982, 988, 117 S.Ct. 2359, 2362, 138 L.Ed.2d 976 (1997) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">In indirect contempt cases, which Blackstone called \u201cmatters that arise at a distance, and of which the court cannot have so perfect a knowledge,\u201d Blackstone, <em>supra, </em>at *286, courts must provide the full panoply of constitutional rights: notice of the charge, right to counsel, presumption of innocence, as well as the opportunity to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>See Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., </em>481 U.S. 787, 798-99, 107 S.Ct. 2124, 2132-33, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987); Scialdone, 279 Va. at 443-44, 689 S.E.2d at 728.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In 1831, the Virginia General Assembly codified the common law categories of direct contempt. See 1830-31 Va. Acts ch. 11; <em>United States v. Barnett, </em>376 U.S. 681, 722-24, 84 S.Ct. 984, 1006-07, 12 L.Ed.2d 23 (1964). This statute, \u201cin sanctioning the power of the courts to punish, as contempts, the <em>\u2018acts \u2019 </em>therein enumerated, it is merely declaratory of what the law was before its passage.\u201d <em>Carter\u2019s Case, </em>96 Va. at 809, 32 S.E. at 783 (emphasis in original). This statute, as did the common law,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">seems to embrace almost every conceivable form of that offence which can occur in the presence of, or in proximity to, the court, that is to say, under circumstances likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>arouse the passion or prejudice of the judge, and disturb that equanimity essential to calm and wise judicial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9-\"><em>Id. </em>at 814, 32 S.E. at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Following its predecessors nearly word for word, Code \u00a7 18.2-456 lists the major common law categories of direct contempt. The first, \u201cMisbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice,\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1), has remained unchanged since the original 1831 statute. .We have never defined <em>misbehavior </em>in any definitive sense\u2014nor could we. <em>See </em>Ronald J. Bacigal, <em>Criminal Offenses &amp; Defenses </em>408 (2011-12 ed.) (recognizing the term \u201ccannot be fully defined\u201d). It is assumed that reasonable people understand the line between good and bad behavior, particularly when exhibited in open court in the presence of a judge. A probationer, after all, is expected to know what his condition of good behavior means in his suspended sentence. It is not too much to expect the same from litigants appearing before a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Parham argues she did not misbehave in the presence of the JDR court. She conceded, however, in her testimony in circuit court that she acted with contemptuous intent when she balled up the summons. But she argues that balling up the court\u2019s written orders, after the JDR judge\u2019s recess, cannot fairly be described as misbehavior. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">No litigant is expected to cheerfully agree with an adverse judicial ruling. Nor, for that matter, do courts attempt to exercise any control over a disappointed litigant\u2019s temptation to harbor disrespect for either the courts or their decisions. But courts do rightly expect a disrespectful litigant to keep her insolent thoughts to herself and to refrain from exhibiting contemptuous behavior in open court. Such petulance breeds defiance of, and disdain for, the judiciary, while accomplishing absolutely nothing toward addressing the alleged error that provoked the litigant to misbehave in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">By balling up the summons and, later, the JDR court\u2019s written orders, Parham intended to display\u2014to both the court and all others in the courtroom\u2014her contemptuous disrespect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>for the JDR court and its decision. Both the JDR court and the circuit court, reviewing the decision, correctly concluded Parham committed misbehavior in the presence of the court, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Parham also argues that, even if her conduct did qualify as misconduct in open court, it cannot be said to have \u201cobstructed] or interrupted] the administration of justice\u201d as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1). We disagree with the assumption underlying Parham\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Subsection 1 applies to \u201c[misbehavior in the presence of the court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1). Given the syntax and punctuation of this provision, the necessity for showing an actual obstruction or interruption of justice does not apply to misbehavior \u201cin the presence of the court\u201d but only to misbehavior \u201cso near thereto.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Misbehavior the court directly sees or hears, therefore, can be dealt with summarily. Misbehavior outside the court\u2019s presence, on the other hand, must somehow obstruct or interrupt justice before it can be, if at all, the subject of summary contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Parham\u2019s misbehavior occurred in the presence of the JDR court and, to be sure, was clearly directed at the court. It was unnecessary for the court to find her misbehavior obstructed or interrupted justice before declaring her guilty of summary contempt. <em>Accord In re Savin, </em>131 U.S. 267, 276, 9 S.Ct. 699, 701, 33 L.Ed. 150 (1889) (\u201cThere may be misbehavior in the presence of a court amounting to contempt, that would not, ordinarily, be said to obstruct the administration of justice.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>That said, we do not mean to imply Parham\u2019s misbehavior did not obstruct or interrupt justice. The JDR court wisely took a recess in hopes of defusing the situation, creating an interruption in the proceedings for the court and everyone in the courtroom. We need not predicate our ruling on this ground, however, because misbehavior in the presence of the court may be summarily punished under Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1) without a showing of an obstruction or interruption of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Parham argues the circuit court violated her due process right to confrontation by admitting into evidence the JDR court\u2019s \u201ccertificate of the conviction and the particular circumstances of the offense\u201d required by Code \u00a7 18.2-459. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">A circuit court\u2019s review of a district court\u2019s certification under Code \u00a7 18.2-459 does not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. <em>Gilman v. Commonwealth, </em>275 Va. 222, 228, 657 S.E.2d 474, 476-77 (2008). No litigant in a summary contempt case has a right to cross-examine the judge. After all, the \u201cconfrontation\u201d guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment \u201cis confrontation <em>at trial,\u201d Nelson v. O\u2019Neil, </em>402 U.S. 622, 626, 91 S.Ct. 1728, 1726, 29 L.Ed.2d 222 (1971) (emphasis added), and one found guilty of summary contempt is not entitled to a trial, <em>United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, </em>512 U.S. 821, 832, 114 S.Ct. 2552, 2559-60, 129 L.Ed.2d 642 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Parham argues, however, that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment affords a right of confrontation where the Sixth Amendment does not. We do not follow this reasoning. If the Sixth Amendment (which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>expressly grants a \u201cright to confront\u201d) does not afford a right of confrontation to summary contempt defendants, it would be insensible to think the Due Process Clause (which does not even grant a right to trial under these circumstances) would do so. Nor would such a view be consistent with <em>Gilman\u2019s </em>holding that traditional summary contempt procedures are consistent with due process principles and need not be constrained by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s higher standards. <em>See Gilman, </em>275 Va. at 228, 657 S.E.2d at 476. For these reasons, the circuit court did not violate Parham\u2019s due process rights by admitting into evidence the JDR court\u2019s certificate required by Code \u00a7 18.2-459.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Finding the evidence sufficient and the procedures consistent with due process principles, we affirm Parham\u2019s conviction of summary contempt under Code \u00a7 18.2-456(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\">. <em>See also Yoder v.
