On appeal, she contends the evidence was insufficient to prove intent to defraud and prejudice to another. Appellant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s disqualification of her trial counsel due to a conflict of interest, and thus, she alleges she is entitled to a new trial. For the reasons stated, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">\u201cOn appeal, \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (quoting <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987)). So viewed, the evidence showed that in 2007 and 2008, appellant worked as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) at Potomac Center, a Medicaid-certified skilled nursing facility in Arlington, Virginia. As part of her duties, appellant was required to make entries on medical records showing when she administered medications according to physician\u2019s orders and when she performed certain procedures, such as turning and repositioning bed-ridden patients.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>All nurses, including appellant, were also required to document the patient\u2019s medical chart<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when medications were not administered, or when a patient refused to take medications. Appellant was also required to record in her nurse\u2019s notes when she provided incontinence care or repositioned bedridden patients to prevent bedsores. This documentation was required whether the failure to administer the medication was due to nursing error or the patient\u2019s refusal of medication or treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">J.E., a Medicaid patient, resided at Potomac Center when appellant worked there. J.E. suffered from seizure disorder, dementia with behavior disturbances, bowel problems, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that caused respiratory deficiencies. Due to his dementia, J.E. was combative and often refused to take his medication. He was characterized as a medical and behavioral \u201chigh risk\u201d due to his health problems. Because he was bedridden, J.E. was at high risk for skin breakdown and had to be turned every two hours. His treating physician, Dr. Romaldo DeSouza, prescribed a long list of medications to treat his constipation, COPD, and anxiety. The medications had to be given at certain times during the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Dr. DeSouza testified he had not seen any adverse reaction by J.E., even if he had been untimely given medications or even if he had not received his stool medications at all. J.E. had no major bed sores. However, if not given Xanax, J.E. would become more agitated.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Due to J.E.\u2019s wife\u2019s concerns that he was receiving improper care, and with her consent, a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) installed a covert video surveillance camera in J.E.\u2019s room. The surveillance took place in August and September of 2008. During surveillance, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>shown on video, appellant did not administer some medications as prescribed, but she recorded having administered these medications. Appellant also failed to perform nursing care she documented she had performed. Appellant recorded vital signs when she had not taken them, recorded turning and repositioning J.E. when she had not done so, and recorded performing incontinence care when she had not. She fabricated entries in J.E.\u2019s medical records numerous times during the surveillance period. When the FBI agent showed appellant the various medical reports in which appellant had recorded the administration of medications and treatment, appellant indicated the entries were correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Dr. Susan Levy, an expert in geriatric medicine, testified that a nurse\u2019s failure to accurately record the administration of medication is potentially dangerous, because the physician cannot provide accurate treatment with incorrect information. She testified that it is difficult for a physician to evaluate the patient\u2019s treatment plan without good documentation. Physicians rely on the medical records to evaluate whether medications should be increased, discontinued, or whether modes of treatment should be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Dr. Levy indicated that correct documentation of a patient\u2019s medication refusal is very important to physicians and that nurses are expected to make notations when medications are not consumed. Refusal to take medication triggers a reevaluation of the medication regimen. According to Levy, the type of bowel issue J.E. had, chronic ilius, could become \u201cserious very quickly\u201d and required the regular administration of laxatives. Levy explained that regular turning and repositioning for a patient like J.E. was important to prevent pressure ulcers. Pressure ulcers can potentially be fatal. Turning and repositioning also would help to keep J.E.\u2019s airways open and stimulate bowel function. J.E. was to be repositioned every two hours. Beyond that time frame, there is an increased risk of skin breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Evidence further revealed that it is crucial for one shift of nurses to keep accurate records of a patient\u2019s medication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>administration, treatment, and behavior for the next shift of nurses. This is particularly true when the patient has cognitive impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Medicaid also uses the patient\u2019s clinical records in a formula to determine reimbursement and to determine whether patients at the facility are receiving the care for which Medicaid is paying. As a result, Medicaid required Potomac Center to maintain accurate and complete patient records. In order to comply with regulations and receive reimbursement,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an employee at the Potomac Center would obtain data from the patient\u2019s clinical records and send that information to the Commonwealth of Virginia, which used the records to \u201cascertain what care an individual [was] being provided.\u201d Sanctions imposed by the Commonwealth and by the federal Medicaid program, for falsifying clinical records or for failure to provide care to a Medicaid patient, could result in civil penalties (to include civil malpractice claims), loss of licensure, or even closure, based on the level of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Assessments based on a patient\u2019s medical records are submitted to the Commonwealth to determine reimbursement rates and quality control. The <em>per diem </em>reimbursement rate is based on a resource utilization group (RUG). The RUG level is based on the amount of care and services the facility provides each patient. The greater the level of medical services, the greater the RUG level would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">A grand jury indicted appellant and a number of other employees of Potomac Center for crimes involving J.E.\u2019s care. Rod Leffler was retained counsel for six of those employees, including appellant. After a bench trial in March of 2010, the trial court convicted appellant of four counts of forgery. Sentencing was set for May 28, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">By letter dated April 26, 2010, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney offered plea agreements to two of Leffler\u2019s other clients, Abdul Sesay and Mamusu Sesay, who had been charged with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>related conduct involving J.E.\u2019s care at Potomac Center and were awaiting trial. The terms of the plea offers required those clients to cooperate with the Commonwealth and testify against the other defendants, including appellant and four others.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In May of 2010, another of Leffler\u2019s Potomac Center clients, Thomas James, was called to testify at a special grand jury after he was acquitted of criminal charges involving J.E.\u2019s care. At that grand jury, the Commonwealth offered James immunity for his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">On May 10, 2010, the Deputy Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney filed a notice and motion to disqualify Leffler as counsel due to a conflict of interest. Appellant, by counsel, filed a response asserting no conflict existed and stating she had executed a waiver of any alleged conflict.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">At the hearing on the disqualification motion on June 23, 2010, Leffler acknowledged that James had received immunity for his testimony at the grand jury and that Leffler expected that James would testify against some or all of the remaining clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">At the hearing, Leffler denied any conflict. The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney stated, \u201cMr. James has been, or will be subpoenaed to testify against his colleagues including people represented by [Leffler].\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney then stated, \u201cAnd I believe one defendant\u2014one of counsel\u2019s defendants may well testify against [appellant] in a sentencing hearing. I believe that may be Mr. James on the positioning, repositioning debate.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">The trial court expressed concern about a conflict caused by Leffler\u2019s representation of multiple clients charged with the same offenses, particularly if one client testified against another, as well as possible plea negotiations. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>inquired of Leffler, \u201cand if you\u2019re representing five, six or\u2014or I just don\u2019t know how you focus laser-like vigorously on one to the exclusion of all others. Tell me how you can do that.\u201d Leffler candidly responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer for that, Judge, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The trial court granted the motion to disqualify Leffler in all of the cases arising from the same incidents, including appellant\u2019s case. As of the date of the disqualification hearing, some of Leffler\u2019s clients had not yet been tried. On August 27, 2010, at the sentencing hearing, new counsel renewed appellant\u2019s objection to Leffler\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AmI\">I. Sufficiency</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to prove she had the intent to defraud and that there was any prejudice to another.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">\u201cWhen considering a challenge that the evidence presented at trial is insufficient, we \u2018presume the judgment of the trial court to be correct\u2019 and reverse only if the trial court\u2019s decision is \u2018plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u2019\u201d <em>Baylor v. Commonwealth, 55 </em>Va.App. 82, 86, 683 S.E.2d 843, 845 (2009) (quoting <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 96, 99, 570 S.E.2d 875, 876-77 (2002)). \u201cWe do not \u2018substitute our judgment for that of the trier of fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002)). \u201cInstead, the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319 [99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560] (1979). \u201cThis familiar standard gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number><em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>56 Va.App. 178, 184-85, 692 S.E.2d 271, 274 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Appellant was convicted of forgery under Code \u00a7 18.2-172, which provides that \u201c[i]f any person forge any writing ... to the prejudice of another\u2019s right ..., [that person] shall be guilty of a Class 5 felony.\u201d The General Assembly codified the English common law of forgery when it enacted Code \u00a7 18.2-172. <em>See Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>246 Va. 174, 182-83, 431 S.E.2d 648, 653 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">At common law, the crime of forgery \u201cis defined as \u2018the false making or materially altering with intent to defraud, of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy, or the foundation of legal liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fitzgerald v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 171, 173, 313 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1984) (quoting <em>Bullock v. Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 558, 561, 138 S.E.2d 261, 264 (1964)). A document or instrument is one of legal efficacy \u201cwhere <em>by any possibility </em>it may operate to the injury of another.\u201d <em>Gordon v. Commonwealth, </em>100 Va. 825, 829, 41 S.E. 746, 748 (1902) (emphasis added). Therefore, to sustain a conviction under the modern forgery statute, the Commonwealth must prove that the forged or altered document operated to the <em>actual or potential </em>prejudice of another. <em>See Muhammad v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 194, 199, 409 S.E.2d 818, 821 (1991) (holding that the \u201cbare possibility\u201d of prejudice is sufficient under Code \u00a7 18.2-172).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">To prove a forgery under the statute, the Commonwealth was required to prove only that the forged document had the potential to operate \u201cto the prejudice of another.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-172. \u201c \u2018The purpose of the statute against forgery is to protect society against the fabrication, falsification and the uttering of instruments which <em>might </em>be acted upon as being genuine.\u2019 \u201d <em>Muhammad, </em>13 Va.App. at 199, 409 S.E.2d at 821 (quoting <em>Mayes v. State, </em>264 Ark. 283, 571 S.W.2d 420, 427 (1978)) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">Appellant challenges the sufficiency of proof only with regards to \u201cintent to defraud\u201d and \u201cprejudice.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201cIntent to defraud\u201d has been defined by this Court as acting \u201cwith an evil intent, or with the specific intent to deceive or trick.\u201d <em>Campbell v.

We must \u201c \u2018look to the conduct and representation of the defendant.\u2019\u201d <em>Rader v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 325, 329, 423 S.E.2d 207, 210 (1992) (quoting <em>Norman v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 518, 519, 346 S.E.2d 44, 45 (1986)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><em>Burrell v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 72, 86-87, 646 S.E.2d 35, 42 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Appellant contends that even if she failed to accurately document what she did or did not do, such does not prove intent to defraud. She argues there was no proof that she benefited from her actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">The Commonwealth responds that the sheer number of false entries (at least 50 documented violations were introduced at trial) is evidence of a fraudulent intent. The Commonwealth points to appellant\u2019s experience as an LPN, her training, and her knowledge of Potomac Center\u2019s policy of accurate documentation as further evidence of appellant\u2019s intent to defraud. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Here, appellant\u2019s failure to accurately document was not an isolated event, but was a pattern of behavior to misrepresent the status of the patient\u2019s treatment and medication. <em>See, e.g. McCary v. Commonwealth, </em>42 Va.App. 119, 129, 590 S.E.2d 110, 116 (2003) (holding, in a construction fraud case, that a pattern of similar behavior was probative of fraudulent intent). The trial court so found in this case. Further, the trial court rejected appellant\u2019s trial testimony that her documentation was accurate. Having rejected the credibility of her testimony, the trial court could consider that perjured testimony as additional evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt. <em>See Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 296, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 2492, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>(1992); <em>Morris v. Commonwealth, </em>269 Va. 127, 133-34, 607 S.E.2d 110, 114 (2005) (\u201cAnd, upon finding Morris\u2019s testimony unworthy of belief, the'trial judge could draw the reasonable inference that Morris testified falsely \u2018in an effort to conceal his guilt.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Covil v. Commonwealth, </em>268 Va. 692, 696, 604 S.E.2d 79, 82 (2004))); <em>see also Spangler v. Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 436, 438, 50 S.E.2d 265, 266 (1948) (explaining that, when a defendant \u201cproceeds to introduce evidence in his own behalf,\u201d the prosecution\u2019s case \u201cmay be strengthened by defendant\u2019s evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Clearly, appellant knew the importance of maintaining accurate medical records, based on her experience and training. She knew the medical repercussions of faulty recordkeeping. She also knew that J.E. had many medical issues requiring the timely administration of medications and other treatment essential to his health.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">As to appellant\u2019s contention that she had no intent to defraud because she received no benefit from her failures, we find no merit to this argument. It is reasonable for the fact finder to conclude that appellant received the benefit of being paid for work she did not perform and that she benefitted from masking her dereliction of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Next, appellant argues there was no evidence that anyone suffered prejudice. She cites Dr. DeSouza\u2019s testimony that J.E. was not affected by appellant\u2019s failure to administer medications or reposition him. DeSouza testified he saw no signs of major bed sores.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">This argument is flawed because it does not accurately portray the case law. Actual prejudice is not required. As we have already noted, to uphold a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-172, the evidence must show only the possibility that the forged instrument may operate to the prejudice of another\u2019s right. <em>See Gordon, </em>100 Va. at 829, 41 S.E. at 748; <em>Muhammad, </em>13 Va.App. at 196-97, 409 S.E.2d at 819-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">J.E. was an elderly, infirmed patient. He was undoubtedly deprived of necessary medications. According to Dr. Levy, J.E.\u2019s bowel condition could become serious very quickly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>required the regular administration of laxatives. Regular turning and repositioning was important to prevent pressure ulcers, to keep J.E.\u2019s airways open, and to stimulate bowel function. Evidence also revealed that failure to maintain accurate medical records compromised the physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 ability to formulate or modify treatment and medication regimens. Clearly, J.E. was exposed to actual and potential prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Potomac Center was mandated by state and federal Medicaid regulations to maintain accurate medical records. Failure to do so would result in sanctions, ranging from civil penalties to loss of licensure and closure. These facts plainly indicate potential prejudice to the center.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Lastly, falsified records showing treatment performed and medications administered are factors that ultimately determine the level of Medicaid reimbursement. While this reimbursement is on a <em>per diem </em>basis, the amount of treatment and medications given to a particular patient are used in a formula to determine the <em>per diem </em>reimbursement. Thus, the trial court could properly conclude Medicaid was also prejudiced by appellant\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The trial court did not err in finding the evidence was sufficient to convict appellant of four counts of forgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">II. Disqualification</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Appellant assigns error to the trial court disqualifying trial counsel because of a conflict of interest in his representation of appellant and five other defendants involved in the care of J.E. Appellant asserts in her last two assignments of error that because any alleged conflict would have existed prior to and during the guilt phase of her trial, she is entitled to a new trial. She further asserts she is entitled to a new trial because one of the bases of the conflict was the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer that it would call one of Leffler\u2019s other clients, James. James, however, was not subpoenaed nor called as a witness at appellant\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The Supreme Court of the United States explained in <em>Wheat v. United States, </em>486 U.S. 153, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988), that \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment right to choose one\u2019s own counsel is circumscribed in several important respects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 108 S.Ct. at 1697. The Supreme Court also recognized the trial court\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the needs of fairness, as well as the judiciary\u2019s \u201cindependent interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within the ethical standards of the profession and that legal proceedings appear fair to all who observe them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 160, 108 S.Ct. at 1697. The aim of the Sixth Amendment is \u201cto guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant rather than to ensure that a defendant will inexorably be represented by the lawyer whom he prefers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159, 108 S.Ct. at 1697.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">This Court applied <em>Wheat </em>to <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>50 Va.App. 600, 652 S.E.2d 156 (2007). In <em>Johnson, </em>appellant waived a potential conflict from representation by his attorney, who also represented a potential witness against appellant. Counsel had also obtained a waiver from the eyewitness. Nevertheless, the trial court disqualified appellant\u2019s attorney and appointed substitute counsel. On appeal, Johnson claimed the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Citing <em>Wheat, </em>we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">[TJrial courts must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a <em>potential for conflict exists </em>which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses. This standard gives trial courts broad latitude because the likelihood and dimensions of nascent conflicts of interest are notoriously hard to predict, even for those thoroughly familiar with criminal trials. It necessarily follows that the trial court has a unique obligation to foresee problems over representation that might arise at trial and head them off beforehand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">Appellate courts must rely heavily on a trial court\u2019s instinct and judgment based on experience in making its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>decision. It should be no surprise, then, that different trial courts faced with the similar circumstances would reach opposite conclusions with equal justification, but that does not mean that one conclusion was \u201cright\u201d and the other \u201cwrong.\u201d The evaluation of the facts and circumstances of each case under this standard, therefore, must be left primarily to the informed judgment of the trial court. When reasonable jurists could disagree, the trial court\u2019s ruling should stand on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><em>Johnson, </em>50 Va.App. at 605-06, 652 S.E.2d at 158-59 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\"><em>Johnson </em>is controlling here. In <em>Johnson, </em>we affirmed the trial court and observed \u201cat trial, [counsel] would have found himself in an intractable dilemma; either he could vigorously cross-examine Coleman in an effort to discredit Coleman\u2019s sworn testimony, or he could weaken the intensity of cross-examination (perhaps even abandon the effort altogether) out of a desire to protect Coleman.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606, 652 S.E.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">We concluded that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not \u2018demand that a court honor [a] waiver of conflict-free representation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 607, 652 S.E.2d at 159 (quoting <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 152, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2565, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cInstitutional interest in the appearance, as well as the reality, of propriety cannot be vitiated merely by a client\u2019s waiver.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">This appeal presents a similar conflict to the one in <em>Johnson. </em>Leffler represented multiple co-defendants, some of whom, as part of a written plea agreement, agreed to testify against other co-defendants. By doing so, Leffler put himself in \u201can intractable dilemma.\u201d As an example, if one of Leffler\u2019s clients testified against appellant at sentencing or against any other co-defendant at trial, he would be pitting one client against the other, as the trial court correctly observed. Further, a vigorous cross-examination of that client might be in the best interest of appellant or a co-defendant on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>trial, but may be injurious to the interests of that witness, such as prosecution for perjury. For example, if a co-defendant testified against appellant, he would satisfy the conditions of his plea agreement, but would potentially harm appellant\u2019s case. If the co-defendant did not testify against appellant, he would violate the conditions of his suspended sentence. Indeed, when asked how he could vigorously focus on one client\u2019s interest to the exclusion of the others, Leffler candidly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer for that, Judge, I don\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">As the trial court pointed out, a conflict may arise in negotiating plea agreements for other clients. As with Abdul Sesay and Mamusu Sesay, the Commonwealth may very well insist on testimony against co-defendants. Yet such an agreement would be detrimental to other co-defendants who may then be exposed to damaging testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Appellant next contends that one of the Commonwealth\u2019s reasons to move for Leffler\u2019s disqualification was that they would call another of Leffler\u2019s clients to testify against appellant at sentencing. Because James was neither subpoenaed nor called, appellant reasons that the basis for disqualification never materialized, thus disqualification was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">This argument fails for two reasons. First, it is of no moment that James was not called as a witness. The issue is whether, at the time of the disqualification hearing, there was a potential conflict by Leffler\u2019s representation of two clients, one of whom may testify against the other. As stated above, the standard is whether \u201ca <em>potential for conflict </em>exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>50 Va.App. at 605, 652 S.E.2d at 158 (emphasis in original). \u201c[W]e judge the trial court\u2019s ruling in light of the circumstances facing it as the time of the pretrial decision to disqualify, not through the lens of hindsight after the trial has come to a close.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608, 652 S.E.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Second, in considering a potential conflict, we do not look at subsequent events. The trial court, in granting the motion, considered Leffler\u2019s representation of Abdul Sesay and Mamusu Sesay, as well as possible plea negotiations for other co-defendants. The trial court considered potential conflicts with multiple clients, including James.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Finally, appellant contends if a conflict arose, it arose prior to her trial, when the Commonwealth made an oral offer to one of Leffler\u2019s other clients. She asserts that because of the conflict, Leffler should not have represented her at all, and thus the guilty verdict should be set aside. This argument is premised on appellant\u2019s assertion that the plea agreements creating a conflict were in place prior to appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">However, no evidence, nor proffer, revealed what the earlier oral plea offer encompassed. There was nothing to suggest that any part of the oral offer created a potential conflict, such as one co-defendant testifying against another. Thus, appellant\u2019s assertion that a conflict existed prior to appellant\u2019s trial is pure speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">We note that the written plea offers to Abdul Sesay and Mamusu Sesay, both dated April 26, 2010, were made subsequent to appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We therefore conclude appellant is not entitled to a new trial because there is no evidence a conflict existed prior to appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in disqualifying Leffler.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the evidence in the record proves beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant is guilty of forgery under Code \u00a7 18.2-172. Further, the trial judge correctly disqualified appellant\u2019s counsel due to a potential conflict in his representation. Therefore, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-11\">.
