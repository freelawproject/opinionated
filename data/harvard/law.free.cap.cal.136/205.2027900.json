Plaintiff is both an appropriator of water from the stream and a riparian proprietor. Defendants are riparian proprietors, owning lands upon the stream above plaintiff. This dam is constructed upon defendants\u2019 lands. Judgment was rendered declaring the dam a nuisance and ordering defendants to abate it. They appeal from that judgment and also from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">As riparian proprietors, defendants were entitled to a rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>sonable use of the waters of the creek upon their lands for domestic and irrigating purposes <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>93 Cal. 676), and upon this point the court made the following finding of fact: \u201cThat said dam prior to the commencement of this suit, and ever since, has prevented all and every part of the water above said dam from flowing down said stream and watercourse, and the said water is entirely prevented from flowing over and by said dam to plaintiff\u2019s lands, and the said dam has diminished the quantity of water in its natural flow, and does prevent the running of said water in said creek and watercourse, as it was accustomed to run in the state of nature; and by reason of said dam so constructed and maintained across said watercourse, the water is backed up and spread over a large surface, by reason of which a large portion thereof has and does become lost by absorption and evaporation, and this plaintiff is thereby deprived of the use of the same; and all of said water is by said dam prevented from flowing to plaintiff\u2019s premises, as it would have done had it not been for the dam so erected and maintained by said defendants.\u201d The evidence supports the foregoing finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">It seems to be plain that the defendants\u2019 use, as indicated by the foregoing finding of fact, is not a reasonable one. It is said in the case above cited, \u201cthat no proprietor can absorb all the water of the stream so as to allow none to flow down to his neighbor.\u201d In <em>Lux </em>v. <em>Haggin, </em>69 Cal. 394, it is said: \u201cWhat is such reasonable use is a question of fact, and depends upon the circumstances appearing in each particular case.\u201d In <em>Ferrea </em>v. <em>Knipe, </em>28 Cal. 340,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we find a case, as to its facts, substantially similar to the case now before the court, and the syllabus there found correctly declares the principle of law here involved, in the following language: \u201cIt is not a reasonable use of water for a riparian proprietor, who desires to use the same for watering cattle and for domestic purposes, to erect dams across the stream, by which the water is spread out and lost by evaporation and absorption so as to injure another riparian proprietor below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Some point is made upon the claim that the waters impounded by the dam find their source in springs situated upon defendants\u2019 lands. If this be so, still, after these waters pass from the springs into the watercourse, whatever property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>rights defendants had in the use of them, by reason of their ownership of the land upon which the springs were situated, were\" lost. <em>(Eddy </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>3 Cal. 253.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">It is also claimed that plaintiff does not allege himself to be a riparian owner, but only asserts his rights as an appropriator. Even conceding the claim well made, still plaintiff, as an appropriator, has a right to have this dam abated under the facts disclosed by the finding made by the trial court heretofore quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">There are no other matters demanding the consideration of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Van Dyke, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> 87 Am.
