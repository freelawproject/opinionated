It is further found that, if defendant is permitted so to use this name in connection with its business, plaintiffs will be greatly damaged thereby. Upon general principles of equity, the acts of defendant here detailed will not be countenanced by the courts. If it be conceded that the word \u201cCyclops\u201d in this particular instance is the trade-name of plaintiffs rather than their trade-mark, that fact is not material. By a long-continued, exclusive user, plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest have acquired property rights in the use of the word which defendant is bound to respect. <em>(Weinstock, Lubin &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Marks, </em>109 Cal. 529.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Section 991 of the Civil Code provides: \u201cOne who . . . conducts a particular business may appropriate to his exclusive use as a trade-mark any form, symbol, or name which has not been so appropriated by another, to designate the origin or ownership thereof.\u201d Under the provisions of this section plaintiffs, by an exclusive user' of the name \u2018 \u2018 Cyclops, \u2019 \u2019 gained rights in its use which a court of equity will protect. And that the word \u201cCyclops\u201d is a word' in which the right of exclusive user may be created, the court has no doubt. Neither does the court attach any importance to the fact that defendant is incorporated under the name of \u201cThe Cyclops Iron Works.\u201d If an individual would not be allowed to use the word \u201cCyclops\u201d under the circumstances here pictured by the complaint and findings, a corporation may not take the word as a part of its corporate name, and thus, by indirection, accomplish ends otherwise forbidden by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">Van Dyke, J., and Harrison, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\"> 50 Am.
