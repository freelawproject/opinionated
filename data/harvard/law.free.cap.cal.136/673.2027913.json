The action was brought by the plaintiff against the defendants to quiet his title to certain'mining property. Two of the defendants,\u2014the respondents herein,\u2014in addition to answering the complaint, filed a cross-complaint against the plaintiff and one of their co-defendants, upon which judgment was rendered in their favor and against the defendants in the cross-complaint, and the appeal is from that judgment. While the trial of the issues presented under this cross-complaint is in the action brought by the plaintiff against the several defendants, the judgment is in legal effect the same as if the cross-complainants had instituted an original action against the plaintiff and their co-defendant, and obtained judgment therein. The judgment is against the appellants herein, and the fact that they were on opposite sides of the record in the original complaint does not impair their right to unite in the appeal or to give a joint notice of appeal any more than if they had been defendants in an original action against them by the respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">2. In the undertaking filed herein the sureties \u201cdo hereby jointly and severally undertake and promise on the part of the appellants that the said appellants will pay all damages and costs which may be awarded against them on appeal or on a dismissal thereof, not to exceed $300.\u201d The code does not require a separate undertaking on the part of each appellant, its provision being (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 941) that it must be executed \u201con the part of the appellant\u201d by two sureties to the effect \u201cthat the appellant will pay\u201d the damages and costs that may be awarded him on the appeal. By section 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cthe single number includes the plural,\u201d and there is the same reason for holding that the appellants may unite in the undertaking as in the notice of appeal. The omission of a payee in the undertaking is immaterial. The code does not require that it shall contain the name of the payee, and a proper construction of the undertaking herein renders the sureties liable thereon to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>respondents. Aside from these considerations, as the undertaking in the present case is in the form which has been in use for many years, we would not feel justified in disturbing so long and well-settled a practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">3. In his certificate attached to the transcript the clerk certifies that \u201ca good and sufficient undertaking on appeal in due form was properly filed herein.\u201d This complies with the requirements of the code (sec. 953); and is <em>prima facie </em>sufficient. <em>(Meeker </em>v. <em>Hoffer, </em>57 Cal. 140.) If the certificate was incorrect, it was incumbent upon the respondents to make that fact to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Garoutte, J., and Van Dyke, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
