L. c. 209A abuse prevention order entered after notice on March 13, 2017, and its one-year extension issued by a different judge, entered on April 5, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate, at either hearing, that she was in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious harm. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff filed an application for a 209A order, and an ex parte order issued, on March 3, 2017. With minor variations, the facts presented at the ex parte hearing and at the two hearings after notice, based on the plaintiff's affidavit and testimony, were the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The plaintiff and the defendant had been married for eleven years. The plaintiff had recently informed the defendant that she was unhappy in the marriage, and the couple had begun marriage counselling. The defendant became depressed, gained weight, and started hoarding. His attitude and conduct toward the plaintiff became increasingly erratic and paranoid, and he became intrusive and confrontational. He began searching through her telephone, electronic mail, trash, and purse. He photocopied notes in her purse that she had written for discussion with their counsellor and accused her of cheating on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before work on the morning of March 3, 2017, the plaintiff met with a friend at her previous place of employment in Agawam. The defendant telephoned her to ask where she was and to talk about their relationship. The plaintiff said that she was seeing a friend and that it was not a good time to talk. Twenty minutes later, the defendant arrived at the building where the plaintiff had met her friend and confronted her about not spending time with him to work on their relationship. The plaintiff again told him that she did not want to talk, and she asked him to leave her alone so she could go to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Instead, when the plaintiff drove to work in Holyoke, the defendant followed closely behind in his truck. Frightened by the defendant's behavior, the plaintiff tried to telephone the security department at her workplace for an escort into the building. Unable to reach the security department, she parked in front of the building entrance. The defendant parked his car directly behind the plaintiff's car, and as she started to enter the building, again insisted that the plaintiff talk with him. When she declined and asked him to leave, the defendant started to get inside the plaintiff's car. She told him to get out of her car, but he refused, insisting that if she would not speak with him, the marriage was over and he wanted her out of the house. The plaintiff then went inside the building to get someone from security. The defendant got into his truck and drove away before security officers arrived outside. The plaintiff went to court that same day to apply for a 209A order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff testified that this incident, combined with the defendant's recent escalating erratic conduct and past incidents, caused her to fear for her safety. The defendant had been verbally abusive throughout their marriage, calling her derogatory names in front of family members. Several years before he had picked up the family's dog by the neck and punched it in the head after it scratched the paint of his truck. About one year before the plaintiff sought the 209A order, in the course of an argument with her, he punched a wall in the kitchen, breaking the sheetrock. She was also afraid because the defendant owned more than fifty guns, which at times throughout their marriage he had failed to secure properly; however, there was no evidence that he had ever misused or threatened her with a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"We review the issuance of an order pursuant to G.

The plaintiff described violent and abusive episodes leading up to her decision to end the marriage (she filed for divorce in the time between the two hearings). In the days leading up to the issuance of the ex parte order, the defendant's behavior had become increasingly erratic, paranoid, and possessive in response to the plaintiff's estrangement. The behavior culminated with the defendant, after being asked to leave the plaintiff alone, seeking her out where she had met a friend. He then followed her to her workplace, and when he was again asked to leave, he instead got into her car demanding that she speak with him.
