The loan's interest rate was 5.875 percent and the maturity date was March 1, 2038. The note was secured with a mortgage signed by Vasko. The mortgage was filed on March 4, 2008, with the Wood County Recorder. In addition, an undated allonge was attached to the note, which contained the indorsement \"Pay to the Order of\" BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., fka, Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P. (\"BAC\"), and was signed by Realty's vice president.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On June 14, 2010, a complaint in foreclosure was filed by BAC against Vasko and others in Wood County Court of Common Pleas, being case No. 2010CV0565. The case was dismissed without prejudice in May 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On March 14, 2012, Bank of America, N.A., Successor by Merger to BAC (\"BOA\"), filed a complaint in foreclosure against Vasko and others in Wood County Court of Common Pleas, being case No. 2012CV0208. In July 2013, summary judgment was granted to BOA. In December 2014, a joint motion to vacate judgment was filed and an order was entered by the\n   court dismissing the complaint without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In August 2012, Vasko executed a Revolving Promissory Note (\"revolving note\") in the amount of $180,000 in favor of appellant. An Open-End Mortgage on the property was given by Vasko to appellant to secure the revolving note. On October 19, 2012, this mortgage was recorded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On September 1, 2014, BOA and Vasko entered into a Loan Modification Agreement (\"the Modification\") which referenced the note and the mortgage previously recorded on March 4, 2008. The principal amount of the Modification was $141,923.11, the interest rate was 4.625 percent, the new maturity date was August 1, 2044, and the monthly mortgage payments were lowered from $995.63 to $815.92. The Modification was recorded on October 2, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In April 2016, BOA filed a complaint for money judgment and foreclosure against Vasko, appellant and others in Wood County Court of Common Pleas, being case No. 2016CV0215. Appellant filed a counterclaim against BOA and sought a declaration that appellant has the first valid lien on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In January 2017, BOA filed a motion for summary judgment on appellant's counterclaim. Appellant filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On March 22, 2017, the court granted summary judgment to BOA and found the recording of the Modification did not affect the priority of the original mortgage. In support of its finding, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    Community Action Commt. of Pike Cty., Inc. v. Maynard\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.

Appellant appealed; the appeal was dismissed as the judgment was not a final appealable order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On April 13, 2017, BOA filed a motion to substitute party plaintiff requesting that Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Bayview\") be substituted for BOA. In the motion, BOA represented the mortgage loan was transferred to Bayview, and Bayview is now the holder of the note and mortgage. The trial court granted the motion on April 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On April 25, 2017, Bayview filed a motion for default judgment against Vasko and his unknown spouse, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On April 27, 2017, the trial court issued a Final Judgment Entry for Foreclosure which encompassed all matters before the court. The court made numerous finding including: Vasko and his unknown spouse, if any, were in default; the United States of America may have a right, title, interest or claim upon the property; the Treasurer of Wood County, Ohio, was due taxes and assessments on the property; there was due to Bayview on the note $136,341.62 plus interest, and there may be due to Bayview any monies advanced for real estate taxes, insurance and property protection; to secure payment of the note, Vasko executed a mortgage, recorded on March 4, 2008; there was no just reason for delay; and, the property shall be foreclosed and sold and the proceeds distributed first to the Wood County Clerk of Courts, then the Treasurer of Wood County, then Bayview, and any balance to the clerk pending further court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    First Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Appellant contends the trial court erred when it held the \"effective/priority date\" of the Modification relates back to the same \"effective/ priority date\" as the original mortgage lien.

The bank had entered into a construction loan agreement with the project property owner and had judgment liens on the subject property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20N.E.3d%20529\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The bank and project property owner also entered into several mortgage modifications because the owner purchased additional property for the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The bank asserted its mortgage had priority over the mechanic's liens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The trial court found the mechanic's lien had priority over the bank's mortgage because the modifications added significant property and did not include a construction mortgage covenant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. On appeal, the bank claimed the trial court erred, inter alia, because its mortgage lien was superior in priority as it arose from a construction mortgage and an open-end mortgage, and the modifications were contemplated by the terms of the original mortgage and related back to the date of the mortgage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15. The appellate court noted R.C. 5301.231 does not define the phrase \"shall take effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48. The court then found \"based on our review of similar statutes,\" the phrase means a modification is invalid as against other creditors until recorded, and the modification's priority is determined as of the date of recording, not the date the original mortgage was recorded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Our review of these cases causes us to conclude that we should follow the rationale and holding in\n   <em>\n    Community Action\n   </em>\n   , where the court supported its conclusion with a detailed analysis. In contrast, the court in\n   <em>\n    Panzica\n   </em>\n   did not undertake such an in-depth analysis in reaching its conclusion that the modifications take effect when recorded. Moreover, the fact situation in\n   <em>\n    Community Action\n   </em>\n   is aligned with the facts of this case, as both cases involved a modification of a note where there were no additional funds, the interest rate was not increased, the repayment period was extended and the monthly payments were reduced. Whereas in\n   <em>\n    Panzica\n   </em>\n   , the fact pattern involved a construction loan, several modifications and mechanic's liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We therefore find the recording of the Modification did not affect the priority\n   of the original mortgage. Thus, Bayview's lien has priority over appellant's lien. Accordingly, the trial court did not error when it found, between competing lienholders, the \"effective/priority date\" of the Modification relates back to the same \"effective/ priority date\" as the original mortgage. It follows that appellant's first assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Second Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Appellant contends BOA failed to attach the Modification to its motion to substitute party plaintiff, filed on April 13, 2017, so the substitution order should be vacated. Appellant also advances the argument that BOA did not enter into a mortgage assignment directly with Bayview. Instead, appellant submits BOA assigned to HUD BOA's interest in the February 25, 2008 mortgage, and not the Modification. Then, HUD assigned its interest in the February 25, 2008 mortgage, and not the Modification, to Bayview. As such, appellant asserts, \"it is not a stretch to characterize\" these mortgage assignments \"as an effort by BOA to 'launder' its Loan Modification Agreement * * * out of the 'chain-of-title' of the mortgage assigned to * * * Bayview by HUD, not * * *BOA.\" Based on this, appellant maintains Bayview does not have a right, title and interest in the Modification, upon which the foreclosure action is based. Appellant submits \"[s]uch failure to assign Bayview the right, title, and interest in the operative modified mortgage * * * directly impacts * * * the efficacy of the April 27, 2017 Final Judgment * * *.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Bayview counters the substitution of a party is not a substantive issue and substitution was not required, as the action could have continued in BOA's name. Bayview observes appellant does not dispute that BOA transferred its interest in the note to Bayview, and the transfer of a note acts as an equitable assignment of the mortgage. Thus, Bayview contends the trial court did not abuse it discretion by granting the substitution when there is no dispute that the note was transferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Civ.R. 25(C) provides that a party to whom an interest has been transferred may be substituted in an action in place of the party that previously held the interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boedeker v.

With respect to the mortgage assignment, appellant was not a party to the mortgage assignment, and has not claimed the status as a third-party beneficiary to the assigned mortgage. As such, appellant does not have standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage. As to the court's order substituting Bayview as a plaintiff, a review of the record shows the trial court allowed Bayview, as the holder of the note and mortgage, to be substituted for BOA upon its finding that good cause had been shown. We conclude the trial court's decision to grant the motion to substitute party was not arbitrary, unconscionable or unreasonable, and therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, appellant's second assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    Third Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant contends the trial court's April 27, 2017 Final Judgment Entry of Foreclosure exceeded the relief sought by Bayview in its April 25, 2017 motion for default judgment and far exceeded the scope of Civ.R. 55. In addition, appellant argues the court's judgment failed to reference or include appellant's mortgage and the Modification and, therefore, should be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} We review a trial court judgment granting a motion for default using an abuse of discretion standard.\n   <em>\n    Tikaradze v. Kenwood Garden Apts.\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist. Lucas No. L-11-1217,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012-Ohio-3735\">\n    2012-Ohio-3735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203548204\">\n    2012 WL 3548204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Civ.R. 55(C) provides in relevant part that \"a judgment by default is subject to the limitations of Rule 54(C).\" In turn, Civ.R. 54(C) states in pertinent part that \"[a] judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount that prayed for in the demand for judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Here, in BOA's complaint for money judgment and foreclosure against Vasko, BOA alleged Vasko defaulted under the terms of the note and Modification. BOA sought enforcement of the mortgage as its conditions had been broken, and BOA has the right to foreclose on the property. BOA named defendants, United States of America, appellant and Treasurer of Wood County, Ohio, as parties who may claim an interest in the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 35} A review of the record shows the trial court, in granting the motion for default, awarded Bayview the relief its predecessor sought in the complaint. In its judgment, the trial court set forth \"Vasko [was] in default of Answer or other pleading and thereby confesses the allegations of the Complaint to be true.\" The court further stated \"the liens of any parties that have filed an answer asserting a valid and subsisting lien are hereby transferred to proceeds.\" The court then ordered the distribution of the proceeds to certain parties. We therefore conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rendering its April 27, 2017 judgment. Accordingly, appellant's third assignment of error is not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 36} The judgments of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas are affirmed. Appellant is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal, pursuant to App.R. 24, and the clerk is ordered to serve all parties with notice of this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Mark L.
