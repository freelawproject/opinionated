Like conventional mace, a pepper spray canister is \"dangerous per se because it was designed for the sole purpose of bodily assault or defense and was constructed to inflict serious bodily harm through incapacitation, and because, in these circumstances, the defendant used it in a manner consistent with its design.\"\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299082\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/265/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299082\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/265/\">\n    . at 269-270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's claim, the fact that the verdict in\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   (unlike in this case) was supported with expert testimony on the properties and physiological effects mace has on a person is of no legal significance because the evidence here was still sufficient to establish pepper spray as dangerous per se. In fact, because the evidence supported a rational conclusion that the pepper spray was designed and had an intended purpose to inflict the requisite degree of bodily harm, it was permissible for the jury to conclude it was dangerous per se. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299082\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/265/\">\n     ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299082\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/265/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Similarly, the victim's testimony, which the defendant views as minimizing her injuries, does not affect our conclusion that the evidence established that pepper spray is dangerous per se. Even if the victim \"did not actually suffer serious bodily injury, something we need not decide, the [pepper spray] was nonetheless inherently dangerous because of its capacity to inflict serious harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299082\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/265/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"299082\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/55/265/\">\n    . at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted), citing\n   <em>\n    Appleby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478899\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/296/#p303\">\n    380 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   307 n.6.

For the first time on appeal, the defendant claims the judge erred in his jury instruction on dangerous per se, and that he failed to instruct the jury on dangerous as used.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tarrant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869101\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/367/411/\">\n    367 Mass. 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975), the Supreme Judicial Court held that where it appears that the \"instrumentality is ... designed to produce death or serious bodily injury,\" the instrumentality qualifies as dangerous as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869101\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/367/411/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869101\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/367/411/\">\n    . at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, \"where the instrumentality is not per se harm-inducing it is a question of fact for the jury whether the circumstances surrounding the presence of the instrumentality suggest its latent character as dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869101\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/367/411/\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3869101\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/367/411/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Appleby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"478899\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/380/296/#p303\">\n    380 Mass. at 303-304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because dangerousness per se was a question of law, the judge did not err in instructing as he did, and thus there is no risk that justice miscarried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant also claims the judge failed to instruct the jury on the required factors for them to assess whether pepper spray was dangerous as used. We disagree. First, the defendant did not request such an instruction. Second, the judge was not required to sua sponte instruct in this manner given that the jury had already been told pepper spray was dangerous per se. Third, the gravamen of the defense was that the defendant was not the assailant and the can of pepper spray found in the defendant's vicinity was not employed in the attack. In fact, the defense argued that the victim's injuries were inconsistent with someone who had been sprayed with pepper spray. Had the judge instructed on dangerous as used, it would have conflicted with the defense. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Proulx\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"511587\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/61/454/#p464\">\n    61 Mass.

Also for the first time on appeal, the defendant claims that witnesses improperly provided their opinions on the meaning of the phrase \"run what you got,\" and as a result gave an opinion as to the ultimate issue of his intent to rob. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, two police officers testified that the phrase in question was meant as a demand for the person to whom it was directed to turn over his or her belongings. However, the officers' testimony was at best cumulative of what the victim herself described it meant to her, i.e., that the assailant wanted her to \"give him what [she had].\" It was certainly permissible for the victim to explain the manner in which the assailant attempted to rob her and its effect on her. In conjunction with the victim's testimony, both officers opined as to the meaning of a phrase that may not have been obvious to the jury. As in other instances, the witnesses in this case merely explained the significance and meaning of the evidence.
