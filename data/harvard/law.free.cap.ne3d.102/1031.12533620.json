McKnight (wife), the former wife of Benjamin P. Fisher (husband), primarily challenges the aspects of the divorce judgment relating to legal custody of the parties' minor child, parenting time, child support, and attorney's fees. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the portions of the divorce judgment relating to legal custody, parenting time, and attorney's fees, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order. The remainder of the divorce judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The parties were married in August of 2005, and had one child together. In April of 2014, the wife filed a complaint for divorce in the Probate and Family Court. On August 1, 2014, following a hearing, a judge of the Probate and Family Court issued an order appointing a guardian ad litem (GAL) to investigate, evaluate, and prepare a report regarding the best interests of the parties' child in relation to custody and parenting time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the same day, a pretrial notice and order issued indicating that the case may go to immediate trial if the judge determines that \"one party, by failure to appear at the pre-trial conference or otherwise, will not present a case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In August of 2014, the parties entered into a stipulation providing that the wife would have primary physical custody of the child, and the husband would have unsupervised parenting time every other weekend, along with dinner visits on Wednesday evenings. In December of 2014, the parties entered into a stipulation requiring the husband to pay base child support of $380 per week, along with additional child support equivalent to ten percent of his bonus income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On August 5, 2015, the wife and her counsel appeared for the pretrial conference. The husband did not appear. The wife testified that the husband indicated he would not participate in the litigation. The judge credited the wife's testimony, found that the husband did not intend to present a case, and proceeded to an immediate trial on the wife's complaint for divorce (first trial). At the first trial, the judge heard testimony from the wife, admitted the GAL report as an exhibit, and instructed the wife to submit a proposed divorce judgment (proposed judgment). In her proposed judgment, the wife requested (1) sole legal and physical custody of the child, with supervised parenting time for the husband; (2) $399.69 per week in base child support,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   along with additional child support equivalent to twenty percent of the husband's bonus income; (3) a division of marital assets under which the parties would retain their respective retirement accounts, bank accounts, and liabilities;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) and a lump sum of $15,000 to cover her attorney's fees. The wife also filed a separate motion seeking $15,000 in attorney's fees on August 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On August 19, 2015, the husband filed a motion to vacate default and requested that the matter be set for trial if he and the wife were unable to \"agree on custody or financial arrangements.\" On September 17, 2015, both parties and their counsel appeared for a hearing on the husband's motion to vacate. At the hearing, the husband indicated that the only issue in dispute was legal custody of the parties' child. On September 18, 2015, the judge issued an order (1) denying the husband's request to vacate on the basis that judgment had not yet entered in the case, and (2) allowing the husband's request for a new trial on the sole contested issue of legal custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December of 2015, the wife filed a complaint for contempt, alleging that the husband was in arrears of his child support payments in the amount of $13,172.02. The contempt matter was thereafter consolidated with the second trial per the wife's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Both parties and their counsel appeared for the second trial, which commenced on December 16, 2015, and concluded on January 12, 2016, after three days of hearing. At the second trial, the judge heard testimony from both parties and the GAL. On April 21, 2016, the judge issued a divorce judgment, providing, in relevant part, that (1) the parties shall have joint legal custody; \"however, if there is a dispute between the parties regarding the child's health, safety or welfare, including educational, medical and religious matters, ... the [w]ife shall have final authority to decide those matters\"; (2) the wife shall have primary physical custody of the child; (3) the husband shall have unsupervised parenting time every other weekend and on Wednesday evenings until 8:30 P.M. ; (4) the husband shall not consume alcohol, narcotics, or nonprescribed medications at any time during his parenting time with the child or for twelve hours prior thereto; (5) the husband shall pay base child support of $380 per week, along with additional child support equivalent to fifteen percent of his bonus income; (6) the parties shall share the cost of the child's college education, \"in accordance with their respective ability to pay at the time\"; (7) the parties shall retain their respective retirement accounts, bank accounts, and liabilities; and (8) the parties shall be solely responsible for their respective attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 29, 2016, the wife filed a timely motion to alter and amend the divorce judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 59, which was denied on June 24, 2016. The present appeal by the wife followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . The wife principally argues that the judge (1) erred in ordering a new trial on the issue of legal custody; (2) improperly \"modified\" the \"previously adjudicated\" issues, including parenting time and child support; (3) abused his discretion in awarding joint legal custody and unsupervised parenting time to the husband; and (4) abused his discretion in denying the wife's request for attorney's fees. We address the wife's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The new trial\n   </em>\n   . The wife contends the judge improperly allowed the husband's request for new trial on the issue of legal custody.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   A judge may grant a new trial \"on all or part of the issues for any of the reasons for which rehearings have heretofore been granted in suits in equity in the courts of the Commonwealth\" and, upon such motion, may \"take additional testimony, amend findings of fact and conclusions of law or make new findings and conclusions.\" Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 59(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decision whether to reopen the proceedings is within the discretion of the trial judge.\n   <em>\n    Dominick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dominick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3983320\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/18/85/#p90\">\n    18 Mass. App. Ct. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 90 (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Here, the judge reopened the proceedings with respect to the sole contested issue of legal custody. The only evidence at the first trial pertaining to legal custody consisted of the GAL report, which was admitted as an exhibit, and the wife's testimony that she does \"not have the ability to communicate with [the husband] on a consistent basis.\" Given the limited nature of that evidence, we think the judge's decision to allow additional evidence, including testimony from both parents and the GAL, was appropriate and necessary for the purpose of determining the child's best interests. See\n   <em>\n    Rolde\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rolde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3967432\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/12/398/#p402\">\n    12 Mass.

Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion in the allowance of the husband's request for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Dominick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dominick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3983320\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/18/85/#p90\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3983320\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/18/85/#p90\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The \"previously adjudicated\" issues\n   </em>\n   . The wife contends that the judge, in failing to strictly adopt the wife's proposed judgment, (1) improperly \"modified\" the \"previously adjudicated\" issues, including parenting time and child support, and (2) impermissibly considered evidence from the second trial when determining those issues. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There is \"a traditional policy against default judgments in domestic relations cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1020968\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/64/529/\">\n    64 Mass. App. Ct. 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 n.10 (2005) (quotation omitted). The husband's failure to appear at the pretrial conference did not obligate the judge to adopt the wife's proposed judgment in its entirety. Indeed, such practice is generally discouraged. See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Olga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250671\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/821/#p823\">\n    57 Mass. App. Ct. 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (2003) (\"We have criticized in the past wholesale adoption of findings proposed by one party to the litigation, and we do so again\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, none of the issues had, in fact, been \"adjudicated\" prior to the entry of the divorce judgment, as no judgment had yet entered in the divorce action. See Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 58(a) (\"Every judgment shall be set forth on a separate document. A judgment is effective only when so set forth and when entered as provided in [Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P.] 79 [a]\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We likewise discern no error in the judge's consideration of evidence from the second trial when deciding the issues of parenting time and child support. It is true that the judge's September 18, 2015, order limited the second trial to the sole issue of legal custody, and ordinarily, \"once the issues are defined in a final pretrial order, they ought to be adhered to in the absence of some good and sufficient reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"382273\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/43/376/#p378\">\n    43 Mass. App. Ct. 376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378 (1997) (quotation omitted). However, a judge is permitted to consider an issue that has been tried with the \"implied consent\" of the parties. Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 15(b). Generally, when determining whether a judge may consider \"evidence or ... legal or factual theories at trial that were not delineated in pretrial orders, courts have consistently focused on the elements of surprise and unfairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Slade\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"382273\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/43/376/#p378\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"382273\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/43/376/#p378\">\n    at 378-379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we cannot say the judge's consideration of issues beyond the scope of the final pretrial order resulted in surprise or unfairness to the wife. The wife sought to consolidate her contempt action with the second trial, which resulted in extensive testimony regarding the parties' finances in connection with child support and other related matters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The wife called the GAL as a witness at the second trial and elicited testimony from her regarding the parenting plan. The wife also testified regarding the parenting plan, as did the husband. At no point did the wife object to the expanded scope of the second trial. Accordingly, it is apparent from the record that although these issues were not part of the final pretrial order, they were nevertheless tried with the implied consent of the parties. See Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P 15(b) ;\n   <em>\n    National Medical Care, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Zigelbaum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3984940\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/18/570/#p578\">\n    18 Mass. App. Ct. 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578-579 (1984) (\"if the issue is tried by the ... implied consent of the parties and there is no prejudicial surprise, it is treated as if it had been raised in the pleadings without regard to whether the pleadings are amended to conform to the evidence\"). We therefore discern no error in the judge's consideration of evidence from the second trial relating to issues beyond the scope of the September 18, 2015, order, including parenting time and child support.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Legal custody and parenting time\n   </em>\n   . The wife contends that the judge's findings do not support the award of joint legal custody and unsupervised parenting time to the husband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Shared legal custody\" is defined as \"continued mutual responsibility and involvement by both parents in major decisions regarding the child's welfare including matters of education, medical care and emotional, moral and religious development.\" G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31, as amended by St. 1989, c. 689. Shared custody \"requires two capable parents with some degree of respect for one another's abilities as parents, together with a willingness and ability to work together.\"\n   <em>\n    Rolde\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rolde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3967432\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/12/398/#p402\">\n    12 Mass. App. Ct. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 405 (1981). Here, the judge found there to be \"conflicting testimony\" regarding the parties' \"ability to co-parent the child effectively.\" The judge credited the GAL's testimony that the parties were unable to co-parent effectively due to the husband's \"inappropriate conduct\" and \"vitriolic rages,\" including \"name calling\" and \"swear[ing]\" whenever the wife disagreed with him. The judge also credited the GAL's testimony that the husband \"has a significant substance abuse history that interferes with his ability to communicate and co-parent.\" The judge credited the wife's testimony that sometimes the parties were able to communicate effectively, while at other times, it was \"impossible.\" The judge acknowledged that the husband loves the child and \"wants to retain the ability to participate in important decisions in the child's life\"; however, the judge questioned whether the husband \"has the ability to control his outbursts, rages and abusive behavior toward [the] [w]ife.\" The judge also credited the wife's testimony that the husband had been \"physically and emotionally abusive to her.\" See G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A, inserted by St. 1998, c. 179, \u00a7 3 (judge shall \"consider evidence of past or present abuse toward a parent,\" and there shall be presumption against joint custody if judge finds \"that a pattern or serious incident of abuse has occurred\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In light of these findings, the judge's decision to award shared legal custody is not adequately supported.

Here, the judge found that the wife was \"legitimately concerned about [the] [h]usband's alcohol and/or drug consumption around the child.\" The judge found that the husband \"minimized and diminished his substance abuse history.\" The judge credited the wife's testimony regarding \"domestic violence\" that occurred while the husband was intoxicated. The judge also credited the GAL's testimony that the husband \"lacked insight into his behavior,\" \"inappropriately introduced the child to women[,] and even allowed the child to sleep in bed with him and another woman.\" Despite crediting the GAL's testimony, the judge ultimately rejected the GAL's recommendation of supervised parenting time for the husband. To be sure, the judge was not required to adopt the GAL's recommendation. See\n   <em>\n    Pizzino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827150\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/67/865/#p876\">\n    67 Mass.

However, the judge did not make any positive findings regarding the husband's ability to appropriately care for the child, nor did he appear to consider the husband's past abuse of the wife \"as a factor contrary to the best interest of the child.\" G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 31A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In sum, the judge's subsidiary findings, as they currently stand, do not support his ultimate determinations as to shared legal custody and unsupervised parenting time, and \"[t]he factual basis upon which the judge\" made each of those determinations \"remains opaque.\"\n   <em>\n    Prenaveau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Prenaveau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3833867\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/131/#p142\">\n    75 Mass.

The portions of the divorce judgment (1) granting the parties joint legal custody of the minor child, (2) ordering unsupervised parenting time for the husband, and (3) denying the wife's request for attorney's fees are vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum and order. The judge may, but is not required to, take additional evidence with respect to the issues on remand. The remainder of the divorce judgment is affirmed.
