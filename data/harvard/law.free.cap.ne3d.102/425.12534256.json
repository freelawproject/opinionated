He maintains that his complaint sufficiently alleged violations of: (1) articles 4 and 29 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution (Declaration of Rights); (2) the full faith and credit clause, United States Constitution Art. IV, \u00a7 1 (full faith and credit clause); and (3) the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   .

All allegations made in the amended complaint are taken as true and we draw every reasonable inference in the plaintiff's favor. See\n   <em>\n    Burbank Apartments Tenant Assn\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Kargman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12172952\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/107/#p116\">\n    474 Mass. 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 116 (2016).

In May, 2014, \"the Vermont Superior Court issued a Certificate of Expungement related to certain matters regarding [the plaintiff] that had occurred in Vermont in 1996.\" In December, 2015, the Hanover, Massachusetts, police department sent an information request regarding Guerriero to the Burlington, Vermont, police department. In response, the Burlington police department sent the Hanover police department information that was subject to the 2014 expungement order. A few months later, the Burlington police department notified the Hanover police department that the information was sent in error, and asked the Hanover police department to destroy the information and cease considering it. The Hanover police department declined to destroy the records. In June, 2016, the Vermont Superior Court issued another Certificate of Expungement relating to a different matter \"regarding [the plaintiff] that had occureed [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] in Vermont in 1996.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Counts I and II of the amended complaint allege violations of art. 4 and art. 29 of the Declaration of Rights; count III of the plaintiff's amended complaint alleges a violation of the full faith and credit clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In his appellate brief, Guerriero assumes that there is a direct right of action under both the Declaration of Rights and the Federal full faith and credit clause. This suggestion is made without citation to controlling authority. This \"abbreviated and conclusory claim does not rise to the level of appellate argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270854\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/459/361/#p392\">\n    459 Mass. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (2011). Further, the plaintiff provides no authority for the proposition that his rights under these provisions have been violated. These contentions likewise do not rise to the level of appellate argument. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Mass.%20921\">\n    367 Mass. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975);\n   <em>\n    Kellogg\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration in Med\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272449\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/1001/#p1003\">\n    461 Mass. 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It appears from the briefs that the genesis of this dispute lies in the request of the town of Hanover (town) for information pertaining to the plaintiff's application for a gun permit, and the town's claim that it has the right to retain the information in connection with that application. However, Guerriero did not appeal from the denial of the permit, he has not made any allegations concerning the permit, and that issue is not before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Count IV of the amended complaint does allege a violation of G. L. c. 12, \u00a7 11I, which would provide a vehicle for any claims of constitutional violations. However, the town is a municipality and is immune from claims under \u00a7 11. See\n   <em>\n    Howcroft\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peabody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"132450\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/51/573/#p591\">\n    51 Mass. App. Ct. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 591-593 (2001) (municipalities and those acting in their official municipal capacities are not \"persons\" within the meaning of the statute).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Even if the town fell within the statute's coverage, Guerriero fails to allege sufficient facts to show the requisite existence of \"threats, intimidation, or coercion.\" See\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood League of Mass., Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482595\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/417/467/#p474\">\n    417 Mass. 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 474 (1994). The plaintiff alleges no threat or use of force. See\n   <em>\n    Kennie\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Natural Resources Dept. of Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789737\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/754/#p763\">\n    451 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (2008) (\"Both threats and intimidation often rely on an element of actual or threatened physical force\"). Nor has he pleaded \"physical, moral, or economic\" coercion sufficient to satisfy the statute's requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789737\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/754/#p763\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789737\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/754/#p763\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Here, the town did not attempt to force the plaintiff to do anything. It did not threaten to keep his records; it asserted a right to do so. \"[A] direct deprivation of rights, even if unlawful, is not coercive because it is not an attempt to force someone to do something the person is not lawfully required to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Swanset Dev.
