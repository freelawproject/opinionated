Because the paragraphs in the supporting affidavit that address the principal and interest due on the note must be stricken for failure to comply with Civ.R. 56(E), HSBC failed to establish all the requirements for summary judgment in a foreclosure action. Therefore, we sustain the Webbs' assignment of error, reverse the judgment of the trial court, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On December 1, 2015, HSBC sued the Webbs and other defendants not relevant to this appeal. (Dec. 1, 2015 Compl.) The complaint sought to obtain judgment on the outstanding balance of a note signed by the Webbs and to foreclose, pursuant to a mortgage, on residential real estate located at 4815 Stonehaven Drive, Columbus, Ohio 43220.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On December 21, 2015, the Webbs answered denying every allegation in the complaint for lack of knowledge. (Dec. 21, 2015 Answer); Civ.R. 8(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Approximately four months later, on April 27, 2016, HSBC moved for summary judgment. (Apr. 27, 2016 Mot. for Summ. Jgmt.) In support of its motion, HSBC attached an affidavit from Cynthia Thomas, an employee of Wells Fargo, N.A., which was the servicing agent of HSBC in this case. (Apr. 27, 2016 Thomas Aff.) The affidavit was accompanied by documents purporting to be copies of the note (with allonges), the mortgage, several transfers, several modifications, and a delinquency notice. (Exs. A-H attached to Thomas Aff.) Notably, HSBC failed to attach any documents that substantiated Thomas' assertions regarding the amount of principal and interest due on the note. The Webbs opposed summary judgment by filing a motion to strike Thomas' affidavit in which they argued that the affidavit was not based on Thomas' personal knowledge, did not authenticate or provide a sufficient foundation to authenticate the exhibits to it, and did not attach documentary evidence of the delinquency. (May 9, 2016 Mot. to Strike.) The Webbs also filed a response in opposition to summary judgment arguing the same alleged deficiencies in Thomas' affidavit as were highlighted in their motion to strike. (May 9, 2016 Resp. in Opp. to Summ. Jgmt.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On November 9, 2016, the trial court denied the Webbs' motion to strike and granted HSBC's motion for summary judgment. (Nov. 9, 2016 Entry &amp; Decree.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Essentially, the trial court found that \"the affidavit of Ms. Thomas contain[ed] the proper foundation, authenticate[d] the documents attached thereto, establishe[d] that Plaintiff [wa]s in possession of the subject note, and establishe[d] the default and balance due on the note.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The trial court then noted that \"[o]ther than their arguments related to the sufficiency of Plaintiff's supporting affidavit,\" the Webbs had \"not presented any Civ.R. 56 evidence to indicate they [we]re not in default of the subject note or that the amount alleged due on the note [wa]s incorrect.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court entered judgment against the Webbs jointly and severally for $790,528.49 and ordered foreclosure of the subject property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The Webbs now appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In the regular performance of my job functions, I am familiar with business records maintained by Wells Fargo for the purpose of servicing mortgage loans. These records (which include data compilations, electronically imaged documents, and others) are made at or near the time by, or from information provided by, persons with knowledge of the activity and transactions reflected in such records, and are kept in the course of business activity conducted regularly by Wells Fargo. It is the regular practice of Wells Fargo's mortgage servicing business to make these records. In connection with making this affidavit, I have acquired personal knowledge of the matters stated herein by examining these business records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Thomas Aff. at \u00b6 1-2.) In short, Thomas' affidavit establishes that she had knowledge of the status and keeping of records within Wells Fargo for the purpose of\n   servicing mortgage loans, and had personal knowledge of the Webbs' loan, mortgage, and related transactions only to the extent that she had reviewed such records. Thus, she could offer sworn statements summarizing the content of the records and asserting, for example, that HSBC has had (since the time of the filing of the complaint) possession of the note.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(Thomas Aff. at \u00b6 1-2.) Consistent with that observation, Thomas' averments with regard to the Webbs' payment history repeatedly stated that they were based on the \"business records\" of Wells Fargo:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   6. According to Wells Fargo business records, payments have not been made as required under the terms of the Promissory Note and Mortgage; the account is due and owing for the February 1, 2015 payment; the last payment was received on March 31, 2015 and was applied to the January 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   7.

We recognize that the Webbs did not present evidence disputing the default or the amount owed on the note. Nevertheless, they have not admitted the amount due on the note and they did challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting HSBC's motion for summary judgment. The Webbs specifically challenged the sufficiency of the Thomas' affidavit in both their motion to strike and their memorandum in opposition to HSBC's motion for summary judgment. Among other arguments, the Webbs asserted that the Thomas affidavit should be stricken for failure to attach or submit the documents relied upon by Thomas as required by Civ.R. 56(E). These facts distinguish this case from those cited by HSBC, which involved situations where the homeowner admitted the averments in the bank's affidavit or did not challenge the sufficiency of the bank's affidavit based upon a failure to attach documents relied upon by the affiant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.
