L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), and a school zone violation, see G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. On appeal, the defendant maintains that: (1) the evidence was insufficient to show that the offenses charged took place within a school zone; (2) the Commonwealth's witnesses impermissibly testified that the defendant was under \"surveillance\" and subject to a narcotics-related investigation; (3) the Commonwealth's expert invaded the jury's role by speaking directly to the issue of guilt; (4) the prosecutor engaged in improper vouching during closing argument; and (5) testimony by a substitute chemist violated his confrontation rights. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . On October 17, 2014, several officers conducted surveillance of the area near a residence in Pittsfield, located on Columbus Avenue. In particular, they were surveilling the defendant. During this time, the officers witnessed the defendant walk outside of the residence and meet with a woman for \"several seconds.\" Five minutes later, the officers again witnessed the defendant come from the area of that same residence and meet another woman for a brief period of time. Shortly thereafter, the officers observed a car pull up outside of the residence and a woman went inside, returning to her car within a few minutes. Roughly thirty minutes later, another man walked into the residence and returned to his car within minutes. About fifteen minutes after that, the defendant got into a car that had pulled up and parked on Columbus Avenue Extension near Onota Street. When the officers stopped the car, they observed a large sandwich bag with what looked like crack cocaine inside. The car's driver was holding \"a few [ten dollar bills].\" The defendant was arrested and found with $281 in cash and a cellphone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    School zone violation\n   </em>\n   . At trial, the defendant moved unsuccessfully for a required finding of not guilty with regard to the school zone violation, maintaining that the roadway leading to the school could not be considered school property under G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J. In reviewing the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty, \"we consider 'whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20369\">\n    478 Mass. 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 373 (2017), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p677\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (1979).
