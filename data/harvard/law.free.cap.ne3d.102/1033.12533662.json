The defendant appeals claiming that the judge erred in allowing prior bad act evidence and hearsay testimony. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The jury could have found the following facts. The defendant and the victim, whom we shall call Pamela, had a romantic relationship between 2003 and 2008, from which a child was born. By 2014, the defendant had moved to Florida but came back to Massachusetts to visit family. On May 5, 2014, Pamela obtained a G. L. c. 209A restraining order (209A order) against the defendant. Four days later, on May 9, 2014, the defendant called the victim from a restricted telephone number and threatened to kill her. He told her if she extended the restraining order, \"[she] wouldn't make it through the front door ... [and] would be bodied and thrown in the Merrimack River.\" Pamela telephoned the police the next day to report the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Admission of prior bad acts\n   </em>\n   . Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion in limine to exclude all prior bad act evidence. After a voir dire hearing, during which Pamela testified, the judge allowed the motion as to an alleged rape of the victim, but otherwise denied the motion. Pamela testified that: (1) the defendant verbally and physically abused her between 2004 and 2008; (2) the defendant repeatedly threatened to kill her and throw her in the Merrimack River; (3) she obtained a 209A order in 2009 and another in 2012; (4) the defendant violated both 209A orders by telephoning Pamela from a restricted telephone number and threatening to kill her; (5) the defendant jumped into her automobile and choked her in front of their daughter; and (6) the defendant telephoned her multiple times in 2014 and threatened her safety. The defendant argues that this evidence was more prejudicial than probative and had not been previously disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The prosecution \"may not introduce evidence that a defendant previously has misbehaved, indictably or not, for the purposes of showing his bad character or propensity to commit the crime charged, but such evidence may be admissible if relevant for some other purpose\" such as to show a pattern of conduct, intent, and the relationship between a defendant and a victim,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Helfant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877723\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/214/#p224\">\n    398 Mass. 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 224 (1986), and cases cited, and if the probative value outweighs the risk of unfair prejudice.

The evidence was admitted to show the hostile nature of the defendant's relationship with Pamela, his motive or intent to commit the charged crimes, and Pamela's state of mind when she received the defendant's threatening telephone call.

G. Evid. \u00a7 404(b) (2015). Indeed, the increasingly violent nature of their relationship, his continued threats to kill Pamela and throw her body in the Merrimack River, and previous violations of the two 209A orders were probative of the defendant's state of mind and relevant to rebut his claim that this incident was a recent contrivance by Pamela to prevent the defendant from getting visitation with their daughter.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824010\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/568/#p575\">\n    445 Mass. 568\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575 (2005) (\"The two protective orders demonstrated that the defendant and [the victim] had, at different times, a continuous hostile relationship and had been 'sufficiently estranged' \"). Additionally, any possible prejudice was diminished by the judge's forceful instructions to the jury, on multiple occasions, of the limited purpose of the testimony.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em case-ids=\"2824010\" https:=\"\" index=\"6\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;id\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2824010\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/568/#p575\">\n    . at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, nothing in the record indicates that the defendant specifically requested and the Commonwealth failed to provide prior bad act evidence.

App. Ct. 567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 574 (2006) (defendant needs to expressly request specific evidence). The defendant requested statements of witnesses in the pretrial conference report, but there is no indication in the record that the Commonwealth had possession of any witness statements not disclosed prior to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Hearsay testimony\n   </em>\n   . The defendant next claims that the judge erred in allowing Officer Stephen Beland to testify that Pamela told him that the defendant telephoned her, threatened to kill her, and ordered her not to go to court to extend the 209A order. The defendant contends that this hearsay statement was offered for its truth and therefore was inadmissible. The Commonwealth counters that the statement was offered for a proper, nonhearsay purpose. We agree with the Commonwealth as the defendant opened the door to this testimony when he cross-examined Pamela as he sought to impeach her by implying that her report to the police was inconsistent with her trial testimony. Furthermore, the defendant argued that Pamela's testimony was a recent contrivance in order to gain an advantage in an ongoing custody dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While a prior consistent statement of a witness is not admissible, \"if a witness is impeached on cross-examination by a claim of recent contrivance or inducement, a statement that [she] made before [she] had an incentive to fabricate [her] testimony may be admitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barbosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269021\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/773/#p797\">\n    457 Mass. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 797 (2010).
