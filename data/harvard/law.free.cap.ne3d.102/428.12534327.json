Concluding that (1) the plaintiffs have not pleaded sufficient facts to show the impairment of a constitutionally-protected liberty interest or a substantial injury, and (2) 115 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 5.05 (2009) and 5.13 (2011) are not unconstitutionally vague, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiffs are caregivers employed by the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, Inc. (JRC), a private facility licensed by the department to provide services for developmentally disabled adults. On February 17, 2013, the plaintiffs were involved in an incident with a resident of the JRC that was later investigated by the department. By the time of that investigation, the JRC had already disciplined and retrained the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The department investigator found numerous shortcomings on the part of the JRC. The investigator found that the narrow hallways of the residence and the placement of the resident's bedroom \"put [the resident] and staff at unnecessary risk of harm.\" The investigator also found that the JRC had failed to keep the resident's individual habilitation plan up to date. The investigator questioned whether the residence was \"even appropriate for [the resident's] needs.\" In light of these shortcomings, the investigator found that the plaintiffs should have ceased transporting the resident once she began actively struggling and that their failure to do so \"exposed [the resident] to a serious risk of harm.\" Accordingly, the investigator found \"sufficient evidence to substantiate mistreatment.\" Although the investigator and the resulting action plan recommended numerous remedial steps for the JRC, they did not recommend any remedial steps for the plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs appealed the finding of mistreatment to the commissioner, who affirmed the finding. The plaintiffs then filed a complaint in the Superior Court seeking, inter alia, judicial review and a declaratory judgment. A Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20755\">\n    365 Mass. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Standard of review\n   </em>\n   . \"We review the denial of a motion to dismiss de novo, accepting the facts alleged in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff[s'] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451904\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/254/#p260\">\n    477 Mass. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 260 (2017).

The plaintiffs, however, do not sufficiently allege any change to their status or rights. Other than conclusory allegations, they plead no termination or other adverse employment decision, and the plaintiffs remained employed in the same position at the time they filed their complaint. The documents incorporated in their complaint reflect that the discipline of the plaintiffs preceded the department's determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although it is uncontested that the department's findings are maintained in its electronic databases and in internal JRC records, the controlling statutory and regulatory scheme, including the Fair Information Practices Act, precludes the release of this information to employers and potential employers.

Accordingly, the plaintiffs' basic contention that the plaintiffs' future employment opportunities will be adversely affected does not rise above a speculative possibility.

In light of the \"ample confidentiality procedures in place to protect the information in the system from general dissemination,\" the complaint shows no more than \"a generalized fear of injury to [the plaintiffs'] reputation\" insufficient to support a due process claim.\n   <em>\n    Vaccaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274528\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/153/#p160\">\n    425 Mass. at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
