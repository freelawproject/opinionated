See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 1 (definition of \"way\" includes \"any public highway\"), and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hazelton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963685\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/11/899/#p900\">\n    11 Mass. App. Ct. 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 900 (1980) (evidence that a road is publicly maintained is evidence that it is a public way under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 [1][\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ] [1] ). The Commonwealth's proof of the third element is equally clear. The trooper also testified that the defendant exhibited classic signs of intoxication and a diminished capacity to operate safely. Specifically, the trooper stated that the defendant was belligerent, smelled strongly of alcohol, drove erratically, and had poor balance and bloodshot eyes. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lavendier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842274\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/79/501/#p506\">\n    79 Mass. App. Ct. 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 506-507 (2011) (\"belligerent demeanor, strong odor of alcohol, poor balance, and glassy, bloodshot eyes\" are signs of intoxication). The defendant also admitted to consuming wine and vodka before driving. On the basis of this evidence, we are satisfied that a jury could reasonably conclude that alcohol diminished the defendant's ability to drive safely.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    AdonSoto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457221\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/497/#p509\">\n    475 Mass. at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We discern no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The prosecutor's question\n   </em>\n   . Before any evidence had been introduced regarding the defendant's performance on the field sobriety tests, the prosecutor asked the trooper if he had \"ask[ed] [the defendant] any more questions before he proceeded to fail the sobriety test?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant contends that the question resulted in an impermissible comment on the defendant's guilt, and therefore, in the absence of an objection, it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788607\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/200/#p209\">\n    451 Mass. 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 209 (2008). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First, the question (which prematurely assumed facts not in evidence, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McHugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3979008\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/17/1015/#p1016\">\n    17 Mass. App. Ct. 1015\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1016 [1984] ), was only one of many other properly formed questions. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899865\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/412/318/#p328\">\n    412 Mass. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (1992) (collecting cases in which improper questions did not require reversal). Second, ample evidence of the defendant's poor performance on the field sobriety tests quickly followed the prosecutor's question. Third, the judge properly instructed the jury that an attorney's \"question to a witness is never evidence, only the answer\" is evidence. Jurors are presumed to follow these instructions.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Degro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285239\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/432/319/#p328\">\n    432 Mass. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (2000). Accordingly, under these circumstances, we cannot say that the prosecutor's single, inartfully framed question created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The judge found the defendant responsible for a marked lanes violation, but placed the finding on file.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
