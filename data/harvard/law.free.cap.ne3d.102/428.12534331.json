Gioioso &amp; Sons, Inc. (Gioioso), purchased lower cost, high-deductible, occurrence-based insurance policies from the defendant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty), for five policy years. These policies required Liberty to pay all claims and then seek reimbursement from Gioioso of the deductible amounts. Additionally, Gioioso was required to post a letter of credit as security for its anticipated financial obligations under the policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Gioioso initiated this litigation in 2012, claiming that Liberty improperly inflated the amount of security it would require, needlessly tying up Gioioso's credit, in breach of the parties' agreements and G. L. c. 93A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Liberty counterclaimed for a payment of $112,000 in outstanding premiums in connection with an earlier, retrospectively rated policy. Liberty also counterclaimed for attorney's fees and expenses (count II), relying on language in the contract governing the security obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   A Superior Court motion judge entered summary judgment in Liberty's favor on all claims except its claim for attorney's fees. Faced with cross appeals from the parties, we reverse that portion of the judgment pertaining to Liberty's request for fees and expenses (count II of its counterclaim). We affirm all other aspects of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Breach of the security agreement\n   </em>\n   . Gioioso began purchasing general liability, worker's compensation, and automobile insurance policies from Liberty in 2001, but switched to high-deductible policies requiring the posting of collateral in late 2005. Under its most recent policies, Gioioso's deductible amount was $300,000 for each covered loss. The policies are occurrence-based. In association with these high-deductible policies, the parties entered into an agreement for the guarantee of financial obligations (\"security agreement\"). The security agreement requires a \"clean, irrevocable letter of credit\" in an amount listed on an attached schedule, \"subject to upward or downward adjustment in amounts by Liberty Mutual at least annually.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The security agreement goes on to state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Liberty Mutual may, at its sole discretion, determine that the estimated amount of unpaid Obligations is greater than the amount of the existing letter of credit and, if so, Liberty Mutual shall have the option to require Policyholder to deliver, within (30) days of receipt by Policyholder of written notice by Liberty Mutual, an amendment to the existing letter of credit or an additional letter of credit ... so that the total amount of such letter(s) of credit equals the amount set forth on the most recent Schedule.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The most recent security agreement schedule, dated in 2009, requires a letter of credit in the amount of $2.2 million. That schedule includes the following additional provisions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"This Schedule, and any amendments, additional Schedules, and updates thereto, are incorporated into and made a part of the [security agreement] entered into between Liberty Mutual and Policyholder .... It is expressly understood and agreed that the amount of collateral ... referenced on this Schedule may be adjusted at the sole discretion of Liberty Mutual to reflect then-current obligations. Policyholder agrees to provide Liberty Mutual with the referenced amounts and any required increases thereto by the Schedule date communicated by Liberty Mutual.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The motion judge determined that Gioioso failed to identify a genuine issue of material fact on its claims that Liberty breached the security agreement or the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"It is ... elementary that an unambiguous agreement must be enforced according to its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Schwanbeck\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3900182\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/412/703/#p706\">\n    412 Mass. 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (1992).

Gioioso was twice informed of this discretion in the plain language of the contract. Accordingly, the motion judge was correct that Liberty's calculation of the security amount-by whatever method it saw fit-could not constitute a breach of the express contract between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Additionally, we agree that Gioioso failed to identify a genuine dispute of material fact whether Liberty violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in calculating the security amount.

The motion judge wrote that \"the court has had difficulty in understanding the point being made in the affidavits\" but in any event, the fact that one or both of the affiants may have used a method different from Liberty's in calculating the security amount \"does not create a triable issue of fact on the question of whether Liberty acted in good faith.\" Having reviewed the affidavits, we agree that they do not raise a genuine factual dispute as to any issue material to Gioioso's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Here, Gioioso has identified no manner in which it has been deprived of any fruit of its contracts with Liberty,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor has Gioioso suggested in any way that Liberty has used the security agreement to extract a concession from Gioioso.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the judge correctly determined that Liberty was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Gioioso's claim for breach of the implied covenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Gioioso's c. 93A claim\n   </em>\n   . The motion judge determined that because Gioioso did not demonstrate a genuine issue of fact on its contract claims, its claim for unfair business practices pursuant to G. L. c. c. 93A, \u00a7 11\"must also be dismissed.\" Gioioso argues that a c. 93A claim is sui generis and does not necessarily rise or fall with its contract claims. While this proposition is correct as a general matter, see\n   <em>\n    Kattar\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Demoulas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343543\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/1/#p12\">\n    433 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-13 (2000) ;\n   <em>\n    Gath\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    M/A-COM, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    M/A-Com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346341\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/482/#p498\">\n    440 Mass. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 498 (2003), it does not help Gioioso here because Gioioso's theories as to how Liberty violated c. 93A are coextensive with its contract theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Here, for the same reasons already described, Gioioso failed to establish a dispute of material fact whether Liberty's exercise of its discretion to determine the security amount was an unfair or deceptive practice in the business-to-business context. See\n   <em>\n    Duclersaint\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Federal Natl Mort.

Under Gioioso's commercial general liability policy for the year ending in November, 2005, Liberty had the \"right and duty to defend the insured against any suits seeking damages.\" Additionally, the policy stated, Liberty \"may, at [its] discretion, investigate any occurrence and settle any claim or suit that may result.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2007, the First Baptist Church in Dorchester (First Baptist) sued Gioioso in connection with excavating work Gioioso had performed. Liberty assumed the defense and tried the case, resulting in a jury verdict against Gioioso in the amount of $288,295 plus prejudgment interest. Liberty filed a notice of appeal but then declined to prosecute the appeal, and instead settled the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under the 2004-2005 policy, Liberty claims that Gioioso owes it $112,997 in retrospective premiums in connection with the First Baptist loss. Gioioso does not argue with Liberty's mathematical calculation, but claims it does not owe Liberty any money because Liberty should have pursued the appeal. Liberty, on the other hand, argues that under the relevant policy it had full discretion to settle the First Baptist case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Depending upon the reasonable likelihood of success on appeal, the insurer's duty to defend may continue until an appeal has been disposed of.\"\n   <em>\n    Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

App. Ct. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157 n.2 (1992). Gioioso argues on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Couch, Insurance \u00a7 200.48, at 220-118 (3d ed. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As evidence of reasonable grounds for appeal in the First Baptist case, Gioioso points to three sources: (i) a letter from its own lawyer, Douglas E. Sylvia, advocating for an appeal; (ii) an e-mail from Gioioso's trial lawyer, David R. Cain; and (iii) a letter from Robert A. Curley, Jr., an attorney hired by Liberty to review the trial transcript and make recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The only viable grounds for appeal articulated in these three communications all relate to the exclusion of certain evidence by the trial judge. Both Curley and Sylvia expressly acknowledged in their letters, however, that the exclusion of evidence is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion and an error in such a ruling will result in a new trial only if it prejudiced the proponent of the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Lind\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Domino's Pizza LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073663\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/87/650/\">\n    87 Mass. App. Ct. 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 663 &amp; n.14 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Moreover, Cain, the trial lawyer, wrote in his e-mail that \"my memory and my notes are that [the trial judge] was careful enough in her rulings ... to survive review.\" And Curley, the attorney hired by Liberty, opined that only one of five possible evidentiary errors presented a viable issue and the likelihood of getting a new trial based on that single error was less than ten percent. He further advised that an appellate court would most likely hold that the error was harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   These communications simply do not establish that a \"reasonable ground\" existed for an appeal, nor do they create a dispute of fact on the issue. Additionally, Liberty correctly relies on the policy language stating that it \"may, at [its] discretion ... settle any claim or suit [resulting from an occurrence].\" \"We interpret these terms according to the 'fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.' \"\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1080050\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/434/174/#p180\">\n    434 Mass. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Bilodeau\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lumbermens Mut.

The fair meaning of this language leaves the matter of settlement entirely to the discretion of Liberty. Nonetheless, however, in exchange for that discretion, Liberty was bound by a reciprocal obligation to act in \"good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Murach\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Massachusetts Bonding &amp; Ins.

Even though Gioioso complied with the security agreement by posting letters of credit as required, its initiation of a lawsuit claiming that Liberty had violated the agreement by requiring the posting of those same letters forced Liberty to \"exercise or enforce\" its rights by mounting a defense to Gioioso's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Moreover, the motion judge's more narrow reading of the fee-shifting clause-that it applies only to fees incurred as a result of a breach of the security agreement's terms-would render the provision's second clause, lettered \"(b),\" superfluous. Because the contract expressly provides in clause (b) for fee-shifting in the event that the policyholder fails to \"perform or observe any of the provisions hereof,\" the prior clause, lettered \"(a),\" must have a more expansive meaning-extending to the exercise of rights even where the policyholder is not strictly in breach of the security agreement.

As a threshold matter, we agree with the motion judge that Gioioso failed to provide admissible evidence supporting this theory. See\n    <em>\n     Kourouvacilis\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     General Motors Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895521\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/410/706/#p714\">\n     410 Mass. 706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 714 (1991). But even assuming arguendo that Liberty was over-secured and obtained a market advantage because of it, such evidence would have had no tendency to show that Liberty violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in the particular contracts at issue here. The purpose of the implied covenant \"is to guarantee that the parties remain faithful to the intended and agreed expectations of the parties in their performance.\"\n    <em>\n     T.W.Nickerson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668913\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/562/#p570\">\n     456 Mass. at 570\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , quoting from\n    <em>\n     Uno Restaurants, Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Boston Kenmore Realty Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"411744\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/441/376/#p385\">\n     441 Mass. 376\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 385 (2004). \"A breach occurs when one party violates the reasonable expectations of the other.\"\n    <em>\n     Eigerman\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Putnam Invs., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777474\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/450/281/#p287\">\n     450 Mass. 281\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 287-288 (2007). Here, Liberty's broad discretion to set the amount of the security requirement was apparent from the plain language of the contract.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777474\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/450/281/#p287\">\n      Ibid\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777474\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/450/281/#p287\">\n     .\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Any expectation harbored by Gioioso that Liberty would not exercise its discretion in such a way as to further its business interests would not have been a reasonable expectation.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777474\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/450/281/#p287\">\n      Id\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3777474\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/450/281/#p287\">\n     . at 289\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, Gioioso's claim is not viable here, where: (i) the ulterior motive Gioioso ascribes to Liberty had nothing to do with depriving Gioioso of any benefit of the subject contract, and (ii) Gioioso agreed that Liberty would have sole discretion to set the security amount.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Gioioso's claim that Liberty improperly offered to accept a letter of credit in a reduced amount on the condition that Gioioso would affirm that the security agreement remains in effect is not properly before the court. The complaint does not include this allegation; the facts related to it did not occur until after October 12, 2012, the date the complaint was filed. Although Gioioso moved to amend its complaint and for class certification in May, 2013, that motion was denied. The record does not reveal what changes were proposed in the motion to amend (other than adding a class-based claim), but Gioioso has not appealed from the denial of the motion to amend in any event. Accordingly, this theory was never properly before the motion judge and is not properly before this court. Moreover, we do not believe Liberty's attempt to preserve the legal status quo as a condition of accepting reduced security after the commencement of litigation has the sort of extortionate or coercive quality that would amount to a violation of the implied covenant or c. 93A.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    We agree with the motion judge that Liberty's failure to inform Gioioso at some earlier point in time that Liberty had applied a liquidation credit to the security amount and would cease doing so if Gioioso stopped buying insurance from Liberty does not change the outcome. The parties' security agreement was clear insofar as it conferred \"sole discretion\" upon Liberty to calculate the security amount. That Gioioso privately assumed that the required security amount would automatically decline once Gioioso stopped purchasing new policies from Liberty was not the fault of Liberty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Gioioso also appeals from the decisions on various discovery motions. Having reviewed the record carefully, we see no abuse of discretion in the judge's handling of the discovery issues. See\n    <em>\n     Solimene\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     B.
