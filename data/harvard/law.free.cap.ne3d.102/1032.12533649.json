He argues that he should have been permitted to withdraw his 2009 guilty pleas because his plea counsel was ineffective in failing to provide accurate advice regarding the immigration consequences of his pleas. The defendant also appeals from the denial of his motion to reconsider the denial of his initial motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We vacate the order denying the initial motion and remand the case for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The defendant, a citizen of Haiti and a lawful permanent resident of the United States, was indicted on March 13, 2009, for assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A ; and assault with intent to rob, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 20, both arising from an attempted robbery. At the plea colloquy\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   held on September 21, 2009, the judge told the defendant that if his guilty pleas were accepted, the judge would \"place [him] on probation, eighteen months' suspended sentence, and then [he'd] have probation, where [he] could possibly go to [S]tate prison if [he] violate[d] it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge then asked the defendant if he still wished to go ahead with his plea, and the defendant said that he did. The judge accepted the pleas and sentenced the defendant on the first count to eighteen months in the house of correction, suspended during a three-year term of probation, and on the second count to a concurrent three-year term of probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Based on the sentences actually imposed, the conviction of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon offense was an \"aggravated felony,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   providing a basis under Federal law for removal (i.e., deportation) from the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2015, while the defendant was returning from a trip to Haiti, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials stopped him and initiated removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2016, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea and for a new trial, pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=435%20Mass.%201501\">\n    435 Mass. 1501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001). At an evidentiary hearing, the motion judge (who had not been the plea judge) accepted in evidence (1) the recording of the defendant's 2009 plea colloquy; (2) affidavits from the defendant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   his step-mother,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the defendant's plea counsel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) testimony by the prosecutor who had represented the Commonwealth at the 2009 plea hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant's affidavit stated that plea counsel \"never spoke to [him] about the immigration consequences,\" and that \"[i]f [he] had known that [he] was giving up [his] life in the United States by signing this plea agreement, [he] would have taken [his] chances and gone to trial.\" Plea counsel's affidavit, on the other hand, stated that he had advised the defendant of the \"very generous offer of probation and a suspended 18 month jail sentence which would\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   result in deportation\" (emphasis supplied).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plea counsel further stated that \"every time\" he met with the defendant in court, he informed the defendant of \"the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   of a deportation hearing and deportation if he plead[ed] guilty to the indictments, or if he went to trial and lost, then he could expect a maximum of 20 years in [State] prison with a\n   <em>\n    certainty\n   </em>\n   of deportation based on his convictions\" (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The judge issued findings of fact crediting counsel's statements over the defendant's. He ruled that counsel's advice had not been deficient and, thus, without reaching the question whether the defendant had been prejudiced by that advice, denied the defendant's motion. The judge also denied the defendant's subsequent motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"A postsentence motion to withdraw a plea is treated as a motion for a new trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Conaghan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343525\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/105/#p106\">\n    433 Mass. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (2000).

Accordingly, counsel \"was obligated to provide to his client, in language that the client could comprehend, the information that presumptively mandatory deportation would have been the legal consequence of pleading guilty. Stated differently, counsel needed to convey that, if Federal authorities apprehended the defendant, deportation would be practically inevitable.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p181\">\n    468 Mass. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 181 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Here, counsel advised that a plea carried \"a high probability\" of, or \"would likely result\" in, deportation. Significantly, however, counsel also advised the defendant of \"the\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   of a deportation hearing and deportation\" if he pleaded guilty, whereas if he went to trial and was convicted, he faced \"a\n   <em>\n    certainty\n   </em>\n   of deportation.\" This contrasting advice, although rendered prior to\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , was misleading, in that the defendant's pleading guilty to a charge that he knew would result in an eighteen-month suspended sentence made deportation no less likely than had he gone to trial and been convicted. Although the Supreme Judicial Court has \"not dictate[d] the precise language that must be employed, as each case will present different circumstances,\"\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p181\">\n    468 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   181 n.5, we conclude that plea counsel's advice here, although rendered prior to\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , was deficient, failing the first prong of\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The remaining question is whether the defendant was prejudiced by the deficient advice.

It now remains for the judge to resolve that issue, and in doing so, to take such additional relevant evidence regarding prejudice as the parties may offer.
