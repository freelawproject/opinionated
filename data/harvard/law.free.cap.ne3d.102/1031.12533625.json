L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    h\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a subsequent jury-waived trial, the defendant was found to be an armed career criminal, level three, pursuant to the Massachusetts Armed Career Criminals Act (ACCA). On appeal, he contends that reversal is warranted because (1) his pretrial motion to suppress evidence was erroneously denied; and (2) the trial judge violated his right to a fair trial by improperly advocating for the prosecution. He also argues that the armed career criminal level three determination was invalid under both the \"residual\" and \"force\" clauses of the ACCA. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress the ammunition found on his person by the police. We first summarize the facts as found by the motion judge\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in his comprehensive memorandum and order denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the night of May 3, 2013, a man was shot and killed at an apartment within the Alice Heywood Taylor housing project in the Mission Hill neighborhood of Boston. Police Officer Shannon O'Donnell arrived on the scene within a minute of the first radio call, which went out at 12:41 A.M. Upon entering the apartment, she observed a man lying on his back, bleeding from an apparent gunshot wound. Although he was receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation, he exhibited no pulse or signs of respiration. A witness told O'Donnell that she had seen the shooter fire several rounds from a long handgun, and described him as a \"black Hispanic male\" who was about five feet, ten inches tall, around 180 pounds, and wearing a black sweatshirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Officers Steven Dodd and Andrew Hunter arrived at the apartment within three minutes of the first radio call. While on the scene, they heard the shooter's physical description as provided to Officer O'Donnell, and were told that, last observed, he was wearing a \"dark hooded sweatshirt\" and carrying \"a long black handgun.\" Thereafter, they departed to search for potential suspects. Dodd and Hunter were dressed in plain clothes, and patrolled in an unmarked but readily identifiable Crown Victoria police cruiser. They were aware of many prior incidents of violent crime, including firearms offenses, reported in and around the Taylor housing project. Approximately nine to ten minutes after the initial call, the officers turned onto Ruggles Street, where they saw the defendant emerge from a path leaving the Taylor housing project. At that time, the defendant was approximately one-eighth of a mile from the apartment, and was the first person the officers had seen since departing the crime scene in their cruiser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant caught the officers' attention because he was walking quickly and generally fit the witness's description of the shooter. They noted that he was a black man, wearing a dark jacket or sweatshirt, with a height and build in the correct range.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant crossed the street, and began walking toward them on the sidewalk. Without activating the lights or siren, Officer Dodd pulled the cruiser to the left side of the street, facing the wrong way, and stopped a short distance in front of the defendant. As he did so, the defendant slowed and placed his hands in his jacket pockets. The officers exited the cruiser. Officer Dodd stood on the sidewalk about twenty feet from the defendant, and Officer Hunter walked toward him on the street. They identified themselves as police officers, and Officer Dodd directed the defendant to show his hands. When he did not immediately cooperate, Officer Hunter repeated the instruction, saying something like, \"Let me see your hands.\" Although the defendant seemed nervous and was breathing heavily, he complied. Officer Dodd then asked whether he had any weapons, and he stated, \"I might have something. But it's not mine. I found it in Mattapan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At that point, Officer Hunter pat frisked the defendant and discovered a box of bullets. Upon learning that he had neither a license to carry nor a firearm identification card, the officers placed him under arrest. He was convicted of the above listed charges, and this appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . In reviewing a judge's ruling on a motion to suppress, \"we accept the judge's findings of fact and will not disturb them absent clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664978\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/246/#p250\">\n    455 Mass. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (2009).

The defendant does not challenge the findings of fact, and we discern no error therein. Accepting those facts, we conclude that the motion was properly denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The motion was denied on the grounds that (1) the defendant was not constitutionally seized until the patfrisk; and (2) at that time, the officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search. The defendant argues that the judge erred on both fronts, and that the bullets should have been suppressed as the fruit of the officers' unlawful actions. Specifically, he urges that, under the totality of the circumstances, he was seized when the officers inquired whether he had any weapons; and that, at that moment, they lacked the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct a lawful\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop. See\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ohio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6167798\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/392/1/#p20\">\n    392 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20 (1968).

First, it introduced the docket sheet, criminal complaint, and tender of plea sheet, which, together, indicated that the defendant pleaded guilty to a May 8, 2007, aggravated assault and battery on a victim who was then three months pregnant. Next, the Commonwealth elicited testimony from an MBTA police officer, Vincent Moy, regarding the circumstances surrounding the defendant's arrest. Per Officer Moy's testimony, on the night of May 8, 2007, he was dispatched to the Ruggles MBTA station where a suspect had been detained. Upon arriving, he observed the victim, who was scared, crying, and had a swollen face, and spoke with her about the assault. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was arrested and booked. This factual background, including the evidence of the victim's swollen face, was sufficient for a rational trier of fact to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the theory underlying the defendant's conviction was harmful battery.
