Huff Realty (\"Huff\"), Thomas Singer, Christopher Parchman, and Nationwide REO Brokers, Inc., (\"Nationwide\") in a case regarding the removal, disposal, and retention of the personal property that the Wrights failed to retrieve from their former home at 7329 Waterpoint Lane following a foreclosure. We affirm the judgment of the trial court because res judicata barred the Wrights from asserting these claims against the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Factual Basis of the Federal Law Suit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In February 2009, Bank of America (\"BOA\") foreclosed on a home owned by Glenn and Patricia Wright. The sheriff sold the property back to the bank in December 2009. The Wrights never removed their personal property from the home. After the sale, the bank informed the Wrights in writing numerous times that their property must be removed from the home, to no avail. On March 4, 2010, BOA posted a \"Personal Property Notice\" on the home informing the Wrights that any property that was not removed by April 8, 2010, would be disposed of without further notice. The notice was also mailed to and received by the Wrights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} The Wrights, through broker Tim Atteberry, made two attempts to repurchase the home. Atteberry made offers in January and March 2010, but BOA never responded to the offers. On April 7, 2010, Atteberry spoke with Kate McCarthy, a paralegal who worked for Manley Deas Kolchalski, L.L.C., the law firm that represented BOA. Atteberry represented that he had a potential buyer for the property who was interested in purchasing the furniture with the home. Atteberry did not disclose to McCarthy that the Wrights were the potential buyers. After conferring with BOA, McCarthy sent an email confirming that the furniture would remain on the property and instructing Atteberry to conduct future negotiations with Tom Singer, the listing agent from Huff Realty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After April 7, 2010, the Wrights never followed up with BOA regarding their personal property. In the meantime, Atteberry contacted Singer who did not negotiate with Atteberry. BOA sold the property to the Hellers in July 2010. When the Wrights visited the home in August 2010, they learned it had been sold to the Hellers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Four months later, the Wrights filed suit against BOA in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio asserting state-law claims for breach of contract, negligence, and fraud, claiming they were wrongfully deprived of their personal property because BOA had a lawful duty to protect the property until the Wrights chose to retrieve it, BOA failed to retain the property, and BOA conveyed the personal property to the Hellers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Federal Court Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In the district court, the Wrights alleged that BOA had agreed to secure and maintain their personal property, BOA had breached the agreement by discarding the property and allowing it to be turned over to the Hellers, the Wrights' demands for recovery of the personal property had been refused, and the Wrights had been deprived of the ownership and benefit of their personal property. The Wrights further alleged that BOA \"was negligent in fulfilling\" its duty to maintain custody and control over the property, and that BOA had falsely misrepresented its intent to maintain and secure the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 7} After discovery, the district court granted BOA's motion for summary judgment finding that BOA did not enter into a contract with the Wrights to allow them to leave their property in the home, and that any alleged permission to maintain the personal property in the home was contingent solely on the successful repurchase of the home by Atteberry on behalf of the Wrights. The court further found that the Wrights were not in negotiations to purchase the property, and that they should have known well before July 2010 that BOA would not sell the property to Atteberry. Once the Wrights knew that they could not repurchase the home, they should have taken active steps to retrieve their belongings. Instead, the Wrights sat passively and did nothing to protect their interests. They made no attempt to contact BOA or retrieve their personal belongings after April 7, 2010, and BOA did not have a duty to protect or preserve their personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The Wrights appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the District Court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wright v. Bank of Amr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=517%20Fed.%20Appx.%20304\">\n    517 Fed.Appx. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.2013). In reaching its decision, the court concluded that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no evidence that BOA intended or attempted to keep Wrights' personal property; the record makes it clear that the Wrights could have retrieved their personal property at any time. In fact, the Wrights had over three months to retrieve the personal property-three months in addition to the original time frame of four months that BOA gave the Wrights to remove their personal property after the foreclosure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=517%20Fed.%20Appx.%20304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=517%20Fed.%20Appx.%20304\">\n    at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Factual Basis of the Second Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After the Wrights lost the suit in federal court, they filed a second suit based on the same underlying facts. Again they alleged that they had permission to leave the personal property in the house because they were in negotiations with BOA to repurchase the house, and that they were unlawfully deprived of their personal property. However, this time, they alleged claims of conversion against the Hellers, Huff Realty, Huff agents Thomas Singer and Christopher Parchman, Nationwide, and Regal Field Services and its owners Shane and Kathleen Klaber, and sought compensatory and punitive damages. The Wrights also alleged claims of replevin and unjust enrichment against the Hellers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The day after BOA purchased the home, JP Morgan Chase Bank (\"Chase\"), the servicing agent for BOA, assigned the marketing and sale of the home to Nationwide, an asset disposition company located in Braintree, Massachusettes. Nationwide assigned Huff Realty and Huff agents Singer and Parchman to market and sell the home. Huff had a contractual agreement to provide these services for properties handled by Nationwide as the agent for bank owned properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 11} After receiving the assignment, Huff agents inspected the home and informed Nationwide the house contained furniture and personal items. Nationwide notified counsel for BOA, and, in February 2010, BOA sent three letters requesting that the Wrights remove their personal property from the home. On March 4, 2010, counsel for BOA instructed Nationwide to post a \"Personal Property Notice\" on the home informing the Wrights that any property that was not removed by April 8, 2010, would be disposed of without further notice. Huff posted the notice at the request of Nationwide, and McCarthy provided the notice to the Wrights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On April 7, 2010, McCarthy sent an email to Nationwide instructing them that the home would be sold with the furniture because Atteberry had a buyer who wished to purchase the furniture with the home. Nationwide was instructed by McCarthy not to trash the furniture when the April 8, 2010 deadline had passed. Nationwide, Huff, Singer, and Parchman followed these instructions. BOA also instructed Nationwide to box up all the small, personal items that remained in the home and put them in the garage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} After McCarthy told Atteberry the furniture would remain in the home, Atteberry spoke with Singer three or four times in April and early May. Singer informed Atteberry that he could not entertain any offers until he received authorization to list the property. Neither Atteberry or Wright contacted Singer after May 4, 2010. The Hellers purchased the property in July 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Hellers' purchase contract reflected that Tom Singer and Huff Realty were acting as agents for BOA, and that BOA reserved the right to dispose of or leave any personal property at its discretion. Shortly before the closing, Parchman informed the Hellers that BOA may leave some of the property in the home instead of trashing it. On June 22, 2010, Field Asset Services removed the garbage from the garage. When the Hellers closed on the home on July 6, 2010, BOA exercised its contractual right to leave the personal property in the home. The Hellers moved into the property on July 24, 2010, and spent the next two weeks discarding all of the trash. They donated some of the remaining items to charity, and kept the rest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On August 14, 2010, the Wrights visited the home and learned that the house had been sold to the Hellers. Two and a half months later, the Wrights sent a letter to the Hellers asking them to call the Wrights if they did not want any of the property and wanted to give the Wrights an opportunity to recover it. The Hellers' counsel contacted the Wrights' attorney, who indicated that the Wrights did not want any of the personal property, and that the Wrights were going to sue BOA. The Wrights' attorney requested that the Hellers cooperate with the Wrights in their suit against BOA. When the Hellers were deposed in September 2011 for the BOA lawsuit, they gave the Wrights two boxes of family photos that they had salvaged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Proceedings in the Second Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} All of the defendants filed answers and asserted, among other affirmative defenses, that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the Wrights from raising these claims and issues again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} After discovery, all of the defendants filed motions for summary judgment alleging that the claims were barred by res judicata, and more specifically, claim preclusion. The trial court granted the motions for summary judgment, finding that res judicata barred the plaintiffs' claims. The Wrights appealed, raising six assignments of error. However, the Wrights did not appeal the judgment granting summary judgment to Nationwide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Under Civ.R. 56(C), summary judgment is appropriate when, looking at the evidence as a whole (1) there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, (2) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, and therefore, (3) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Wright admitted that he received a notice that Huff and Singer were BOA's agents working on behalf of BOA. At all times, Huff, Singer, and Parchman followed BOA's instructions with respect to the personal property and acted within the scope of the agency relationship, and the contract for sale indicated that Huff and Singer were acting as agents for BOA. Additionally, Huff, Singer, and Parchman shared a mutuality of interest and common desired result with BOA with regard to the sale of the home.

Although the Wrights acknowledge that privity may be established by successors to property interests, they argue it is inapplicable here because they did not raise a conversion claim against BOA in the first action, and the personal property was not sold to the Hellers as the Wrights initially believed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 30} However, res judicata operates to \"extinguish a claim by the plaintiff against the defendant even though the plaintiff is prepared in the second action (1) To present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented in the first action, or (2) To seek remedies or forms of relief not demanded in the first action.\"\n   <em>\n    Frye Teachers Assn., OEA/NEA v.

At the time of the filing of the federal action, the Wrights were well aware that the Hellers had purchased the home from BOA, that their personal belongings had been left in the home, and that the Hellers retained the personal property. Raising several claims, the Wrights alleged that BOA unlawfully disposed of the personal property by allowing it to remain in the home after the Hellers had purchased the home.
