L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A ; one count of aggravated rape of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23A ; and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the defendant maintains that the judge abused his discretion in admitting prior bad acts evidence and that the prosecutor made improper remarks in her opening statement and closing argument. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant was indicted on multiple counts of assault on, and rape of, his fianc\u00e9e's daughter, whom we shall call Casey, while she was between the ages of eleven and thirteen.

Many of the acts involved the defendant's treatment of both Casey and her mother. The judge carefully parsed the evidence, conducted a voir dire of Casey, and decided to admit eight of the twelve acts. At the second trial, these acts were again admitted, over the defendant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Evidence of a defendant's prior bad acts is generally inadmissible if proffered \"for the purpose of demonstrating the defendant's bad character or propensity to commit the crimes charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/#p252\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144342\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/228/#p252\">\n    . at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The judge admitted only those acts that Casey witnessed, reasoning that the probative value of revealing Casey's state of mind, and contextualizing the defendant's relationship with Casey, outweighed the potential prejudice to the defendant. Testimony that the defendant repeatedly verbally and physically abused both Casey and her mother was relevant to show the reasonableness of Casey's fear of the defendant and to explain her delay in reporting the sexual abuse, as was the fact that she came forward once he was incarcerated on unrelated charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McKinnon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4015690\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/35/398/#p404\">\n    35 Mass.

The defendant takes issue with numerous parts of the prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument. As the defendant did not object at trial, we review to determine whether these statements amounted to error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Abdul-Alim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%20165\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Opening statement\n   </em>\n   . The defendant maintains that the prosecutor improperly evoked the jury's sympathy when she referred to the defendant as Casey's \"father figure,\" and stated that Casey had been \"downstairs folding laundry, something she always did as a [twelve] year old in middle school\" when she was raped. The prosecutor is entitled to state \"anything that [she] expects to be able to prove by evidence,\" so long as this expectation is \"reasonable and grounded in good faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fazio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"330370\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/375/451/#p454\">\n    375 Mass. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 454, 456 (1978). Casey later testified to the defendant's parent-like role in her life and the sexual assault that occurred while she was folding laundry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Closing argument.\n   </em>\n   For the reasons mentioned above, the prosecutor's argument that the defendant abused his role as Casey's caregiver was appropriately drawn from the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Murchison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480460\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/58/#p59\">\n    418 Mass. 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 59 (1994) (counsel may argue reasonable inferences drawn from evidence). Nor did the argument constitute an improper appeal to sympathy or prejudice. The prosecutor was permitted to argue that the defendant took advantage of his role to obtain access to, and exert control over, Casey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Taken in context, the prosecutor's statement that Casey had cried on the witness stand did not impermissibly suggest that she was entitled to greater credibility because she was willing to endure the hardships of testifying. Contrast\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dirgo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174404\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/1012/#p1013\">\n    474 Mass. 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1013-1014 (2016). Rather, the prosecutor asked the jury to recall Casey's demeanor, and to consider it when deciding whether or not to believe her testimony. The defendant had challenged Casey's credibility; this statement was permissible rebuttal. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157250\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/111/#p118\">\n    430 Mass. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118-119 (1999) (\"A prosecutor can address, in a closing argument, a witness's demeanor, ... and believability, provided that such remarks are based on the evidence, or fair inferences drawn from it, and are not based on the prosecutor's personal beliefs\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Error in the prosecutor's reference to living in a \"house of horrors,\" was cured by the judge's instruction to disregard this characterization and to consider only how Casey's environment affected her state of mind. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fritz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362009\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/341/#p352\">\n    472 Mass. 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (2015), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Frank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343558\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/185/#p196\">\n    433 Mass. 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (2001) (\"[T]he jury are to be given a measure of sophistication in sorting out excessive claims made in closing argument\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    He was acquitted of one count of aggravated rape of a child.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Casey was permitted to testify that the defendant was incarcerated when she disclosed the abuse. In order to reduce speculation as to the reasons for the defendant's incarceration, the judge read a stipulation to the jury, stating that the defendant served \"six months in the [h]ouse of [c]orrection for motor vehicle offenses totally unrelated in any manner to this case.\" The judge excluded evidence of the defendant's physical abuse of their dog. Additionally, the prosecutor was not allowed to elicit testimony about the specific names the defendant called Casey's mother, but only that the defendant frequently called her mother derogatory names in Casey's presence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
