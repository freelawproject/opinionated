Melanson.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The plaintiffs appeal from a Superior Court judgment dismissing, as time barred, their complaint against the defendant for medical malpractice and loss of consortium. The plaintiffs argue that the motion judge improperly resolved a question of fact in determining that their claims accrued more than three years before they filed their complaint. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the pertinent facts as alleged in the complaint, as well as in affidavits submitted by plaintiff Julia Melanson and her consulting physician, Arthur M. Carlin, in opposition to the defendant's motion to dismiss. Upon submitting those affidavits, the plaintiffs asked, and the judge agreed, to treat the defendant's motion as one for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In 2012, the plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who had \"previous abdominal medical history,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was diagnosed with a form of diverticulitis and admitted to a hospital in Newburyport, where, on October 11, 2012, the defendant, a licensed physician, performed a laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy with low anterior anastomosis. Her postoperative stay was complicated by delirium, abdominal fluid drainage, and slow return of gastrointestinal function. She was discharged on October 22, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After experiencing chills, abdominal cramping, and emesis, she was readmitted on October 30, 2012. The defendant advised her that he thought there was a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions. After several days, he returned her to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy. During her postoperative stay, she developed a pulmonary embolus; due to her lack of improvement, she requested transfer to a tertiary care center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 8, 2012, she was transferred to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Beth Israel) in Boston for care by a different surgeon. Tests revealed leakage of urine from her left ureter into her left pelvis, caused by the defendant having severed the ureter during the October 11, 2012, surgery. A left nephrostomy tube was placed to drain the urine from the left kidney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 14, 2012, and again on January 25, 2013, she was readmitted to Beth Israel with infections in the area of the nephrostomy tube. The infections were painful. On March 22, 2013, she was again readmitted and had surgery, performed by Beth Israel surgeons, to reimplant the severed ureter into the bladder. It was again determined that the ureter had been severed by the defendant during the initial surgery. Notably, there is no evidence that she was informed at this time that the reimplantation had \"fixed\" her problems or that she would experience no further symptoms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Even after the March, 2013, surgery she \"continued to experience abdominal issues,\" and inquired of her primary care physician and her Beth Israel surgeons regarding the cause, but they \"evaded answering\" and \"never provided a satisfactory answer to [her] questions.\" In September or October, 2014, her attorney similarly inquired in writing of her treating physicians but received no response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In August, 2015, she asked her attorney to obtain an independent medical evaluation. On September 9, 2015, she received such an evaluation, which concluded that the injury received when the defendant severed her ureter \"was a substantial cause of [her] medical and surgical problems.\" The evaluating physician opined, however, \"that the severing of the ureter and the failure to discover and remedy the situation did not constitute malpractice.\" \"Given [her] complicated medical history[,] this was the very first time that [she] realized that the severing of [her] ureter was a substantial cause of [her] problems.\" But \"[a]t that point and under the circumstances [she] understood that initiating legal action against [the defendant] would be irresponsible and acting in bad faith and accordingly sought another independent evaluation of [her] situation since [she] continued[ ]to have further abdominal issues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This evaluation did not occur until September, 2016, when Dr. Carlin concluded that the defendant's severing of the left ureter, and subsequent failure to recognize and remedy the injury, deviated from the standard of care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   She filed suit in Superior Court on September 13, 2016. On the defendant's motion, the complaint was dismissed as time barred, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Governing law\n   </em>\n   .
