The by-laws require only a simple majority vote of those present for actions at a meeting, while demanding unanimous approval in writing for actions taken without a meeting. Section 6.01(A) of the declaration, however, requires three-fourths approval by the membership to amend the declaration-whether by vote or by written consent. Requiring unanimous approval in writing, by applying \u00a7 3.11 of the by-laws outside its normal context, to amend the declaration without a meeting thereby disregards the plainly-provided procedure in \u00a7 6.01(A) of the declaration. Such an interpretation would render the by-laws inconsistent with the declaration in violation of \u00a7 4.01 of the declaration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In contrast, our interpretation does not make the by-law provisions meaningless. Construing \u00a7 6.01(A) to permit the three-fourths written consent process explicitly laid out there leaves \u00a7\u00a7 3.10 and 3.11 of the by-laws to govern the use of the authority placed in the association to, inter alia, operate the common areas, pay taxes, provide services to the community, and obtain insurance. It is also the most practical construction, given that convening a meeting at which three-fourths of the membership was present or obtaining the affirmative written consent of\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   member in the association would be rather difficult. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Trustees of the Cambridge Point Condominium Trust\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cambridge Point, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20697\">\n    478 Mass. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703 (2018) (by-law requirements that made suit against developers \"effectively impossible\" violated public policy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The motion judge, therefore, properly interpreted the declaration and the by-laws, and allowed summary judgment in favor of the defendants on count I. To the extent the association otherwise failed to comply with the declaration and the by-laws in conducting the process, such issues were rendered moot by the amendment's failure. See\n   <em>\n    Aquacultural Research Corp.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779615\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/631/#p634\">\n    88 Mass. App. Ct. 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634 (2015) (litigation concerning challenged certificate, made inoperative by subsequent decision that precluded alleged harm, would require adjudication of hypothetical dispute; litigation was therefore moot). We accordingly do not address them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The judge ordered the entry of judgment for the plaintiffs on the other counts of the complaint. The defendants have not cross-appealed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Under the plaintiffs' argument, \u00a7 3.10 of the by-laws would similarly apply to the amendment process, but this would negate the supermajority requirement of \u00a7 6.01(A) of the declaration. Section 3.10 requires a simple majority to act on a vote \"except where a different vote is required\n    <em>\n     by law, the Articles of Organization, or these By-laws\n    </em>\n    \" (emphasis supplied). Section 3.10 provides no exception for where a different vote is required by the declaration, thus demonstrating that the drafters intended the procedures set forth in the declaration to control the amendment process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
