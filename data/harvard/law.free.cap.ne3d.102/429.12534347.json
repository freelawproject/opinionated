We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . When the victim was nine years old, the defendant moved in with the victim's mother. Because the mother had an early work shift, the defendant assumed responsibility for getting the victim and her younger brothers ready to be picked up by the bus for school. Soon thereafter, he began rubbing his penis on the victim's genital area on repeated mornings, once unsuccessfully trying to penetrate her. He told the victim, a recent cancer survivor, that the mother would no longer be able to bring her to cancer treatments if she revealed what he was doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After a few weeks of this abuse, the victim experienced severe genital pain during a party at her aunt's home. After her mother asked her what was wrong, she reluctantly disclosed the abuse. The next day, the mother brought the victim to MetroWest Hospital. There, Dr. Susan Mahoney, a pediatric emergency room doctor, examined her and noticed swelling, redness, and abraded skin in the victim's genitalia. Six days later, Dr. Kimberly Schwartz of the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital examined the victim and observed superficial abrasions and signs that the injuries observed by Dr. Mahoney had healed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Witness bias\n   </em>\n   .

The judge did not bar the defendant from all inquiry into his theory of bias on cross-examination. Rather, the judge specifically allowed the defendant to question the victim's mother on (1) the prior involvement of the Department of Children and Families (DCF) with her children, including the finding that her children were in need of services; and (2) the difficulty of raising her three children as a single mother.

The defendant's theory rested on incidents with DCF that occurred over two years prior to the allegations. There was no ongoing DCF involvement when the instant allegations were brought, and no evidence suggested further involvement by DCF was likely to occur. In particular, there was no evidence that the victim's mother ever feared, or had any reason to fear, losing custody of her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this regard, the defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kowalski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011805\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/33/49/\">\n    33 Mass. App. Ct. 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), is misplaced. There, the victim specifically testified that her boy friend had beaten her, providing a plausible basis to demonstrate her existing fear of the boy friend as the motive for fabricating rape charges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011805\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/33/49/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011805\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/33/49/\">\n    . at 51-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The judge could find that the defendant's theory in this case was not similarly plausible. The record fails to establish a logical connection between the discovery of the victim's physical condition and an immediate need for the mother to fabricate rape charges to avoid losing custody of her children. The defendant's theory that the mother, acting on a remote, unprompted fear, would take the drastic step of accusing the defendant of such a horrific crime fell into the realm of speculation. The judge did not err, accordingly, by restricting the defendant's inquiry on the subject.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Vouching by expert witnesses\n   </em>\n   .

Although it is a \"well-established principle that the preferred method for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a motion for a new trial[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zinser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783997\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/807/#p810\">\n    446 Mass. 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810 (2006), we are able to evaluate the defendant's claim that the apparently inadvertent redaction of the victim's medical records deprived the defendant of a substantial ground of defense; it did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, hospital medical records are exempted from the common-law rule against hearsay where the recorded statement relates \"to the treatment and medical history of such cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6801850\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/473/317/#p321\">\n    473 Mass. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 321 (2015), quoting from c. 233, \u00a7 79. The mother's statement in the victim's medical records denying prior involvement with DCF is hearsay, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cassidy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145085\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/201/#p216\">\n    470 Mass. 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216-217 (2014), and does not bear any apparent relationship to the victim's treatment, diagnoses, or medical history. \"Thus, without testimony or additional evidence,\" the mother's statement was not admissible under the hearsay exception provided by \u00a7 79.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Irene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273430\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/462/600/#p616\">\n    462 Mass. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 616 (2012). Because the admission of the unredacted records would have been in error, the defendant cannot show he was prejudiced by his counsel's conduct. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Domino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275966\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/465/569/#p578\">\n    465 Mass. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578 (2013) (analyzing claim of prejudice while disregarding \"the likelihood of a legal misstep by the judge\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Leading questions and other errors\n   </em>\n   . The decision to allow leading questions on direct examination, especially when handling young children, is well within the discretion of the trial judge.

As the victim specifically stated that she was testifying based on her own memory and was subject to cross-examination on what happened during the breaks, there was no indication of unfairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the prosecutor did not misstate the evidence in closing argument. Both the victim and the mother testified that the victim was scared to disclose the defendant's abuse to her mother, but did in fact do so. The prosecutor properly argued that the victim and the mother were consistent on this and was entitled to choose the mother's version of the disclosure for quotation.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Urrea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276678\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/530/#p546\">\n    443 Mass. 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 546 (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
