L. c. 119, \u00a7 21, submitted a report to the Department of Children and Families (department) expressing concern that the mother was neglecting the child's medical, physical, and educational needs. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A. The department investigated and supported the charge. See G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51B. The mother appealed the department's decision and a fair hearing was scheduled. On the date set for hearing, the mother requested that the matter proceed only on written submissions. See 110 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.18 (2014). The mother's request was granted and she submitted five exhibits, her written argument, and certain other materials. The department submitted its \u00a7 51A intake and \u00a7 51B investigative reports. After considering the parties' submissions, a hearing officer concluded that there existed a reasonable basis to support the charge. The mother sought judicial review in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 30, \u00a7 14(7) ; a Superior Court judge denied the mother's motion for judgment on the pleadings and dismissed her complaint, and judgment entered for the department. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The mother's conclusory brief does not contain a reasonably comprehensible legal argument and sets forth little factual detail. She does not cite to pertinent supporting record or legal authority. As both a legal and practical matter, therefore, we are unable to consider the mother's claims.\n   <em>\n    Kellogg\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Registration in Med\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4272449\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/1001/#p1003\">\n    461 Mass. 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1003 (2011).

In any event, and to the extent we are able to discern the mother's claims, those claims lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The department may consider and rely on hearsay provided the hearsay has sufficient \"indicia of reliability.\"\n   <em>\n    Covell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Department of Social Servs\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47221\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/766/#p786\">\n    439 Mass. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 786 (2003), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Embers of Salisbury, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Alcoholic\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bevs.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Control Commn\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877559\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/401/526/#p530\">\n    401 Mass. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (1988). While the \u00a7 51A and \u00a7 51B reports from the department contain, in part, hearsay, that hearsay nonetheless bears such indicia, specifically the detailed, exhaustive reports provided by professional, specially-trained persons. The reports detail both the authors' direct observations and the content of their communications with identified persons. \"[R]easonable persons are accustomed to rely\" on such materials \"in the conduct of serious affairs,\" G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11(2), inserted by St. 1954, c. 681, \u00a7 1, and the department properly could rely on these reports.

We need not consider the matter further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
