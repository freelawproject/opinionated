L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), and possession of a class D substance with intent to distribute, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ). On October 24, 2008, the defendant waived his right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty to both counts, resulting in both matters being continued without a finding until October 23, 2009. Later, on or about October 22, 2010, the defendant pleaded guilty in the Lawrence Division of the District Court Department to unlawful possession of a class D substance (greater than one ounce), G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. As a result of his plea in the District Court, on October 4, 2011, the defendant was issued by the United States Department of Homeland Security a notice to appear for removal proceedings that charged he was subject to removal from the United States; on October 29, 2014, the defendant was ordered removed to Haiti. On April 25, 2016, the defendant filed in the BMC a motion to vacate conviction requesting that his October 24, 2008, plea be vacated; the motion was denied on September 8, 2016. The defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant asserts that the judge abused her discretion by refusing to vacate his plea where the defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel, as his counsel failed to warn him of the immigration consequences of his admissions. Under\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"314554\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/366/89/#p96\">\n    366 Mass. 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (1974), there is a two-part test for determining ineffective assistance of counsel that considers both counsel's performance and whether any deficient performance caused the defendant to suffer prejudice. In a case such as this, counsel has a duty to inform a defendant that upon a plea of guilty or admission to sufficient facts, \"removal ... would be presumptively mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeJesus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153493\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/174/#p179\">\n    468 Mass. 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (2014). However, even if we assume that the defendant has met his burden to establish that his attorney's advice did not measure up to\n   <em>\n    Saferian\n   </em>\n   's performance standard, he has not met his burden to establish that the consequences of counsel's serious incompetency was prejudicial. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chleikh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848635\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/718/#p723\">\n    82 Mass. App. Ct. 718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 723 (2012). See also\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Britto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"343529\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/433/596/#p601\">\n    433 Mass. 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 601 (2001). The defendant has not demonstrated that he was removed from the United States as a result of his guilty plea in the BMC case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the record indicates that the basis for the defendant's removal was his conviction in the District Court on October 22, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion to vacate conviction affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-11\">\n    At oral argument, counsel for the defendant informed this panel that the defendant had been removed to Haiti. Following oral argument, the defendant's counsel filed with this court a copy of the order, dated July 1, 2016, allowing the defendant's motion to vacate his conviction in the District Court. These facts do not affect the outcome in this case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
