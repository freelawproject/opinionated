Defense counsel then used the black box evidence at length during closing argument to cast doubt on other evidence presented by the Commonwealth.

The defendant's other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel similarly lack merit.

In the absence of such a showing, the defendant has not established that he was deprived of a substantial ground of defense.

The integrity of the grand jury proceedings in this case was not impaired by the undisclosed romantic relationship between the prosecutor who first presented the case to a grand jury and one of the testifying police officers. The Commonwealth's duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to a grand jury is limited to circumstances where \"the prosecutor possesses exculpatory evidence that would greatly undermine either the credibility of an important witness or evidence likely to affect the grand jury's decision, or withholds exculpatory evidence causing the presentation to be 'so seriously tainted,' that the prosecutor must present such evidence to the grand jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilcox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735019\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/33/#p37\">\n    437 Mass. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 (2002), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Dell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875838\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/392/445/#p447\">\n    392 Mass. 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 447 (1984).

The misstep here did not rise to the level of egregiousness and there is no indication in the record that it caused the defendant any prejudice.
