Keith and Patricia White-Davis.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   The plaintiff, B. Ruben DeWayne, claims to have a prescriptive easement over the defendants' registered property to reach his garage, which was built in 1924. He contends the easement should have been noted in the 1972 decree of registration of the defendants' property and that its absence is due to submission of inaccurate or incomplete plans which, he asserts, amounts to perpetrating a fraud on the court and renders the decree void ab initio. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's complaint. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   \"[F}or registered land to be burdened by an easement, generally the easement must be shown on the certificate of title.\"\n   <em>\n    Hickey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pathways Assn\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362238\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/735/#p754\">\n    472 Mass. 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 754 (2015). \"This is so whether the easement in question was granted by deed or acquired by prescription. To hold otherwise would undermine the integrity of the registration system, for over every title would loom the possibility of an undisclosed but valid interest in the land acquired through prescriptive use.\"\n   <em>\n    Tetrault\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bruscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877653\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/454/#p461\">\n    398 Mass. 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (1986). Here, no easement is noted in the decree or the certificate of title and even if an easement by prescription had existed before the registration decree, any such easement did not survive the registration proceedings. See\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877653\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/454/#p461\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877653\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/454/#p461\">\n    . at 459-460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   As the plaintiff points out, his predecessor in title objected to the registration claiming the same easement that the plaintiff claims in this action. \"Before the Land Court issues a judgment of registration, it first must pass on the validity of asserted encumbrances.... Therefore, a certificate of title represents a determination by the Land Court that only those encumbrances appearing on the certificate are valid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877653\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/454/#p461\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"877653\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/398/454/#p461\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   To the extent the plaintiff contends that the decree was obtained through fraud by the filing of incomplete plans, where it is undisputed that the plaintiff's predecessors received notice and in fact responded to the registration proceedings, they had an opportunity to raise any issue regarding the accuracy of the plans at that time. Familiar principles of issue preclusion foreclose that argument now.
