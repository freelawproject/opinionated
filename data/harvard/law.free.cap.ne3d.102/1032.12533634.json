The defendant applied for further appellate review and, on November 6, 2017, the Supreme Judicial Court remanded the matter to this court \"for any reconsideration that may be warranted in light of [that] court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Leslie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451885\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/477/48/\">\n    477 Mass. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\" After careful consideration, we conclude that the result is the same, although, having in mind the discussion of curtilage in\n   <em>\n    Leslie\n   </em>\n   , we do so for slightly different reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The facts offered at the hearing on the motion to suppress are summarized in some detail in our earlier opinion.\n   <em>\n    Dobson No. 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Briefly, there was evidence that a Sheffield police officer observed the defendant backing his car out of a private driveway. The defendant's car left the driveway as it was backing up, and backed across the front yard of the property, hitting and knocking over a large cement pillar. The defendant then drove over the sidewalk attempting to drive out onto Main Street, a public way. The officer followed the defendant and saw him enter a driveway four or five houses down on the same street. The officer followed into the driveway and spoke to the defendant, who was confrontational. The defendant eventually was arrested for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OUI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \"In allowing the defendant's motion to suppress, the judge concluded that [the officer] did not have reasonable suspicion to follow the defendant into his driveway. He based that conclusion on the fact that the driving behavior that caught the officer's attention had occurred on private property and not on a public way or a 'place to which the public has a right of access as invitees or licensees. The driveway to a private residence [where the defendant had knocked over the pillar] is none of these.' For this reason, the judge concluded that there had been 'no civil motor vehicle infraction or criminal motor vehicle offense.' \"\n   <em>\n    Dobson No. 1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

In so doing, the judge found that the defendant had pulled his car to the end of the long driveway; the driveway was bordered by 'a tall stockade (privacy type) fence,' with a 'tree line' along the fence, separating the defendant's property from that of his next door neighbor on the driveway side of the house. The front door to the house faces the street and is not directly accessible from the driveway; the front door would be used by the general public. The back door is accessed from the end of the driveway, and '[i]t would appear that occupants or regular visitors would access the home from the rear door/driveway area.'

The\n   <em>\n    Butterfield\n   </em>\n   court went on to discuss the issue in terms of whether the defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in his driveway.

For example, in this case, \"the photographs admitted in evidence show that, after parking, the defendant's car would have been clearly visible from the street; although a stockade fence and trees bordered the driveway along the side of it, there was 'no fence at all ... closer to the street [in front of the driveway].'

That license, however, is limited in scope, purpose, and duration.... Here, Detective Griffin and the other officers were entitled to open the front gate, walk up the path and onto the porch, and engage Price and his guests in conversation. In veering off the path and venturing into the side yard of the home for the purpose of conducting a search for the weapon, Detective Griffin engaged in the precise conduct that\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Jardines\n   </em>\n   found offensive to the Fourth Amendment.

The officer in the present case did no more than pull into the driveway and attempt to engage the defendant in conversation-at least until the defendant confronted him and, in so doing, gave the officer probable cause to arrest him for OUI. In particular, the officer did nothing comparable to looking under the porch-or bringing a drug dog to sniff for drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Another important distinction is that, in\n   <em>\n    Leslie\n   </em>\n   , the court did not consider the issue whether the officers had probable cause and exigent circumstances for their search because the Commonwealth had not argued that issue below.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12696458\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/1/\">\n    . at 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the Commonwealth argued in its memorandum in opposition to the defendant's motion to suppress that, at the time that the officer entered the defendant's driveway, he had probable cause to arrest him for leaving the scene of an accident after causing property damage and negligent operation of a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Specifically, the officer here observed the defendant driving erratically, apparently damaging property, and then driving away. The officer did not know the defendant's name or know that the driveway the defendant entered was his own. It was reasonable, therefore, for the officer to pull into the driveway behind the defendant in order to identify him and to conduct a threshold inquiry. Soon after he began the threshold inquiry, the defendant's impairment became obvious and the officer then also had probable cause to believe that the defendant, whom he had seen driving, was under the influence of alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As the Commonwealth argues, these facts are very similar to those in\n   <em>\n    Butterfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772030\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/926/#p928\">\n    44 Mass.

Officer Miller asked the defendant, who was on the walkway and within ten to fifteen feet of the back door, to return to the driveway. The defendant refused but answered Officer Miller's questions. Officer Miller walked toward him to continue the questioning until he was within a couple feet of the defendant. During part of the questioning, the defendant was leaning against his house\"). There, \"[w]e conclude[d] that Officer Miller did not intrude upon a legitimate expectation of privacy by entering the defendant's driveway.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772030\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/926/#p928\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"772030\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/44/926/#p928\">\n    . at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, the language in the various cases that have analyzed the scope of what an officer may do in \"hot pursuit\" of someone fleeing is useful here. The cases are not precisely on point because there is no evidence here that this defendant knew that the officer was following him. Nonetheless, some of the same considerations should apply. In\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/\">\n    471 Mass. 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the defendant for reckless operation of a motor vehicle, a \"jailable\" offense.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/\">\n    . at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This was so, even though the officer pursued the defendant into his home. As the court explained, \"[e]stablishing a bright-line rule prohibiting the warrantless entry of a home when the underlying offense is of lesser magnitude than a felony would send an unacceptable message to the defendant who 'drinks and drives that a hot pursuit or an arrest set in motion can be thwarted by beating police to one's door.'

We decline to adopt such a rule, which runs directly counter to sound public policy.
