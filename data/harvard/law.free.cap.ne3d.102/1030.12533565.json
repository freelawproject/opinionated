We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Judicial bias\n   </em>\n   . The mother claims that, due to her involvement in prior proceedings before the same judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the judge was biased against her in this action. We disagree. \"The law concerning recusal of a judge is well established: the decision to withdraw rests first within his sound discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of a Care &amp; Protection Summons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"734999\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/437/224/#p239\">\n    437 Mass. 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239 (2002).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Here, the mother did not move for the judge's recusal; \"[a]lthough this does not necessarily mean there was no bias, we do take [it] into consideration when viewing the record.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Poly\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moylan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1027985\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/423/141/#p150\">\n    423 Mass. 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 150 (1996). The mother claims she brought the potential for judicial bias to the judge's attention on three occasions during the trial. Putting aside whether this was sufficient to preserve the issue, the mother failed to point to anything in the record demonstrating that she did not receive a fair trial aside from the judge's references to past proceedings. The judge made multiple statements on the record indicating that he considered his ability to evaluate the matter fairly. In fact, the judge said to the mother:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"Every case rises and falls on its own merits. So, I don't want you to think for a minute that I'm going to be influenced by what happened before. But if you're really serious about what's going to happen in the future, I'll help take you through that future, and you'll get your kid back.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Furthermore, the judge provided the mother with multiple opportunities to comply with her service plan and reunify with the child, which she failed to do. \"Although it is possible that an unfavorable disposition could develop during prior proceedings, where that disposition is not 'so extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment,' it does not warrant recusal for bias.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of a Care &amp; Protection Summons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 240, quoting from\n   <em>\n    Liteky\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"235096\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/540/#p551\">\n    510 U.S. 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 551 (1994).

The mother also claims that the judge based the termination decision on erroneous factual findings and conclusions of law. Although one of the challenged factual findings lacks evidentiary support, it is outweighed by the totality of evidence in favor of termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Upon review, we give substantial deference to a judge's decision to terminate parental rights, which must be supported \"by clear and convincing evidence, based on subsidiary findings proved by at least a fair preponderance of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Jacques\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3848001\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/82/601/#p606\">\n    82 Mass.

The mother has a record that includes six criminal charges, including an assault and battery dated after the child's birth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mother has a history of drug abuse, including use of heroin, marijuana, and benzodiazepine during her pregnancy with the child. The mother's substance abuse and subsequent morphine treatment placed the child in danger both before and after her birth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The mother failed to comply with tasks assigned to her pursuant to the service plan. For instance, the mother often arrived late to scheduled visits with the child and was unprepared with snacks and activities. During visits, she was inattentive to the child's needs and was often distracted by her telephone and ongoing conflicts with her parents and the foster mother. The mother's living space is cluttered and exposes the child to hazards such as cat vomit and urine, craft supplies, and drug paraphernalia. The child spent minimal time in the mother's exclusive care\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and has bonded with the foster mother. Furthermore, two previous attempts by the Department of Children and Families (DCF) to reunify the mother with the child failed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The mother has been inconsistent with her drug treatment: she has missed group therapy meetings and at least one dose of her methadone treatment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and her medication counts have been \"typically off,\" which raised concerns that the mother was not taking her medication as prescribed. She has not completed a residential or inpatient treatment program. Additionally, she stated that \"drug rehabilitation treatment does not help her\" and that, as recently as August, 2015, her sobriety was not \"stable.\" The mother has failed to provide DCF with required documentation related to drug screens and her treatment protocol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On this record, we are convinced that the determination of unfitness was supported by clear and convincing evidence. The judge made detailed and thorough findings, supported by the record, and considered a \"constellation of factors\" to conclude that the mother was unfit and that termination was in the child's best interests.\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Greta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286820\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/577/#p588\">\n    431 Mass. 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 588 (2000). The mother's prior drug abuse and unstable sobriety, combined with her inability to take responsibility for her situation and meet the child's needs, makes her unlikely to provide \"minimally acceptable care\" in the future.\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Elena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783031\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/446/24/#p31\">\n    446 Mass. 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (2006), quoting from G.

Furthermore, the mother was repeatedly observed asleep while holding and feeding the child in the hospital. Rather than driven by fatigue, the mother's falling asleep and slumping over on top of the child was due to her high morphine dosage postpartum. Doctors and nurses continually educated the mother about the safety issue this posed to the child, reminding her that \"suffocation risk is a real possibility, especially as the mother is methadone medicated which seems to be making her sleep more deep[ly],\" but the mother's denial and continued missteps drew concern from doctors and nurses about her ability to care for the child.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The mother disputes the judge's finding that the child lived with the mother for one month while the mother was in treatment at Angel House and spent \"a handful of overnight visits\" with the mother.

However, this does not constitute reversible error because the ultimate determination of unfitness is supported by other clear and convincing evidence and this finding is \"not central to the ultimate conclusion of unfitness.
