For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Plaintiff-appellant, Robert Hurst, owns and resides in a condominium in the Carriage House West complex in Toledo, Ohio. On April 18, 2015, he was helping a neighbor clean her balcony. They needed a nozzle for a hose, so Hurst entered the darkened storage area of the underground parking garage-an area primarily used by maintenance employee, Robert Perine-to try to find one. Hurst walked toward the back of the garage where he knew there were shelving units, but he did not know where the light switch was located. He pulled out his phone to utilize its flashlight, but before he was able to turn it on, he stepped into a partially uncovered sump pump. He suffered serious injuries to his shoulder, for which he underwent two surgeries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Hurst filed a complaint against defendants-appellees, Carriage House West Condominium Owners Association, Inc., and Seaway Asset Management Company, the entities responsible for managing and maintaining the common areas of the complex. He alleged that by failing to properly cover the sump pit and maintain adequate lighting, appellees breached their duties to keep the common areas in good repair and free from hazards, to fix any such known hazards, and to warn of concealed dangers or dangers about which they had superior knowledge. He also claimed that Seaway breached its duty to properly manage the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellees moved for summary judgment on February 21, 2017. In an order journalized on April 7, 2017, the trial court granted summary judgment to appellees. It found that Hurst walked into a dark maintenance area, the darkness was an open and obvious hazard, and appellees owed no duty to warn against the danger of walking into a darkened area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Hurst appealed the trial court judgment and assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trial Court erred by failing to analyze the, \"step-in-the-dark rule\" to determine if Plaintiff acted without knowledge, information or investigation as to what the darkness might conceal when he stepped into the maintenance area and sustained injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In his sole assignment of error, Hurst claims that the trial court erred in failing to analyze the \"step-in-the-dark rule\" to determine if he acted reasonably when he walked into the darkened storage area. He maintains that a question of fact exists given that he had lived in the complex for six or seven years, the storage area was located in the parking garage, Perine had directed him to the storage area in the past to retrieve items, and he knew the area to be safe based on the other times he was directed by Perine to enter the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Appellees respond that Perine testified at deposition that while residents were not prohibited from entering the storage area, he kept nothing in the area that he would want a resident to use. They deny that Hurst was ever directed into the storage area in the past, and they emphasize that no one directed him into the storage area on the date of his fall. Appellees cite Hurst's deposition testimony indicating that he walked 25-30 feet into the storage area without a light while he tried to activate his cell phone flash light. They insist that Hurst was contributorily negligent and assumed the risk by stepping into a dark, unfamiliar area without using a source of light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} To establish actionable negligence, one must show the existence of a duty, a breach of that duty, and injury resulting proximately therefrom.\n   <em>\n    Mussivand v.

He did not indicate when he was last in the storage area and he did not recall whether he had seen the sump pump, but it is undisputed that he was not directed to the storage area on the day he was injured. Hurst testified that he walked approximately 25-30 feet into the storage area while attempting to retrieve his phone for a flashlight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In\n   <em>\n    Mayhew\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-1016\">\n    2017-Ohio-1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20N.E.3d%20758\">\n    86 N.E.3d 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 61, the appellate court found that summary judgment to the property owner was appropriate where the plaintiff walked down a dark, but familiar, staircase during a power outage without the aid of a flashlight or other illumination such as a cell phone. We reach the same conclusion here. Hurst recognized the danger inherent in proceeding through the storage room in the darkness, yet chose to do so anyway instead of waiting until he successfully activated his cell phone flashlight. Under these circumstances, we find that there exists no conflicting evidence to overcome the inference of the lack of ordinary prudence and care raised by the step-in-the-dark rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Accordingly, we find Hurst's sole assignment of error not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 20} For the foregoing reasons, we find Hurst's assignment of error not well-taken and affirm the April 7, 2017 judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas. The costs of this appeal are assessed to Hurst under App.R. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mark L.
