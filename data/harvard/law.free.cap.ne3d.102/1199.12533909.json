The motion was not reviewable under Crim.R. 32.1, as a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, or under Crim.R. 33, as a motion for a new trial, when Foster had been convicted of trafficking following a jury trial, and the motion sought resentencing rather than a new trial. Nor was the motion reviewable under R.C. Chapter 2731 as a petition for a writ of mandamus, under R.C. Chapter 2721 as a declaratory judgment action, or under R.C. Chapter 2725 as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, when the motion did not satisfy those statutes' procedural requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2731.04, 2721.12(A), and 2725.04. And Crim.R. 57(B) did not require the common pleas court to review pursuant to the procedures provided under Civ.R. 60(B) the challenges advanced in the motion, because Foster's judgment of conviction had been reviewable under the procedures provided for a direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See State v.

Because the earned-credit statute identified eligible offenders and conferred upon the department of rehabilitation and correction, not the trial court, the authority to determine and award the credit, we concluded that\n   that portion of Livingston's sentence declaring him ineligible for earned days of credit was not authorized by law and was thus subject to review on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4-7, citing R.C. 2953.08(D)(1).

We further note that the version of R.C. 2925.03(C)(6)(g) effective in 2008, when Foster was resentenced, conferred upon the trial court the discretion to impose \"an additional mandatory prison term\" for Foster's major-drug-offender specification. Because the trial court was authorized by statute to impose upon Foster the seven-year prison term for the major-drug-offender specification and to restrict his eligibility for the intensive prison program, transitional control, and judicial release, those portions of his sentence were not void, and the common pleas court had no jurisdiction to entertain the collateral challenges to them presented in his 2016 motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} But the trial court had no statutory authority to declare Foster \"not eligible for * * * any other early release program\" or to order that he \"serve [his] sentence in its entirety.\" Those parts of his sentence were, therefore, void, and the common pleas court had jurisdiction to review and correct them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Accordingly, we sustain in part the first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Merger\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In his second assignment of error, Foster asserts that the 2008 judgment of conviction entered on remand from our 2007 decision in\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

The judgment plainly shows that the trial court, pursuant to our order on remand, merged the possession and conspiracy charges into the trafficking charge and sentenced Foster for trafficking only, along with that offense's major-drug-offender specification. We said as much in our 2009 decision in Foster's direct appeal, affirming the 2008 judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-080929.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} This court does not have, nor did the common pleas court have, jurisdiction to entertain Foster's merger challenge to the judgment of conviction. Accordingly, we overrule the second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Affirmed as Modified, but Remanded\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Because Foster's sentence was not correctable under any criminal rule or statutory procedure, his 2015 \"Motion to Vacate, Set-Aside, and Resentence Due to Void Judgment\" was subject to dismissal. Accordingly, upon the authority of App.R. 12(A)(1)(a), we modify the judgment appealed from to reflect the dismissal of the motion. And we affirm the judgment as modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} But the common pleas court had jurisdiction to correct those unauthorized portions of his sentence declaring that he was \"not eligible for * * * any other early release program\" and ordering that he \"serve [his] sentence in its entirety.\" We, therefore, remand this cause for correction of the offending portions of the sentencing entry, in accordance with the law and this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Judgment accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Cunningham, P.J., Myers and Miller, JJ.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
