Consolo (\"Consolo\"). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On September 25, 2013, Hammon filed a complaint in the General Division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court against Huntington, First Capital, and Consolo. Hammon's complaint arose out of a monetary settlement of a medical malpractice action that he received as a minor, and the guardianship established to manage those funds in Cuyahoga P.C. No. 1992-GRD-1079707 (the \"guardianship\"). When Hammon was a minor, the probate court appointed Huntington as guardian of Hammon's estate, and Consolo acted as counsel for Huntington in its capacity as guardian. As we discuss more fully below, Huntington invested the guardianship estate funds in two separate trusts for which First Capital acted as trustee. The general division dismissed Hammon's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On February 20, 2014, Hammon refiled his complaint in Cuyahoga P.C. No. 2014-ADV-195963 (the \"adversarial proceeding\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In October 2014, the trial court granted Hammon's motion to amend his complaint in response to motions for a more definite statement filed by Consolo and First Capital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That same month, Hammon filed his second amended complaint that is now the subject of the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The following is an overview of the allegations contained in Hammon's second amended complaint. Hammon was born in September 1988. He sustained a birth injury that resulted in cerebral palsy and impairment of his motor skills. In September 1992, the probate court appointed National City Bank (\"National City\") as guardian of Hammon's estate for the purpose of managing the proceeds of his pending medical malpractice case in the common pleas court. In December 1993, the probate court approved the settlement of Hammon's medical malpractice case for $3,200,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In July 1997, Hammon's mother, Rita Berardinelli (\"Berardinelli\"), through her attorney, Consolo, filed an application to remove National City as guardian of her son's estate and to appoint Huntington as successor guardian. In response to this application, National City agreed to step down as guardian. The probate court appointed Huntington as successor guardian of Hammon's estate. Hammon alleges that soon after the appointment of Huntington as guardian, Consolo ceased representation of Berardinelli and began to represent Huntington in its capacity as guardian, at the expense of the estate. Hammon further alleges that at the time Consolo filed the application to remove National City and appoint Huntington as guardian on behalf of Berardinelli, Huntington was also a client of Consolo and his law firm. He\n   asserts this conflict of interest was never waived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In August 1999, Huntington filed an application for authority to purchase a $1 million annuity to generate an income stream over Hammon's lifetime. In December 1999, the probate court held an initial hearing on this application. Present at the hearing were Huntington representatives, Consolo, Berardinelli, and Hammon's father, David Hammon (\"David\"). David objected to the idea of an annuity and \"advocated for an investment that would create an income stream and that would also protect the principal.\" The amended complaint further states that David obtained a continuance of the hearing to seek legal representation and consult with financial experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} At the continued hearing in February 2000, all parties in attendance at the December 1999 hearing were again present in addition to David's counsel, attorney Mark Sullivan (\"Sullivan\"). The parties met to consider and negotiate investment of guardianship funds so that Hammon would not receive a large sum when he turned 18, but rather to provide him with a stream of income over his lifetime. All parties present at the hearing eventually agreed that $1 million would be invested in a \"Settlement Preservation Trust,\" with a projected income of \"approximately $85,000 per year\" with the $1 million principal being paid back to Hammon when he turned 35. This agreement was reflected in an agreed entry that was executed by a Huntington representative, Berardinelli, Consolo, David, and Sullivan. The agreed entry states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties agree that the sum of [$1,000,000] should be invested in what is titled a \"Settlement Preservation Trust.\" [Huntington,] as guardian of the estate, will be the grantor of the Trust as Guardian and will also be the beneficiary of the Trust until the time [Hammon] reaches the age of majority. Upon reaching the age of majority, [Hammon] will become the beneficiary of the income from the Trust, which is currently projected to be approximately [$85,000] per year. This income stream will continue until [Hammon] reaches the age of [35] at which time the income will cease and the original principal investment of [$1,000,000] will revert to [Hammon].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On June 8, 2000, Consolo filed a motion to accept this undated agreed entry. Attached to the agreed entry was an unsigned schedule of payments sheet that lists a \"guaranteed payout\" of $1,950,745 and \"annual benefits\" of\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   $85,815 per year, guaranteed payable for 23 years. First payment is [November 2, 2000]. Last payment is [November 2, 2022]. This is 23 guaranteed annual payments, and then payments stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The payment sheet also notes a \"lump sum benefit[ ] payable [November 2, 2023]\" of \"$1,000,000.\" The motion to accept this agreed entry was withdrawn by counsel in December 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In July 2000, Huntington entered into a trust agreement with Morgan Chase Trust Company (\"Morgan Chase\") entitled the \"Zachary Hammon Settlement Preservation Trust\" (\"SPT 1\"). This first trust was funded with $1 million. The \"schedule of payment instructions\" attached as Schedule C to the SPT 1 document is very similar to the payment schedule attached to the agreed entry. It provides for \"$84,815 annually for 23 years. Payments to commence on November 2, 2000\" and \"$1,000,000 lump sum paid on November 2, 2023.\" However, unlike the payment schedule attached to the agreed entry that provided for \"guaranteed\" annual and lump sum payments, the SPT 1 document states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Grantor [HNB] acknowledges that Trustee [First Capital] and the Trust Service\n   Administrator and the custodian [sic] have not made any guarantee with regard to investment return, investment performance of the Trust nor as to the payments set forth in Schedule C attached hereto.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In January 2005, Huntington entered into a second trust agreement with Morgan Chase also entitled the \"Zachary Hammon Settlement Preservation Trust\" (\"SPT 2\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   SPT 2 was funded with $500,000. Addendum C attached to the SPT 2 document, captioned \"Grantor's Request for Payments\" provided:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Periodic Distributions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   $33,307.89 paid annually to the Beneficiary [Hammon] for 18 years. Payments to commence [May 2, 2008] (age 18) and continue to and including [May 2, 2023] (age 35). * * * $500,000.00 lump sum payment paid to [Hammon] on [November 2, 2023] (age 35).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} SPT 2 contains similar \"no guarantee\" language to that of SPT 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The Beneficiary [HNB] further acknowledges that neither the Trustee [First Capital] nor the Custodian have made any guarantee of investment return, investment performance of the Trust, or of the ability of the Trustee to make a future distribution(s) contemplated under the Trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Addendum C states that \"[v]ariations in investment returns from those anticipated may cause the schedule of payments shown above to be higher or lower than those shown.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Hammon turned 18 years old in September 2006. On January 24, 2007, Huntington filed its final account as guardian for the period from October 1, 2003 to September 4, 2006. The account shows assets and receipts totaling $2,080,774.52, disbursements of $369,180.57, and a resulting balance of $1,711,594.000. This accounting lists the following assets: Hammon and Berardinelli's home at a market value of $251,000; SPT 1, with a market value of $509,038.00; and SPT 2, with a market value of $487,127.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} On January 27, 2007, Hammon signed a ward's receipt acknowledging (1) receipt of $1,711,594; (2) approving the Final Account; and (3) \"approv[ing] any Guardian or Attorney fees therein, which require [Hammon's] approval.\" The probate court approved the final account in March 2007 and terminated the guardianship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Hammon's second amended complaint explains that his father, David, was in prison from February 2000, \"shortly after he and his attorney advocated for a guaranteed investment,\" until May 2002, and then again from September 2004 until January 2011. His mother, Berardinelli, had issues with drug addiction and died in February 2009. The second amended complaint alleges that despite the termination of the guardianship in March 2007, all defendants continued to act on Hammon's behalf as the bulk of the estate funds were still invested in SPT 1 and SPT 2 after termination of the guardianship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Hammon alleges that on May 7, 2009, his attorney at the time sent an email to a First Capital representative seeking confirmation as to whether payments under SPT 1 and SPT 2 were fixed or variable and whether there was any return of the principal. He alleges that First Capital did not respond to this inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In November 2009, Huntington sent a letter to Hammon advising him that \"the investment products purchased from First Capital (formerly Morgan Chase) had not performed as anticipated\" and recommending that Hammon consult with an\n   attorney. Hammon acknowledges that he did consult with two separate attorneys in 2009 and 2010, but alleges that the efforts of these attorneys to investigate the performance of SPT 1 and SPT 2 were thwarted by the defendants. He asserts that he was finally informed in June 2013, by one or more of the defendants, that neither SPT 1 nor SPT 2 guarantee any specific annual income nor the return of the principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Based upon these allegations, Hammon asserted the following claims against Huntington in the second amended complaint: breach of contract (Counts 1 and 8), negligence (Count 2), breach of fiduciary duty (Count 3), fraud (Count 4), civil conspiracy (Count 5), conversion (Count 7), and violations of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (\"UPIA\") (Count 9). Hammon also asserted claims of breach of contract, fraud, civil conspiracy, conversion, and violations of the UPIA against First Capital (Counts 4, 5, 6, 8, and 9) and fraud, civil conspiracy, and conversion against Consolo (Counts 4, 5, 6, and 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} After the filing of the second amended complaint, this matter proceeded on a parallel track with the inactive guardianship case. The trial court's judgment entry explains that in March 2014, Hammon moved the probate court to vacate its March 2007 order approving the final account. In late 2014, all three defendants in the adversarial proceeding separately moved for dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) of the second amended complaint. Huntington's motion to dismiss was also styled \"in the alternative\" as a motion for summary judgment. In December 2015, Hammon moved for the funds of SPT 1 and SPT 2 to be released to him. In September 2015, Hammon filed a suggestion of recusal of the judges of the probate court. Both Cuyahoga County Probate Court judges recused themselves, and a visiting judge was appointed over the inactive guardianship case and the present adversarial proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} The trial court denied the motion to vacate the order approving the final account of the guardianship estate in February 2016, but granted the motion to release the trust funds to Hammon in March 2016. Hammon moved the trial court to reconsider its denial of his motion to vacate the order approving the final accounting. The trial court denied his motion to reconsider in May 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In September 2016, the trial court held a hearing on the motions to dismiss, heard oral argument from counsel for all parties, and subsequently issued a judgment entry granting all three motions, dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 24} It is from this order that Hammon now appeals, raising the following three assignments of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The trial court erred in dismissing [Hammon's] second amended complaint, because (1) it wrongfully and erroneously concluded that his breach of contract claims were tort claims, and (2) it considered evidentiary materials outside of the complaint.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial court erred in dismissing the fraud and breach of trust claims, because even if the trigger dates of January 27, 2007 and May 7, 2009 are lawfully considered trigger dates, then the record still does not support the proposition that Hammon knew or reasonably should have known that [Huntington, First Capital, and Consolo] caused damages to him by their fraudulent conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The trial court erred in considering numerous materials outside of the complaint, in ruling upon the 12(B)(6) motions that were filed by all defendants.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} For ease of analysis, we consider these assignments of error together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Claims against Huntington\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In the first and third assignments of error, Hammon argues that the trial court erred in considering the evidentiary materials attached to Huntington's motion to dismiss and improperly granted Huntington's motion. We note that Huntington styled its motion to dismiss \"in the alternative\" as a motion for summary judgment and put forth res judicata and statute of limitations defenses to Hammon's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In considering a motion to dismiss a trial court cannot consider facts outside the pleadings, unless the parties are first provided with notice that the motion is being converted into a motion for summary judgment and afforded an opportunity to respond in accordance with Civ.R. 56.\n   <em>\n    Redmond v. Sberna\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 68529,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20273764\">\n    1996 WL 273764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (May 23, 1996). Notice is required to give parties a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate whether a genuine issue of fact exists.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20273764\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Hammon argues that the trial court never notified the parties that Huntington's motion to dismiss would be converted into a motion for summary judgment and denied him the opportunity to conduct any discovery. He contends \"[t]herefore, this is truly a [Civ.R.] 12(B)(6) case, and the court cannot look at any evidentiary materials outside of the complaint.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In\n   <em>\n    Redmond\n   </em>\n   , this court considered whether notice of conversion is required when a motion to dismiss is also styled as an alternative motion for summary judgment. We held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [T]here is no conversion of a motion to dismiss when a party moves to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The \"in the alternative\" styled motion provides all the notice necessary to the non-moving party because, on its face, it constitutes a motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment. Therefore, notice is not necessary when a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment is filed, and the non-moving party acknowledges the dual nature of the motion and responds with countervailing evidentiary materials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   (Internal Citations Omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, citing\n   <em>\n    Applegate v.

He asserts that neither he nor his attorney at the time of the winding up of the guardianship knew that \"there was a contract for guaranteed investment\" and, therefore, his claims premised upon the agreed entry could not have been litigated in the guardianship case. Hammon differentiates between Huntington's administration and accounting of the guardianship and the assurances allegedly made by Huntington representatives to his parents\n   that the terms of SPT 1 would guarantee yearly income and return of the $1 million principal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 38} We agree with Hammon that Counts 1 and 4 of his second amended complaint, which he styles as breach of contract and fraud, respectively, do not relate to Huntington's administration of his estate. In both Counts 1 and 4, Hammon alleges that Huntington representatives made assurances to his parents that estate funds would be invested in a manner that guaranteed a return of the principal amount to Hammon when he reached the age of 35. Although Hammon's allegations in Counts 1 and 4 arise out of the guardianship, these alleged assurances were not the subject matter of the guardianship proceeding and are separate and distinct from the probate court's determination that Huntington lawfully administered Hammon's estate.

The trial court found that at that time, \"a reasonably prudent individual knew or should have known that [SPT 1 and SPT 2] had not performed as anticipated.\" The trial court also found \"[a]pparently [Hammon] believed that when he contracted with [a law firm in early 2009] to represent him for potential negligence, conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, fraudulent conveyance and other related claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 51} We find that the trial court's discovery rule analysis conflates Hammon's fraud and breach of fiduciary claims against Huntington. As we discussed above, Hammon's fraud claim is premised upon the agreed entry and alleged assurances of guaranteed return of the principal that are separate and distinct from the actual investment performance of the trusts and Huntington's administration of Hammon's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   {\u00b6 52} Hammon alleges that he and his family relied upon representations by Huntington representatives that return of the principal amounts of the SPT 1 and SPT 2 trusts were guaranteed. He contends that he did not discover until June 2013 that neither SPT 1 nor SPT 2 guaranteed any specific annual income nor the return of the principal. Accordingly, the overall values of SPT 1 and SPT 2 in January 2007, at the time of the final accounting of the guardianship, may not have given Hammon, his family, or counsel, reason to believe that he would ultimately not receive the return of the principal amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Hammon admits in his complaint that on May 7, 2009, Christopher Vlasich (\"Vlasich\"), his attorney at the time, sent an email to a First Capital representative, seeking confirmation as to whether the payments under SPT 1 and SPT 2 were fixed or variable and whether there was any return of the principal, but he contends that First Capital did not respond to this inquiry. To his reply to Huntington's motion, Hammon attached the affidavit Vlasich who represented him in 2009. Vlasich stated that the focus of his firm's investigation related to the distributions made by the court-appointed guardians, National City, and Huntington, primarily as they related to Hammon's mother, Berardinelli. Vlasich further stated that he \"reviewed an Agreed Entry attached to a\n   Motion to Accept Agreed Entry * * * and [SPT 1 and SPT 2] in an attempt to determine whether payments made thereunder were fixed or variable and whether there would be any return of principal.\" He reiterates Hammon's allegation that he emailed a First Capital representative in May 2009 to determine whether Hammon could expect to return of the principal, but he did not receive a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Considering all the evidence in the limited record before us in a light most favorable to Hammon, we cannot conclusively determine that Hammon should have discovered the alleged fraud and the conflicting terms of the agreed entry from SPT 1 and SPT 2 in May 2009. The record does not reflect that Attorney Vlasich was aware that Hammon and his family relied on assurances of guaranteed return of the trust principal as evidenced by the agreed entry, nor does the record reflect, as the trial court states, what \"Hammon believed * * * when he contracted with [Vlasich's] law firm in 2009.\" Moreover, the record is not clear when Hammon was alerted to the inconsistencies between the agreed entry and SPT 1 and SPT 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Based on the foregoing, we find that reasonable minds could come to more than one conclusion as to when Hammon should have discovered the basis of the alleged fraud claim. Accordingly, we find that the trial court erred in dismissing of Hammon's fraud claim against Huntington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Claims against First Capital and Consolo\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Throughout his brief, Hammon argues that the trial court improperly relied on evidentiary materials outside the complaint and misapplied the discovery rule to his fraud claims against First Capital and Consolo and his breach of trust claim against First Capital.

Based on the foregoing, Count 8 is necessarily a breach of trust claim as pled against First Capital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 64} First Capital argues that, under the terms of SPT 1 and SPT 2, South Dakota law should apply to Hammon's breach of trust claim. South Dakota law provides a two-year statute of limitations for breach of trust claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.D.Codified Laws 15-2-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The trial court, however, applied Ohio law in analyzing Hammon's breach of trust claim. Under Ohio law, the relevant statute of limitations for breach of trust claims is R.C. 5810.05, which provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (A) A beneficiary may not commence a proceeding against a trustee for breach\n   of trust more than two years after the date the beneficiary, a representative of the beneficiary, or a beneficiary surrogate is sent a report that adequately discloses the existence of a potential claim for breach of trust and informs the beneficiary, the representative of the beneficiary, or the beneficiary surrogate of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding against a trustee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (C) If division (A) of this section does not apply * * * a judicial proceeding by a beneficiary against a trustee for breach of trust must be commenced within four years after the first of the following to occur:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   (4) The time at which the beneficiary knew or should have known of the breach of trust.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   {\u00b6 66} It is not clear from the face of the complaint whether Hammon, his representative, or surrogate was sent a report disclosing the basis of his breach of trust claim and that R.C. 5810.05(A) applies here. Therefore, we apply the four-year statute of limitations under division (C). We find that the statute of limitations began to run, at the very latest, when Huntington advised Hammon that the trusts \"had not performed as anticipated\" on November 2, 2009. The savings statute, R.C. 2305.19, specifically states that it does not apply to an action arising under R.C. 5810.05. Therefore, Hammon's filing of his initial complaint in the adversarial proceeding controls, rather than his September 2013 filing in the common pleas court. Hammon filed his initial complaint in the present matter on February 20, 2014, more than four years after November 2, 2009. Therefore, Hammon's breach of trust claim against First Capital is time barred under the laws of both South Dakota and Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   {\u00b6 67} We note that the trial court stated that it relied on materials outside the complaint in dismissing Hammon's fraud claim against First Capital on the basis of statute of limitations. This error is harmless because Hammon failed to plead his fraud claim against First Capital with sufficient particularity under Civ.R. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   {\u00b6 68} In the second amended complaint, Hammon does not identify anyone from First Capital who was involved in the alleged negotiations that led to the agreed entry, nor does he identify any specific fraudulent statements made by First Capital representatives to his parents or their counsel. Hammon merely alleges that \"representatives of [First Capital], flew in a representative to Cleveland to attend the [February 2000] hearing\" and includes First Capital in his general allegations against all defendants. Moreover, we note that the agreed entry does not identify First Capital as a party, nor is it signed by any First Capital representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   {\u00b6 69} We also note that the trial court dismissed the fraud claim against Consolo for lack of particularity under Civ.R. 9. Hammon does not assign any error to this finding. Accordingly, we find the trial court properly granted the 12(B)(6) motions to dismiss First Capital and Consolo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   {\u00b6 70} Based on the foregoing, we find that the trial court committed reversible error by dismissing Hammon's fraud claim against Huntington because genuine issues of material fact exist as to Hammon's discovery of the alleged fraud. Although the trial court erroneously relied on the materials outside the complaint in granting the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion of First Capital, this error was harmless because Hammon did not plead his fraud claim against First Capital with particularity. Accordingly, Hammon's first, second, and third assignments\n   of error are sustained in part and overruled in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   {\u00b6 71} Therefore, we affirm the trial court's grant of the Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motions to dismiss of First Capital and Consolo as well as the trial court's dismissal of Counts 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 against Huntington. We reverse the trial court's dismissal of Hammon's fraud claim in Counts 1 and 4 against Huntington.
