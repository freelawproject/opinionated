He contends that the judge erred in refusing his request to instruct the jury on the defenses of necessity and accident.

App. Ct. 735\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (2007) (accident defense). An instruction on either defense would have been required had the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the defense and with all reasonable inferences drawn in its favor, supported that defense. See\n   <em>\n    Magadini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173771\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/593/#p597\">\n    474 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   600 ;\n   <em>\n    Power-Koch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3235178\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/69/735/#p737\">\n    69 Mass. App. Ct. at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that the evidence here, so viewed, did not support either defense, and we therefore affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant argues that the defenses were supported by evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the defendant's pick-up truck had a mechanical problem that caused it to jump out of \"park\" and into gear. We assume arguendo, although there was no direct evidence on the point, that the jury could permissibly have found that the truck did jump into gear at about the time in question. The defendant's wife had parked the truck in a store parking lot to do an errand, leaving its keys on the driver's seat with the defendant, who was sitting in the passenger seat, so he could listen to the radio if he wished. A witness then heard tires squealing and saw the truck quickly travel in reverse through the parking lot, cross through traffic on a street, and crash into a bank on the other side of the street. The defendant was in the truck. When the defendant's wife returned from her errand, she saw that the truck was not where she had left it, but instead was across the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The defendant argues that the truck's having slipped into reverse gear constituted an \"accident,\" that \"necessity\" justified his putting his foot on the brake pedal in an attempt to stop the truck from causing injury or property damage, and that a further \"accident\" resulted in him putting his foot on the accelerator, rather than the brake pedal, causing the tires to squeal and the truck to travel in reverse across the road and hit the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   What this scenario ignores is that under any permissible view of the evidence, the truck's tires could not have squealed and it could not have traveled across the road unless its engine had been started,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, even taking the view most favorable to the defendant, he was the only one who could have started it. His having done so constituted \"operation.\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Uski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"851792\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/263/22/#p24\">\n    263 Mass. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24 (1928) (\"A person operates a motor vehicle within the meaning of G.

The defendant does not argue that \"necessity\" justified his starting the engine in order to avoid some greater harm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cf.\n   <em>\n    Magadini\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173771\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/474/593/#p597\">\n    474 Mass. at 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kendall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789515\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/10/#p13\">\n    451 Mass. 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13 (2008) (necessity defense \"exonerates one who commits a crime under the 'pressure of circumstances' if the harm that would have resulted from compliance with the law ... exceeds the harm actually resulting from the defendant's violation of the law\").
