The defendant argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from his appellate attorney in his direct appeal,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    DeGennaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/420/\">\n    84 Mass.

The defendant specifically contends that his attorney failed to argue that applying a \"novel construction\" of the fiduciary embezzlement statute, G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 57, to the defendant would be an ex post facto application of the criminal statute, thereby violating the defendant's due process rights. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The defendant was convicted of violating G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 57, the fiduciary embezzlement statute. This court affirmed the defendant's convictions in\n   <em>\n    DeGennaro I\n   </em>\n   .
