We accept all the motion judge's findings, summarized as follows. In February, 2013, two police detectives on patrol in an unmarked police cruiser observed the defendant and another man walking through a high crime area where there were recent incidents of shots fired. Neither man was known to the detectives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The detectives pulled over in the cruiser and identified themselves as police officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   One detective requested that both men remove their hands from their pockets for officer safety. After the detective's second request, the defendant quickly removed his hands. The second detective described the defendant as appearing nervous, and as looking like a \"deer in the headlights.\" He further observed that the defendant's right pocket looked heavy and weighted down. Both detectives were experienced officers trained in the investigation of violent crimes. One of the detectives conducted a patfrisk of the defendant for officer safety and removed a loaded firearm from the defendant's jacket pocket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The motion judge found that the patfrisk was justified for officer safety \"[o]nce this experienced officer observed the defendant's right pocket was heavy and weighted down when he removed his hands.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"[P]olice officers may not escalate a consensual encounter into a protective frisk absent a reasonable suspicion that an individual has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a criminal offense\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   is armed and dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Narcisse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269066\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/1/#p9\">\n    457 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 9 (2010). Both requirements are satisfied when there is \"a reasonable belief that an individual has a weapon and appears inclined to use it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269066\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/1/#p9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269066\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/1/#p9\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The facts and inferences underlying the officer's suspicion must be viewed as a whole when assessing the reasonableness of his acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sykes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817062\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/308/#p314\">\n    449 Mass. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 314 (2007), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thibeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934217\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/762/#p764\">\n    384 Mass. 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764 (1981).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties are in agreement that the detectives' initial stop of the defendant and his companion was consensual and that he was seized when the police announced their intention to pat frisk him. The disputed question is whether the detectives had reasonable suspicion at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Even considering the factual context and the detectives' training, the mere fact that one of the detectives observed something heavy in the defendant's pocket does not provide a reasonable belief that the defendant had a weapon or that he appeared inclined to use it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jones-Pannell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362473\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/429/#p434\">\n    472 Mass. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434-436 (2015) (officer's training, combined with defendant ignoring officer's questions, defendant's flight, and hand inside of pants did not create reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed weapon);\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Martin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269082\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/14/#p20\">\n    457 Mass. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 20-21 (2010) (nervousness and silence in response to officer's questions in high crime neighborhood did not create reasonable suspicion that defendant possessed firearm).

We therefore agree with the defendant that the detectives did not have reasonable suspicion to conduct a patfrisk and the motion to suppress should have been allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   .
