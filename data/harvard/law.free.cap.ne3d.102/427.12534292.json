Anthony coins as potentially high-value items; and (2) to affirmatively investigate whether the coins' actual value exceeded their face value. These were discretionary functions, the alleged value of the seized coins was in no way obvious, and there is no established law or procedure-nor any cited by the plaintiff-that required the defendant to undertake such a process.

Having no information to the contrary, the defendant could reasonably believe that he had no legal obligation to determine the coins' possible value prior to processing them. As a matter of law then, the judge properly concluded that the defendant was entitled to qualified immunity under the MCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    The plaintiff asserted negligence and conversion claims under common law and the Massachusetts Torts Claims Act against the defendant at oral argument, yet they were not argued in his brief.
