L. c. 265, \u00a7 22A ; five counts of aggravated rape of a child, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23A ; and three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen, G.

The defendant contends that, due both to insufficiency of the evidence and to prejudicial error in the jury instructions, his conviction of indecent assault and battery based on touching the victim's buttocks was duplicative of two of his aggravated rape convictions (digital-anal and penile-anal). We disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   As to sufficiency, the victim (who was eleven years old at the time of trial) testified that the defendant \"would put his finger on my-on my bum.\" The prosecutor asked, \"What would he do with his hands when he touched your bum? Can you describe that for us?\" The victim responded by making a rubbing motion with her hands. The prosecutor then asked, \"Was there\n   <em>\n    anything\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    else\n   </em>\n   [emphasis supplied] that he did with your bum?\" The victim responded by describing the defendant putting both his finger and his \"front private\" inside her \"bum.\" \"Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\" this was sufficient \"[t]o support a conviction of indecent assault and battery ... [based on] separate and distinct acts from the acts constituting the crime of rape,\" or in this case, aggravated anal rapes.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Juzba\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"123851\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/46/319/#p325\">\n    46 Mass.

In this case, the defendant argues, and the Commonwealth does not dispute, that the judge was required to instruct the jury that, to convict the defendant of both offenses, they must find that he \"committed separate and distinct criminal acts.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Traylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362193\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/260/#p274\">\n    472 Mass. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 274 (2015), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145197\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/682/#p700\">\n    470 Mass. 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 700 (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the judge did not do so, \"the test ... is not whether there was sufficient evidence to support multiple convictions, but whether there is any significant possibility that the multiple convictions were based on the same act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 276-277.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Here, the judge instructed the jury that \"he's been charged with ten separate and distinct offenses[,]\" and \"[y]ou must consider each of these offenses, each charge and the evidence pertaining to each offense separately.\" The judge gave similar instructions regarding separate consideration of the five aggravated rape charges and of the three indecent assault and battery charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge also explained to the jury that they would be provided with a verdict slip for each charge, with each slip describing specific conduct. Insofar as pertinent here, the judge explained that one aggravated rape slip would specify \"finger into anus,\" another would specify \"penis into anus,\" and one of the indecent assault and battery slips would specify \"hands on buttocks.\" Such slips were provided, and the jury marked the line for \"guilty\" on each of them. Also, the victim's testimony, which the jury plainly credited, clearly described the defendant's rubbing of her buttocks as separate from the digital-anal and penile-anal rapes. In these circumstances, we see no\n   <em>\n    \"significant possibility\"\n   </em>\n   that the indecent assault and battery conviction for touching the buttocks was based on the same conduct as-i.e., duplicative of-either of the anal rape convictions.

Here the Commonwealth made no such argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   What the defendant actually challenges here are not statements that the victim had no reason to lie, but two rhetorical questions by the prosecutor in response to the defendant's attacks on the victim's credibility. The first such question was: \"Does [the victim] strike you as somebody that is particularly sophisticated to concoct an elaborate lie that lasts not just for a little while but years, years of that?\" The second was: \"[It's been] suggested by the defendant that this was concocted, this was made up. Why? Why? Would she make this up? Why would she fabricate this? Because mom wanted him out of the house?\" As stated in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12456647\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/89/13/#p28\">\n    89 Mass. App. Ct. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 28 (2016), there is no rule barring a prosecutor from \"asking the rhetorical question, 'What possible motive does [the witness] have to come in here and lie to you?' 'A prosecutor can address, in a closing argument, a witness's demeanor, motive for testifying, and believability, provided that such remarks are based on the evidence, or fair inferences drawn from it, and are not based on the prosecutor's personal beliefs ....' \"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157250\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/430/111/#p118\">\n    430 Mass. 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118-119 (1999). The defendant does not argue that those standards were violated here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Burden-shifting\n   </em>\n   . Finally, we disagree with the defendant that the prosecutor used rhetorical questions to shift the burden of proof onto the defendant. Although such a tactic would be improper, see\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Habarek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"820871\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/402/105/#p111\">\n    402 Mass. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (1988), not all rhetorical questions shift the burden of proof. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 1113(b)(3)(E), and note at 438 (2017). The two questions the defendant challenges here, quoted above, merely responded to attacks on the victim's credibility, without \"improperly shift[ing] the burden of proof [or] comment[ing] on the defendant's silence.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153508\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/468/1/#p12\">\n    468 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    At the close of the Commonwealth's case, the judge allowed the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty on one of two counts of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony, G.
