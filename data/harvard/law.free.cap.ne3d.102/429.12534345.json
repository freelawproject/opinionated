More particularly, he claims that the Commonwealth's evidence failed to establish that he intentionally interfered with the victim's \"normal breathing or circulation of blood by applying substantial pressure on [her] throat or neck.\" G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15D(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), inserted by St. 2014, c. 260, \u00a7 24. We disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The reconstructed record of the trial reveals that the defendant and the victim were engaged in a fight outside a convenience store and a nearby hotel. When police officers approached the two, one of the two officers saw the defendant push the victim and the victim \"swat[ ] him away.\" The defendant then hit the victim in the head, and the victim threw coffee at the defendant. The defendant became \"enraged and put his left arm around [the victim's] neck, 'swinging her from side to side' by the neck.\" The police officers identified themselves and ran toward the couple. To one of the officers, \"it appeared that the defendant was choking [the victim], who \"yelped\" and \"let out a couple of screams.\" The victim had \"red marks\" around her neck and face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant claims that this evidence does not offer a basis to conclude that his conduct interrupted the victim's breathing or blood circulation. However, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the officer saw the defendant put his arm around the victim's neck, with enough force to \"swing her from side to side\" and to leave red marks. From this observation, it was apparent to the officer that the defendant was \"choking\" the victim. As a transitive verb, the first definition of \"choke\" in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 218 (11th ed. 2007), is to \"check or block normal breathing of by compressing or obstructing the trachea.\" Moreover, \"choking\" is defined as \"producing the feeling of strangulation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3878563\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/401/745/#p747\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3878563\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/401/745/#p747\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Given the plain meaning of these words, it was a reasonable inference for the jury to conclude that the defendant interfered with the victim's \"normal breathing.\" G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15D(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ).

To the extent the defendant claims that the victim's ability to \"yelp\" disproves strangulation, we note only that her ability to make sounds affects only the weight of the evidence and not its sufficiency because the crime is achieved by \"interference\" with breathing and complete strangulation is not required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   G.

The defendant also claims that his domestic assault and battery conviction is duplicative of his strangulation conviction and, thereby, violates the double jeopardy clause. In support, the defendant argues that the assault and battery must be treated as a lesser included offense of strangulation because both convictions stem from a single indivisible course of conduct. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant makes this claim for the first time on appeal. \"Where the defendant neither raised the issue of duplicative convictions before the trial court, nor filed a motion to revise or revoke the sentence under Mass.R.Crim.P. 29,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=378%20Mass.%20899\">\n    378 Mass. 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1979), we review his claim only to determine if a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice occurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670114\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/418/\">\n    454 Mass. 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430 n.13 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As an initial matter, we must determine whether domestic assault and battery and strangulation are cognate offenses.

Strangulation does not require that the defendant and victim are in a substantive dating or familial relationship. Compare G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13M, with G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15D. The defendant agrees that these are not \"authentic\" cognate offenses.
