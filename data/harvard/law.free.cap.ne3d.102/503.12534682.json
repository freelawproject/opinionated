The court found Stephen D. Lykins, defendant below and appellant herein, guilty of pandering obscenity involving a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.321(A)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant assigns the following errors for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IMPOSING A $1,000.00 FINE UPON MR. LYKINS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT ERRONEOUSLY ASSESSED COSTS FOR DISMISSED CHARGES.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \"MR. LYKINS WAS ASSESSED COSTS THAT WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY LAW.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   FOURTH ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"THE CLERK OF COURTS ISSUED IMPROPERLY, AND WITHOUT AUTHORITY, AN EXECUTION AGAINST MR. LYKINS'S PROPERTY FOR BOTH FINES AND THE COSTS OF PROSECUTION.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After an Adams County grand jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with three counts of pandering obscenity involving a minor. Subsequently, appellant agreed to plead guilty to one count of pandering obscenity involving a minor and the trial court sentenced appellant to serve six years in prison. The court also (1) classified appellant a tier II sex offender/child victim offender registrant; (2) ordered appellant \"to pay a $1,000.00 fine currently in [appellant]'s bank account\" and to \"pay all costs of the prosecution of this action for which execution is awarded, and any fees permitted pursuant to [R.C] 2929.18(A)(4).\" The court \"specifically [found] in the imposition of financial sanctions that [appellant] has the past,\n   present and future income ability and/or potential to satisfy all financial sanctions imposed.\" This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In his first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred by imposing a $1,000 fine. He asserts that the court considered only whether his bank account held sufficient funds to pay the fine. Appellant further argues that the trial court should not have considered his social security benefits when evaluating his ability to pay. Appellant claims that his social security benefits essentially are sacrosanct and cannot be considered when a sentencing court evaluates a criminal defendant's ability to pay a fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PLAIN ERROR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 4} We first observe that appellant did not object at sentencing to the trial court's imposition of a $1,000 fine. He further did not assert that he lacked the ability to pay the fine, that the court could not consider the funds in his bank account, or that the court could not consider his social security benefits when evaluating his ability to pay. His failure to raise these issue before the trial court means that he forfeited the right to raise them on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.

Although the statute does not contain any factors that a trial court must consider in evaluating an offender's ability to pay, reviewing courts generally have identified some of the following factors as relevant when considering an offender's ability to pay: (1) the offender's age; (2) the offender's employment history and potential; (3) the offender's education; (4) the offender's health; (5) the length of the offender's prison term; (6) the offender's source of income; (7) the offender's income potential; (8) whether the offender is indigent; and (9) the amount of the fine.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50 (considering offender's age, education, employment history and potential, health, and length of prison term);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Appellant, however, claims that the record indicates that the trial court looked solely to his bank account balance at the time of sentencing when deciding to impose the fine. We do not agree. The trial court considered the presentence investigation report and noted the following: (1) appellant had been gainfully employed in the past and worked for approximately 30 years as a self-employed construction worker; (2) he has been receiving disability payments for the past three years due to degenerative disk disease, asthma, and high blood pressure; (3) his disability payments are his sole source of income; and (4) appellant \"has no financial assets or obligations.\" The court further pointed out that appellant would be able to earn $17 to $19 per month while incarcerated. Thus, while the trial court did ask how much money appellant's bank account held, we do not agree that the court relied solely on this factor. Instead, the trial court considered the totality of appellant's circumstances. Moreover, appellant has not pointed to any controlling authority to indicate that a trial court cannot consider funds held in an offender's bank account. In fact, the amount of money in an offender's bank account would seem to be a relevant factor to consider when evaluating an offender's present ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Furthermore, we note that the amount of the fine in the case sub judice is not so high as to represent an insurmountable burden to appellant. Appellant will have the ability to earn $17 per month while incarcerated. Consequently, we do not believe that the record clearly and convincingly demonstrates that the trial court failed to consider appellant's ability to pay the $1,000 fine or that the imposition of the $1,000 fine is contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Appellant also argues that the trial court wrongly considered his social security disability benefits when evaluating\n   his ability to pay. Appellant did not raise this specific issue before the trial court, and we therefore decline to address it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Risner v. Ohio Dept. of Nat.

We additionally recognize that appellant did not point to any direct controlling authority that states a trial court cannot consider social security benefits when evaluating an offender's ability to pay under R.C. 2929.19(B)(5). Instead, the authority appellant cites generally states that social security payments are not subject to garnishment, attachment, etc. Consequently, any error that the court may have committed by considering appellant's social security benefits would not be an obvious error. Also, we again observe that the trial court considered appellant's earning potential while imprisoned (i.e., $17-$19 per month), and the amount of money he possessed. Thus, the court did not look solely to appellant's social security disability benefit when it evaluated his ability to pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We also point out that appellant's status as an indigent defendant who qualified for appointed counsel does not demonstrate that he lacks the present or future ability to pay. \"Being 'indigent' and being 'unable to pay' are not the same.

The court dismissed the remaining two counts. All three charges originated from separate complaints filed in municipal court. The listing of fees contained in the record indicates that appellant has been assessed the costs incurred in all three court cases. However, he entered a guilty plea to only one count, and the trial court sentenced him for only one count. Therefore, in accordance with the foregoing authority, it is improper to impose costs associated with the dismissed counts.

He contends that before the clerk could issue the writ, he is\n   entitled to an itemized bill and an adequate opportunity to pay. Appellant further argues that R.C. 2949.15 only permits a writ of execution to issue against nonindigent convicted felons.

First, we point out that the sheriff returned the execution against appellant's property for $.01. Appellant has not cited any authority that authorizes us to set aside the execution and order a return of $.01.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   40 Ohio Jur. 3d Enforcement of Judgments, Section 307 (footnotes omitted) (\"The writ of execution is of no further effect after the return is made or after the return day of the writ, and the officer's power over the process ends at that time.\"). Additionally, appellant did not request a stay of execution, and did not request the trial court to set aside, quash, or recall the execution.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   40 Ohio Jur. 3d Enforcement of Judgments, Section 306 (footnotes omitted) (\"Returns of execution may be set aside if made through a mistake.\"); 40 Ohio Jur. 3d Enforcement of Judgments, Section 340 (footnotes omitted) (\"Since every court has control and supervision over its own process, it has the power to quash, set aside, or recall an execution\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Furthermore, we disagree with the substance of appellant's argument. Two Ohio Supreme Court cases appear to directly refute his assertion that the clerk cannot issue an execution against an indigent defendant's property and attempt collection from an indigent defendant. In\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , the court held: \"a clerk of courts may attempt the collection of assessed court costs from an indigent defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. In\n   <em>\n    Threatt\n   </em>\n   , the court considered whether R.C. 2949.14 and R.C. 2947.23 permit \"court costs assessed as part of a sentence [to] be collected against a[n indigent] defendant convicted of a felony by levy or garnishment * * * [.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. The\n   <em>\n    Threatt\n   </em>\n   court determined that \"the state may use any collection method that is available for collection of a civil judgment for money, as well as the procedures set out in R.C. 5120.133 if the defendant is incarcerated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Consequently, we disagree with appellant that the clerk cannot execute against his property based upon his indigent status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Moreover, Ohio courts have not recognized that a criminal defendant is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before a clerk may issue an execution against property under R.C. 2949.15. In\n   <em>\n    Threatt\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that R.C. 2947.23(B)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   sets forth a hearing process, but the court did not rule that a court must afford a defendant a hearing before collection efforts begin. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   R.C. 2947.23(B) defines a hearing process to be used after a defendant has failed to pay a judgment for costs. It permits, but does not require, a court to order the defendant to perform community service for credit against the judgment. The statute goes on to provide: \"Except for the credit and reduction provided in this division, ordering an offender to perform community service under this division does not lessen the amount of the judgment and does not preclude the state from taking any other action to execute the judgment.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Id. at \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 33} We further note that R.C. 2949.15 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   If a nonindigent person convicted of a felony fails to pay the costs of prosecution pursuant to section 2949.14 of the Revised Code, the clerk of the court of common pleas shall forthwith issue to the sheriff of the county in which the indictment was found, and to the sheriff of any other county in which the person has property, executions against his property for fines and the costs of prosecution, which shall be served and returned within ten days, with the proceedings of such sheriff or the certification that there is no property upon which to levy, indorsed thereon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   When a levy is made upon property under such execution, a writ shall forthwith be issued by the clerk for the sale thereof, and such sheriff shall sell the property and make return thereof, and after paying the costs of conviction, execution, and sale, pay the balance to the person authorized to receive it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Courts have held that \" R.C. 2949.15 does not require a hearing prior to the seizure of a defendant's property for purposes of collecting court-ordered costs of prosecution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, even if we believed that the miscalculation of court costs (see our discussion of appellant's second assignment of error) requires setting aside or modification of the writ, we point out that the amount of the return was $.01.
