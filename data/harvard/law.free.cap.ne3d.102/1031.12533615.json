The judge found that the mother repeatedly subjected the children to serious neglect and domestic abuse. See G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(ii), (ix). The mother repeatedly exposed her children to trauma and was resistant to utilizing assistance. The children are especially sensitive to noise and fighting as a result of their earlier experiences of trauma. The two older children deeply distrust the mother (and the father) after years of continuous emotional abuse and neglect. All of the children have developed special needs\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and they fear returning to the mother's care. See G.

Despite years of services, the mother continues to have experiences of \"overexcitement\" and does not recognize when her voice is raised. Despite her mental health hospitalizations in high school and \"sensitiv[ity] to spirits,\" the mother does not believe that she has psychological needs and is resistant to receiving services. While the mother (and the father) showed some improvement in their parenting abilities after the children's removal, the children's behavior and development deteriorated with increased visitation time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The mother may be dissatisfied with the judge's weighing of the evidence and her credibility determinations; however, \"[w]e see no basis for disturbing the judge's view of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Quentin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"117657\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/424/882/\">\n    424 Mass. 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 886 n.3 (1997).

The mother contends that one particular subsidiary finding-that the absence of developmental disability services did not compromise her ability to parent-is clearly erroneous. Specifically, the mother claims that the judge ignored the clinical requirements that made her eligible for services and instead selectively relied on the mother's employment history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The mother has not demonstrated that the judge's finding was clearly erroneous. A subsidiary finding is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it, or when, \"although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Custody of Eleanor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3903850\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/795/#p799\">\n    414 Mass. 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (1993), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Building Inspector of Lancaster\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sanderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030383\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/372/157/#p160\">\n    372 Mass. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In making the challenged finding, the judge considered the conflicting evidence, including the testimony of the mother's expert, Thomas F.

Her delay in utilizing recommended services undermines the mother's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DCF surely paid insufficient attention to the mother's cognitive limitations. Although the lead social worker helped the mother apply for DDS services, the social worker did not know what services DDS might have offered and failed to follow up on the issue. However, other than criticize DCF's parenting plan for providing inadequate services and suggesting \"specific programs to deal with people with developmental delays,\" the mother did not show what additional services she could have obtained from DDS or how they might have improved her parenting abilities more than the tailored services that DCF did offer. Moreover, even \"[a] determination by the court that reasonable efforts were not made shall not preclude the court from making any appropriate order conducive to the child's best interest.\" G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 29C, as appearing in St. 2008, c. 176, \u00a7 87. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Ilona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

The mother contends that the evidence does not support the judge's application of G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(ix), and that the judge must have improperly relied on the children's out-of-court statements, which were admitted only for the children's state of mind, to find evidence of ongoing abuse and neglect. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The turmoil in the parents' relationship is documented through the observations of social workers, a police officer, and the mother's own testimony. DCF removed the children from the parents' home for allegations of abuse and neglect three times, on August 13, 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   November 16, 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in October, 2012. Multiple G. L. c. 119, \u00a7 51A, reports document the repeated abuse and neglect of the children. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Rhona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250672\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/479/#p484\">\n    57 Mass. App. Ct. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484 (2003). The mother (and the father) consistently failed to meet the children's basic health and hygiene needs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge acknowledged but did not credit the parents' denials of domestic violence. See\n   <em>\n    Care &amp; Protection of Three Minors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3875462\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/392/704/#p711\">\n    392 Mass. 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 711 (1984) (credibility determinations are within judge's discretion). The evidence was sufficient for the judge to apply G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(ix), based on repeated instances of neglect and the children's exposure to domestic violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The mother further contends that the judge erred in applying G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3(\n   <em>\n    c\n   </em>\n   )(vii), based solely on her finding that the children had bonded with their respective caregivers. In this regard, the judge relied upon the children's \"strong bonds with their foster parents that the [c]hildren wish to become permanent\" as one of the reasons for terminating the mother's parental rights. \"Although the bonding of a child with foster or adoptive parents is not a dispositive consideration, it is a factor that has weight in the ultimate balance.\"\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Nicole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1035573\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/40/259/#p262\">\n    40 Mass.

App. Ct. at 30-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, this is not a case where the judge's determination is solely based on the children's bonding with the foster parents. Rather, it was one of many factors supporting her ultimate conclusion. Compare\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Rhona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250672\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/57/479/#p484\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The judge relies on the bond between Rhona and her foster parents as a significant basis for his determination\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judge properly considered the children's development while living with the parents and contrasted it with the children's development after removal. See\n   <em>\n    Adoption of Kimberly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902994\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/414/526/#p530\">\n    414 Mass. 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530-531 (1993). While the mother (and the father) \"have not been able to foster a basic feeling of trust and security in the [c]hildren that is necessary for their development,\" each child's welfare greatly improved in the care of their foster families.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The judge found that security is essential for each of the children's welfare and development. The judge credited the testimony of the forensic evaluator that Peter could \"not cope with possibility of losing his secure attachment to his foster parents.\" If Dalila and Anne were to be returned to the parents' care, the transition would have to be gradual, \"possibly involving ... an intermediate, 'neutral,' placement.\" The guardian ad litem testified that, if returned to the parents' care, Dalila and Anne would need \"very intensive services\" for \"an unspecified period of time.\" Given the children's elevated needs, the judge did not err in considering the psychological impact to the children of removal from their foster placements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n   . In considering the pattern of abuse and neglect as well as the progress the children have made since leaving the home, the judge did not abuse her discretion in finding the mother unfit and that the best interests of the children would be served by terminating the mother's parental rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The father's appeal\n   </em>\n   . The father contends that he should not have been found unfit because the evidence does not clearly and convincingly establish that his parenting put the children's welfare, particularly Dalila's, at hazard. The father also argues that his plan to hire a nanny was reasonable, and the judge erred in rejecting it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although the father demonstrated improvement in his parenting abilities, after careful evaluation of the record and the judge's conclusions, we are satisfied that the judge did not err in finding the father unfit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Most of the factors supporting the finding of the mother's unfitness-including the inability to maintain a clean, safe home, the lack of care for the children's basic health and hygiene, and domestic violence-equally reflect on the father's shortcomings as a parent. All of the children, including Dalila, have heightened needs that the father (and the mother) are unable to meet. The father allowed the children to suffer abuse and neglect for years, and he makes no claim of cognitive limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The judge was entitled to give little weight to the father's proposal to hire a nanny. The father has a strenuous work schedule. In the past, he had not been able to comply with the condition that the children not be left alone with the mother, and the judge could properly rely on this conduct to assess the father's current fitness. DCF had previously approved the hiring of a nanny as a way for the father to work around the mother's parental unfitness, but the mother's resistance thwarted the attempt. Returning the children to the father would effectively amount to returning them to the mother's care. The judge could reasonably conclude that the employment of the nanny was not a viable option and that the father had no realistic plan to care for any of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The father also contends that DCF's mismanagement of the case should be a mitigating factor negating a determination of unfitness. While the delivery of services in this case was not perfect, even if the judge had considered DCF's handling of the case as a mitigating factor, which she was not required to do, it would not undermine the ultimate conclusion that the father was and would remain unfit and that terminating his parental rights was in the best interests of the children.
