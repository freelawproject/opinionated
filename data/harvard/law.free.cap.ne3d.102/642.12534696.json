In the complaint, appellant alleged she had been employed by appellee as an emergency room secretary at The Ohio State University Hospital East (\"OSU East\"), and that appellee had wrongfully terminated her for allegedly engaging in inappropriate, threatening, and retaliatory behavior toward staff members of the hospital. The complaint alleged causes of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On December 29, 2016, appellee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). On January 9, 2017, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee's motion to dismiss. By entry filed April 17, 2017, the Court of Claims granted appellee's motion to dismiss as to appellant's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, but denied appellee's motion to dismiss appellant's claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On April 20, 2017, appellee filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing appellant could not pursue a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public\n   policy because she was not an at-will employee. On May 17, 2017, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellee's motion for summary judgment, asserting there were genuine issues of material fact as to her employment status. By decision filed June 7, 2017, the Court of Claims granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, finding appellant was not an employee-at-will and, therefore, could not state a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On appeal, appellant sets forth the following assignment of error for this court's review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court erred in granting Appellee's Motion to Dismiss Appellant's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} At the outset, we note appellant does not challenge on appeal the Court of Claims' grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee as to her claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.

In August or September 2014, Dr. Thomas Terndrup was working a shift at OSU East while appellant was working as the emergency room secretary. During his shift, Dr. Terndrup \"repeatedly threw paperwork on [appellant's] work area rather than hand it to her.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 7.) After several such incidents, appellant \"asked Dr. Terndrup to stop throwing paperwork at her, stating it was rude.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 8.) In response, Dr. Terndrup \"became very angry at [appellant] and stormed into the office of the OSU East Nurse Manager, Ken Groves, to whom he angrily complained about [appellant].\" (Compl. at \u00b6 9.) Dr. Terndrup \"also complained to another doctor, Dr. Michael Dick,\" the head of the \"OSU East doctor's group.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 10.) According to appellant, \"[f]rom that time on, [appellee] was waiting for an opportunity to terminate [appellant] in retaliation for standing up to Dr. Terndrup.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} It was further alleged on September 26, 2014, appellant and \"ER Social Worker Sylvia Clarkson were having a typical, casual conversation about current events in the news.\" On that date, appellant and Clarkson \"had discussed an incident of workplace violence that had been in the news.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 12.) Clarkson \"reported [appellant] for that conversation to Nurse Manager Ken Groves,\" despite the fact that Clarkson \"stated that she did not feel threatened by [appellant].\" (Compl. at \u00b6 13.) Groves reported appellant's conversation with Clarkson \"to Human Resources Administrative Director Thomas Ramey and OSU Wexner Medical Center Security, Lt. Wertz.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} According to the complaint, Groves and Ramey \"seized upon what Ms. Clarkson had reported as an opportunity to terminate [appellant], despite [appellant's] satisfactory job performance record at that time.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 15.) OSU security officers interviewed appellant, \"who stated that she had just been talking about the news with Ms. Clarkson, and that she preferred not to state anything further.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 16.) Appellant \"was permitted to complete her shift that day and to work the next.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 17.) On October 6, 2014, appellant was placed on administrative leave. On October 31, 2014, appellant \"was charged with engaging in inappropriate, threatening and retaliatory behavior toward staff members.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellant's complaint alleged appellee \"had no legitimate basis to charge [appellant] with such conduct, or to terminate her on that basis.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 20.) Further, that \"claimed safety concerns about [appellant] were a pretext for its intent to terminate her for her prior interaction with Dr. Terndrup.\" (Compl. at \u00b6 21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In its entry of dismissal as to the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Court of Claims held in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Making all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff, Dr. Terndrup's actions of throwing paperwork at her; his complaining about plaintiff's behavior to her supervisor; a coworker's complaints about plaintiff's conversation about workplace violence; and, termination of plaintiff's employment, does not rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct necessary to state a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, it appears beyond doubt that the assertions in plaintiff's complaint do not support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Appellant contends the trial court's decision omits reference to several significant allegations she made in support of her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, including allegations that: (1) after appellant asked Dr. Terndrup to stop throwing paperwork at her, he complained to appellant's supervisor and, from that time on, appellee was waiting for an opportunity to terminate her in retaliation for standing up to Dr. Terndrup, (2) appellant's co-worker did not feel threatened by a conversation with appellant regarding workplace violence, and (3) appellee brought baseless and pre-textual charges against appellant and used those as the basis for her termination. According to appellant, had the Court of Claims taken these allegations as true, it could not have found that the conduct alleged was insufficiently extreme and outrageous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In order to establish a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must prove \"(1) that the defendant intended to cause the plaintiff serious emotional distress, (2) that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous,\n   and (3) that the defendant's conduct was the proximate cause of plaintiff's serious emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Phung v.

Lebanon City Schools\n   </em>\n   , * * * the court concluded that the following conduct failed to rise to the level of extreme and outrageous conduct: (1) the employer screamed and yelled at the employee; (2) the employer falsely accused the employee of causing problems in the treasurer's office and of stealing money; (3) the employer \"repeatedly\" berated the employee in front of other people; (4) the employer called the employee \"moronic and uneducated\"; and (5) the employer berated the employee for being a woman.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 22} In the instant case, taking as true all the allegations in the complaint, including facts pertaining to the investigation and eventual termination of appellant's employment, the conduct alleged is simply not \"so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"\n   <em>\n    Mendlovic\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47. Based on this court's de novo review, we agree with the Court of Claims that the conduct alleged in the complaint does not, as a matter of law, rise to the level of extreme and outrageous necessary for a prima facie case of intentional infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, the Court of Claims did not err in granting appellee's motion to dismiss appellant's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Based on the foregoing, appellant's single assignment of error is overruled, and the judgment of the Court of Claims of Ohio is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   TYACK, P.J., and LUPER SCHUSTER, J., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
