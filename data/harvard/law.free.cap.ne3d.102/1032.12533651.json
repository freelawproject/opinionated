Kansky, from excessively feeding birds at her residential property. The two-count complaint alleged that Kansky's bird feeding violated provisions of the State sanitary code and town by-law, and created and maintained a public nuisance. After a two-day bench trial the judge entered a permanent injunction, enjoining Kansky and family members from feeding wild birds or fowl from her premises using any bird feeder or similar device or by hand. Kansky appeals from the judgment. The only question now before us is whether the trial judge properly denied Kansky's jury trial demand. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Article 15 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights provides a right to a jury trial \"[i]n all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons.\" The present matter-an action in equity by a municipality to enjoin a public nuisance-does not involve a suit between two or more persons within the meaning of art. 15. Compare\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mongardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157049\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/26/5/#p8\">\n    26 Mass. App. Ct. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8 (1988) (motor vehicle infraction). Likewise, and despite Kansky's assertion that the order entered infringes on her right to \"feed[ ] and enjoy[ ] wildlife,\" this matter does not involve a controversy concerning \"property\" within the meaning of art. 15.

On the contrary, as the foregoing authorities demonstrate, it has long been understood that \"an injunction against the future maintenance of a public nuisance may properly be entered without the involvement of a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United Food Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871894\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/374/765/#p778\">\n    374 Mass. 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 778 (1978). Compare\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"32171\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/180/334/#p355\">\n    180 Mass. 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (1902) (master ordered defendant in estate proceedings to pay money damages; despite contested factual questions matter was \"[b]oth as to subject matter and the remedy sought ... well within chancery jurisdiction\" and defendant had no absolute right to a jury trial). The present matter, as noted, is in essence an action by a municipality to prospectively enjoin a public nuisance. As such, and notwithstanding that contested issues existed below as to whether Kansky's acts in fact created a public nuisance, this matter is a proceeding well within equity jurisdiction as it existed when the Commonwealth adopted its Constitution and that, therefore, may be resolved \"without the involvement of a jury.\"\n   <em>\n    United Food Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871894\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/374/765/#p778\">\n    374 Mass. at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The authorities cited by Kansky are not to the contrary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike in the matters cited, the town here made no demand for money damages or such other relief as might have been available at common law, and no such remedy entered. Nor can we conclude on the record provided that the judge's considered decision to reject Kansky's jury trial demand was so idiosyncratic, arbitrary, or capricious as to constitute an abuse of discretion. See G. L. c. 185C, \u00a7 21, inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 92 (\"All cases in the housing court department ...\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be heard and determined by a justice ... sitting without jury, except that in all cases where a jury trial is\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   by the constitution of the commonwealth or of the United States and the defendant has not waived his rights to a trial by jury, the cause shall be forthwith tried ... before a jury\" [emphases supplied] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   To the extent made, we need not consider Kansky's \"takings\" argument; the record before us fails to demonstrate she raised it below.
