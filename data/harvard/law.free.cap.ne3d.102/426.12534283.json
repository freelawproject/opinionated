On appeal, the defendant contends that (1) the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress, and (2) there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress.\n   </em>\n   The defendant argues that the judge erroneously denied his motion to suppress because the alleged misdemeanor was not committed in the presence of the arresting police officer. We affirm the judge's denial of the defendant's motion to suppress, albeit on grounds different from those articulated by the motion judge. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cotto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320170\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/97/#p118\">\n    471 Mass. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118 (2015), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Va Meng Joe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"274531\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/425/99/#p102\">\n    425 Mass. 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (1997) (\"An appellate court is free to affirm a ruling on grounds different from those relied on by the motion judge if the correct or preferred basis for affirmance is supported by the record and the findings\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \"[W]e accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error but conduct an independent review of [the judge's] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Meas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317827\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/467/434/#p440\">\n    467 Mass. 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (2014) (quotation omitted). The defendant relies on the common-law rule concerning warrantless arrests for misdemeanors, which generally requires that the misdemeanor constituting a breach of the peace be committed in the presence or view of the officer, who must interrupt the conduct to effectuate the arrest. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/#p629\">\n    471 Mass. 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629-630 (2015). Here, the officer did not see the defendant drive or hit the pole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The judge relied on hot pursuit in denying the motion. We need not reach that issue, because the arresting officer was authorized to arrest the defendant by statute. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 21. \"An officer 'authorized to make arrests' who is in uniform or conspicuously displaying his badge of office may arrest without a warrant any person who, the officer has probable cause to believe, has operated or is operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Howe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882927\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/332/#p334\">\n    405 Mass. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (1989), quoting from G.

The responding police officers knew from a witness's report that a white Toyota Highlander\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   had crashed into a pole. When Officer Victoria arrived on the scene he saw a white vehicle's bumper next to the pole. The witness then reported that the vehicle's license plate number was \"1RNB30\" and that the driver was an older man with white hair. After identifying a discrepancy in the plate number,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   one of the officers located a nearby address for a white Toyota Highlander. They went to the address and saw a white Toyota Highlander with a missing bumper in the driveway. Officer Victoria touched the hood of the vehicle, and it was still warm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The officers spoke to the defendant, who admitted to crashing into the pole. The defendant claimed he drank two beers after arriving home some time earlier.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the defendant's wife said that her husband had just arrived home. The defendant was aggressive, had an odor of alcohol, was unsteady on his feet, and his speech was slurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"An arrest is supported by probable cause, and therefore lawful, 'where, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the police are enough to warrant a prudent person in believing that the individual arrested had committed ... an offense' for which arrest is authorized.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cartright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20273\">\n    478 Mass. 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 283 (2017), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/#p629\">\n    471 Mass. at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence here was more than sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant was driving his car while under the influence of alcohol.

Upon review, we look at the facts adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found that all elements of the crime had been proved.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Latimore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"337417\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/378/671/#p676\">\n    378 Mass. 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 676-677 (1979).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Operating under the influence of alcohol.\n   </em>\n   The defendant contends that the Commonwealth did not produce sufficient evidence that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. The defendant admitted to drinking two beers when he arrived home. Yet, after his arrest and booking, he had a blood alcohol content of .17, more than twice the legal limit. When Officer Sheehy spoke with the defendant at his home, the officer observed that the defendant was unsteady, had bloodshot glossy eyes, had an odor of alcohol, appeared confused, and was loud, mumbling, and uncooperative. The Commonwealth sustained its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant operated a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.

As discussed above, there was evidence from which a jury could conclude that he was intoxicated at the time of the accident. The jury could take into account the evidence of intoxication in considering the negligent operation charge.

The jury were permitted to infer that the defendant struck the pole, damaged it, and left the scene.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899729\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/81/773/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant argues that the Commonwealth could not rule out the possibility that the damage to the pole may have occurred long before the defendant hit it.
