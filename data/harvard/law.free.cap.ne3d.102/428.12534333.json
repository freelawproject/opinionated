A jury later found Hernandez and Henriquez each guilty of sex trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, owning or managing a place for unlawful sexual intercourse therein, and keeping a house of ill fame in connection with their roles as principals in the sex trafficking scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   In this appeal, Hernandez and Henriquez allege error in the trial judge's denial of their motion for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing, see\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delaware\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769234\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/154/\">\n    438 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), and renewed motion to suppress, and claim that the judge improperly limited the scope of their cross-examination of sex worker witnesses. They also argue that the sex trafficking statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, is unconstitutionally vague, though for different reasons. Hernandez argues separately that the judge committed a number of errors at trial. Henriquez argues that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence based on the insufficiency of the Commonwealth's warrant affidavit. He also claims error in the denial of his motion to dismiss an indictment based on insufficient evidence before the grand jury. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . 1.\n   <em>\n    Constitutionality of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50\n   </em>\n   . a.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez's claim\n   </em>\n   . Hernandez argues that the sex trafficking statute, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, is unconstitutionally vague because it criminalizes the same conduct already proscribed by existing statutes. Specifically, she claims that one who acts as a joint venturer in committing the crimes of managing a place for unlawful sexual intercourse, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 6, or keeping a house of ill fame, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 24, has no notice of whether he or she will be prosecuted under those statutes or under the more punitive sex trafficking statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \"A statute violates due process and is void for vagueness when individuals of normal intelligence must guess at the statute's meaning and may differ as to its application, thus denying them fair notice of the proscribed conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Disler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3788806\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/216/#p223\">\n    451 Mass. 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223 (2008). \"Proscribed conduct, however, is not always capable of precise legal definition.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274990\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/464/245/#p249\">\n    464 Mass. 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (2013).

Both \u00a7 6 and \u00a7 24 of G. L. c. 272 punish those who knowingly own or maintain a place wherein persons engage in unlawful sexual intercourse for money. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mullane\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2823230\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/445/702/#p714\">\n    445 Mass. 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 714-716 (2006). In contrast, under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, one who knowingly enables or causes another to engage in commercial sexual activity need not own or manage the place where such conduct occurs in order to be convicted of sex trafficking. Thus, although Hernandez argues that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 50, criminalizes essentially the same conduct as other existing statutes, it plainly does not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Henriquez's claim\n   </em>\n   . Henriquez's argument that the sex trafficking statute is unconstitutionally vague because it lacks the element of force or coercion similarly lacks merit, the Supreme Judicial Court already having considered this precise issue in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGhee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361920\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/405/\">\n    472 Mass. 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In that case, the court held that \"because G.

The words of the statute have commonly accepted and readily understood meanings in the English language, and the phrase 'commercial sexual activity' is amply defined in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 49. The statutory language provided fair notice to the defendants that the very conduct in which they engaged was the kind of conduct that the Legislature intended to prohibit and punish.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361920\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/405/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361920\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/405/\">\n    . at 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In addition, at least in the case of reckless falsehood, the false statement must be necessary to the existence of probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nine Hundred &amp; Ninety-two Dollars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813547\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/383/764/#p767\">\n    383 Mass. 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767-768 (1981). The defendants made no such showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We agree with the judge, who found \"nothing to suggest that there was an intentional or reckless misstatement by the [S]tate troopers.\" The defendants failed to demonstrate how what we see as minor inconsistencies between the search warrant affidavit and the testimony at trial, resulted from intentional or reckless police behavior. Furthermore, none of the alleged inconsistencies in the search warrant affidavit is necessary to the determination of probable cause. As such, there was no error in the denial of the defendants' request or motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Limitation on cross-examination\n   </em>\n   . While a criminal defendant is entitled to a reasonable cross-examination of witnesses against him, that right of confrontation is not absolute.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795392\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/399/385/#p393\">\n    399 Mass. 385\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393 (1987). Generally, a trial judge \"has broad discretion to limit cross-examination of a witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mercado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668381\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/198/#p203\">\n    456 Mass. 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 203 (2010) (quotation omitted). To determine whether the judge abused this broad discretion, \"we weigh the materiality of the witness's direct testimony and the degree of the restriction on cross-examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Miles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"826207\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/420/67/#p72\">\n    420 Mass. 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 (1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Here, there is no question that the direct testimony of the sex worker witnesses was vital to the Commonwealth's case. Regarding their sex worker history, the judge ruled that their testimony admitting they made the initial contact in order to earn money as sex workers sufficiently covered the topic. She also determined that cross-examination about this history would \"devalue them and their integrity to the point of perhaps tempting the jury to not treat this evidence with the proper seriousness.\" This was well within the judge's discretion to limit cross-examination \"based on concerns about ... harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness's safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"286768\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/431/535/#p540\">\n    431 Mass. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 540 (2000) (quotation omitted). Furthermore, because use of force or coercion is not an element of the sex trafficking statute, the defendants' aim to show the witnesses' voluntary involvement in the sex trafficking scheme is irrelevant. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McGhee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361920\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/472/405/\">\n    472 Mass. at 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The trial judge also instructed the jury, both at the time of the statement's admission and twice during her final charge, that they could consider the statement solely as evidence against Henriquez, and not against any other defendant. Nevertheless, Hernandez argues portions of the redacted statement implied the involvement of another individual, whom the jury necessarily inferred was Hernandez. These portions include Henriquez's statement that \"we pay the gas, we pay the toll, we pay everything,\" and that his \"wife\" purchased the vehicle that police followed and from which they eventually seized evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There was no\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   violation.

His statement that \"we\" pay for certain things came immediately after his claim that \"it's a lot of people [running the business],\" and could have been taken as referring to someone other than Hernandez. Similarly, Henriquez's references to \"my wife\" only implicated Hernandez when considered together with the marriage certificate entered in evidence, and only concerned an ancillary fact: that she purchased the vehicle driven by Henriquez. In addition, the judge gave forceful limiting instructions to the jury three times. Henriquez's redacted statement incriminates Hernandez only to the extent that the jury accepted the other evidence against her detailing her role within the sex trafficking operation. The admission of such a statement, which only implicates Hernandez circumstantially when combined with other evidence in the case, does not offend\n   <em>\n    Bruton\n   </em>\n   . Consequently, the judge did not abuse her discretion by admitting the redacted statement and denying Hernandez's motion to sever the trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective assistance\n   </em>\n   .

The trooper responded that he attempted to interview her, but \"she didn't want to talk.\" Defense counsel later explained at sidebar that his intent was to demonstrate that the trooper's interactions with Hernandez were brief, in order to impeach his opinion that he heard Hernandez's voice on the wiretap recordings, and that he did not intend to elicit the trooper's answer. After some discussion, defense counsel asked the judge to give the curative instruction at the end of trial, so as not to draw attention to the trooper's statement. The next day, again during cross-examination, Special Agent Arnold testified that he briefly conversed with Hernandez during \"an attempted interview.\" The judge immediately instructed the jury to disregard that statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   We see no failure of counsel rising to the level of ineffective assistance.

The judge also gave strong curative instructions, one immediately after one statement, and again during her jury charge. Most importantly, at no time during the trial did the prosecutor suggest that the jury should infer Hernandez's guilt because she declined to speak with the police.

The trooper reported to the judge that a juror jokingly asked him to say that he knew her to cause the judge to excuse her from the jury. Then realizing she was a juror in the instant case, he responded, \"[T]rials can be interesting.\" The judge conducted a voir dire of the juror (no. 181), as well as three other jurors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge asked the juror if she could continue to be fair and impartial and the juror responded affirmatively, emphasizing that the interaction with the trooper had nothing to do with the case. While the juror and trooper should not have conversed, the judge acted within her discretion when she concluded that the interaction was not prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Hernandez argues that the judge erred by not questioning every juror in an individual voir dire as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332005\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/790/#p800\">\n    376 Mass. 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 800-801 (1978). However, the court in that case held that a voir dire of the entire jury is required \"when a claim of potentially extraneous influence on a\n   <em>\n    jury\n   </em>\n   is brought to the judge's attention\" (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332005\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/790/#p800\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332005\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/790/#p800\">\n    . at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the judge determines, through questioning the jury collectively, that a juror has seen or heard extraneous material outside the record, \"there must be individual questioning of that juror ... to determine the extent of the juror's exposure to the material and its effects on the juror's ability to render an impartial verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332005\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/790/#p800\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"332005\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/376/790/#p800\">\n    . at 800-801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, questioning the entire jury was unnecessary because Trooper Cashman identified the juror he spoke with, who in turn identified the only other jurors present. The judge then questioned these jurors individually, as required, made findings, and determined that each juror remained impartial. No further action was required, and the judge did not err in denying the motions for mistrial and to strike the trooper's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Jury instruction on identification\n   </em>\n   . Hernandez's claim that the judge was required to instruct the jury on voice identification is without merit.

However, in\n   <em>\n    Gomes\n   </em>\n   , decided more than a year after this trial, the court clearly stated that its holding was not retroactive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145229\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/352/#p376\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145229\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/352/#p376\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Furthermore, aside from the \"earwitness\" identification, the Commonwealth linked Hernandez's voice to the recordings through other evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, despite arguing the issue in his closing argument, defense counsel never requested an identification instruction. There was no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    English-reading jurors\n   </em>\n   . It was not error for the judge to inquire whether prospective jurors could read English, and to dismiss a juror who had trouble understanding English. \"A trial judge is allowed a broad range of discretion in the jury selection process.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnoski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480421\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/523/#p530\">\n    418 Mass. 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 530 (1994). While the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of a criminal defendant to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community, \"the States retain 'broad discretion' and 'remain free to prescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Acen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"898142\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/396/472/#p479\">\n    396 Mass. 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (1986), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Louisiana\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176665\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/419/522/#p538\">\n    419 U.S. 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538 (1975). One ground for disqualification of prospective jurors is the inability to \"speak and understand the English language.\" G. L. c. 234A, \u00a7 4.

Henriquez argues separately that the judge erroneously denied the defendants' motion to suppress in which they contended the affidavit filed in support of the wiretap warrant was insufficient. A wiretap warrant may issue only upon probable cause to believe that a designated offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed and that interception of communications would lead to evidence of that offense.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Thorpe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"934198\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/384/271/\">\n    384 Mass. 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 n.3 (1981). This probable cause determination requires that (1) a wiretap be conducted only in the investigation of organized crime, as reflected in the designated offenses of the statute, G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99(A), as appearing in St. 1968, c. 738, \u00a7 1; and (2) the wiretap is necessary because \"normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear unlikely to succeed if tried,\" G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 99(E)(3). To establish necessity, \"[t]he Commonwealth need not show that traditional investigative techniques were wholly unsuccessful or that the police had exhausted all other investigative procedures before filing its application for a warrant authorizing a wiretap.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fenderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895909\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/410/82/#p83\">\n    410 Mass. 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 83 (1991), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882991\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/405/248/#p250\">\n    405 Mass. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (1989).

To dismantle entirely the sex trafficking operation, investigators required evidence against its principals, which proved unobtainable through traditional methods.

Finally, Henriquez also argues that it was error to deny his motion to dismiss the indictment against him for sex trafficking because the evidence presented to the grand jury was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause. When reviewing a motion to dismiss an indictment based on insufficient evidence, the sole issue that we confront is whether the grand jury heard \"sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused ... and probable cause to arrest him.\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McCarthy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"900724\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/385/160/#p163\">\n    385 Mass. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 163 (1982).

A witness also testified she immediately turned over to Henriquez the money she received, with some of it later returned to her. Taken together, the grand jury heard sufficient evidence to conclude that probable cause existed to arrest Henriquez for engaging in sex trafficking as defined by the statute. Thus, the indictment properly issued, and there was no error in the denial of both the motion to dismiss and the motion for a directed verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Judgments affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Hernandez's further attempt to create vagueness within the sex trafficking statute by attaching conspiracy to the crime of deriving support from prostitution, G.
