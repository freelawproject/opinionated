The defendant argues on appeal, among other things, that the judge erred in denying his motion because there was an insufficient factual basis set forth in his guilty plea for the crime of simple possession of marijuana. We agree and, thus, reverse the order denying the defendant's motion to withdraw his guilty plea and for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The defendant was charged with the following: (1) possession of a controlled substance near a school zone, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32J ; (2) possession of a class D substance with the intent to distribute, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32C ; (3) disturbing a school or other assembly, in violation of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 40 ; and (4) carrying a dangerous weapon, in violation of G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(\n   <em>\n    b\n   </em>\n   ). At the plea hearing, the prosecutor and the defendant entered a plea bargain where the parties agreed to the \"dismiss[al] [of] the school zone [charge]\" and a reduction of the charge of \"possession [of a class D substance] with intent [to distribute] ... to [a charge of simple] possession [of a] [c]lass D substance,\" in violation of G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 34. The parties also agreed to enter a continuance without a finding for two years for the charges of disturbing a school or other assembly, carrying a dangerous weapon, and unlawful possession of a class D substance. At his plea hearing, the defendant admitted to the following facts, as recited by the prosecutor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   \"January 6, 2011 at approximately 11:10 A.M. the officers were posted in the second floor main hallway [of Dorchester Academy] when [the defendant] approached the Sergeant and stated he just got shoved into a brick wall, head first, while inside stairwell number 6 by a fellow student, [name omitted]. [The defendant] was immediately referred to the nurse for cuts and scrapes to his left temple area.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"[The] [r]eporting officer then made contact with [the fellow student] who stated that he was walking up the stairwell after lunch with [the defendant] ...
