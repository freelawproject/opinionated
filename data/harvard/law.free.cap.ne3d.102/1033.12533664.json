She then brought this negligence action to recover damages for her injuries. A judge granted summary judgment for Stop &amp; Shop, concluding that (1) under the traditional theory of premises liability, Katin could not prove that Stop &amp; Shop had notice of the condition that caused her fall, and (2) the \"mode of operation\" theory of premises liability was not applicable to her claim. Katin appeals, challenging both rulings. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . The basic facts are not in dispute. On March 25, 2010, Katin entered a Stop &amp; Shop store and went directly to the area where the bread was sold. There, she slipped on a sign that was lying on the floor face down. Katin had been in the store for less than two minutes when she fell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The only other person in the area was a male customer, who picked up the sign and showed it to Katin. The side of the sign that had been facing up was completely white and blended in with the color of the floor. The other side had red and blue lettering that resembled the \"Wonderbread\" logo. Katin observed that the sign was \"very clean\" with no dirt, footprints, or tire tracks. Nothing about its appearance suggested that it had been on the floor for an unreasonable amount of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Katin does not know how the sign ended up on the floor or how long it was there. Nearby, however, there was an empty display frame, which was freestanding, approximately thirty-six inches tall, and made of steel. According to one of the store managers, Louis D'Amato, the construct of the frame would have made it impossible for the sign to fall out on its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Accompanied by the male customer, Katin took the sign to the customer service desk and reported the accident. She told a manager she was \"fine\" and did not contact the store in the weeks that followed, even though the manager provided her with contact information and invited her to call. Nearly three years later, in February of 2013, Katin filed this lawsuit. At some point in that intervening three-year period, Stop &amp; Shop lost or discarded the sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . \"We review a decision on a motion for summary judgment de novo.\"\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    P.

The only evidence on this point, however, is Katin's own deposition testimony that the sign was \"very clean\" with no shoe prints or other marks, which suggests that it was not on the floor for very long. Indeed, Katin conceded below that there was nothing about the sign's physical appearance to indicate that Stop &amp; Shop allowed the condition to persist for an unreasonable amount of time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Nevertheless, Katin contends that her claim should have gone to the jury because Stop &amp; Shop has a safety and cleanliness policy that requires employees to pick up items that they see on the floor. Based on this policy, she argues, the jury could infer that employees acted carelessly by not \"immediately retriev[ing]\" the sign. But under the traditional approach to premises liability, store owners are afforded \"a reasonable opportunity to discover and correct any hazards before liability attaches.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheehan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856033\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/780/#p782\">\n    448 Mass. at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Stop &amp; Shop cannot therefore be held liable for its employees' failure to \"immediately\" pick up the sign; rather, Katin must prove that Stop &amp; Shop had notice that was \"sufficient to allow time ... to remedy the condition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856033\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/780/#p782\">\n     Ibid\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856033\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/780/#p782\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Katin further contends that, because Stop &amp; Shop spoliated the sign, she is entitled to an adverse inference instruction of some kind (she does not specify), which would allow a jury to \"conclude that the sign remained on the floor for an unreasonable length of time.\" The problem with this argument is that at no point did Katin demonstrate to the judge that the elements of spoliation were met. In opposing summary judgment, she asserted only summarily that she was entitled to sanctions because Stop &amp; Shop failed to preserve the sign. Sanctions for spoliation do not extend, however, to \"a fault-free destruction or loss of physical evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Kippenhan\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Chaulk Servs., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651265\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/124/#p127\">\n    428 Mass. 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127 (1998).

Here, the judge had no occasion to make such findings because Katin did not adequately raise the issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, we lack any meaningful record on which to consider her claim that she is entitled to an adverse inference instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Furthermore, the judge did address one element of spoliation-whether the nonspoliating party was prejudiced by the loss or destruction of evidence, see\n   <em>\n    Keene\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"47231\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/439/223/#p235\">\n    439 Mass. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 235 (2003) -and determined that Katin failed to demonstrate prejudice. We discern no abuse of discretion in this determination. As the judge found, no prejudice resulted from the loss of the sign because \"the sign itself is not the only evidence of its condition at the time Katin fell\"; \"[t]here is also Katin's own testimony as to the sign's clean, white condition.\" Katin contends that this was error because, if she had the sign itself, she might be able to show that \"it was resistant to track marks or dirt.\" But even then, she still would have no affirmative evidence that the sign was on the floor long enough for Stop &amp; Shop to have discovered and removed it. We therefore agree with the judge that Katin has no reasonable expectation of proving actual or constructive notice under the traditional theory of premises liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Mode of operation theory\n   </em>\n   .

See\n   <em>\n    Sarkisian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320224\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/679/#p681\">\n    471 Mass. at 683-685\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a case where the theory is applicable, the plaintiff need not prove actual or constructive notice, but instead \"satisfies the notice requirement if [s]he establishes that an injury was attributable to a reasonably foreseeable dangerous condition on the owner's premises that is related to the owner's [chosen] mode of operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheehan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3856033\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/448/780/#p782\">\n    448 Mass. at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although Katin does not know how the sign ended up on the floor, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to her, creates a reasonable inference of third-party interference. In particular, D'Amato's testimony that the sign could not have fallen out of the frame on its own supports an inference that a customer either intentionally or inadvertently removed the sign from the frame. But mere \"proof that a store's customer could have conceivably produced the hazardous condition\" does not get Katin to the jury; after all, \"nearly every business enterprise produces some risk of customer interference.\"\n   <em>\n    Sarkisian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320224\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/679/#p681\">\n    471 Mass. at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Chiara\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fry's Food Stores of Ariz., Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1475958\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/152/398/#p400\">\n    152 Ariz. 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 400-401 (1987). To survive summary judgment, Katin has the more onerous burden of showing that Stop &amp; Shop employed \"a 'particular' mode of operation that ma[de] the hazardous condition foreseeable, and a 'recurring feature of the mode of operation,' rather than one where the risk only 'conceivabl[y]' could arise from the mode of operation\" (footnote omitted).\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457189\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/34/#p37\">\n    475 Mass. at 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Sarkisian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320224\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/679/#p681\">\n    471 Mass. at 684, 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, the summary judgment record, even when viewed favorably to Katin, establishes at best that there was a conceivable risk that a customer would interfere with the sign and cause it to fall on the ground. Proof of only a conceivable risk does not get Katin to the jury.

This case is also distinguishable from\n    <em>\n     Bowers\n    </em>\n    , where the unsafe condition-dislodged stones from a gravel area-resulted from the store's invitation to customers to walk through the gravel area, unassisted by store employees, to shop for products on display there.

Here, the sign was not for sale or intended to be handled by customers, and no evidence exists that the risk of it falling was created, or exacerbated, by customers helping themselves to products on the shelves. In other words, as the judge observed, the record does not establish that the risk of a fallen advertising sign is any greater in a self-service store than in other business establishments (such as banks and post offices) that also serve customers and advertise products.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
