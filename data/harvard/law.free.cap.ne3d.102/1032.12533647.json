In essence, and relying on a purported private right of action under G. L. c. 268A, Butler asserts that the special permit must be set aside because one of the ZBA's members had a conflict of interest. No error appearing, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   As the motion judge held, Butler has not alleged that the jurisdictional prerequisites required under c. 268A have been satisfied. See G. L. c. 268A, \u00a7 21(\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ), as amended through St. 2009, c. 28, \u00a7 80;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Leder\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Superintendent of Schs. of Concord &amp; Concord-Carlyle Regional Sch.

Her attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Leder\n   </em>\n   as limited to suits by business competitors is not supported by anything in the decision and is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In light of this, we need not and do not reach Butler's remaining arguments. We deny defendants Benchmark Senior Living's and Brendon Properties Northside, LLC's requests for an award of their appellate attorney's fees. Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Municipal action may be set aside \"upon request by said municipal agency\" provided there has been \"a finding by the [state ethics] commission pursuant to an adjudicatory proceeding ...\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
