Within thirty days after the tenant vacated the property, the landlord sent him a letter with an itemized list of alleged damages to the property. Because the amount of the alleged damages exceeded $1,600, the landlord did not return any portion of the security deposit to the tenant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The tenant then filed suit under the Massachusetts security deposit statute, G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B, claiming that he was entitled to the return of his deposit, treble damages, and attorney's fees because the landlord did not sign her letter \"under pains and penalties of perjury\" as required by G. L. c. 186, \u00a7 15B(4)(iii), second sentence. The landlord counterclaimed for $3,910 in damages. On the tenant's motion for summary judgment, the judge concluded that, because the letter was not sworn to under pains and penalties of perjury, the landlord forfeited her right to retain the deposit and her right to bring counterclaims and was liable to the tenant for treble damages and attorney's fees. The judge thus ordered the dismissal of the landlord's counterclaims without prejudice and entry of judgment for the tenant in the amount of $4,800 plus attorney's fees, interest, and costs. The landlord appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After briefing but before oral argument in this appeal, the Supreme Judicial Court decided\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Phillips\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Equity Residential Mgmt., L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20Mass.%20251\">\n    478 Mass. 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).

So much of the judgment that awards the tenant treble damages and attorney's fees is vacated, and the matter is remanded for recalculation of the tenant's damages plus any applicable interest and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Affirmed in part; vacated in part.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
