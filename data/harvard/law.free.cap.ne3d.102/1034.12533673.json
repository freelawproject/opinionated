Section 1195(1) provides that the results of such tests are admissible in evidence at a criminal trial if the tests are \"administered pursuant to the provisions of section [1194].\" The results of a test also may be admissible absent compliance with section 1194 where a defendant has voluntarily consented to the test because section \"1194 ... ha[s] no application where the defendant expressly and voluntarily consented to a [chemical] test\" (\n   <em>\n    People v.

Here, because the breathalyzer test was not administered in accordance with the\n   requirements of section 1194 and defendant's consent to take the test was not voluntary, as required by\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , the results of the test were properly suppressed.\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2014, defendant was arrested on various charges, including operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. More than two hours after his arrest, he was informed that police wanted him to take a breathalyzer test and was asked whether he would \"take this test? Yes or no?\" After defendant answered \"No,\" he was given the \"refusal warnings\" set forth in Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194 -namely, he was warned that, if he refused \"to submit to the test,\" the result would be \"the immediate suspension or subsequent revocation of [his] driver's license or operating privileges whether or not [he was] found guilty of the charges for which [he had] been arrested.\" In addition, he was warned-inaccurately-that if he \"refuse[d] to submit to the test or any portion thereof, it w[ould] be introduced as evidence against [him] in any trial proceeding resulting from the arrest.\" Defendant then agreed to take the test and provided a breath sample, which showed that his blood alcohol level was above the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant subsequently moved to suppress the videotaped recording of the administration of the breathalyzer test, the test results, and all statements that he made to the arresting officer, including his initial refusal to take the test. Defendant asserted that, pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194, because more than two hours had passed between the time of his arrest and the request that he take the breathalyzer test, the officer administering the test should not have advised him\n   that, if he refused to take it, his driver's license would be suspended and the refusal could be used against him in court. Defendant maintained that the refusal warnings were inappropriate after two hours, and rendered his consent to the test involuntary. Criminal Court, adopting a Judicial Hearing Officer's decision, granted the motion to suppress both defendant's initial refusal to take the test and the test results. The court ruled that, \"[i]n light of the uncontradicted evidence that the refusal occurred more than two hours after arrest, suppression of the refusal is warranted.\" The court further concluded that the breathalyzer test results should have been suppressed because \"the warnings given by the police were coercive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The People moved to reargue, asserting that, although the refusal \"warnings were most certainly designed to induce submission to the test [and][i]t is undisputed that they do threaten the operator-accused with adverse consequences [for refusal] to consent,\" the warnings do not render a driver's consent involuntary because they merely inform the driver of the privilege that may be lost due to refusal, and that the refusal can be used against the driver in any subsequent legal proceedings. Criminal Court denied the motion to reargue, concluding that under\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   , \"where the chemical test is administered more than two hours after an arrest, admissibility of the results requires that the People show that consent was express and voluntary.\" The court then held that the People failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that defendant's consent was \"voluntary and not the result of coercive conduct by the officer\" because defendant consented \"only after [the officer] gave the improper warnings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Upon the People's appeal, the Appellate Term, First Department affirmed, holding that Criminal Court \"properly suppressed the breathalyzer test results\" because defendant's consent, given in response to \"inappropriate\n   warnings,\" was involuntary.

We conclude that, because more than two hours had passed since defendant's arrest, the warning that evidence of his refusal to take the breathalyzer test would be admissible at trial was inaccurate as a matter of law and, therefore, the record supports the conclusion of the courts below that his consent to the test was involuntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As previously noted, evidence of a refusal to take a breathalyzer test is admissible at trial pursuant to Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194(2)(f). Although there is no time limit expressly set forth in\n   section 1194(2)(f), that provision refers directly back to the chemical test authorized in subdivision (2)(a). Specifically, section 1194(2)(f) states that it is \"[e]vidence of a refusal to submit to\n   <em>\n    such\n   </em>\n   chemical test\" that is admissible at trial (emphasis added), with \"such chemical test\" being the one to which a defendant is deemed to have consented in subdivision (2)(a). In other words, the use of the word \"such\" in section 1194(2)(f) ties that provision back to subdivision (2)(a)-a different subparagraph\n   within the same subdivision-so that the two must be read together (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 97, Comment at 213-214, 216 [\"(W)ords, phrases, and sentences of a statutory section should be interpreted with reference to the scheme of the entire section ... and the meaning of a single section may not be determined by splitting it up into several parts.\"] ). Section 1194(2)(a) provides, in turn, that a defendant is \"deemed to have given consent to a chemical [breath] test,\" so long as the test is performed \"within two hours after such person has been placed under arrest for\" driving while intoxicated. Inasmuch as \"such chemical test\" is no longer authorized under the deemed\n   consent provision in section 1194(2)(a) after the two-hour period has expired, the motorist cannot, as a matter of law, refuse to take the test\n   <em>\n    within the meaning of section 1194(2)(f)\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any evidence of a refusal after that point must be suppressed because it does not fall within the parameters of the statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718451\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/544/#p548\">\n    18 N.Y.3d at 550-551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718451\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/544/#p548\">\n    942 N.Y.S.2d 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5718451\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/18/544/#p548\">\n    965 N.E.2d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Our interpretation of Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194(2)(f) is supported by that provision's legislative history.

Therefore, at the time the warnings were added to the statute, voluntariness was not a concern because a refusal could not be used against a defendant at trial. Indeed, the Legislature noted that \"[t]he proposal [to add the warning language] would not affect any subsequent criminal proceedings on the charge for which arrested, since it specifically applies only to\n   <em>\n    revocations\n   </em>\n   for refusal to consent to the chemical test\" (Sponsor's Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1968, ch 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The statute was not amended to permit evidence of a refusal at trial until 1973, in response to a concurring opinion by Judge Jasen in\n   <em>\n    Paddock\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sponsor's Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1973, ch 351).

The People's remaining argument regarding the accuracy of the warning of license suspension-the crux of the dissent-is both irrelevant to our analysis and academic. Further, the People's argument concerning the admissibility of defendant's initial refusal to take the breathalyzer lacks merit inasmuch as defendant did not \"persist[ ] in the refusal\" ( Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194[2][f] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Contrary to the People's argument, as well as the conclusion of the Appellate Division, Second Department in\n    <em>\n     People v.

Section 1194(2) is a self-contained paragraph that refers only to the \"such\" chemical tests described therein, i.e., the chemical test to which a defendant is \"deemed to have given consent\" (\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00a7 1194[2][a] ).

The group pointed the officers in the direction in which the driver had fled the scene, and within approximately ten blocks, officers came upon the stopped white Escalade. The driver, the defendant herein, smelled of alcohol and was unsteady on his feet. Police arrested defendant at 3:12 a.m., transported him to the police precinct and, once there, advised him of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   rights. Following questioning, and more than two hours from arrest, at approximately 5:50 a.m., an officer asked defendant, \"Will you take this [breath] test?\" Initially, defendant said no. The officer warned defendant that if he did not take the test, his license would be suspended and\n   his refusal would be used against him as evidence in court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant consented and provided the breath test, which measured his blood alcohol content (BAC) at .09%-above the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant was charged with reckless endangerment in the second degree, reckless driving, and three counts of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Defendant moved to suppress the results of the breath test on the allegation that the police unlawfully arrested him. During the suppression hearing, defendant continued to argue that the test results were inadmissible as the result of an unlawful seizure of his person,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   but in closing arguments also argued that the suppression court was bound by\n   <em>\n    People v.

The People disagreed with the effect of the dicta in\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   and relied on a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) change in policy since the 2011 conviction in\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   , allowing the agency to revoke licenses where a refusal fell outside the two-hour rule. Both the judicial hearing officer and nisi prius agreed they were bound by the precedent of\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   , and suppressed the evidence of the chemical test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On appeal to this Court, the crux of defendant's argument is that because the refusal warnings given to him were based\n   on allegedly erroneous information-namely that the DMV had the authority to revoke defendant's license under the circumstances-his consent following those warnings was coerced. However, based on the undisputed evidence in the hearing record,\n   the refusal warnings were not a misapplication of law at all. During the suppression hearing, the most decisive period in this case's history, the People argued that\n   <em>\n    Rosa\n   </em>\n   was inapplicable because DMV policy had changed since the facts underlying that case. In 2012, the DMV amended its policy to allow revocation or suspension of a motorist's license for refusing to submit to a breath test, even if such refusal is given more than two hours from arrest (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2012 NY St Dept of Motor Vehicles Op No. 1-12 at 2). Defendant never once challenged the People's assertion that the controlling refusal warnings as amended by DMV policy were correct as a matter of fact and law, and that defendant's consent was not coerced due to those warnings and must be accepted as voluntary (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Because it was undisputed that the DMV changed its policy to allow revocation of a license in the event a breath test is refused more than two hours after the arrest-and defendant never challenged that legal authority-our inquiry into alleged coerciveness as a result of the warnings given ends.

As a pioneer in combating the growing menace of drunk driving since the middle of the last century, New York designed the nation's first deemed consent law to set up a paradigm for evidence collection by providing that the privilege of driving required submission to a chemical test under penalty of a revocation of the license (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Interim Rep of N.Y. St Joint Legis Comm on Motor Veh Problems, 1953 N.Y. Legis Doc No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   25 at 11-18). The sole purpose of the statute, now section 1194, is compulsory submissions to chemical\n   tests from motorists. It is an evidence gathering measure specifically created by the legislature in recognition of the basic difficulty of proving the BAC of drivers at trial without such tests (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13). For that reason, the legislature did not-and this Court has never until today-set up arbitrary obstacles to this necessary evidence collection (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

Originally, the two-hour rule was an evidentiary standard concerned with probativeness (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   L 1941, ch 726, eff July 1, 1941). Especially at the statute's inception, when technological advancements in this area were less developed, a prompt breath test was presumably a more accurate measurement of BAC (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

In purposely placing the two-hour rule in the section 1194 provisions devoted solely to evidence\n   <em>\n    collection\n   </em>\n   in deemed consent cases, as opposed to other section 1194 provisions or section 1195, governing evidence\n   <em>\n    admissibility\n   </em>\n   and its probative value, the legislature signaled the two-hour rule does not define either the admissibility or probative value of evidence taken on court order pursuant to section 1194 or upon express consent of the motorist (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4435187\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/1007/#p1008\">\n    85 N.Y.2d at 1008-1009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4435187\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/1007/#p1008\">\n    630 N.Y.S.2d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4435187\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/1007/#p1008\">\n    654 N.E.2d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

This is\n   a consent case with actual evidence of a breath test provided by the motorist. Under section 1194(2)(f), a defendant's refusal-which is inextricably linked to the revocation of a license and more readily understood as a revocation of the deemed consent created by the legislature as a condition of a license grant-is admissible at trial \"only upon a showing that the person was given sufficient warning, in clear and unequivocal language, of the effect of such refusal\n   <em>\n    and that the person persisted in the refusal\n   </em>\n   \" ( Vehicle and Traffic Law \u00a7 1194[2][f] [emphasis added] ).

The refusal is defined by the statute as one that must follow the giving of requisite warnings and one whereby a defendant persistently refuses to submit to a compulsory test. Then the evidence of the refusal is admitted pursuant to section 1194(2)(f) as an inference of guilt. Obviously, refusal\n   evidence is entirely superfluous when a defendant has consented to a breath test and the BAC results speak directly to the issue of guilt. Further, the position that advising defendant that his refusal could be used as evidence is somehow coercive is also without merit.

By this statutory scheme, the refusal warnings in section 1194(2)(b) -given to motorists who persist in revoking the deemed consent presumed to be given by any licensed driver-serve the purpose of alerting the driver to the consequences of blocking the compulsory method of evidence collection laid out in section 1194(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The two-hour rule, however, has no applicability outside the deemed consent scenario.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That sound explanation furthers the object, spirit, and purpose of the statute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes \u00a7 92), and is also compatible with our decades of precedent on this very subject.

Particularly in light of\n   <em>\n    Birchfield's\n   </em>\n   holding that a warrantless breath test is a reasonable search incident to arrest within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment for intoxicated motorists, any issue of consent here is somewhat academic as one's consent is not required for a search and seizure (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   579 U.S. at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597986\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2160/#p2184\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2184 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, this is neither a\n   deemed consent case nor a persistent refusal case-a distinction that has muddled this litigation at every stage. We are dealing instead with a defendant's cooperation in expressly consenting to take a breath test after being provided appropriate warnings of the consequences of his refusal to do so. We have held that the best practice for police is to warn defendants of options, as well as their right of refusal so that a defendant's decision to take a breath test is made knowingly and voluntarily (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2234401\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/307/73/#p77\">\n    307 N.Y. at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20N.E.2d%20211\">\n    120 N.E.2d 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In this case, police asked defendant to take the breath test and provided the refusal warnings as explained in the DMV's revised policy, advising defendant that his license would be revoked even though more than two hours had passed since his arrest, and a refusal can be used as evidence against him. As a result, defendant made a choice and expressly consented to the breath test. Based on the record, the statute, and our precedent, the statutory two-hour rule does not apply to the administration of the refusal warnings given in such a scenario.\n   Accordingly, the results of the breath test should not have been suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For those reasons, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Judges Rivera, Wilson and Feinman concur, Judge Wilson in a concurring opinion.
