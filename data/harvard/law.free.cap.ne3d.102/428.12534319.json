(Atlantic). Judgment entered in favor of Lloyd's after cross motions for summary judgment. On appeal, Atlantic makes three arguments. First, Atlantic argues that Lloyd's failed to preserve its right to raise the independent contractors exclusion during the underlying tort action and therefore is estopped from doing so now. Next, Atlantic argues that the independent contractors exclusion is ambiguous and the ambiguity must be construed against Lloyd's. Finally, Atlantic argues that, even if the independent contractors exclusion is unambiguous, the exclusion does not apply to the underlying tort action because Park Grove's negligence, not Atlantic's, is the basis for the action against Park Grove. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The essential facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2002, Park Grove hired Atlantic, an independent contractor, to (among other things) construct a sidewalk as part of a residential housing project. Atlantic stopped paving part of a sidewalk short of a driveway on the property and built a \"cold joint\" between the two. In 2006, Claire LaPosta tripped and fell on the cold joint and injured herself. LaPosta sued Atlantic for its negligent construction of the \"cold joint\" and Park Grove for its failure to warn of the defect created by Atlantic. A jury returned a verdict that assigned, as relevant here, fifty-five percent fault to Atlantic and thirty percent fault to Park Grove, jointly and severally. Lloyd's refused to indemnify Park Grove for its portion of the judgment; as a result, Atlantic (through its insurer) satisfied the full amount. This suit followed in which Lloyd's, relying on the independent contractors exclusion contained in its general liability policy under which Park Grove was insured, sought a declaration that it had no duty to indemnify Park Grove. That provision excludes from coverage \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of operations performed for the Named Insured by Independent Contractors or acts or omissions of the Named Insured in connection with his general supervision of such operations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   First, Atlantic argues that Lloyd's failed to preserve its right to raise the independent contractors exclusion during the underlying tort action and therefore is estopped from doing so now. Atlantic raises this issue for the first time on appeal and thus, the argument is waived.\n   <em>\n    International Fid. Ins.

The fact that Park Grove made the same point below, does not help Atlantic now.

And that customary understanding leads to a natural and clear meaning of the exclusion, namely that bodily injury or property damage connected to the operations of the insured's (Park Grove) subcontractor (Atlantic) are excluded from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the alternative, Atlantic argues that, even if the independent contractors exclusion is unambiguous, the exclusion does not apply to the underlying tort action because Park Grove's liability arises out of Park Grove's failure to warn of the defect in the sidewalk rather than Atlantic's negligence in performing the work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The phrase \"arising out of\" is to be read expansively and \"suggest[s] a causation more analogous to 'but for' causation, in which the court examining the exclusion inquires whether there would have been personal injuries, and a basis for the plaintiff's suit, in the absence of the objectionable underlying conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Bagley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . We therefore look at \"the\n   <em>\n    source\n   </em>\n   from which the plaintiff's personal injury originates,\" not \"the specific\n   <em>\n    theories of liability\n   </em>\n   alleged in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 458. The source of LaPosta's injury is indisputably the \"cold joint\" created by Atlantic. Put otherwise, but for Atlantic's \"cold joint,\" LaPosta would not have been injured. LaPosta's injury therefore arises out of Atlantic's actions and the independent contractors exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    Park Grove is not a party to the appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    In our de novo review, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party against which judgment was entered.\n    <em>\n     Herbert A.
