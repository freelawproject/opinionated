Jones-Kelley, Director of ODJFS (collectively \"appellees\"), for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 2} At all relevant times, appellants engaged in the business of providing both emergency and non-emergency ambulance services and emergency and non-emergency ambulette services (wheelchair van) for patients enrolled in the Ohio Medicaid program administered by appellees. In order for appellants to conduct such business, appellees required appellants to obtain Medicaid certification and to execute provider agreements setting forth the terms of service, including the rate of reimbursement for covered services provided. Ohio Adm.Code 5160-1-17.2 defines the provider agreement, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   A provider agreement is a contract between the Ohio department of job and family services (ODJFS) And a provider of medicaid covered services. By signing this agreement the provider agrees to comply with the terms of the provider agreement, Revised Code, Administrative Code, and federal statutes and rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Ohio Adm.Code 5160-1-60 sets forth the Medicaid payments providers are to receive for covered services, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (A) The medicaid payment for a covered procedure, service, or supply constitutes payment in full and may not be construed as a partial payment when the payment amount is less than the provider's submitted charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (B) * * * The medicaid payment amount for a covered service, procedure, or supply is the lesser of the submitted charge or the established medicaid maximum. Medicaid maximum payment amounts for many existing services, procedures, and supplies, particularly services rendered by practitioners of the healing arts, are set forth in the appendix to this rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On December 11, 2007, Medcorp filed a complaint against appellees in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint alleges the Medicaid reimbursement rates set by appellees are so low as to violate state and federal statutory, regulatory, and constitutional provisions, including 42 U.S.C. 1983, 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)-(30)(A), 42 C.F.R. 447.204, R.C. Chapter 5111, R.C. 5111.01 and 5111.02, the Due Process Clauses, the Equal Protection Clauses, and the Takings Clauses. The complaint further alleges the Medicaid reimbursement rates set by appellees constitute a breach of the provider agreement. On May 12, 2008, TLC filed a complaint against appellees in the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas alleging the same claims. Appellants' complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as \"just compensation for Medicaid reimbursement monies taken to which it is entitled.\" (TLC Compl. at 9; Medcorp Compl. at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On appellees' motion, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas transferred venue of the two cases to Franklin County, and the trial court in Franklin County consolidated the two cases pursuant to Civ.R. 42(A). On October 10, 2008 and January 20, 2009, appellees filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1), for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Appellees argued because appellants alleged claims for monetary relief against the state of Ohio sounding in breach of contract, the Court of Claims of Ohio had exclusive original jurisdiction of the complaints. Appellants argued even though the complaints seek monetary relief against appellees, the claims alleged in the complaints are purely equitable in nature and are, therefore, within the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court agreed with appellees and granted appellees' motion to dismiss on February 9, 2017. Appellants timely appealed to this court from the trial court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

If, on the other hand, a plaintiff \"cannot assert title or right to possession of particular property,\" but he or she may, nevertheless, \"be able to show just grounds for recovering money to compensate for some benefit the defendant has received from [the plaintiff],\" the claim, however characterized by the plaintiff, is treated as a claim for legal remedy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellants' argument in this case is that their complaints state claims for equitable restitution, rather than legal claims for money damages. For example, in addition to the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief, appellants argue that claims seeking reimbursement from ODJFS for funds wrongfully withheld by ODJFS, in violation of federal statutes and regulations pertaining to Medicaid reimbursement, are equitable in nature, even though the complaints seeks the payment of money. However, even if we were to agree with appellants that the complaints allege claims for equitable restitution, Count III of TLC's complaint in this case provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   42.

The complaint in that case alleged the plaintiffs-appellees incurred monetary damages as a result of newly implemented Ohio Adm.Code 5101:3-2-20, which reduced the period of time Medicaid reimbursed hospitals for outpatient services. According to the complaint, prior to the implementation of the new rule, ODHS reimbursed participating hospitals for outpatient services under a \"cost-based reimbursement\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   method, which entailed reimbursing each hospital for the costs of the resources directly and indirectly utilized in providing health care services.\n   <em>\n    Ohio Hosp.

Among the claims asserted in the complaint was a claim for reimbursement of monies withheld by ODHS pursuant to an invalid administrative rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On appeal to this court, ODHS argued the Court of Claims did not have jurisdiction of the claims alleged in the complaint because the claims fell outside the state's waiver of immunity under R.C. 2743.02 and, in particular, because the claim reimbursement of monies withheld pursuant to an invalid administrative rule sounded in equitable restitution rather than monetary damages at law. This court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Claims. ODHS appealed from this court's judgment to the Supreme Court of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In the decision of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ohio Hosp. Assn.\n   </em>\n   , one of the issues for the court was whether the Court of Claims Act waived sovereign immunity with respect to plaintiffs-appellees' claims alleging ODHS violated the Social Security Act and related federal regulations by enacting the new administrative rule. On this question, the court held that \"reimbursement of monies withheld pursuant to an invalid administrative rule is equitable relief, not money damages, and is consequently not barred by sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.E.2d%20695\">\n    579 N.E.2d 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Appellants here argue this holding in\n   <em>\n    Ohio Hosp.

However, a determination that appellants' complaints contain equitable claims for relief against appellees does not resolve the question of jurisdiction presented herein. Of significance to the question of the Court of Claims' jurisdiction in this case is the following holding in\n   <em>\n    Ohio Hosp. Assn.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   We hold that this suit is within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims because of the nature of the claims raised and the relief sought. The hospitals initially sought relief for violations of their provider agreements and an earlier settlement agreement between certain of the parties, as well as for violations of federal law, state law, the United States Constitution, and the Ohio Constitution. The complaint sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.\n   <em>\n    The claims for violation of the provider agreements and an earlier settlement agreement are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Claims to the extent that the hospitals allege that their contractual rights have been violated and seek monetary relief\n   </em>\n   .
