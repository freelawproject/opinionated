For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The facts for purposes of this appeal are not in dispute. On May 19, 2015, appellant filed this class action lawsuit against appellee, The Huntington National Bank, on behalf of itself and other bondholders who invested funds into a municipal bond issue described as \"$6,590,000 COUNTY OF LUCAS OHIO HOSPITAL FACILITIES REFUNDING REVENUE (NON-TAXABLE) BONDS, SERIES 1998 (VILLA NORTH PROJECT) CUSIP 54309 BP6, 549309 BQ4, 549309 BR2, 549309 BS0.\" The complaint alleged that Lucas County was the technical obligor on the bonds for tax purposes, but in reality, Foundation for the Elderly, Inc. (\"Foundation\") was the obligor and lessee of the Villa North nursing home project. Appellee served as the trustee for the bondholders and as lessor of the project pursuant to a Trust Indenture entered into between appellee and Lucas County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Sometime before June 2003, Foundation went into default, and West Toledo Healthcare became the substitute obligor. By December 2003, Benchmark Healthcare of Toledo, Inc. (\"Benchmark\") had become the obligor in place of West Toledo Healthcare, and had defaulted on the bond payments. Notably, appellee provided notices to the bondholders of the defaults and changes in obligors. In May 2004, Benchmark filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and in December 2007, filed its First Amended Plan of Reorganization. After the bondholders voted in favor of the plan, the bankruptcy court approved the plan. Relevant here, appellant began purchasing these bonds for a fraction of the face value on November 3, 2003, and continued to purchase them through June 7, 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} By July 2009, Benchmark had failed to implement the amended reorganization plan. Thus, the bankruptcy was dismissed, and appellee filed a foreclosure action against Benchmark. In November 2014, the Villa North project was sold and a final distribution was made to the bondholders. In the final distribution, the bondholders only received approximately $350,000 of the $6,590,000 initial bond issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Within the class action complaint, appellant asserted claims for breach of fiduciary duty, breach of trust under R.C. 5801.01 et seq., negligence, breach of contract, and liability for mismanagement of the Villa North nursing home project. In general, appellant alleged that appellee \"did virtually nothing to protect the interest of the Bondholders, while collecting substantial sums of Bondholder money as its compensation.\" Upon motion of appellee, the trial court dismissed all of the claims except the breach of contract claim as being barred by the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Thereafter, appellant moved to certify a class on the remaining breach of contract claim, describing the class as \"All persons or entities who own bonds.\" Appellee opposed the motion for class certification, arguing, inter alia, that appellant had not satisfied the requirement under Civ.R. 23(B)(3) that, \"the questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" In particular, appellee argued that the class is comprised of bondholders who purchased the bonds at different times and after different key events. Thus, the facts, evidence, and related legal issues of liability would differ among class members based on when the members acquired\n   the bonds, or whether the members approved the bankruptcy reorganization plan. Appellant, on the other hand, argued that the issue of whether appellee breached the Trust Indenture was common to all current bondholders because under R.C. 1308.16(A), \"[A] purchaser of a certificated or uncertificated security acquires all rights in the security that the transferor had or had power to transfer.\" Appellant concluded, therefore, that the right to sue for breach of contract that was held by bondholders at the time of the breach transferred to subsequent purchasers of the bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On November 16, 2016, the trial court entered its judgment denying appellant's motion to certify a class. The trial court reasoned that the term \"rights in the security\" under R.C. 1308.16(A) does not include a claim against a third party for breach of contract, such as appellant's claim in the current action. Consequently, because appellant has alleged numerous breaches over a significant period of time, and because the claims do not transfer to subsequent purchasers, different class members would have different potential damages and would emphasize different potential breaches. Therefore, the trial court determined that appellant had not satisfied the requirement under Civ.R. 23(B)(3). Further, because the trial court found the predominance issue in Civ.R. 23(B)(3) to be determinative, it did not consider any of the other Civ.R. 23 requirements for bringing a class action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Appellant has timely appealed the trial court's November 16, 2016 judgment, asserting one assignment of error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1.

However, appellant takes the position that the subsequent purchaser of a bond does acquire the cause of action pursuant to R.C. 1308.16, which is Ohio's version of U.C.C. \u00a7 8-302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 14} R.C. 1308.16 provides, in its entirety,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (A) Except as otherwise provided in divisions (B) and (C) of this section, a purchaser of a certificated or uncertificated security acquires all rights in the security that the transferor had or had power to transfer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (B) A purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (C) A purchaser of a certificated security who as a previous holder had notice of an adverse claim does not improve its position by taking from a protected purchaser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Appellant argues that his claim against appellee is a \"right in the security\" because the Trust Indenture explains that the trust is to be executed \"for the equal and proportionate benefit, security and protection of all present and future holders and owners of the Bonds issued or to be issued under and secured by this Indenture.\" The trial court, recognizing that this is an issue of first impression, disagreed. In reaching its decision, the trial court relied on the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Consol. Edison, Inc. v.

(\"Con Ed\") and Northeast Utilities (\"NU\"). As part of the agreement, Con Ed agreed to purchase all outstanding shares of NU at a substantial premium over the market price. Shortly before the merger was completed, though, Con Ed announced that it would not proceed. Con Ed then filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that it had no obligations under the merger agreement. NU counterclaimed, arguing that Con Ed repudiated and breached the agreement. NU sought to recover, in part, the \"lost premium\" on behalf of its current and future shareholders as third-party beneficiaries to the merger agreement. Robert Rimkoski intervened as a defendant and filed a claim against Con Ed, also seeking to recover the lost premium due to Con Ed's breach of the merger agreement. Rimkoski sought to represent a class of similarly situated individuals who owned shares of NU on March 5, 2001, the date of the alleged breach. The question before the court was whether \"the third-party beneficiary claim belong[s] to those who held NU shares at the time of Con Ed's alleged breach on March 5, 2001, * * * or to those who are holding NU shares at the time that a judgment against Con Ed is entered, collected, or distributed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 183. More specifically, \"Where shareholders are third-party beneficiaries of a contract between the corporate issuer of the stock and a third party, is the right to sue that third party for breach of the contract automatically transferred to a subsequent purchaser of the stock?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 17} NU argued, as appellant does here, that the stock-related contract claims against third parties were automatically assigned to subsequent purchasers of the stock by virtue of New York's version of U.C.C. \u00a7 8-302(a), which is identical to R.C. 1308.16(A). The trial court rejected this argument, finding that the legislative history and structure of the U.C.C. \"confirm that \u00a7 8-302(a), rather than defining what rights are in the security, involves the mechanism for transferring rights and applies primarily to disputes over the quality of title and the competing ownership rights passed from transferor to transferee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 188. The court concluded that,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Section 8-302 does not define \"rights in a security\" or codify a rule assigning to purchasers any claim accrued while possessing the security. The provision simply provides that whatever \"rights in the security\" are, they are automatically transferred to a purchaser unless (a) the transferor did not own or control them, (b) the purchase was for a limited interest, or (c) the purchaser is a prior holder with notice of an adverse claim taking from a protected purchaser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189-190.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Having concluded that U.C.C. \u00a7 8-302 automatically conveys only the \"rights in the security,\" the trial court then determined that the \"rights in the security\" do not include the rights of \"third-party beneficiaries arising out of agreements separate from the contract embodied in the security.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 190. This is where we find\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Edison\n   </em>\n   to be distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Whereas the parties in\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Edison\n   </em>\n   were bringing counterclaims against a separate and unrelated company based on its purported breach of an agreement with the company that issued the shares, here, appellant is bringing a claim against the trustee for the bondholders based on a breach of the Trust Indenture. The Trust Indenture is part of the \"bond proceedings.\" R.C. 140.01(J) (\" 'Bond proceedings' means one or more ordinances, resolutions, trust agreements, indentures, and other agreements or documents, and\n   amendments and supplements to the foregoing, or any combination thereof, authorizing or providing for the terms, including any variable interest rates, and conditions applicable to, or providing for the security of, obligations and the provisions contained in such obligations.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R.C. 140.06(I) (\"Such obligations may be secured additionally by a trust agreement or indenture between the public hospital agency and a corporate trustee which may be any trust company or bank * * *. Any such agreement or indenture may contain, as part thereof, any of the bond proceedings, * * * and other provisions which are customary or appropriate in an agreement or indenture of such type, including but not limited to: * * * (3) The rights and remedies of the holders of obligations and of the trustee, and provisions for protecting and enforcing them * * *.\"). Thus, a claim for breach of the Trust Indenture arises out of the contract with the bondholders, and is therefore properly considered a \"right in the security\" that passes to a subsequent purchaser under R.C. 1308.16(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Appellee argues that this result improperly transforms R.C. 1308.16(A) to provide for the automatic transfer of all rights \"related to\" the security or \"accrued while possessing\" the security, and cites two cases for the proposition that ownership of a security does not automatically result in an assignment of any claims. We find the cases cited by appellee to be inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} In\n   <em>\n    In re Nucorp Energy Secs.

The action was related to a class action brought by parties who purchased debentures between October 1, 1981, and January 20, 1982. In the class action, the class argued that the indenture trustee knew that the disclosure documents accompanying the debenture issue were misleading. The Phelps Committee represents purchasers who bought the debentures from class members after January 20, 1982. In bringing its action, the Phelps Committee argued that it automatically acquired the sellers' causes of action when it purchased the debentures from the class members. Thus, the issue before the court was \"whether, under federal or state law, the direct purchasers' rights were automatically transferred to the subsequent purchasers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306685\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1486/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306685\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1486/\">\n    at 1488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 22} As it pertains to the federal claim for breach of trust under the Trust Indenture Act, the Ninth Circuit held that federal law applied to the assignability of such claims, and under federal law, there was no remedy for \"subsequent purchasers to whom no misrepresentations were made directly or indirectly and to whom no statutorily provided cause of action was expressly assigned.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306685\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1486/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306685\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1486/\">\n    at 1490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As to the assignment of the state-law claims, the court found that New York law applied, and under that law, the state-law claims were not automatically transferred.

Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a suit against PetroCorp, asserting, inter alia, two contract claims for breach of the Warrant Agreement, where the breach occurred prior to the plaintiffs acquiring the warrants. Relevant here, PetroCorp asserted as an affirmative defense that the right to bring claims for breach of the Warrant Agreement was not transferred with the warrants when the plaintiffs purchased them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Relying on Texas' version of U.C.C. 8-302(a), the trial court rejected PetroCorp's argument. Specifically, the trial court noted that the claim was asserted against the successor-in-interest to the issuer of the warrants, and was based on the warrant agreement. The court found that \"[t]he Warrants are a contract between PetroCorp and the Warrant holders that provide rights through the terms of the Warrant Certificate and the Warrant Agreement. The Warrant holders' rights in the Warrants 'thus include the rights against the issuer [here, PetroCorp] under the contract embodied in the security [here, the Warrant Agreement] as supplemented by federal and state law.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214961\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/477/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214961\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/329/477/\">\n    at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    Consolidated Edison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228613\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/318/181/\">\n    318 F.Supp.2d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the court held that the plaintiffs' claim for breach of the warranty agreement was a \"right in the security\" that automatically transferred with the purchase of the warrant.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228613\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/318/181/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Similarly, in the case before us, appellant's cause of action arises from a breach of the Trust Indenture, which is part of the contract with the bondholders. Appellee argues that\n   <em>\n    R.A. Mackie\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because in that case the cause of action was against the issuer, not the indenture trustee. However, we do not find that distinction to be meaningful since the basis for the claim is grounded in the same instrument that is part of the contract with the bondholders. Appellee's position leads to the incongruous result that breach of the trust indenture by an issuer is a \"right in the security,\" but breach of the same trust indenture by the trustee is not. Therefore, we hold that a contract claim for breach of the Trust Indenture, whether asserted against the trustee or the obligor, arises out of the contract with the bondholders and is thus a \"right in the security\" that automatically transfers to subsequent purchasers pursuant to R.C. 1308.16(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Accordingly, appellant's assignment of error is well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Other Civ.R. 23 Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In addition to arguing in opposition to appellant's assignment of error, appellee argues that class certification under Civ.R. 23 is still not appropriate as appellant has failed to satisfy the other requirements of that rule. However, because the trial court based its determination solely on Civ.R. 23(B)(3), and did not consider any of the other requirements, we decline to rule on those issues for the first time on appeal. \"If we were to reach issues that had not been addressed by the trial court in the first instance, we would be usurping the role of the trial court and exceed[ing] our authority on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Catalanotto v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas is reversed.

The majority bases its conclusion on R.C. 140.01(J) and (I), which provide that a trust indenture is a part of the \"bond proceedings,\" and therefore a \"right\" that passed to appellant under R.C. 1308.16(A). In my view, while that demonstrates that a bondholder has standing to sue under a trust indenture, it does not answer the ultimate question of whether a bondholder has standing to sue for prior breaches of that agreement. I believe that the answer to that question depends upon the precise terms of the particular \"security\" at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 32} A case from the Supreme Court of California,\n   <em>\n    National Reserve Co. v.

Ward Esplin purchased a participation certificate from the Thrift Company, and\n   then later assigned \"all of his right, title, and interest\" in the participation certificate to the Reserve Company. The Reserve Company later instituted an action against the Trust Company, on its behalf and on behalf of all other holders of such contracts and certificates, seeking recovery for various breaches of the trust agreement that occurred before the assignment.

The court offered the following reasoning:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The trust indenture, upon which the present action is based, specifically provides that ownership of a certificate secured by the agreement is a condition precedent to the maintenance of a cause of action for violation of a covenant contained therein. The assertion of the cause of action is thus dependent upon ownership of the certificate. All right, title and interest in such certificate has been assigned to plaintiff. Only by virtue of its transfer to the plaintiff could the cause of action continue to exist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 833-834,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=112%20P.2d%20598\">\n    112 P.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Interestingly, in the case relied upon by the majority,\n   <em>\n    R.A.

Mackie\n   </em>\n   at 507. The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Significantly, the Warrant Agreement provides that \"all covenants, conditions, stipulations, promises, and agreements in this Agreement contained shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their successor and the holders of the Warrant Certificates.\" That provision also limits to the \"parties hereto and the holders of the Warrant Certificates any right, remedy, or claim under or by reason of this Agreement * * *.\" The Warrant Agreement thus authorizes holders of the Warrants, without limitation, to maintain a legal\n   proceeding for breach of that Agreement.

If\n   <em>\n    R.A.
