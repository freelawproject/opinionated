R.D. also was required to pay S.W.'s legal costs and fees incurred in connection with her complaint for modification. A subsequent motion by R.D. to vacate the modification judgment was denied. On appeal, R.D. challenges the sufficiency of the notice of the hearing at which the judgment entered. He also contends that the child support order and the award of attorney's fees were not warranted. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . We summarize the relevant factual and procedural history from the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties, who are not married, have four children. On or about May 2, 2005, a judgment entered requiring the father to pay child support to the mother in the amount of $235 per week (support judgment). The parties subsequently reconciled prompting S.W. to file a complaint for modification seeking dismissal of the support judgment. Although the support judgment was dismissed on March 5, 2007, the father continued to pay child support until September, 2014, just before the youngest daughter's eighteenth birthday.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Soon thereafter, on January 15, 2015, the mother filed a complaint for modification seeking to reestablish R.D.'s obligation to support their two youngest daughters. R.D. was served with the summons and complaint on February 10, 2015, at his last and usual place of abode, and a pretrial conference was scheduled for September 15, 2015. When the father failed to appear, the pretrial conference was rescheduled for January 27, 2016. R.D. again failed to appear for the pretrial conference and, by order dated January 28, 2016, a pretrial conference was scheduled for June 9, 2016. In relevant part, the order provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   \"2. Father [R.D.] shall attend the Pre-Trial Conference, prepared with a written memorandum and a complete and accurate, signed Financial Statement as instructed in the separate Notice and Order for same that was mailed to him by the Court. If Father fails to attend, his obligation for support, maintenance and education for [the two daughters] may be determined in his absence based upon his 2015 earned income as stated in the subpoenaed Boston University records obtained by Mother's attorney.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   R.D. did not attend the hearing on June 9, 2016. The judge proceeded as provided in the pretrial notice and order and called the modification complaint for trial. The judge found that both daughters were full-time college students domiciled with the mother and principally dependent upon her for their support. The judge calculated S.W.'s gross weekly income at $975, the amount reflected on the mother's financial statement dated June 8, 2016. The judge imputed a gross weekly income of $1,322 to the father \"based upon his 2015 earned income as stated in the subpoenaed Boston University records\" from his employer. The judge then determined that R.D.'s child support obligation for the two daughters was $333 per week and ordered R.D. to pay current child support to the mother in that amount per week forthwith, and retroactively to the week ending February 13, 2015. As a result of the retroactive application of the order, the father owed the mother an additional $23,310. The judge also ordered R.D. to pay S.W.'s legal costs and fees in the amount of $3,500.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   About three weeks later, on June 28, 2016, the father filed a motion to vacate the judgment, asserting, with no supporting affidavit, that he did not receive notice of the hearing that had been scheduled for June 9, and that the amount of income imputed to him was incorrect because the judge failed to consider (1) that he pays health insurance for the daughters, and (2) that he has child support obligations in connection with another child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A hearing on R.D.'s motion to vacate the judgment was held on July 13, 2016. Among other arguments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the father claimed that he was entitled to relief because he had not received notice of the modification proceedings. In support of this claim R.D. relied on a letter (which he apparently attached to his motion) that had been sent to him and then returned to the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also pointed to several instances wherein his name had been misspelled on proofs of service. The judge rejected this argument on two grounds: first, R.D. had not complied with Standing Order 2-99;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and second, R.D. had failed to provide sufficient evidence of lack of notice. As the judge explained \"[t]he attachment (letter) that was returned is from 2015. None of the several mailings to the same address thereafter have been returned, and it is the address now stated by recipient as accurate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n   . We begin by addressing the mother's claim that the appeal is moot. It is not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the parties appear to have settled the issues of arrearages and ongoing child support of the youngest daughter by entering into a stipulation which was incorporated into a judgment of modification, the questions regarding notice and whether the award of child support and attorney's fees was warranted remain unresolved. We therefore proceed to address the merits of the father's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n   . R.D. claims that he was denied due process of law because he did not receive notice of the pretrial conferences held on January 28 and June 9, 2016, or the subsequent trial held after he failed to appear on June 9, 2016. In support of his claim, R.D. points to a single letter that was returned to the court on March 30, 2015, as undeliverable, and to several minor misspellings of his name in various court documents. The judge concluded that R.D.'s evidence of lack of service was insufficient. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The judge correctly found that the return of one letter to the court approximately one year before the date of the pretrial conference at issue did not demonstrate that the father had not received sufficient notice of the proceedings. Moreover, R.D. never provided an affidavit or a sworn statement in support of his claim. Finally, the record supports a finding that the father received correspondence from the mother's attorney, dated February 2, 2016, to which the pretrial conference notices and the January 28, 2016, order were attached. In these circumstances, we think it is clear that the father is not entitled to relief on the basis that he did not receive proper notice of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Child support calculations\n   </em>\n   . Next, the father argues that the judge abused her discretion in awarding child support because she did not consider his responsibility to provide for another child, his voluntary expenses, or the fact that he provides health insurance for the daughters. However, no evidence of these expenses was before the judge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the father never filed a signed financial statement as required by the January 28, 2016, pretrial order before judgment entered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Absent a statement of his current income, the judge properly used R.D.'s 2015 earned income to calculate his child support obligations. We will not second-guess the judge's calculations where R.D. \"failed to provide the judge with evidence from which she might have arrived at a different figure.\"\n   <em>\n    M.C\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    T.K\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    463 Mass. 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Attorney's fees\n   </em>\n   . R.D. claims error in the judge's award of attorney's fees to S.W. in the amount of $3,500. Such an award rests in the judge's sound discretion. See\n   <em>\n    M.C\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    T.K\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3685518\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/463/226/#p240\">\n    at 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The judge's reasons for awarding attorney fees are supported by the record and, therefore, there was no abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    L.L\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144900\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/470/169/\">\n    470 Mass. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185 n.27 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Motion to vacate\n   </em>\n   . R.D.'s argument with respect to the denial of his motion to vacate barely rises to the level of appellate argument, see Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=367%20Mass.%20921\">\n    367 Mass. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). In any event, in light of R.D.'s failure to engage in the proceedings until after judgment had entered, despite being aware of them, the judge committed no abuse of discretion by denying the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    The mother's request for appellate attorney's fees and costs\n   </em>\n   . We agree with S.W. that she is entitled to an award of appellate attorney's fees and costs.

R.D. shall have fourteen days after the application is filed to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Order denying motion to vacate judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Both R.D. and S.W. have filed a supplemental appendix without prior court approval as required by Mass.R.A.P. 18(a), as amended,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=425%20Mass.%201602\">\n     425 Mass. 1602\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1997).
