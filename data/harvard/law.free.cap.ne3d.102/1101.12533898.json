In resolving this issue, the en banc court determined that a conflict exists between decisions in this district on the question of whether the trial court's failure to impose court costs at the sentencing hearing, but ordering the defendant to pay court costs in the judgment entry of conviction, constitutes reversible error or harmless error.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The notion that it could be a strategic decision by trial counsel to not request a waiver of costs at sentencing ignores the very purpose why R.C. 2947.23 was amended-to request waiver of properly imposed court costs at a later date when a change of circumstances presents themself, including a cooling-off period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Court found trial courts lack this ability because they are not specifically authorized by statute to waive costs after sentencing.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n    This serves little practical purpose. Although section 2947.23 of the Revised Code allows for community service in lieu of payment of costs, many offenders become debilitated or have a change of circumstances after sentencing and cannot perform community service. This means indigent offenders do not pay their court costs and do not perform community service. In order to rectify this problem, the General Assembly should amend the statute to allow the court discretion to suspend costs after sentencing.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    R.C. 2947.23(C) addresses the jurisdictional concerns raised in both\n    <em>\n     State v.

But the Supreme Court's clear admonition against finding structural error compels the conclusion that the R.C. 2947.23(C)\"fix\" actually does, absent extraordinary facts, render any Crim.R. 43(A) error harmless beyond any doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 25} The en banc majority argues that a defendant making an R.C. 2947.23(C) request to waive the payment of court costs after sentencing is prejudiced because the defendant would not have the benefit of legal representation when making the motion.\n   <em>\n    Ante\n   </em>\n   at \u00b611.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 26} This argument needlessly confuses a Sixth Amendment right to counsel into what is a Crim.R. 43(A) claim.

Importantly, the en banc majority does not overrule\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , so that decision remains binding on this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 28} This case is an excellent example of why defense counsel might not ask for a waiver of the payment of court costs. The sentencing transcript shows that the court questioned Taylor about how he never held a job yet possessed over $10,000 in cash when arrested on the two trafficking cases. When Taylor told the court that he lived with his parents but provided no financial assistance to them, the court stated, \"so $10,000 you have on you in a matter of months, and you don't share any of that with your mom and dad for living in their home; is that what you're telling me?\" Given this and other statements made by the trial judge, defense counsel may well have thought that a motion to waive court costs on grounds of indigence would have been futile and that Taylor would have a better chance to file the motion at a later point in time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If defense counsel can, as a matter of strategy, decide not to pursue a\n   waiver of the payment of court costs at sentencing, there can be no prejudice from the fact that an R.C. 2947.23(C) postsentence motion to waive the payment of court costs is not one where the petitioner is entitled to the assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Finally, the en banc majority opines that a petitioner is prejudiced because there is no right to appeal in the event the court were to deny a postsentence motion to waive the payment of court costs. The majority maintains that there is no legally enforceable right to challenge the trial court's decision on the payment of court costs, postsentencing, whereas the defendant would have the right to raise the issue on a direct appeal from the sentencing. This conclusion may be erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Appellate courts have jurisdiction over orders that are both final and appealable. An order is \"final\" only if it meets the criteria set forth in R.C. 2505.02. As applicable here, it appears that an order denying a postsentence motion to waive, suspend, or modify the payment of court costs would be an order that affects a substantial right made in a summary application in an action after judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The enactment of R.C. 2947.23(C) gave the trial courts continuing jurisdiction to modify or waive the payment of court costs. The statute explicitly gives a defendant the right to request a waiver of the payment of court costs at any time. This would constitute a substantial right as defined by R.C. 2505.02(A)(1). And a postsentence motion to waive the payment of court costs could be considered a summary application under R.C. 2505.02(B)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

With the law unclear at this point, it is premature for the en banc majority to make the blanket statement that there is no right to appeal the denial of a postsentence motion to waive the payment of court costs and then find prejudice on what is, at best, an uncertain legal conclusion. For the above reasons, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    Decision of the Merit Panel:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   KATHLEEN ANN KEOUGH, A.J.:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 33} On February 14, 2017, the applicant, Ronelle Taylor, pro se, pursuant to App.R. 26(B), applied to reopen this court's judgment in\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist.

Taylor now maintains that his appellate counsel should have argued (1) that trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress and (2) that the trial court improperly\n   imposed court costs. The state of Ohio filed its response on March 16, 2017. For the following reasons, this court denies the application in part and grants it in part, reinstates the appeal, reverses solely as to costs, and remands the case for a correct imposition of costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 34} In\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor,\n   </em>\n   Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-13-580285-A (\"Case I\") the grand jury indicted Taylor on four counts of drug trafficking, three counts of drug possession, and one count of possession of criminal tools. In\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor,\n   </em>\n   Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-14-591206-A (\"Case II\") the grand jury indicted Taylor on single counts of drug trafficking, drug possession, possession of criminal tools, and two counts of endangering children. In Case II on February 3, 2015, Taylor's attorneys filed a motion to suppress. Before the court ruled on that motion, Taylor pleaded guilty to the trafficking offense and to one count of endangering children. In Case I, Taylor pleaded guilty to two counts of drug trafficking and to possession of criminal tools. The trial judge sentenced Taylor in Case I to 12 months on each of the counts to be served concurrently and in Case II to seven years on the drug trafficking count and to time served on the endangering children charge. Further, the judge ordered the sentences in Case I and Case II to be served consecutively. Although the trial judge made the necessary findings for consecutive sentences during the sentencing hearing, those were not contained in the sentencing entries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Appellate counsel argued that the facts of the case did not support consecutive sentences and that the trial judge was biased against the defendant because she called him a monster. This court rejected those arguments, but noted that the sentencing entries did not include the required findings for imposing consecutive sentences. Thus, this court remanded the case for nunc pro tunc entries that included the necessary language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Now Taylor argues his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise on appeal (1) that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress and (2) the trial court's failure to impose court costs during the sentencing hearing, thus depriving him of the opportunity to contest the imposition of costs based on indigency. In order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, the applicant must demonstrate that counsel's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.
