A Superior Court judge ruled on summary judgment that the firm was entitled to the entirety of the disputed fee. After summary judgment entered, the firm sought an award of its attorney's fees and costs, arguing that Sbrogna's defense had been advanced in bad faith. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F. The same Superior Court judge denied the firm's \u00a7 6F motion, concluding that \"this Court cannot say that the legal position that Sbrogna took regarding the contingent fee was frivolous or advanced in bad faith.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Sbrogna appealed the summary judgment to a full panel of this court; we affirmed that judgment in an unpublished order.\n   <em>\n    Fletcher Tilton, P.C\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Sbrogna\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201105\">\n    91 Mass. App. Ct. 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\n   <em>\n    Sbrogna I\n   </em>\n   ). The firm appealed the judge's \u00a7 6F order to the single justice. After we released the\n   <em>\n    Sbrogna I\n   </em>\n   order, the single justice affirmed the Superior Court judge's \u00a7 6F order. In this appeal, we consider the single justice's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Despite the firm's attempt to reargue the underlying merits, our review of the single justice's order is \"of extremely limited scope.\"\n   <em>\n    Danger Records, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Berger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985747\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/444/1/#p11\">\n    444 Mass. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (2005). \"Thus, we review the single justice's order only for abuse of discretion or other error of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Fronk\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fowler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3668867\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/456/317/#p328\">\n    456 Mass. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (2010). The record before us demonstrates no such abuse or other error of law. To the contrary, we concur with both the Superior Court judge and the single justice that, as perhaps foreshadowed in\n   <em>\n    Sbrogna I\n   </em>\n   when we denied the firm's request for its appellate attorney's fees and costs, while Sbrogna's defenses were \"weak, we also do not find them so lacking in substance as to warrant\" imposition of \u00a7 6F sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Order of the single justice affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
