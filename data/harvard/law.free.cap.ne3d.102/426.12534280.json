We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to suppress\n   </em>\n   . The defendant argues first that the judge erred in partially denying his motion to suppress. He contends that (1) the arresting officer's order to get out of his truck (exit order) was unlawful because there was no reasonable fear for the officer's safety, and (2) all of the statements he made after he got out of his truck in response to the exit order should have been suppressed because, at that time, he was \"effectively arrested\" without receiving proper Miranda warnings. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The motion judge found that, at approximately 9:00 P.M. in the evening of September 7, 2013, Officer Nathan Ferbert of the Middleborough police department stopped the defendant for speeding. The judge found that the stop was justified, and the defendant does not challenge the stop itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Obiora\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3849903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/55/#p57\">\n    83 Mass.

The defendant indicated that he had just met up with someone 'behind the prison' and that before that, he had been at a party.\" The defendant denied that he had been drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Ferbert ordered the defendant to get out of the truck and then conducted a patfrisk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then placed the defendant in handcuffs, to await the arrival of a second officer. The defendant was not under arrest at that time, and Ferbert did not question him while he was in handcuffs. The second officer arrived on the scene within three or four minutes, and the officers then removed the handcuffs so that they could conduct field sobriety tests. Before he began, and in response to Ferbert's question, the defendant informed the officer that he had \"an old leg injury\" that might affect his ability to perform the tests. Nonetheless, he agreed to take the tests. Ferbert instructed the defendant on the performance of the nine-step walk and turn, and the one-legged stand. While he was performing the tests, the defendant also asked the officer some questions about the test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the motion to suppress hearing, the judge found that the defendant was, in fact, in custody while handcuffed, although not under arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge also concluded that Ferbert had reasonable \"ongoing safety concerns\" justifying temporarily placing the defendant in handcuffs to await the arrival of another officer to assist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress evidence, \" 'we accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error,' but 'independently review the judge's ultimate findings and conclusions of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/#p628\">\n    471 Mass. 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628 (2015), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tyree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3665125\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/455/676/#p682\">\n    455 Mass. 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (2010). Here, the defendant challenges specifically the judge's conclusion that Ferbert's safety concerns justified the exit order. This argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ferbert's safety concerns included the time and location of the stop (\"on an extremely dark, isolated, rural road\"); the officer's familiarity with the defendant's reputation with local police (for \"violence and drug involvement\"); and the fact that the officer was alone at the scene, at least initially. The judge found Ferbert's testimony on these issues \"entirely credible\" and \"objectively reasonable.\" We see no error.

We see no error in the judge's factual findings, or in denying the defendant's motion to suppress as it relates to the field sobriety tests and to the statements he made. See\n   <em>\n    Jewett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/#p628\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4320674\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/471/624/#p628\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The statements themselves fall into three groups. First are the defendant's answers to the officer's questions about where he was coming from and whether he had been drinking. At that point, \"either immediately before or immediately after\" the exit order, the defendant was not in custody. No Miranda warnings were required and the defendant does not contend otherwise; his argument for suppression of those statements rests solely on his contention that the exit order was unlawful and everything that followed was the fruit of that poisonous tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The second statement came in response to the officer's question about whether anything would prevent the defendant from taking field sobriety tests; the defendant responded that he had an old leg injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That statement was not incriminating; in fact, the defendant offered medical records to corroborate that claim as the only evidence in his case. Assuming, arguendo, that the defendant could reasonably be considered to have been in custody at that time, any error in refusing to suppress his statement about his leg injury clearly was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Cf.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hoyt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4273077\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/461/143/#p154\">\n    461 Mass. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154-155 (2011). The remaining statements were volunteered, and we agree with the motion judge's conclusion that the \"defendant's spontaneous statements in the course of taking the tests are obviously not subject to suppression on\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   grounds.\" See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3850030\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/83/772/#p776\">\n    83 Mass.

Here, Ferbert testified that, while parked and \"running radar\" at the intersection of Murdock and Summer Streets, he captured on radar the defendant driving a small red pickup truck while speeding past him. Ferbert also identified the defendant, the only passenger, as the driver of the truck. Operation was not a live issue at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ferbert further testified that Summer Street is a paved road (until the shoulder, where it meets grass) with a dividing line, located in a rural area where the police monitor traffic flow. The evidence, therefore, was sufficient for the jury to infer that the defendant was driving his truck on a public way. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cromwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"626888\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/56/436/#p438\">\n    56 Mass.

Ferbert used his flashlight to illuminate the ground while the defendant was performing the tests. There is no white fog line in this area of the road, but there is a clear delineation between the road and the grassy shoulder providing a straight line to follow. In performing the tests, the defendant exhibited two \"clues\" during the nine-step walk and turn, and three \"clues\" during the one-legged stand, indicating a failure of each of the tests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on these failure clues, Ferbert opined that the defendant was intoxicated.

During his first attempt at the one-legged stand (requiring the defendant to stand on one leg, with hands by his side, for thirty seconds), the defendant put his leg down after five seconds; on his second attempt, he raised his arms from his sides almost immediately after lifting his leg and fell backwards, bracing himself on his truck; the third attempt was much the same as the second, the defendant fell backwards a few seconds after lifting his leg.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
