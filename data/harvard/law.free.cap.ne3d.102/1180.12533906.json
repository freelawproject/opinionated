We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} This appeal stems from a refiled action wherein Betty Jackson sued the Akron Summit County Public Library (the \"Library\") for compensatory damages related to injuries she sustained after tripping and falling on concrete outside of the Highland Square Branch Library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} According to Ms. Jackson, she went to the Highland Square Branch Library to use the Internet for her job. At her deposition, Ms. Jackson testified that she entered the library without incident and did not observe any hazards. She then exited the library through the same set of doors that she used upon entering, indicating that nothing obstructed the view in front of her. After taking several steps, she fell onto the concrete. Ms. Jackson testified that she did not know the cause of her fall. There was no dispute, however, that concrete slabs near where Ms. Jackson fell had \"heaved,\" thereby creating a roughly one-inch \"ridge or lip\" between the slabs, and that the branch manager had submitted a work order prior to Ms. Jackson's fall indicating that the heaved concrete posed a potential tripping hazard. There was also no dispute that an orange cone was placed outside of the Highland Square Branch Library's entrance prior to Ms. Jackson's fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The Library moved for summary judgment, arguing that: (1) it was entitled to political-subdivision immunity under Revised Code Section 2744; (2) Ms. Jackson could not establish negligence because she could not identify the cause of her fall; (3) any height differential between the concrete slabs that Ms. Jackson allegedly tripped over constituted a trivial defect; and (4) any height differential between the concrete slabs that Ms. Jackson allegedly tripped over was an open-and-obvious hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In response, Ms. Jackson argued that: (1) the Library acted recklessly, wantonly, negligently, and willfully by not repairing the discrepancy in the concrete slab levels, by not warning patrons, and/or by not temporarily closing the Highland Square Branch Library while awaiting a repair; (2) other information that she became aware of subsequent to her deposition-including expert reports and surveillance video showing her fall-proved that the heaved concrete caused her fall\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (3) she was an invitee, not a licensee, for purposes of establishing the applicable duty of care; (4) the Library wrongfully caused and permitted the physical defect to remain in violation of Section 2744.02(B)(4); (5) no defenses to immunity under Section 2744.03 applied; and (6) the hazard was unlikely to be seen by someone entering the library because the raised \"ridge or lip\" faced the library and, upon exiting, the two sets of glass doors and the orange cone would have made it difficult for someone to see the raised concrete. Ms. Jackson also argued that a \"significant height difference\" existed between the concrete slabs, which created \"a hidden danger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court granted the Library's motion, holding that the height differential between the concrete slabs was \"observable[.]\" It, therefore, held that the Library did not owe Ms. Jackson a duty of care, and further held that no exception to political-subdivision immunity applied. Ms. Jackson now appeals, raising one assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   * * * THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY GRANTING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLEE'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In her assignment of error, Ms. Jackson argues that the trial court erred by granting summary judgment to the Library. Ms. Jackson makes several assertions in support of her position. To summarize, she asserts that: (1) the hazard was not a minor defect; (2) the orange cone placed outside of the library could have drawn someone's attention away from the hazard, as opposed to serving as a warning; (3) a dog that a library patron tethered to a bench outside would have been a distraction; (4) \"experience and survival genetics\" causes people to look forward while entering public doorways to prevent colliding with others, which is \"probably something that should be considered both as an attenuating circumstance and as part of the mental framework of a human being\"; (5) the Library had a duty to warn her of the hazard; (6) the height differential between the concrete slabs was not an open-and-obvious hazard; (7) attendant circumstances existed; (8) the trial court\n   improperly substituted the word \"[o]bservable\" for \"[o]pen and obvious\"; and (9) the library's two sets of glass automatic doors negatively impacted her ability to see the hazard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} This Court reviews a trial court's grant of summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

With respect to political-subdivision immunity, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   R.C. Chapter 2744 sets out the method of analysis, which can be viewed as involving three tiers, for determining a political subdivision's immunity from liability. First, R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) sets out a general rule that political subdivisions are not liable in damages. In setting out this rule, R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) classifies the functions of political subdivisions into governmental and proprietary functions and states that the general rule of immunity is not absolute, but is limited by the provisions of R.C. 2744.02(B), which details when a political subdivision is not immune. Thus, the relevant point of analysis (the second tier) then becomes whether any of the exceptions in R.C. 2744.02(B) apply. Furthermore, if any of R.C. 2744.02(B)'s exceptions are found to apply, a consideration of the application of R.C. 2744.03 becomes relevant, as the third tier of analysis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Greene Cty.
