Keith BEGUN.\n </parties>\n <docketnumber id=\"p-2\">\n  17-P-528\n </docketnumber>\n <court id=\"p-3\">\n  Appeals Court of Massachusetts.\n </court>\n <decisiondate id=\"p-4\">\n  Entered: February 2, 2018\n </decisiondate>\n <p id=\"p-5\">\n  <em>\n   MEMORANDUM AND ORDER PURSUANT TO RULE 1:\n  </em>\n  28\n </p>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-6\">\n   After a trial, a jury convicted the defendant of violating G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for submitting a falsified bill of sale to his employer, the town of Shirley, for reimbursement. On appeal, both the defendant and the Commonwealth agree that count 1 of the complaint was defective for failing to allege sufficient facts that would constitute a violation of G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1. To sustain a conviction under G. L. c. 267, \u00a7 1, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant \"with intent to injure or defraud, falsely ma[de], alter[ed], forge[d] or counterfeit[ed]\" one of the instruments enumerated therein.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Levin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3967417\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/11/482/#p493\">\n    11 Mass. App. Ct. 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 493 (1981). As the parties correctly note, a bill of sale is not one of the instruments named in the statute. Thus, due to this defect, the District Court had no jurisdiction over count 1 of the complaint.
