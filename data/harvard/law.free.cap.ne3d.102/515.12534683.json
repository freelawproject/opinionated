The issue before this court is whether a workers' compensation claimant who was injured while driving home after working a third shift installing cash registers at a retail store is barred from receiving benefits by the \"coming and going rule.\" For\n   the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the court below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On June 3, 2016, Marc Glassman, Inc. filed a Notice of Appeal from the March 7, 2016 Order and Decision of the Industrial Commission of Ohio allowing its employee, Brandon Green's, claim for benefits. According to the Commission's findings: \"The Injured Worker was driving home after working a third shift at 3:05 AM, [on June 9, 2015,] fell asleep at the wheel, and hit a large ditch going 55 miles per hour.\" The claim was allowed for laceration of the left foot and open fracture of the left calcaneus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On September 12, 2016, Green filed a Petition and Complaint on Appeal against Marc Glassman and the Administrator, Bureau of Workers' Compensation, praying that \"he be allowed to participate in the State Insurance Fund.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 13, 2016, the Administrator filed her Answer to the Complaint, praying that Green \"be found entitled to continue to participate, under the workers' compensation laws of Ohio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On November 7, 2016, Marc Glassman filed an Answer, demanding the dismissal of Green's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 5, 2017, Marc Glassman filed a Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On May 2, 2017, Green filed a Brief in Opposition. Attached to the Brief was Green's Affidavit attesting to the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. I have been employed by Marc Glassman, Inc. * * * since February 26, 2014.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4.

From April of 2015 to June of 2015, I helped install new cash registers at different Marc's stores for approximately seven work shifts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   8. On all days in which I was not installing new cash registers, I continued to work second and third shift at the Alliance Ohio store as a stocker for the remainder of my work week.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   10. On days where [sic] I was installing new cash registers, I would typically work third shift.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   11. On days where [sic] I was installing new cash registers at Marc's stores other than the Alliance Ohio store, Marc's would reimburse me for any and all mileage from driving to and from the different stores.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   12. On the night of June 8, 2015 and early morning of June 9, 2015, I worked at the Marc's store on Andrews Road in Mentor-on-the-Lake.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 10, 2017, Marc Glassman filed a Brief in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 23, 2017, the trial court granted Marc Glassman's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On July 20, 2017, Green filed a Notice of Appeal.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Green's employment with Marc Glassman demonstrated the determinative characteristics of a fixed-situs employee: he did not commence his employment\n   duties (installing cash registers) until he arrived at a specific and identifiable work place (a store) designated by Marc Glassman, albeit one that varied periodically. This has been the consistent conclusion reached by this and other courts as a matter of law in factually similar cases:\n   <em>\n    Ruckman\n   </em>\n   at 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20N.E.2d%20917\">\n    689 N.E.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (oil riggers were fixed-situs employees where the \"evidence demonstrates that the riggers here had no duties to perform away from the drilling sites to which they were assigned\"; \"[t]he riggers' workday began and ended at the drilling sites\"; and, \"although work at each drilling site had limited duration, it was a fixed work site within the meaning of the coming-and-going rule\");\n   <em>\n    Palette v.

Green maintains that he \"was required to travel long distances at very early morning hours.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For support, Green cites to the\n   <em>\n    Ruckman\n   </em>\n   decision where the Ohio Supreme Court found that the special hazard exception applied to oil riggers whose \"employment relationship dictates that the riggers undertake interstate and lengthy intrastate commutes, thereby significantly increasing their exposure to traffic risks associated with highway travel.\"\n   <em>\n    Ruckman\n   </em>\n   at 125,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20N.E.2d%20917\">\n    689 N.E.2d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Again, we disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Even construing the evidence most strongly in Green's favor, the risks created by the additional responsibility for installing cash registers were not distinctive in nature from or quantitatively greater than risks common to the public. In the present case, Green worked approximately seven work shifts installing cash registers over a two- to three-month period, a relatively infrequent occurrence. While these shifts were typically third shifts, Green's position as a stocker required him to work second and third shifts on days he was not installing cash registers. A ninety-minute commute may be longer than a typical commute, but does not create or constitute a risk that is particularly distinctive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Palette\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39 ;\n   <em>\n    Mackell v.
