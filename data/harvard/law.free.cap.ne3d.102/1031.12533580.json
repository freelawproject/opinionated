(Collaborative) filed a complaint in Superior Court, and moved \"to vacate arbitrator's award, to stay arbitration and for declaratory judgment.\" SEIU Local 509 (union) filed a cross motion to confirm the arbitrator's decision. A Superior Court judge allowed the union's motion and denied Collaborative's motion, and entered judgment accordingly, from which Collaborative now appeals. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   . At issue before us is an interpretation of the CBA and how it relates to conditional employees. The CBA states that an employee must work a \"conditional employment period of three consecutive years,\" during which the \"employee may be discharged, laid off, suspended or demoted without recourse by the employee or the Union under the grievance or arbitration procedures established by this Agreement\" (conditional employment provision). The CBA further contains a nondiscrimination provision, which states that neither party will \"discriminate against any employee in violation of any law on the basis of ... union activity.\" Finally, the CBA lays out a grievance procedure that provides that if either party disputes the application or interpretation of the CBA and the parties cannot reach an agreement, it may be submitted to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The grounds for this appeal began in June, 2014, when Collaborative opted not to renew the contract for a conditional employee (employee) who was nearing the end of her conditional employment period. The union subsequently filed a grievance on behalf of the employee, asserting that her termination was the result of her union activity and therefore violated the nondiscrimination provision of the CBA. Collaborative responded to that grievance by stating that neither the employee nor the union on the employee's behalf was entitled to file such a grievance because the employee was a conditional employee. In response, the union sought arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The substance of the grievance has never been addressed, as the parties agreed to bifurcate the arbitration and address first whether the grievance is even subject to arbitration. The arbitrator determined that the matter was arbitrable as the asserted discrimination directly related to the employee's termination, and that it was unreasonable to interpret the conditional employment provision as extending so far that no remedies would exist for unlawfully discriminatory terminations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While recognizing that the employee was a conditional employee under the CBA, the judge determined that the nondiscrimination provision applied to \"any employee\" and that the arbitrator's conclusion that the matter was subject to arbitration was a plausible interpretation of the CBA. Collaborative appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As the issue before us is a \"gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause,\" we review the judge's decision de novo.\n   <em>\n    Feeney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dell Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670878\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/454/192/#p198\">\n    454 Mass. 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198-199 (2009), quoting from\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Further, Collaborative suggests that the CBA, despite the fact that the nondiscrimination provision unambiguously applies to \"any employee,\" establishes its point so clearly that there is a \"positive assurance\" that the CBA's arbitration provision cannot be utilized by conditional employees alleging discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 838.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We consider the CBA \"in a reasonable and practical way, consistent with its language, background, and purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Sheriff of Suffolk County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834458\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/340/#p343\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834458\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/75/340/#p343\">\n    at 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Absent clearer language in the CBA to support Collaborative's interpretation of the contract, and keeping in mind that such a conclusion would leave a conditional employee with no recourse under the CBA in the event of a discriminatory termination, we disagree with Collaborative. Having reviewed the CBA, we cannot say with positive assurance that the contract is not susceptible of the interpretation advanced by the union: that the nondiscrimination provision protects all employees and is separate and distinct from the conditional employment provision. As such, the CBA could be appropriately read to subject the grieved action-that the employee was allegedly terminated as the result of her union activity-to the CBA's arbitration provision. See\n   <em>\n    Falmouth Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 838-840.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Judgment affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The arbitrator wrote as follows: \"It is fair to assume that if, during the bargaining for [the conditional employment provision], the Employer had said to the Union words to the effect of 'If you agree to our proposal, we will be able to terminate a conditional employee, with contractual impunity, on the grounds that this employee is gay or black or otherwise protected by the law, and you cannot grieve or arbitrate that termination,' the Union would not have knowingly signed on. It is important, therefore, to harmonize the two provisions so that both provisions are accorded their intended meaning.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Falmouth Police\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    at 835, the employee argued that his termination was not supported by just cause.
