App. Ct. 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 n.5 (2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On July 5, 2007, Wells Fargo Bank, as trustee of the ABFC 2005-Opti Trust (bank), conducted a nonjudicial foreclosure sale of the plaintiffs' property. In October, 2008, the bank filed an action in the Land Court seeking to quiet title to the property. The LaRaces did not initially appear in that action. On March 26, 2009, judgment entered against the bank, the Land Court having determined that the foreclosure sale was invalid. The bank sought to vacate the judgment. At this point, the LaRaces appeared in Land Court in opposition to that motion. The motion to vacate the judgment was denied, and the bank appealed. Meanwhile, on December 23, 2009, the LaRaces sent a G. L. c. 93A demand letter to American Home Mortgage Services, Inc. (the predecessor to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC) seeking damages for the wrongful foreclosure of their home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In an opinion dated January 7, 2011, the Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the Land Court judgment in\n   <em>\n    U.S. Natl. Bank Assn\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Ibanez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4269799\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/458/637/\">\n    458 Mass. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three years later, on January 6, 2014, the LaRaces commenced this action. The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the claims were time-barred. The Superior Court judge agreed. The judge determined that the limitations period began to run on March 26, 2009, the date the Land Court found that the foreclosure sale of the LaRaces' home was invalid. He rejected the argument by the LaRaces that they did not have \"definitive notice\" of the state of Massachusetts law until the Supreme Judicial Court issued its decision, noting that the appropriate standard for accrual of an action is when a party has knowledge they were injured, not when they have \"definitive notice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, he ruled that the three-year statute of limitations applicable to the plaintiff's tort claims of wrongful foreclosure and slander of title, see G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A, expired on March 26, 2012, and the four-year limitation period applicable to the c. 93A claim, see G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 5A, expired on March 26, 2013, both well before the commencement of this action on January 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"[A] cause of action accrues on the happening of an event likely to put the plaintiff on notice.\"\n   <em>\n    Flynn\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Associated Press\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877845\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/401/776/#p780\">\n    401 Mass. 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 780 (1988), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Hendrickson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sears\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292028\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/365/83/#p89\">\n    365 Mass. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89-90 (1982). \"The 'notice' required is not notice of every fact which must eventually be proved in support of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   ., quoting from\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peabody Constr.

The March 26, 2009, decision of the Land Court judge that the bank did not have the legal right to foreclose on their property put the LaRaces on notice that an injury had occurred.
