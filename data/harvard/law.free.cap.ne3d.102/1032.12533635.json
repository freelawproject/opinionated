A Superior Court judge dismissed the complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20754\">\n    365 Mass. 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which we accept as true. See\n   <em>\n    Goodwin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lee Pub. Schs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12457209\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/475/280/#p284\">\n    475 Mass. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (2016). On October 10, 2015, the plaintiff was denied his \"Medically approved\" \"diabetic Snack when he tried to obtain his meal.\" That same day he \"contacted the C/O [correction officer] who was assigned to cover the Inmate Dining Hall\" and \" '[J]eremy' the Nurse,\" asking \"about the Plaintiff not being able to receive [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] his diabetic snack in the A.M. as he always did in the Morning for three (3) Years.\" Although \"[t]he Nurse said he would look into the matter,\" the plaintiff did not receive a reply. The plaintiff then filed a grievance, which was denied \"as Non-Grievable\" by MPCH unit director Paul Caratozzola. The plaintiff appealed the denial to MPCH grievance coordinator Linda Farag. When Farag did not respond for several weeks, the plaintiff wrote a letter to MPCH nursing director Patty Davenport-Mello, asking \"for her assistance in the plaintiff receiving [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] a response to his filed Grievance.\" Several days later, the plaintiff received \"the appealed [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Grievance from ... Farag and ... Davenport-Mello['s] letter the Plaintiff wrote to her.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Were we to construe these allegations as challenging a one-time denial of the plaintiff's diabetic snack on October 10, 2015, we would agree with the judge that they do not \" 'plausibly suggest[ ]' ... an entitlement to relief\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Iannacchino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789079\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/623/#p636\">\n    451 Mass. 623\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (2008), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

To prove deliberate indifference, the plaintiff would have to show that the defendants' conduct constituted \"an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\" \"repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\"\n   <em>\n    Estelle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gamble\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7354\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/97/#p105\">\n    429 U.S. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 105-106 (1976).

The plaintiff would have no plausible claim that the defendants acted with culpability rising to this level if the basis of his complaint is that he was denied his diabetic snack on a single occasion on October 10, 2015, and the defendants denied his subsequent grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Even under the tightened pleading standards of\n   <em>\n    Iannacchino\n   </em>\n   , however, we must construe complaints liberally and in a manner that \"do[es] substantial justice.\" Mass.R.Civ.P. 8(f),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20Mass.%20749\">\n    365 Mass. 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974). Cf.\n   <em>\n    Cannonball Fund, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dutchess Capital Mgmt., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4163879\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/84/75/#p99\">\n    84 Mass. App. Ct. 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (2013). A liberal reading of this complaint permits an inference that the plaintiff is alleging that the officials charged with his medical care are depriving him of necessary treatment on an ongoing basis. Indeed, in their motion to dismiss, the defendants asserted that it was unclear from the complaint whether \"the diabetic snack was only denied on October 10, 2015, or if the alleged denial of this diabetic snack is ongoing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the defendants argued that, either way, the plaintiff cannot establish that his diabetic snack is a serious medical need, their argument does not apply the correct pleading standard. To withstand a motion to dismiss, a complaint \"does not need detailed factual allegations,\" but only allegations that \"raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"\n   <em>\n    Iannacchino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3789079\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/451/623/#p636\">\n    451 Mass. at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting from\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Contrary to the defendants' assertions, therefore, the plaintiff was not required to allege that he was \"medically diagnosed with diabetes\" or that \"a physician had previously prescribed him a diabetic snack.\" It was sufficient at the pleadings stage that he alleged that the diabetic snack was \"Medically approved.\" Thus, we conclude that the plaintiff has set forth sufficient allegations to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The claim under \u00a7 1985 stands on different footing, however. The complaint does not allege facts plausibly suggesting the existence of a conspiracy fueled by some \"class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.\"\n   <em>\n    Bray\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alexandria Women's Health Clinic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11925246\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/506/263/#p268\">\n    506 U.S. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (1993) (quotation omitted).\n   <em>\n    Knowlton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3655975\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1/#p12\">\n    704 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (1st Cir. 2013).
