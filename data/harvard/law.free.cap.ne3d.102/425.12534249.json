In January, 2015, the BHA proposed to terminate Griffin's housing subsidy based on three alleged violations of her Section 8 \"family obligations.\" Following a grievance hearing on June 15, 2015, a hearing officer authorized the termination on two grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On certiorari review, a Housing Court judge upheld the decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4. Because we conclude that substantial legal error adversely affected Griffin's material rights, we vacate the judgment. See\n   <em>\n    Figgs\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boston Hous. Authy\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308499\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/469/354/#p361\">\n    469 Mass. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 361-362 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   At an informal hearing, the hearing officer first determines, as a factual matter, whether the participant violated her \"family obligations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   If such a finding is made, as it was in this case, the hearing officer next determines whether a sanction short of termination is warranted. At this second step, the hearing officer is required to \"take into consideration all relevant circumstances and any mitigating circumstances presented by the Participant.\" BHA Section 8 Administrative Plan \u00a7 13.7.5(j). See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.552\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(i) (2017) ;\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lynn Hous.

Because due process protections attach to these proceedings, the participant is entitled to a written decision explaining the evaluation of the mitigation factors and findings of fact on \"all relevant circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20982.552\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 982.552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(i). See\n   <em>\n    Figgs\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boston Hous. Authy\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 356 n.3;\n   <em>\n    Wojcik\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lynn Hous.

App. Ct. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (2006). In this case, the hearing officer's decision did not comport with these principles of law for three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   First, the decision of the hearing officer established that he improperly conflated the two parts of the analysis. Griffin testified that she had no involvement in the armed robbery and no knowledge of the ammunition and rifle scope found in her apartment. As the fact finder, the hearing officer was entitled to reject Griffin's defense. See\n   <em>\n    Seales\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Boston Hous. Authy\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779703\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/88/643/#p646\">\n    88 Mass. App. Ct. 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (2015). However, once he found that she committed the violations, he should not have rejected all potentially mitigating factors from consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This sole focus on culpability was contrary not only to Massachusetts case law, but also to HUD policy. See\n   <em>\n    Boston Hous. Authy\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3817335\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/449/727/\">\n    449 Mass. 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 735-736 &amp; n.14 (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lynn Hous. Authy\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 638 n.20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Second, some of the hearing officer's reasoning shows that he placed an unfair burden of production on Griffin, a pro se litigant at the time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the hearing officer intended to find that future violations by Griffin\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   likely, that conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence in this record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Third, although the hearing officer summarized some of the mitigating circumstances, he improperly omitted from his decision any mention of relevant evidence provided by Griffin in support of her request for a lesser sanction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This constituted legal error. See\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lynn Hous. Authy\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 636.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The hearing officer had broad discretion to decide an appropriate remedy for what we agree were serious program violations. As a result of the absence of findings here, we cannot discern from the decision how, if at all, the hearing officer exercised his discretion with respect to all the relevant circumstances. See\n   <em>\n    Costa\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fall River Hous.

The hearing officer concluded that Griffin engaged in violent criminal activity and committed a serious or repeated violation of the lease.

A violation of any obligation may result in the termination of assistance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The hearing officer stated that the \"[f]ailure to uphold termination based on the mitigating circumstances in this case would be tantamount to accepting Tenant's defense without any evidence to support it and thereby find her wholly free of responsibility for what the reliable evidence shows occurred.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    In justifying his failure to mitigate the proposed termination, the hearing officer offered this vague statement: \"There [we]re no objective facts to rely on to show that future violations are unlikely to occur.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    As the hearing officer noted, Griffin testified that she had participated in the Section 8 program without incident for seven years. She further testified that this was the \"first time ever being in any ... type of trouble.\" There was no evidence of any trouble or other violations committed by Griffin before or after the alleged violations at issue in this litigation. It was also undisputed that Griffin's landlord has never sought to evict her. See\n    <em>\n     Lowell Hous.
