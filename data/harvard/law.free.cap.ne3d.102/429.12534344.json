He comes before this court for a fourth time, arguing that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial judge's instructions to the jury on the third prong of malice were erroneous and because counsel was ineffective. The motion judge denied the motion. Although we agree that the instructions were erroneous, we affirm nonetheless because we are persuaded that the error did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, nor was counsel ineffective. We also affirm the judge's implicit denial of the defendant's motion to reduce the verdict to involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural history\n   </em>\n   . The events leading to the victim's death in 1989 were recited in our 1995 decision affirming the defendant's conviction on direct appeal. See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Estep\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022577\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/502/#p503\">\n    38 Mass. App. Ct. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503-504 (1995). In that appeal, among other arguments, the defendant contended that the trial judge, in jury instructions defining third prong malice, improperly included language referring to \"grievous bodily harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022577\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/502/#p503\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022577\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/502/#p503\">\n    . at 507-508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The instructions are recited below, with emphasis added to highlight the language at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   At the beginning of his charge, the judge told the jury, \"[m]alice may be proven by evidence of any unexcused intent ... to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that either death\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   grievous harm will follow.\" Shortly thereafter, the judge gave a slightly different instruction, informing the jury that they could infer malice \"where a reasonable person under the circumstances known to the defendant would have known that, according to common human experience, ... there was a probability of causing grievous bodily harm\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a plain likelihood of death as a result of the defendant's act.\" He repeated the substance of the latter definition once more during that charge, but this time referred to a \"plain and strong likelihood\" of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The following day,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   after the jury requested \"a clarification of first degree murder, second degree murder and manslaughter,\" the judge instructed the jury several more times on third prong malice, again giving inconsistent definitions. First, he stated that malice is the intent \"to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that either death\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   grievous bodily harm would follow.\" However, he then indicated that malice \"may be inferred where a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances known to the defendant would have known that according to common experience there was a probability of causing grievous bodily harm\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a plain likelihood of death.\" Finally, he instructed the jury that malice requires conduct toward another \"which will probably do grievous bodily harm to that other\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   will create a plain and strong likelihood [of death].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The portions of the instructions which contained the disjunctive \"or,\" if followed, would have allowed the jury to return a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree upon proof that the defendant's conduct created a probability of causing only grievous bodily harm. As we will discuss in detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , these portions of the instructions incorrectly stated the law. On direct appeal, the defendant argued that these erroneous instructions, to which his counsel did not object at trial, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. This court rejected that argument at the time, reasoning that the instructions given \"were in accord with\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Delaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"480475\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/418/658/#p666\">\n    418 Mass. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 666 (1994), and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3897544\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/411/293/#p298\">\n    411 Mass. 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (1991).\"\n   <em>\n    Estep\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4022577\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/38/502/#p503\">\n    38 Mass.

In both cases, the court set aside guilty verdicts based on erroneous jury instructions on third prong malice. In so doing, the court made it clear that including \"or grievous bodily harm\" in a third prong malice instruction \"improperly permitted the jurors to infer malice on proof that the defendant committed an act that he knew (or should have known) would result in grievous bodily harm,\" when what is required instead is \"a plain and strong likelihood of death.\"\n   <em>\n    Vizcarrondo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310267\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/392/\">\n    427 Mass. at 395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As a threshold matter, the Commonwealth asserts that the defendant's claim is barred by the doctrine of direct estoppel, as the argument was raised and rejected in his direct appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276666\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/443/707/#p710\">\n    443 Mass. 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 710-711 (2005) (where issue was actually litigated and decided on direct appeal, and was essential to decision, direct estoppel barred relitigation of issue through motion for new trial). This is a fair argument. However, upon consideration, we are persuaded that we should address the issue even now, given the unusual appellate history of this case and other cases raising this same issue, combined with the fact that this court, in the direct appeal, did not have an opportunity to review all of the trial transcript, including the portion with the supplementary jury instructions at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Specifically, although this court upheld the challenged instruction in this case in 1995, and further appellate review was denied, the Supreme Judicial Court later stated, in\n   <em>\n    Azar\n   </em>\n   , that, despite the fact that \"some opinions of [that] court ... incorrectly included grievous bodily harm language in the description of the third prong of malice,\" \"the instructions were erroneous when given.\"\n   <em>\n    Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993894\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/675/\">\n    435 Mass. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   684 n.5.

He saw blood on her lip; he spoke to her but she did not respond; he did not realize she was dead. He spoke to a neighbor and an ambulance was called. When police and medical personnel responded to the scene at about 8:20 a.m., the victim was observed to have bruises around her eyes, face, neck, arms, hand, and thighs, and dried blood around her nose and mouth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Human blood stains were found in the kitchen (on a cabinet), and either a cabinet door or a wall; the hallway floor; and in the bedroom (on a comforter underneath the victim, a pillow case, two different walls, and a rug under the bed). Blood was also found on one of the victim's toes. No blood was found on the clothing the defendant was wearing at the time of the incident. The blood stains were not tested to determine their age or whether they matched the blood of the victim, the defendant, or someone else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The most severe injuries observed at the autopsy were six separate bruises on the victim's scalp, with blood pooling between the scalp and the top of the brain, indicating forceful blows to the head. Also, inside the neck there was bruising and hemorrhaging, indicating that force had been applied to the neck area close to the time of death. There were multiple abrasions and bruises on the front portion of the neck, and pinpoint hemorrhages in the small vessels of the victim's left eye, known as petechiae, which indicated trauma \"about the neck or going partially around the neck.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Based on this evidence, the principal theme of defense counsel's closing argument was that Tripp, the former boy friend, could have been responsible for the beating that caused the victim's death. Tripp had been seen in the neighborhood earlier, \"looking for a fight with anybody,\" and had been seen walking down the stairs from the victim's apartment early on the morning she died. Counsel acknowledged the defendant's admission that he had thrown the victim against a wall, but repeatedly stressed that if the defendant had beaten the victim severely enough to cause her death, there would have been blood on his clothes, yet there was none. Nor did it make sense that the defendant, if he had killed the victim, would have waited around until the next morning and called out to her to wake her up. The defendant was drunk and asleep, he argued, and so did not hear the fatal attack on the victim. Counsel further argued, with limited support from the testimony of Caine, that the prosecutor had unsuccessfully attempted to get Caine to change his account of the events, but that Caine's testimony as the jury heard it should be believed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, counsel urged the jury to find reasonable doubt, based on questions such as, \"Did Milton Tripp do it? ... If [the defendant] beat her up, where's the blood on him?\" Although counsel touched on other themes as well,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   nowhere did he suggest that the killer's conduct at most created some likelihood of bodily harm rather than a plain and strong likelihood of death. He did not argue that the killer acted without third prong malice and thus, at most, had committed manslaughter. Instead, his argument was that the defendant was not the killer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because the theory of the defense had nothing to do with distinctions between various levels of criminal intent, the erroneous third prong malice instruction created no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.
