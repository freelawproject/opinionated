This cause originated in the court of appeals and, therefore, should proceed as an appeal of right pursuant to S.Ct.Prac.R. 5.01. It appears, however, that the decision being appealed is a magistrate's decision. Therefore, it is ordered by the court, sua sponte, that appellant shall show cause within 14 days why the appeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
