We disagree. \"To establish probable cause to obtain a search warrant, the affidavit must 'contain enough information ... to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they may reasonably be expected to be located in the place to be searched.' \"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    O'Day\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1346372\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/440/296/#p300\">\n    440 Mass. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300 (2003), quoting from\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cefalo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"816129\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/381/319/#p328\">\n    381 Mass. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (1980).

The contours of each controlled sale through completion were observed by law enforcement officers. On each occasion, the confidential informant stated that the defendant was the seller, and turned over the drugs to the officers. To be sure, the affidavit does not state whether the defendant returned to his residence on any of these three occasions. It is also true that we cannot exclude the possibility that the defendant may also have stored drugs in the car he used to drive to the transactions, rather than in his house. But \"[n]o bright-line rule can establish whether there is a nexus between suspected drug dealing and a defendant's home,\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Escalera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4274117\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/462/636/#p643\">\n    462 Mass. 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 643 (2012), nor does the law require that every alternate possibility be excluded.
