If no statement has. been filed/ the company must be assessed in the .mode prescribed - by its charter, and cannot be assessed in any-other. manner.In 1873 no statement had been filed by .jthe;cQtnpany,,.and it-.was, therefore, subject to be taxed for its-real, estate, .including improvements thereon/and personal property., .and/ in the language of the-.charter, no other'tax or .impost; could be levied or .assessed upon it. The question in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>this ease will be solved by determining whether the clause \u25a0exempting the railroad company from further tax or imposts will operate as an immunity to the holders of its stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">This is not an open question in this state. The proviso in the charter under consideration is precisely like that of the Camden and Amboy Railroad Company, and the Morris and Essex Railroad. In <em>The State </em>v. Branin, 3 <em>Zab. </em>484, and in <em>The State </em>v. <em>Bentley, </em>3 <em>Zab. </em>532, the Supreme Court held that this language in a charter exempted the company from \u2022other than the specified burdens, and that its stock in the hands of its shareholders was included in the exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">But, independent of this consideration, the assessment for the value of its real estate, including improvements thereon, and its personal property, which would include all money-received from contribution to its capital stock, would be \u2022equivalent to an assessment upon its capital stock paid in, and its accumulated surplus, and would bring it within the \u25a0spirit and policy of the 15th section of the act of April 11th, 1866, <em>(Nix. Dig. </em>954,) which exempts the stockholders from assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In my opinion, the assessment against the prosecutors for this stock should be set aside, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Justices Woodiiull and Scudder concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
