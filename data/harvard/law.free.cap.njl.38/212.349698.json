Nothing but unavoidable inability to effect such delivery will afford an excuse, and empower the commissioners of appeal to entertain the application for a deduction.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b246-12\">On <em>certiorari </em>in matter of taxation.</summary>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b246-13\">Argued at June Term, 1875,</otherdate>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AtW\">before Justices Woodhtjle and Reed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-14\">For the prosecutor, P. <em>L.

Grey.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b247-5\">Reed, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aug\">Harrison Robbins did business in Philadelphia, but resided and was assessed in Merchantsville, Camden county, in the year 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">He owed $16,000 to parties residing in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">He failed to make, sign and deliver to the assessor the statement required by the twentieth section in the act of 1866.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">He applied to the commissioners of appeal for a reduction of said debts, upon the ground that the assessor never called upon him for a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">The evidence shows that the prosecutor was ignorant of the time of making the assessment; and that he expected the assessor to call upon him; and that the assessor never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">Nothing appears to invalidate the assessment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The personal examination of the prosecutor, by the assessor, was not essential to the legality of the assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">He had a right to employ a variety of ways to inform himself of the value of the taxable property. <em>The </em>State, Keeler, <em>pros., </em>v. <em>Tindall, Collector, </em>7 <em>Vroom </em>97.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">That he employed none of these means, is not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">It is, nevertheless, insisted, that the failure of the assessor to call upon the prosecutor, afforded a reason for relief from the commissioners of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">This can only be tenable upon the ground that this comes within the meaning of unavoidable accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">Such an idea cannot be entertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">The privilege of a reduction depended upon the act of the prosecutor. It was dependent upon the delivery of the statement. <em>State, Perkins, pros., </em>v. <em>Bishop, Collector, </em>5 <em>Vroom </em>45.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-18\">The burden was upon him to effect that delivery to the assessor, or by leaving it at his office, or at his residence, with a proper person.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-19\">Nothing but an unavoidable inability to accomplish such delivery would afford an excuse, and empower the commissioners of appeal to entertain the application for a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-20\">The assessment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
