The report of the commissioners, which was confirmed by the common council, assessed a portion of the entire expense of grading the roadway and sidewalks upon the lands of the prosecutors at the rate of thirty-seven cents per front foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">This uniting the assessment for the two kinds of work\u2014 the grading of the road bed and the grading of the sidewalks \u2014 annuls the entire assessment. There is no provision in the charter for assessing the expenses of grading the road bed, and making it a charge upon the abutting lands. The respective assessm\u00e9nt and expense of grading the two kinds of work cannot be separated, and the entire assessment must be set aside, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Application may, however, be made for re-assessment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
