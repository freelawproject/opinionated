Hudgins (appellant) appeals from his bench trial conviction for grand larceny from the person in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95(i). On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously ruled that his trial and conviction for grand larceny from the person did not violate double jeopardy principles in light of his previous acquittal on an indictment for robbery arising out of the same theft. Because appellant\u2019s acquittal on the robbery indictment acted as an acquittal on the lesser-included offense of petit larceny, we hold that the collateral estoppel protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the Commonwealth\u2019s subsequent attempt to convict appellant for the grand larceny of that same bicycle from the person of the victim. Thus, we reverse and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">On October 1, 2000, appellant pushed an eleven-year-old boy (the victim) from his bicycle and took the bicycle from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">On February 28, 2001, the grand jury issued an indictment charging that, \u201cOn or about Sunday, October 1, 2000,\u201d appellant \u201cdid rob [the victim] of U.S. Currency or other personal property, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-58.\u201d In a bench trial on March 16, 2001, appellant was tried on the robbery indictment and found not guilty. Before acquitting appellant of robbery, the trial court indicated its belief that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for larceny from the person but that it could not convict appellant of larceny from the person on an indictment for robbery because larceny from the person was not a lesser-included offense of robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">On March 26, 2001, the grand jury issued a different indictment alleging that \u201cOn or about Sunday, October 1, 2000,\u201d appellant \u201cdid steal property having a value of five dollars ($5) or more from the person of [the victim], in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Appellant moved to dismiss on grounds of former jeopardy. In a memorandum in support of that motion, he conceded the general principle that larceny from the person is not lesser included in the offense of robbery. However, he argued that the Commonwealth impermissibly relied on the same theft to support the second indictment that it had to support the first indictment, on which he was acquitted. The Commonwealth conceded in the trial court that \u201cthe \u2018same conduct\u2019 by [appellant] resulted in the two indictments, one for Robbery, and one for Grand Larceny from the Person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Relying on <em>Graves v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 161, 462 S.E.2d 902 (1995), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 262, 468 S.E.2d 710 (1996), the trial court denied the motion, holding that \u201cwhile the act alleged \u2014 the theft of a bicycle \u2014 may be the same, robbery and larceny from the person are not identical offenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>After hearing evidence on the grand larceny indictment, the trial court convicted appellant, and he noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Double jeopardy principles \u201cprotect[ ] against prosecution for the same offense after either an acquittal or a conviction of that offense and against multiple punishments for that same offense.\u201d <em>Coleman v.

United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932) (holding that to determine whether single act constitutes one offense or two, court must examine \u201cwhether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not\u201d); <em>see also Brown v.

[for] more than 50 years____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-7\">[T]he rule of collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality. Where a previous judgment of acquittal was based upon a general verdict, as is usually the case, this approach requires a court to \u201cexamine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational [trier of fact] could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d The inquiry \u201cmust be set in a practical frame and viewed with an eye to all the circumstances of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Sealfon v. United States, </em>332 U.S. 575, 579, 68 S.Ct. 237, 92 L.Ed. 180, 184. Any test more technically restrictive would, of course, amount to a rejection of the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings, at least in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>every case where the first judgment was based on a general verdict of acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-5\"><em>Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 443-44, 90 S.Ct. at 1194 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">On appeal, appellant contends that the offense of grand larceny from the person was lesser included in the offense of robbery under the facts of this case. Based on the holding in <em>Graves, </em>we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\"><em>Graves </em>involved a robbery indictment which \u201ccontained no allegation of the value of the property stolen and no allegation that the property was taken from [the victim\u2019s] person.\u201d 21 Va.App. at 164, 462 S.E.2d at 903. Under those circumstances, we held that \u201cthe [robbery] indictment, on its face, failed to specify an accusation of grand larceny from the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, we concluded, \u201cgrand larceny from the person was not a lesser offense included within the robbery specification of the indictment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 462 S.E.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">Although <em>Graves </em>involved the trial court\u2019s authority to convict the defendant for grand larceny from the person on an indictment charging robbery arising out the same facts, we believe its holding is equally applicable here. Here, as in <em>Graves, </em>the first indictment, the robbery indictment, \u201ccontained no allegation of the value of the property stolen and no allegation that the property was taken from [the victim\u2019s] person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 462 S.E.2d at 903. The second indictment, as required to charge grand larceny of the person, alleged that the value of the property stolen was five dollars or more and that the property was taken \u201cfrom the person of [the victim].\u201d Thus, here, as in <em>Graves, </em>the offense of grand larceny from the person was not lesser included in the offense of robbery. That appellant\u2019s case involved successive indictments while <em>Graves </em>involved a single indictment is not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Nevertheless, we conclude appellant\u2019s conviction for grand larceny from the person is barred by collateral estoppel. Although appellant did not denominate it as such at trial or on appeal, a careful review of his argument at both stages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>indicates Ms contention that the collateral estoppel component of the Double Jeopardy Clause barred his prosecution on the second indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">As outlined above, collateral estoppel applies both civilly and criminally to prevent relitigation, in a future lawsuit between the same parties, of \u201can issue of ultimate fact [that] has once been determined by a valid and final judgment.\u201d <em>Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 443, 90 S.Ct. at 1194. Collateral estoppel applies \u201cwhen the prior acquittal necessarily resolved the issue now in litigation.\u201d <em>Simon v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 412, 418, 258 S.E.2d 567, 571 (1979). \u201cThe doctrine ... does not apply if it appears that the prior judgment could have been grounded \u2018upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1108, 1111, 254 S.E.2d 126, 127 (1979) (quoting <em>Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194). \u201cThe party seeking the protection of collateral estoppel carries the burden of showing that the verdict in the prior action necessarily decided the precise issue he now seeks to preclude.\u201d <em>Rogers v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 337, 341, 362 S.E.2d 752, 754 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Here, the evidence established that appellant previously had been acquitted of robbery of the victim\u2019s bicycle, and the Commonwealth conceded that the subsequent indictment for grand larceny from the person was based on appellant\u2019s alleged theft of the same bicycle from the same victim on the same occasion as charged in the first indictment. Under the indictment charging appellant with robbery, he was subject to conviction not only for that robbery but also for any lesser offenses necessarily included in it, ineludmg petit larceny of the same bicycle. <em>See, e.g., Harrell v. Commonwealth, </em>11 Va.App. 1, 6, 396 S.E.2d 680, 682 (1990). Appellant\u2019s acquittal on the robbery charge in Ms circmt court bench trial, the only charge arising out of this incident then pending against him, constituted an acquittal for petit larceny of that bicycle. <em>See Myers v. Commonwealth, </em>148 Va. 725, 729-30, 138 S.E. 483, 484 (1927) (stating principle that acqmttal of greater offense constitutes acquittal of all lesser offenses and bars subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>prosecution of those lesser offenses). Under the facts of this case, appellant\u2019s acquittal, as a matter of law, operated as a finding that appellant did not commit petit larceny of the victim\u2019s bicycle. Appellant met his \u201cburden of showing that the verdict in the prior action necessarily decided the precise issue he now seeks to preclude,\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>5 Va.App. at 341, 362 S.E.2d at 754, and the Commonwealth and the court were bound by this finding in the second proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The trial court\u2019s statement in the first proceeding that it believed the evidence was insufficient to prove robbery but sufficient to prove larceny from the person does not support a different result. The trial court\u2019s apparent belief that the evidence was sufficient to prove petit larceny is insufficient to contravene its acquittal of appellant for petit larceny, by operation of law, as a lesser-included offense of the robbery for which appellant was acquitted. <em>Myers, </em>148 Va. at 729-30, 138 S.E. at 484; <em>see McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 30, 35, 480 S.E.2d 126, 128 (1997) (holding that \u201c[a] court speaks through its orders and those orders are presumed to accurately reflect what transpired\u201d); <em>see also Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 280-81, 257 S.E.2d 808, 822 (1979) (noting that .presumption ordinarily applies where order conflicts with transcript of related proceedings). When the trial court voiced its opinion that the evidence was insufficient to prove robbery but sufficient to prove larceny from the person, the Commonwealth should have asked the court to convict appellant of petit larceny in order to avoid the issue preclusion which bars appellant\u2019s conviction on the second indictment. <em>See Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 736, 743, 273 S.E.2d 784, 789 (1981) (citing <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), for the proposition that \u201ca defendant is acquitted for double jeopardy purposes where the ruling of the trial judge represents a resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offenses charged\u201d). To hold otherwise would contravene the core protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Finally, we conclude our holding in <em>Ramadan v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 708, 508 S.E.2d 357 (1998), also does not require a different result. <em>Ramadan </em>involved a district court proceeding in which the court acquitted the defendant of reckless driving and simultaneously certified to the grand jury a charge of feloniously driving a motor vehicle after having been adjudicated an habitual offender. <em>Id. </em>at 712, 508 S.E.2d at 359. Both acts arose out of the same conduct. <em>Id. </em>The felony charge required proof of \u201c \u2018driving of itself which \u2018endangers the life, limb, or property of another,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 713, 508 S.E.2d at 359 (quoting Code \u00a7 46.2-357(B)(2)), an act of driving which we noted was defined by \u201c \u2018language virtually identical\u2019 \u201d to the language defining the reckless driving offense dismissed by the district court, <em>id. </em>at 713 &amp; n. 2, 359-60 &amp; n. 2 (quoting <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 206, 211, 455 S.E.2d 765, 767 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Although we noted in <em>Ramadan </em>that \u201c[a]n acquittal, \u2018standing alone, does not permit a conclusion with respect\u2019 to a court\u2019s findings or rationale,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 714, 508 S.E.2d at 360 (quoting <em>Copeland v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 450, 453, 412 S.E.2d 468, 470 (1991)), we did so in the context of courts not of record, noting \u201c[gjeneral \u2018district courts frequently[, as here,] mark misdemeanor warrants, \u201cdismissed\u201d without assigning specific grounds,\u2019 acting, \u2018sometimes ... not upon an adjudication of substantive issues, but upon some technical procedural defect or, indeed, upon nothing more than considerations of leniency,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Lee, </em>219 Va. at 1111, 254 S.E.2d at 128). We noted as an additional example the case of <em>Clodfelter v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 98, 107-08, 235 S.E.2d 340, 345-46 (1977), in which the Court held the district court may have dismissed the misdemeanor on the belief that it was \u201csubsumed in the ... felony charge ... certified to the grand jury.\u201d <em>Ramadan, </em>28 Va.App. at 714, 508 S.E.2d at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Thus, <em>Ramadan </em>involved the preclusive effect of a district court\u2019s misdemeanor acquittal on a related felony charge simultaneously certified by that court to the grand jury. Under those circumstances, we declined the defendant\u2019s invitation to hold the acquittal of the misdemeanor on unspecified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>grounds compelled a finding that the evidence was insufficient to prove the certified felony offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">In appellant\u2019s case, by contrast, the challenged proceedings were successive rather than concurrent and involved circuit court rather than district court proceedings. The trial court\u2019s acquittal of appellant in the first proceeding stood alone and constituted an acquittal of appellant for petit larceny as a matter of law. Although the basis for a court\u2019s decision is often hard to prove for the purpose of invoking collateral estoppel in a criminal trial, the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Ashe </em>that a test which is too \u201ctechnically restrictive would, of course, simply amount to a rejection of the rule of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings, at least in every case where the first judgment was based on a general verdict of acquittal.\u201d <em>Ashe, </em>397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">For these reasons, we hold that the Commonwealth was collaterally estopped from attempting to prove in appellant\u2019s second prosecution the underlying petit larceny for which he was acquitted in the first prosecution. Thus, the trial court erroneously denied his motion to dismiss and erroneously convicted him of grand larceny from the person. Accordingly, we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b51-8\">BENTON, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">I join in the majority opinion. I write separately merely to add my view that the existence of successive indictments is also a significant fact in the double jeopardy analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">In the first trial, Tarik H. Hudgins was tried for robbery and acquitted after the presentation of evidence. The second indictment, which charged a larceny arising from the same incident, brought into focus traditional concerns about the protections afforded by the guarantees of the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">\u201cThe development of the Double Jeopardy Clause from its common-law origins ... suggests that it was directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions.... \u201d Thus ... the \u201ccontrol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ling constitutional principle\u201d focuses on prohibitions against multiple trials. At the heart of this policy is the concern that permitting the sovereign freely to subject the citizen to a second trial for the same offense would arm Government with a potent instrument of oppression. The Clause, therefore, guarantees that the State shall not be permitted to make repeated attempts to convict the accused, \u201cthereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d \u201c[SJociety\u2019s awareness of the heavy personal strain which a criminal trial represents for the individual defendant is manifested in the willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., </em>430 U.S. 564, 568-69, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The record establishes that on February 28, 2001, a grand jury indicted Hudgins for robbing \u201cBrinkley [on October 1, 2000] of ... currency or other personal property.\u201d A judge tried Hudgins on that charge and acquitted him on March 16, 2001. Ten days later, the grand jury returned another indictment alleging that on \u201cOctober 1, 2000, [Hudgins] did steal property having a value of five dollars ... or more from the person of ... Brinkley.\u201d Over Hudgins\u2019s objection, the same judge tried this second indictment and convicted him of this larceny offense. At this second trial, the judge found and the prosecutor agreed that the property at issue in both indictments was the same bicycle. Indeed, the Commonwealth on appeal concedes this to be the case. Hudgins contends, as he did at trial, that the prosecution under this second indictment violates constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u201cIt is well established that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the retrial of a defendant who has been <em>acquitted </em>of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Bullington v. Missouri, </em>451 U.S. 430, 437, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 1857, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>An acquittal is accorded special weight. \u201cThe constitutional protection against double jeopardy unequivocally prohibits a second trial following an acquittal,\u201d for the \u201cpublic interest in the finality of criminal judgments is so strong that an acquitted defendant may not be retried even though \u2018the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u2019 If the innocence of the accused has been confirmed by a final judgment, the Constitution conclusively presumes that a second trial would be unfair.\u201d <em>The law \u201cattaches particular significance to an acquittal.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><em>United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 129, 101 S.Ct. 426, 433, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980) (emphasis added, citations omitted). Put simply, \u201cthe Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy ... surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to \u2018run the gantlet\u2019 a second time.\u201d <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 445, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 1195, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">When Hudgins was first tried and acquitted on March 16, 2001 of the charge of robbery involving the bicycle, that proceeding acted as an acquittal also of the lesser-included offense of larceny of the bicycle. \u201cThe greater offense is ... by definition \u2018the same\u2019 for purposes of double jeopardy as any lesser offense included in it.\u201d <em>Brown v.

Thus, just as an acquittal on a lesser-included offense bars a subsequent prosecution on the greater offense, an acquittal on a greater offense bars a subsequent prosecution on the lesser-included offense. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he sequence is immaterial____Whatever the sequence may be, the Fifth Amendment forbids successive prosecution ... for a greater and lesser included offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168-69, 97 S.Ct. at 2227. In other words, whenever a prosecutor can request a lesser-included instruction, a blanket acquittal is an implicit acquittal on each lesser included offense; and a later trial on any lesser-included charge would put the accused twice in jeopardy for the offense. These principles are well established. <em>See Grafton v. United States, </em>206 U.S. 333, 351, 27 S.Ct. 749, 753, 51 L.Ed. 1084 (1907).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>The indictment the grand jury issued on March 26, 2001, ten days after Hudgins was acquitted of robbery, charged a larceny of the same bicycle that was involved in the robbery charge. When the trial judge acquitted Hudgins after trial on March 16, 2001 of the robbery charge, he did not convict Hudgins of the lesser offense of larceny. We do not know whether the prosecutor sought a larceny conviction in the first trial or, instead, decided to forego that option and to seek a second indictment, believing that <em>Graves v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 161, 462 S.E.2d 902 (1995), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 262, 468 S.E.2d 710 (1996), would permit that action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Whatever the prosecutor\u2019s intention, the acquittal at the first trial necessarily acted as an acquittal of the larceny.

Thus, the Commonwealth could not relitigate the ultimate facts resolved in the first trial in Hudgins\u2019s favor by the acquittal for robbery and necessarily for the larceny of the bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Unlike in <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 240 S.E.2d 658 (1978), Hudgins alleges that the two indictments charged offenses involving a taking of the identical object. <em>Cf. </em>218 Va. at 759, 240 S.E.2d at 660 (noting that the \u201c[djefendant does not contend that the two crimes of which he was convicted are identical offenses\u201d). He contends that the same property was the subject of each indictment and that the same offense was the subject of both indictments. The Commonwealth agrees that the taking alleged in both indictments involved the same bicycle. This is precisely the circumstance that the constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy forbid.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">A verdict of acquittal on the issue of guilt or innocence is, of course, absolutely final....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">\u201cThe underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-8\"><em>Bullington, </em>451 U.S. at 445, 101 S.Ct. at 1861.

The Commonwealth could not later prosecute him for larceny, whether grand or petit, of the same bicycle after he was acquitted of the petit larceny in the first trial. \u201cThe Double Jeopardy Clause is not such a fragile guarantee that prosecutors can avoid its limitations by the simple expedient of dividing a single crime into a series of temporal or spatial units.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>432 U.S. at 169, 97 S.Ct. at 2227. Indeed, the policy behind the Double Jeopardy Clause \u201cprotects the accused from attempts to relitigate the facts underlying a prior acquittal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 97 S.Ct. at 2225.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Accordingly, I join in the majority opinion and would reverse the conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b54-5\">. In <em>Graves, </em>a trial judge \"struck the evidence as to [the] robbery ... [indictment, and ruled] that grand larceny from the person is a lesser offense included within a charge of robbery and permitted the case to go forward on a charge of grand larceny from the person.\u201d 21 Va.App. at 163, 462 S.E.2d at 903. We reversed the conviction for grand larceny from the person and held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-6\">Because the [robbery] indictment against Graves did not set forth allegations of value or of theft from the person, it did not charge grand larceny from the person. Therefore, grand larceny from the person was not a lesser offense included within the robbery specification of the indictment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 166, 462 S.E.2d at 904. <em>Graves </em>was not a double jeopardy case.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">In deciding <em>Graves, </em>we merely found <em>\u201cguidance </em>in <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 240 S.E.2d 658 (1978).\u201d 21 Va.App. at 165, 462 S.E.2d at 904 (emphasis added). The defendant in <em>Jones </em>was \"convicted] of grand larceny of an automobile following his conviction of robbery involving larceny of money.\u201d 218 Va. at 758, 240 S.E.2d at 659. Although the defendant in <em>Jones, </em>unlike in <em>Graves, </em>contended that his conviction for larceny was barred by the principle of double jeopardy, he did \"not contend that the two crimes of which he was convicted [were] identical offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759, 240 S.E.2d at 660. Indeed, the defendant \"contend[ed] that the theft of the money underpaid] the robbery conviction and the theft of the car underpaid] the grand larceny conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 760, 240 S.E.2d at 661. Thus, the Supreme Court noted that \"grand larceny of the car was not charged in the robbery indictment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 760, 240 S.E.2d at 660-61, and noted further that \"the two thefts involved two separate and distinct acts of caption and two different acts of asportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761, 240 S.E.2d at 661. Significantly, the Supreme Court held that because \"theft is an essential component of robbery and charged as such in every robbery indictment ..., a robbery indictment includes all elements of whatever larceny offense it charges, whether grand or petit, and the larceny offense charged is, therefore, lesser-included in robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 759-60, 240 S.E.2d at 660. Clearly, Hudgins's case arises in a different posture than <em>Graves </em>and raises a related but different issue than <em>Jones.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b57-6\">COLEMAN, Senior Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ah\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The majority holds appellant\u2019s previous acquittal on a robbery indictment was effectually an acquittal of the lesser-included offense of petit larceny. Therefore, the majority reasons, because the acquittal necessarily found him not guilty of petit larceny, the collateral estoppel protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the subsequent attempt to convict him for grand larceny from the person of the same property. I, too, believe the subsequent prosecution was barred by double jeopardy protectives. However, in my opinion, appellant\u2019s conviction for grand larceny from the person should be reversed because that crime is a lesser-included offense of the robbery charge for which he was acquitted in the prior trial and would be barred under a <em>Blockburger </em>analysis and not on the basis of collateral estoppel. See my dissenting opinion in <em>Graves v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 161, 167, 462 S.E.2d 902, 905 (1995), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>22 Va.App. 262, 468 S.E.2d 710 (1996). Nevertheless, I am bound by the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, see Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 174, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990), and I believe that the majority opinion in <em>Graves </em>allows the appellant to be subsequently tried for an offense which is not lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>as part of the charged offense. Therefore, I vote to affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The majority\u2019s reliance on a collateral estoppel analysis is, in my opinion, misplaced. Collateral estoppel, in the context of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is a doctrine of fact preclusion. <em>See Simon v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 412, 415, 258 S.E.2d 567, 569 (1979). The doctrine precludes the government in a second proceeding from proving a fact that it was necessarily required to prove in the prior proceeding but failed to prove, or from disproving a fact that was necessarily proved in the prior proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 416, 258 S.E.2d at 570 (\u201c[I]n a subsequent prosecution for an offense arising out of the same transaction, collateral estoppel bars a state\u2019s relitigation of facts that have been decided in the defendant\u2019s favor in the prior trial.... \u201d). Although the majority asserts that appellant\u2019s acquittal on the robbery charge necessarily operated as a factual finding that appellant did not commit petit larceny (which they acknowledge is a lesser-included offense of robbery), the trial court specifically found only that the evidence failed to establish the element of force necessary for robbery. \u201c[I]n order to <em>bar a subsequent prosecution </em>for a different offense arising out of the same transaction, a necessary element of the offense in the second trial must have been clearly adjudicated in the earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 415, 258 S.E.2d at 570. In the prior robbery proceeding, the trial court made no factual finding nor did the general acquittal necessarily make a factual finding that would preclude the Commonwealth from proving the facts essential to establish the elements of grand larceny from the person. Thus, I reject the majority\u2019s collateral estoppel analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Were it not for our holding in <em>Graves </em>that grand larceny from the person is not a lesser-included offense of robbery, I would hold here that the second prosecution of Hudgins was barred by the robbery acquittal under a <em>Blockburger </em>analysis. I continue to believe that larceny from the person is a lesser-included offense of robbery, and I find widespread support for my view from the many jurisdictions that have considered the issue. <em>See, e.g., Ramsey v. State, </em>441 So.2d 1065, 1067 (Ala.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Crim.App.1983) (\u201c \u2018[R]obbery [is] ... composed of the crime of larceny from the person with the aggravation of force, actual or constructive, used in the taking.\u2019 \u201d (quoting 67 Am.Jur.2d <em>Robbery </em>\u00a7 7 (1973))); <em>People v. Patton, </em>76 Ill.2d 45, 27 Ill.Dec. 766, 389 N.E.2d 1174, 1176 (1979) (\u201cIn distinguishing between private stealing from the person of another and robbery, ... \u2018where it appeared that the article was taken without any sensible or material violence to the person ... rather by sleight of hand and adroitness than by open violence, and without any struggle on his part, \u2014 it is merely larceny from the person.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Hall v. People, </em>171 Ill. 540, 542-43, 49 N.E. 495 (Ill.1898))); <em>State v.

Varney, </em>690 S.W.2d 758, 759 (Ky.1985) (\u201c \u2018Robbery is a combination of two other crimes (theft and assault) and has been typically defined as \u201clarceny from the person by violence or intimidation.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (quoting Commentary to Kansas Penal Code, \u201cKRS Chapter 515, Robbery\u201d)); <em>Commonwealth v.

Pickard, </em>143 N.C.App. 485, 547 S.E.2d 102, 106 (2001) (\u201cLarceny from the person has been consistently recognized as a lesser included offense of common law robbery.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>531 S.W.2d 558, 559 (Tenn.1975) (holding accused was entitled to instruction on larceny from the person as a lesser-included offense of robbery); <em>Moore v.

It follows from <em>Graves </em>therefore, that from a <em>Blockburger </em>double jeopardy analysis, appellant\u2019s robbery acquittal did not bar a subsequent prosecution of him for grand larceny from the person. \u201cIt is the identity of the offense, <em>and not the act, </em>which is referred to in the constitutional guaranty against double jeopardy.\u201d <em>Epps v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 150, 153-54, 216 S.E.2d 64, 67 (1975) (emphasis added). Thus, because we found in <em>Graves </em>that grand larceny from the person is a separate offense from robbery and not lesser included, I believe we must now hold that the trial court did not err by allowing the subsequent prosecution for larceny from the person following Hudgins\u2019 robbery acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">While I am constrained by <em>Graves </em>to vote to affirm this conviction, this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>would not be so limited. In my view justice would be served by holding that double jeopardy guarantees bar Hudgins\u2019 conviction for larceny from the person after he was acquitted of robbery, but in light of the <em>Graves </em>decision, I must vote to affirm the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
