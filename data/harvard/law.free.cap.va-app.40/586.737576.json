Appellant admits that, while sitting in the passenger seat of a vehicle, he forcibly took control of the steering wheel from the driver and caused the vehicle to go off the road and into a guardrail. This momentary exercise of control, he argues, falls outside the scope of the DUI and habitual offender statutes as a matter of law. We disagree and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">On appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Morrisette v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 386, 389, 569 S.E.2d 47, 50 (2002). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 522, 528, 574 S.E.2d 756, 758-59 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted); <em>see also Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">After attending a funeral on September 28, 2001, appellant and several of his family members visited the home of Marlena Baker, his sister, in Petersburg. Around 10:00 p.m. that evening, appellant and two of his brothers borrowed a car belonging to another of his sisters, Pamela Dugger. Though the men were to return shortly after getting gas for Pamela\u2019s car, they did not arrive back at the house until 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. the following morning. The men had been drinking and appellant, a passenger in the car, was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\u201cVery angry\u201d with her brothers, Pamela and appellant were still arguing about the incident when they began the drive back to Richmond in Pamela\u2019s car at 3:00 a.m. Pamela was behind the wheel, with appellant in the right front passenger seat. As the two drove north along Interstate 95, the argument \u201cheated up.\u201d Appellant got \u201creal excited\u201d and \u201cgrabbed the wheel\u201d of the car. Pamela\u2019s first thought was that her brother was \u201ctrying to harm us.\u201d Appellant, steering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the passenger seat, caused the car to veer off the interstate and into a guardrail.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Virginia State Trooper Bruce Thomas arrived at the scene about five minutes later. Thomas initially questioned Pamela, who reported that her brother caused the accident. Thomas then approached appellant, who was handcuffed and seated in a police car, cursing loudly. Appellant\u2019s \u201ceyes were glassy\u201d and a \u201cstrong odor of alcohol\u201d surrounded him. He admitted that \u201che\u2019d been drinking for hours\u201d and was \u201cdrunk.\u201d A breath test later revealed his blood alcohol level to be .15%, almost twice the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Appellant initially explained to Trooper Thomas that he had been \u201cfighting\u201d with his sister and had \u201cgrabbed the wheel and caused her to wreck.\u201d As the night progressed, however, appellant\u2019s version of the events changed. He later told Thomas that, as a mere \u201cpassenger in a car,\u201d he did nothing to \u201ccause the accident.\u201d Appellant also said, at one point, that he had been \u201cwaving his finger in her face\u201d and may have accidentally \u201chit her hand on the wheel.\u201d Finally, before the magistrate, appellant claimed to be \u201cin the back seat asleep at the time of the accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">At trial, appellant offered yet another version of what happened: He took over the steering wheel to avoid an imminent collision with a tractor-trailer truck that his sister had not noticed. Appellant conceded that he had not given this explanation to Trooper Thomas, but claimed he chose not to do so because the officer treated him like a \u201ccriminal\u201d and failed to show him proper \u201crespect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">At trial, Pamela attempted to corroborate in part her brother\u2019s latest version. She admitted, however, that she had seen several trucks that night, but not the one her brother claimed he saw just before taking over the steering wheel. She also said she may have been \u201cswerving\u201d in and out of her lane prior to the incident, implying that this justified her brother\u2019s intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Without objection, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence a prior DUI conviction, two habitual offender adjudica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>tion orders, a misdemeanor conviction for driving in violation of the habitual offender orders, and two convictions for driving on a suspended license.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">At the close of the case in chief and again after the presentation of all the evidence, appellant moved to strike on the ground that he had not operated the vehicle within the meaning of the DUI and habitual offender statutes. The trial court took both motions under advisement, noting that the evidence showed appellant had seized the steering wheel and had thereby directed the \u201cmode of progress of the vehicle, if you will, by his actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both charges. The jury recommended a thirty-day sentence for the DUI (second or subsequent offense) and a one-year sentence for the habitual offender conviction. Appellant moved the trial court to set aside the verdicts, which the court also took under advisement. At a later sentencing hearing, the trial court denied the motion to set aside the verdicts, imposed the thirty-day DUI sentence, and suspended the one-year prison term on the habitual offender conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Appellant argues that his momentary, but deliberate, assertion of physical control over his sister\u2019s vehicle does not fall within the scope of the DUI and habitual offender statutes as a matter of law. We disagree, finding that the trial court correctly determined the issue to be one of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">The DUI statute makes it \u201cunlawful for any person to drive or operate\u201d a vehicle while intoxicated. Code \u00a7 18.2-266. The habitual offender statute makes it \u201cunlawful for any person determined or adjudicated an habitual offender to drive any motor vehicle\u201d while his license remains revoked. Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Code \u00a7 46.2-100 defines the terms operator and driver to include \u201cevery person\u201d who \u201cdrives or is in actual physical control\u201d of a vehicle. This statutory definition applies to the habitual offender statute. <em>Rosenbaum v. Commonwealth, </em>12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Va.App. 61, 63, 402 S.E.2d 498, 499-500 (1991). And, while not controlling, <em>Reynolds v. City of Virginia Beach, </em>31 Va.App. 629, 631, 525 S.E.2d 65, 66 (2000), Code \u00a7 46.2-100\u2019s statutory definition serves as a valuable interpretative guide to the DUI statute, <em>Stevenson v. City of Falls Church, </em>243 Va. 434, 437, 416 S.E.2d 435, 437 (1992) (relying on former Code \u00a7 46.1-1(17), predecessor of Code \u00a7 46.2-100, for interpreting DUI statute); <em>Leake v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 101, 108, 497 S.E.2d 522, 526 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Under this standard, for example, we have held that operating a vehicle does not necessarily require \u201cmoving the vehicle from one place to another.\u201d <em>Keesee v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 263, 268, 527 S.E.2d 473, 476 (2000) (driver behind wheel, key in ignition, engine not running, but vehicle in gear and one taillight illuminated). Nor does it mean the vehicle\u2019s engine must be running. <em>Propst v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 791, 794-95, 485 S.E.2d 657, 659 (1997) (sitting behind the steering wheel of vehicle stopped in an intersection, with keys in the ignition, headlights on, but engine off constituted \u201coperating\u201d); <em>see also Leake, </em>27 Va.App. at 108, 497 S.E.2d at 526 (\u201coperating\u201d found when driver was standing on the road, but leaning into parked, running car).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">We have never addressed whether a passenger who forcibly seizes control of the steering wheel of a moving vehicle exercises sufficient control to fall within the scope of the DUI and habitual offender statutes as a matter of law. To answer this question, we begin with the premise that a statute should be construed \u201cto promote the end for which it was enacted, if such an interpretation can reasonably be made from the language used.\u201d <em>Alger v. Commonwealth, </em>40 Va.App. 89, 93, 578 S.E.2d 51, 53 (2003) (quoting <em>Mayhew v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 484, 489, 458 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThus, a statute should be read to give reasonable effect to the words used and to promote the ability of the enactment to remedy the mischief at which it is directed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>While we will strictly construe a penal statute to resolve any \u201cambiguity or reasonable doubt as to its meaning\u201d in the accused\u2019s favor, that does not mean the accused \u201cis entitled to a favorable result based upon an unreasonably restrictive interpretation of the statute.\u201d <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 761, 250 S.E.2d 760, 761 (1979) (citations omitted); <em>see also Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 144 (2002); <em>McCray v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 202, 204, 556 S.E.2d 50, 51 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Guided by these interpretative principles, the mischief addressed by the DUI statute is the risk of harm posed by vehicles under the control of intoxicated individuals. Whether that risk comes from an inebriated passenger (who forcibly takes control of the steering wheel) or from a drunk driver should not matter. The brevity of actual control likewise does not place the risk of harm outside the intended scope of the statute. <em>See In re Queen T., </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1143, 1144-45, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 922, 923 (1993) (a passenger \u201csteering a vehicle, without controlling the accelerator or brakes\u201d may be deemed a driver under DUI statute); <em>Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Hoover, </em>161 Pa.Cmwlth. 517, 637 A.2d 721, 723 (1994) (a passenger \u201cgrabbing the steering wheel\u201d operates the vehicle for DUI purposes). We view the habitual offender statute no differently. Here too, the mischief addressed by that statute does not exclude, as a matter of law, brief exercises of physical control over a vehicle\u2019s operation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">In this case, even though appellant had only momentary control over his sister\u2019s vehicle, he nonetheless managed to steer it off the interstate and into a guardrail. True, appellant claimed he did so to avoid an imminent accident with a truck \u2014 one his sister, the driver, testified she never saw. The jury was entitled to disbelieve appellant\u2019s self-serving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>testimony and accept his sister\u2019s initial reaction that he grabbed the wheel in an irrational effort to harm them.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In short, for purposes of the DUI and habitual offender statutes, appellant exercised sufficient control over the vehicle to support convictions under both statutes. By forcibly taking the steering over from the driver, appellant manipulated perhaps the most fundamental feature of a moving vehicle \u2014 the direction in which it would travel. That deliberate act placed him in actual physical control of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Neither the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts nor the trial court\u2019s refusal to set them aside constituted error as a matter of law. We thus affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol (second or subsequent offense) in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-266 and 18.2-270(B), as well as operating a vehicle as an habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b633-7\">. For similar policy reasons, the legislature abrogated the common law doctrine of necessity as a defense to an habitual offender charge. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 537, 543-44, 478 S.E.2d 324, 326-27 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b634-9\"><em>. </em>A fact finder may discount an accused's self-serving explanation as a mere effort at \u201clying to conceal his guilt.\u201d <em>Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 209, 547 S.E.2d 899, 907 (2001); <em>see also Mughrabi v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 538, 548, 567 S.E.2d 542, 546 (2002); <em>Morrison v.
