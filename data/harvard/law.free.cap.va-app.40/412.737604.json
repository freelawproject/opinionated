On appeal, he contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress (a) the pre-trial and in-court identifications of appellant as the assailant and (b) the evidence obtained as a result of his encounter with a police officer near the scene of the crime. He also argues the trial court erroneously denied his motion for mistrial, made after the jury had completed its service but before the trial court imposed sentence, based on the failure of a juror accurately to respond to <em>voir dire </em>questioning regarding whether she or any member of her immediate family had \u201cever been the victim of a serious crime.\u201d We hold the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motions to suppress or his motion for a mistrial, and we affirm the challenged convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">The victim was attacked in a parking garage by an unknown assailant as she approached her car at about 7:20 p.m. on January 16, 2001. The assailant overpowered her and pushed her into her car. She struggled with her attacker and honked her horn, but the assailant \u201cbeat[ ][her] continuously,\u201d and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>was unable to attract the attention of any passersby. The victim was bleeding and in pain and asked the attacker to stop beating her. Based on the assailant\u2019s superior strength and the extent of her injuries, she concluded that she would \u201cjust ... have to cooperate with hi[m].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Shortly thereafter, the victim saw a car coming down the ramp in the parking garage, and she renewed her efforts to sound the horn and escape. When the approaching car slowed down and its driver \u201cjammed on the horn,\u201d the assailant was distracted, and the bloodied victim was able to get out of her car and run to the approaching vehicle. The assailant\u2019s attack on the victim lasted about twenty-five minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Keith Weltens, the driver of the approaching car, stopped ten to fifteen feet from the victim\u2019s car and opened his passenger door for the victim. Weltens saw the assailant step out of the driver\u2019s side of the victim\u2019s car, stand beneath a light in the parking garage, and stare directly at him before the assailant jumped back into the victim\u2019s car. Weltens then drove the victim to a nearby hospital emergency room where he reported the crime to the police and described the attacker.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Based on a dispatch reporting the location of the attack and the description of the attacker, Christopher Atkins, a uniformed patrol officer, apprehended appellant in a nearby park less than an hour after the attack had ceased. Other officers photographed appellant and took the photo to the hospital. Appellant was arrested after both Weltens and the victim positively identified the person in the photograph as the victim\u2019s assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Appellant was charged with the instant offenses. Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the fruits of his detention as the product of an unreasonable seizure. He also moved to suppress the single-photo pre-trial identifications as unduly suggestive and any subsequent in-court identifications as tainted. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">After a jury trial in which appellant was convicted for the instant offenses, appellant moved the court for a mistrial. He alleged a juror failed to answer a question on <em>voir dire </em>honestly and that this failure prejudiced him by depriving him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of a fair trial. Appellant represented that the basis for the motion was the failure of a female juror to admit that she herself had been the victim of a robbery and that this failure was brought to counsel\u2019s attention only after the jury had returned its verdict and been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The trial court conducted a post-trial hearing at which the juror was questioned about her experience, the reason for her failure to disclose it during <em>voir dire, </em>and its impact on her ability to be impartial in appellant\u2019s trial. She testified her nondisclosure was unintentional and that the experience did not affect her ability to be impartial. The trial court found her testimony credible and denied the motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">On appeal of the denial of a motion to suppress, we consider the evidence adduced at both the suppression hearing and the trial, <em>DePriest v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 577, 583, 359 S.E.2d 540, 542-43 (1987), and we view it in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, <em>Commonwealth v. Grimstead, </em>12 Va.App. 1066, 1067, 407 S.E.2d 47, 48 (1991). \u201c[W]e are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>However, we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of legal standards such as reasonable suspicion to the particular facts of the case. <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). We also review <em>de novo </em>the question whether a person has been seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Reittinger v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 232, 236, 532 S.E.2d 25, 27 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">SEIZURE</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u201cFourth Amendment jurisprudence recognizes three categories of police-citizen [contacts]: (1) consensual encoun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ters, (2) brief, minimally intrusive investigatory detentions based upon specific, articulable facts, commonly referred to as <em>Terry </em>stops, and (3) highly intrusive arrests and searches founded on probable cause.\u201d <em>Wechsler v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 162, 169, 455 S.E.2d 744, 747 (1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Consensual encounters \u201c \u2018need not be predicated on any suspicion of the person\u2019s involvement in wrongdoing,\u2019 and remain consensual \u2018as long as the citizen voluntarily cooperates with the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 86, 88, 414 S.E.2d 869, 870 (1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>953 F.2d 116, 121 (4th Cir.1991)). \u201cAs long as the person to whom questions are put remains free to disregard the questions and walk away, there has been no intrusion upon that person\u2019s liberty or privacy as would under the Constitution require some particularized and objective justification.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u201cA seizure occurs when an individual is either physically restrained or has submitted to a show of authority.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 199, 487 S.E.2d at 262. \u201cWhether a seizure has occurred ... depends upon whether, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have believed that he or she was not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199-200, 487 S.E.2d at 262. Relevant factors under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d analysis include \u201cthe threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u201c[I]f there are articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a criminal offense, that person may be stopped in order to identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly while attempting to obtain additional information.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 816, 105 S.Ct. 1643, 1647, 84 L.Ed.2d 705 (1985). In reviewing whether an officer had reasonable suspicion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>justify the seizure, we must consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances and view those facts objectively through the eyes of a reasonable police officer with the knowledge, training, and experience of the investigating officer.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 139, 144, 384 S.E.2d 125, 128 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Here, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that Officer Christopher Atkins\u2019 initial encounter with appellant in the park was consensual. Atkins approached appellant on foot \u201cat a walking pace\u201d at a time when Atkins was the only police officer in the park. Although Atkins was in uniform, he greeted appellant by saying, in a normal tone of voice, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d and Atkins described his encounter with appellant as \u201cvery casual contact.\u201d In the same normal tone of voice, Atkins said to appellant, \u201cDo you mind taking off your stocking cap for me?\u201d Appellant complied with Officer Atkins\u2019 request. The totality of the circumstances support the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that this portion of appellant\u2019s encounter with Officer Atkins was consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Once appellant complied with Officer Atkins\u2019 request to remove his hat, Officer Atkins could see that appellant had a \u201creal short, buzz type haircut.\u201d At that time, Atkins had confirmed that appellant met the general description he had received from witness Weltens of the victim\u2019s attacker \u2014 a white male of a certain approximate height and weight, with \u201cfacial hair that appeared to be two to three days growth,\u201d \u201ca buzz type haircut,\u201d and \u201cwearing a gray sweatshirt with purple fringe.\u201d The fact that appellant matched the assailant\u2019s general description, coupled with appellant\u2019s presence in the immediate vicinity of the attack only a short time after the attack had ended, gave Officer Atkins reasonable suspicion to detain appellant briefly to confirm or dispel his suspicion that appellant might, in fact, have been the victim\u2019s assailant. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 851, 856, 434 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1993), <em>aff'd on reh\u2019g en banc, </em>18 Va.App. 454, 444 S.E.2d 275 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>When Officer Atkins turned on his flashlight, he noticed a spot of blood on appellant\u2019s head. Using his flashlight to make a closer inspection, he saw smaller red droplets around appellant\u2019s ear and scratch marks running from appellant\u2019s neck toward his chest. These observations served to heighten rather than dispel Officer Atkins\u2019 reasonable suspicion that appellant might have been the victim\u2019s attacker and justified Atkins\u2019 detaining appellant further in order to photograph him and to have the victim and witness view the photograph to confirm or dispel Atkins\u2019 suspicions. Atkins immediately called for assistance, obtained a photograph of appellant and had the photograph transported to the nearby hospital where the victim and witness promptly identified the person in the photograph as the victim\u2019s attacker. Appellant was detained no more than twenty-five minutes before the police obtained probable cause for arrest. On these facts, we affirm the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the totality of the circumstances justified the detention. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 857, 434 S.E.2d at 323 (holding that \u201c[transportation of a suspect a short distance for possible identification has consistently been found reasonable and consonant with Fourth Amendment safeguards\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">PHOTO IDENTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving the identity of the accused as the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Brickhouse v. Commonwealth, </em>208 Va. 533, 536, 159 S.E.2d 611, 613-14 (1968). Although \u201c \u2018a single photograph display is one of the most suggestive methods of identification and is always to be viewed with suspicion,\u2019 \u201d <em>Wise v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 178, 184, 367 S.E.2d 197, 200 (1988) (quoting <em>Hudson v. Blackburn, </em>601 F.2d 785, 788 (5th Cir.1979)), \u201c[p]re-trial show-ups are not per se violative of constitutional rights,\u201d <em>Ford v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 249, 258, 503 S.E.2d 803, 807 (1998). In considering whether such an identification is inadmissible as the product of an unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>suggestive process, we look to the totality of the circumstances and consider factors including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ana\">the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199-200, 93 S.Ct. 375, 382, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The application of these factors to the identifications of the witness and victim support the trial court\u2019s finding that the identifications did not result from an unduly suggestive procedure. Here, the victim had ample opportunity to view her assailant during the twenty-five minute attack. When the assailant first approached the victim, his \u201cface was touching [hers] right in [her] face,\u201d and \u201c[they] met eye to eye\u201d before the assailant forced her into her \u201ctwo seated\u201d car. Although the victim and her attacker struggled while in the car as she attempted to escape from him, the attack ceased when she agreed to his demands, and the assailant \u201cbecame very calm.\u201d The victim\u2019s car was parked next to a light in the parking garage and her car \u201cha[d][a] T-top[], so [she] was never without light during [the] attack.\u201d This evidence supports a finding that the victim had ample opportunity to view her assailant at the time of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The victim also accurately described her assailant as a short man with short hair, a goatee around his mouth that was \u201cpeppered gray,\u201d and a spot of blood on his head. Although her description of the clothing he was wearing at the time of the attack did not appear to be accurate, the victim testified that her attacker had \u201ca very distinctive facial appearance\u201d and that her identification of the photograph of appellant as her assailant \u201cwas based on facial appearance\u201d and \u201cbody structure,\u201d \u201cnot ... on the clothing in that photograph.\u201d When the police asked the victim an hour after the assault if she could identify her attacker from a photograph, she said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that she could. She then identified the single photograph of appellant as her attacker, saying one photograph \u201cwas all I needed to be shown.\u201d The victim also identified appellant as her attacker at both the suppression hearing and at trial, testifying she had \u201c[a]bsolutely no[ ]\u201d doubt. In light of the victim\u2019s level of certainty, the fact that the victim may have been told prior to viewing the photograph that witness Keith Weltens had already identified the photograph as depicting the perpetrator does not require a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Weltens also had ample opportunity to view the victim\u2019s attacker, although his opportunity was of shorter duration than the victim\u2019s. Weltens testified that the parking garage was \u201cbright\u201d and \u201cwell lit\u201d and that he had a \u201creal good\u201d \u201cunobstructed view\u201d of the assailant from a distance of ten to fifteen feet for four to five seconds as Weltens sat in his car and the assailant stood beside the victim\u2019s car. Weltens then got out of his car and viewed the assailant for an additional three to four seconds, during which the assailant was \u201cjust standing there\u201d \u201cstaring directly at [Weltens].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Weltens accurately described appellant\u2019s height, clothing and facial appearance, although he underestimated appellant\u2019s weight. Weltens said that when he viewed the single photograph of appellant about an hour later, the photograph was \u201cthe exact match\u201d of the description he gave and that the person in the photograph was the victim\u2019s attacker. Weltens, like the victim, testified he was \u201cpositive\u201d that appellant was the victim\u2019s assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">In light of the <em>Biggers </em>factors, we hold the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the identifications were not unduly suggestive. Our holding in <em>Wise, </em>cited by appellant, is factually distinguishable and, thus, does not require a different result. <em>See Wise, </em>6 Va.App. at 180, 185-86, 367 S.E.2d at 198, 201 (holding identifications were unduly suggestive where bank robber wore disguise and witnesses had been \u201cunable to describe the robber\u2019s facial features\u201d but claimed to have recognized accused when, almost five months after the robbery at issue, they were shown a single still photograph <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>from a videotape of another bank robbery). Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s admission of the pre-trial identifications. Because the admission of the pre-trial identifications was not error, no basis exists for excluding the in-court identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">MOTION FOR MISTRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Appellant contends he is entitled to a new trial based on a juror\u2019s failure to reveal on <em>voir dire </em>the fact that she had previously been robbed at gunpoint while entering her parked car. Because the juror did not disclose this fact in a timely fashion, appellant argues, he was deprived of the opportunity to challenge her for cause or, at the very least, to use a peremptory challenge to remove her from the jury. We hold the trial court\u2019s denial of the mistrial motion was not error because the record supported the trial court\u2019s findings that the juror did not fail to answer \u201chonestly\u201d the questions on <em>voir dire </em>and that the juror was not biased.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In order for a litigant to be entitled to a mistrial based on jury misconduct on <em>voir dire,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">\u201ca party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire, </em>and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. The motives for concealing information may vary, but only those reasons that affect a juror\u2019s impartiality can truly be said to affect the fairness of a trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\"><em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 12, 18, 486 S.E.2d 108, 111 (1997) (quoting <em>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood, </em>464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S.Ct. 845, 850, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984)), <em>aff'd, </em>256 Va. 214, 505 S.E.2d 378 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Appellant contends the juror \u201cfailed to answer honestly\u201d the question regarding whether she had been \u201cthe victim of a serious offense\u201d because she did not bring to the court\u2019s attention the fact that she previously had been robbed at gunpoint. Appellant contends the juror\u2019s incorrect answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>standing alone, established dishonesty. We disagree. The United States Supreme Court noted in <em>McDonough </em>that \u201c[t]o invalidate the result of a [lengthy] trial because of a juror\u2019s <em>mistaken, though honest, </em>response to a question, is to insist on something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be expected to give.\u201d 464 U.S. at 555, 104 S.Ct. at 849-50 (emphases added) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 61, governing new trials, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111, \u201cthe harmless-error statute ... [that] applies directly to appellate courts\u201d). Thus, the Court indicated that the honesty of the juror\u2019s response is to be gauged by whether the juror gave an incorrect answer intentionally or accidentally. Only an intentionally incorrect response may provide a basis for the granting of a mistrial. <em>See id. </em>As the Supreme Court further noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">A trial represents an important investment of private and social resources, and it ill serves the important end of finality to wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the peremptory challenge process because counsel lacked an item of information which objectively he should have obtained from a juror on <em>voir dire </em>examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 555, 104 S.Ct. at 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Here, the trial court conducted a post-trial hearing on appellant\u2019s mistrial motion. <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 215, 102 S.Ct. 940, 945, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982) (recognizing \u201cthat the remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in which the defendant has the opportunity to prove actual bias\u201d). Upon appellate review, we must give deference to the trial court\u2019s decision regarding whether a juror is impartial because the trial court \u201c \u2018sees and hears the juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 246, 397 S.E.2d 385, 391 (1990) (quoting <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 426, 105 S.Ct. 844, 853, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985)). Accordingly, we will disturb the trial court\u2019s decision regarding juror impartiality \u201conly upon a showing of manifest error.\u201d <em>Weeks v. Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 460, 475, 450 S.E.2d 379, 389 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">In examination by the court at the hearing on appellant\u2019s post-trial motion, the juror testified repeatedly that she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>not deliberately withhold the information that she previously had been robbed. She testified that she either \u201cdidn\u2019t hear\u201d the question or \u201cdidn\u2019t understand\u201d and that her failure to respond correctly \u201cwas not a deliberate act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Further, the transcript of the original <em>voir dire </em>indicates that the court\u2019s question to the jury, \u201c[H]ave you or any members of your immediate family ever been the victim of a serious offense?\u201d immediately followed a portion of the <em>voir dire </em>in which the trial judge had dismissed a different juror for cause, called a replacement juror, and asked only the replacement juror a series of questions to \u201cca[tchj\u201d the replacement juror \u201cup with the rest of the panel.\u201d The transcript reflects no pause in the court\u2019s questioning as it turned its attention from the replacement juror back to its questioning of the entire panel, a fact lending credence to the challenged juror\u2019s testimony that she simply did not hear the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Finally, the challenged juror willingly admitted her robbery and resulting fear of parking garages to a bailiff on at least one occasion, tending to support the fact that her failure to reveal that information on <em>voir dire </em>in appellant\u2019s trial was unintentional. These circumstances, coupled with the juror\u2019s repeated statements that her failure to respond correctly to the trial court\u2019s question was unintentional, support the trial court\u2019s finding that she did not fail to answer a material question \u201chonestly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The evidence also supported the trial court\u2019s finding that the juror\u2019s personal experience as the victim of a robbery thirteen to fifteen years earlier did not affect her ability to serve impartially as a juror in appellant\u2019s trial for the instant offenses. The juror said that, although being robbed at gunpoint affected her emotionally, causing her to \u201crelive\u201d the robbery from time to time, she did so only when she was \u201cby [herjself and somebody [was] behind [her].\u201d She insisted that \u201c[her] verdict was strictly on the evidence, nothing about [her] personal life,\u201d and that her prior bad experience had \u201c[absolutely\u201d nothing to do with the outcome of appellant\u2019s trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The trial court accepted her testimony, finding she had \u201can impartial mind, an understanding of the presumption of innocence, and [an] indifference to the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">The holdings in <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 51, 523 S.E.2d 502, 504 (2000), <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 226-27, 532 S.E.2d 28, 30-31 (2000), and <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 826-27, 553 S.E.2d 731, 733 (2001), indicating that \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the [jury selection] process\u201d is an important factor in determining whether a juror should be struck for cause do not require a different result. Those cases involved challenges that occurred before the jury was sworn, which did not give rise to the same concerns for balancing fairness with finality embodied in <em>McDonough, </em>464 U.S. at 553-56, 104 S.Ct. at 848-50, and recognized in <em>Taylor, 25 </em>Va.App. at 18 n. 3, 486 S.E.2d at 111 n. 3. Also, both <em>Cantrell </em>and <em>Barrett </em>involved a relationship between the challenged juror and a witness or other participant in the trial that the Court presumed would result in bias as a matter of law. <em>Cantrell, </em>259 Va. at 51, 523 S.E.2d at 504 (noting juror was \u201ca client of the law firm representing one of the parties to the litigation as a result of a similar occurrence\u201d); <em>Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826-27, 553 S.E.2d at 733 (noting juror was brother of police officer witness). No evidence of such a relationship existed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Because the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s findings that the juror\u2019s failure to answer the subject <em>voir dire </em>question was accidental rather than intentional and that she stood impartial to the cause, its denial of appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Finally, even assuming \u201cmisconduct\u201d occurs when a juror <em>unintentionally </em>gives an incorrect response on <em>voir dire, </em>\u201c \u2018juror misconduct does not automatically entitle either litigant to a mistrial.\u2019 The trial court must also find a probability of prejudice, with the \u2018burden of establishing that probability ... upon the party moving for a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Green v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 394, 401, 494 S.E.2d 888, 891 (1998) (quoting <em>Robertson v. Metropolitan Washington Airport </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number><em>Auth., </em>249 Va. 72, 76, 452 S.E.2d 845, 847 (1995)). Based on the trial court\u2019s finding that the juror was not biased, appellant has failed to prove he was entitled to a mistrial because he failed to show prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motions to suppress or his motion for a mistrial, and we affirm the challenged convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-15\">. Appellant alludes on brief to his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. To the extent appellant purports to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a claim which appears somehow to be based on the juror\u2019s untruthfulness, we note that we have no jurisdiction over such claims. <em>See, e.g., Browning v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 295, 297 n. 2, 452 S.E.2d 360, 362 n. 2 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
