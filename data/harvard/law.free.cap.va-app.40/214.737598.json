Clements (claimant) appeals from a decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (commission) which granted her employer\u2019s application for termination of her temporary partial disability compensation award. She claims she did not unjustifiably refuse the light-duty job offer of Riverside Walter Reed Hospital (employer). She also contends her work with Mary Kay Cosmetics constituted sufficient marketing of her residual work capacity. Finally, claimant argues employer implicitly conceded claimant was totally disabled, thereby entitling her to temporary total disability payments during the time she was on sick leave from work. For the reasons stated below, we reverse and remand for further consideration by the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Claimant began working for employer as a registered nurse in the hospital\u2019s emergency room in 1978. She had a compensable workplace injury in 1998. The commission awarded her temporary total disability, which was later changed to temporary partial disability. Her medical records indicated she could not do any heavy lifting or spend significant amounts of time standing. Claimant returned to work, although at a different job and with reduced hours. Initially, she performed secretarial work, but eventually she was placed in the cardiac rehabilitation unit of the hospital in a temporary, part-time position. However, employer continued to classify claimant as a full-time employee and to provide claimant with the same benefits she had received while working full time, even though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>she now worked half her previous hours. According to testimony from employer\u2019s director of human resources, claimant earned, on average, $410 every two-week pay period while working in the cardiac unit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Approximately two and a half years after the accident, employer decided to offer claimant a \u201cpermanent part-time position,\u201d which amounted to her current job with fewer benefits. If she accepted the job, then the sick leave and vacation time that claimant had accrued in the twenty-plus years she had worked for employer would be forfeited without compensation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time, claimant carried the maximum amount of sick leave allowed by employer, worth approximately $14,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She refused the offered position, and employer applied to the commission on April 3, 2001 for the termination of benefits based on an unjustified \u201crefusal of light duty work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Although employer suggested claimant would no longer have a job if she refused the new position, claimant was allowed to take sick leave and vacation time as of March 30, 2001. Claimant gave employer a Medical Certification Statement signed by her doctor, as required by employer\u2019s sick leave policy. The Statement did not indicate claimant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>totally disabled. To the contrary, her doctor simply noted that claimant could not \u201cdo heavy lifting or overhead work.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Employer paid claimant for seventy-two hours of work for each two-week pay period from April until November 17, 2001, when claimant\u2019s sick leave and vacation time ran out. During that time, employer gave claimant a raise in her base pay. In November, although claimant indicated a desire to return to work, employer did not have any positions available that fit within her doctor\u2019s restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">While working for employer in 1997, claimant began selling Mary Kay Cosmetics products. In 2000, she reached the position of \u201cdirector,\u201d which involved overseeing a sales force of at least thirty people and carrying an inventory of over $10,000 worth of products. She received a commission for her own sales and the sales of the people working under her. However, because she could not manage the requirements of the position and her work for employer, she gave up the directorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">While on sick leave, claimant again increased her involvement with Mary Kay. While her first few months of income were inconsistent, by August 2001 claimant was averaging over $400 a month.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She regained her \u201cdirector\u201d status in December 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The deputy commissioner heard testimony on January 22, 2002 and accepted numerous exhibits. The deputy commissioner found claimant refused the \u201cpermanent part-time position\u201d only because she \u201cwould lose some benefits.\u201d He concluded he did \u201cnot feel this was a justifiable reason to refuse.\u201d He also found claimant did not market her remaining work capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The full commission affirmed the deputy\u2019s ruling. The commission found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">It is clear that the claimant turned down the permanent job due [to] a loss of some benefits which she had been mistakenly receiving through hospital error. We find that the loss of benefits is not a valid reason to turn down an offer of selective work and therefore the claimant\u2019s refusal was not justified. We further find that the claimant failed to prove that she cured her refusal within the six-month timeframe from the last day for which compensation was paid. <em>See </em>[Code] \u00a7 65.2-510(C). The claimant\u2019s employment with Mary Kay Cosmetics is not comparable employment and is insufficient evidence of a cure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">:j: <em>% </em>:j\u00ab sfc # ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">Moreover, we reject the claimant\u2019s arguments that the claimant\u2019s receipt of medical leave stays the six-month period for curing a refusal of light duty, or provides a basis for an award of temporary total disability. The hospital\u2019s decision to allow the claimant to use her leave has no bearing on our decision here and we find that the Act does not provide for a stay of the six-month period during payment of a fringe benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Employer petitioned the commission for a change of condition based on claimant\u2019s unjustified refusal to accept a job offer. Under Code \u00a7 65.2-510:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-9\">A. If an injured employee refuses employment procured for him suitable to his capacity, he shall only be entitled to the benefits provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-503 and 65.2-603 ... during the continuance of such refusal, unless in the opinion of the Commission such refusal was justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">B. If an injured employee cures his unjustified refusal by accepting employment suitable to his capacity at a wage less than that originally offered, the employer shall pay or cause to be paid to the injured employee during his partial incapacity pursuant to \u00a7 65.2-502, a weekly compensation equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to 66% percent of the difference between his average weekly-wages before his injury and the average weekly wage the employee would have earned by accepting the original proffered light duty employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">C. A cure of unjustified refusal pursuant to subsection A may not be established if the unjustified refusal lasts more than six months from the last day for which compensation was paid before suspension pursuant to this section; however, the six-month period may be extended by the number of days a claimant is totally disabled if .the disability commenced during such six-month period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">An employer bears the burden initially to prove a claimant unjustifiably refused a job. <em>Westmoreland Coal Co. v. Russell, </em>31 Va.App. 16, 20, 520 S.E.2d 839, 841 (1999). An employer must establish \u201c \u2018(1) a <em>bona fide </em>job offer suitable to the employee\u2019s capacity; (2) procured for the employee by the employer; and (3) an unjustified refusal by the employee to accept the job.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home v. Underwood, </em>35 Va.App. 31, 37, 542 S.E.2d 785, 788 (2001) (quoting <em>Ellerson v. W.O. Grubb Steel Erection Co., </em>1 Va.App. 97, 98, 335 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1985)). Once an employer has established these elements, the burden then shifts to the claimant to \u201cshow justification for refusing the offer.\u201d <em>Ballweg v. Crowder Contracting Co., </em>247 Va. 205, 209, 440 S.E.2d 613, 615 (1994). Claimants can cure unjustifiable refusals of selective employment by marketing their residual work capacity. Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B); <em>Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc. v. Burnette, </em>17 Va.App. 74, 76, 435 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The commission must examine the totality of evidence offered on these issues. <em>See Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. v. Lawrence, </em>38 Va.App. 656, 662, 568 S.E.2d 374, 377 (2002) (noting that, when determining whether an employee refused employment, the commission determines this fact \u201cfrom the totality of the evidence\u201d). We will not disturb the commission\u2019s findings, even if the record includes contradictory evidence, so long as credible evidence, or reasonable inferences from that evidence, supports the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>sion\u2019s findings. <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 34, 542 S.E.2d at 787; <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Lee, </em>16 Va.App. 616, 619, 431 S.E.2d 342, 344 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">A. Refusal of Selective Employment</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The commission found claimant turned down employer\u2019s job offer because she would lose \u201csome benefits which she had been mistakenly receiving through hospital error.\u201d The commission concluded, \u201cthe loss of benefits is not a valid reason to turn down an offer of selective work and therefore the claimant\u2019s refusal was not justified.\u201d In this case, the commission made incomplete evidential findings and erred in its legal analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">While the evidence proved claimant refused the offer of permanent, part-time employment in part because her benefits package would be reduced, claimant also discussed the loss of the benefits she had already accrued. The evidence proved claimant would lose approximately $14,000 in sick leave and vacation time she had earned over the more than twenty years she worked for employer. While the hospital \u201cmistakenly\u201d allowed her to continue to accrue full-time benefits when she began working part-time after her compensable injury in 1998, a significant portion of the $14,000 of leave was earned while she worked full time. Additionally, while for two years claimant received a benefit that employer\u2019s policies did not provide for part-time employees, employer had never argued she was not entitled to the benefits she accrued through their mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">If claimant had accepted the permanent, part-time job, she would have received no compensation for this accrued benefit. Instead, she was allowed to use the sick leave and vacation time to receive a full-time salary for over seven months after her refusal of the job.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commission\u2019s opinion ignores these facts and instead mentions only the loss of future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>benefits to which claimant was not entitled. The commission erred in failing to weigh and analyze claimant\u2019s argument that her entitlement to the previously accrued benefits justified her refusal of the permanent, part-time position offered by employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Additionally, the commission\u2019s opinion suggests, even if the accrued leave benefits were considered, the loss of benefits could never constitute justification for refusal of selective employment. We disagree with this legal conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We have explained previously that determining whether legitimate justification for refusing selective employment exists involves consideration of numerous, varied factors.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7C\">To support a finding of justification to refuse suitable selective employment, \u201cthe reasons advanced must be such that a reasonable person desirous of employment would have refused the offered work.\u201d <em>[Johnson v. Virginia Employment Comm\u2019n, </em>8 Va.App. 441, 452, 382 S.E.2d 476, 481 (1989).] Furthermore, the determination of justification to refuse employment involves \u201ca much broader inquiry than merely considering whether the intrinsic aspects of the job are acceptable to the prospective employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 382 S.E.2d at 478. Justification to refuse an offer of selective employment \u201cmay arise from factors totally independent of those criteria used to determine whether a job is suitable to a particular employee.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-6\"><em>Food Lion, Inc., </em>16 Va.App. at 619, 431 S.E.2d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Justifiable reasons for refusing a job vary and can be unrelated to the ability to perform the work. <em>See Ballweg, </em>247 Va. at 209, 440 S.E.2d at 615 (noting the commission has accepted various economic reasons for refusing employment that are unrelated to job performance); <em>DePaul Medical Ctr. v. Brickhouse, </em>18 Va.App. 506, 508, 445 S.E.2d 494, 495 (1994) (noting \u201cit is impossible to anticipate and legislate every potential event\u201d that justifies refusal of selective employment). In the proper context, a claimant could prove that denial of or a change in benefits would lead a reasonable person to refuse the offered work.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>On remand, the commission must consider the totality of the evidence and determine whether claimant unjustifiably refused selective employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">B. Cure within Six Months of Last Disability Payment</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The commission found claimant did not cure her refusal of selective employment. If the commission determines on remand that claimant unjustifiably refused employer\u2019s job offer, then it must address this issue again. Therefore, we address the commission\u2019s ruling on cure.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The commission found, \u201cDuring the six months after April 3, 2001, the claimant never advised [employer\u2019s agent] that she was willing to take the permanent part-time position at the hospital.\u201d While some evidence contradicts this factual finding, the record does contain testimony that claimant did not indicate to the hospital after April 3 that she was willing to accept either the originally offered position or any other appropriate job from employer. We will not disturb this finding on appeal. <em>See Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, 35 </em>Va.App. at 34, 542 S.E.2d at 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The commission also found claimant did not cure her refusal by working with Mary Kay Cosmetics, explaining that employment was \u201cnot comparable employment and is insufficient evidence of a cure.\u201d The commission did not explain this ruling further.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">If claimant unjustifiably refused the selective employment offered her, her disability benefits do not cease permanently. If she can cure her refusal, then she is entitled to reinstatement of those benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 36-37, 542 S.E.2d at 788; <em>Food Lion, Inc. v. Newsome, </em>30 Va.App. 21, 25, 515 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1999). She <em>can </em>also partially cure her refusal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-510(B); <em>Hillcrest Manor Nursing Home, </em>35 Va.App. at 37, 542 S.E.2d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>A claimant can cure an unjustified refusal in several ways. She can continue working for the employer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 39, 542 S.E.2d at 789 (\u201cLikewise, continued part-time, selective employment, with [employer], following the full-time offer, constituted a partial cure of her prior unjustified refusal of such employment....\u201d). Reasonable efforts to market an employee\u2019s residual capacity can also cure an unjustified refusal of selective employment. <em>Cf. Greif Cos. v. Sipe, </em>16 Va.App. 709, 715, 434 S.E.2d 314, 318 (1993) (\u201cA disabled employee with residual marketable capacity who claims benefits ... must prove that he or she has made a reasonable attempt to procure work----\u201d); <em>Nat\u2019l Linen Service v. McGuinn, </em>8 Va.App. 267, 269, 380 S.E.2d 31, 33 (1989) (\u201cCode \u00a7 65.1-63 [recodified at Code \u00a7 65.2-510] ... clearly require[s] a disabled employee to make a \u2018reasonable effort\u2019 to market his remaining work capacity in order to receive continued workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d). Finding other, comparable employment can cure a refusal as well. <em>See Virginia Wayside Furniture, Inc., </em>17 Va.App. at 76, 435 S.E.2d at 157 (\u201c[A] partially disabled employee can cure an unjustified refusal of selective employment ... by obtaining other comparable employment.\u201d); <em>Food Lion, Inc., </em>30 Va.App. at 25-26, 515 S.E.2d at 319 (\u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-510 allows employees to cure an unjustified refusal of selective employment by obtaining equivalent selective employment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The commission found claimant\u2019s employment with Mary Kay was not comparable work. The record supports that conclusion. At most, the evidence indicates claimant earned half the amount of her salary from employer with her new job. Nothing in the record suggests claimant did anything else to market her residual capacity. \u201c[T]he mere fact that the employee obtained a new job, where the pay is substantially less than that received at the old job, is, standing alone, insufficient proof of making a reasonable effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>market one\u2019s remaining work capacity.\u201d <em>Nat'l Linen Service, </em>8 Va.App. at 268, 380 S.E.2d at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">As the evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding, we will not disturb this factual finding on appeal. Claimant, therefore, did not cure her refusal within the six months \u00a1from the last day employer claims she was paid disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">C. Entitlement to Temporary Total Disability</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Claimant also argues employer \u201cacknowledged\u201d her total disability when it accepted the Medical Certification Statement that supported her request for sick leave and, thereby, admitted she was entitled to an award of temporary total disability during the period she took leave.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Employer argues that allowing claimant to use her sick leave and thereby continue to receive income from employer does not implicitly concede she was totally disabled at that time. We agree with employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The evidence does not suggest employer required employees to be totally disabled under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act before they could use their sick leave or vacation time. Simply allowing claimant to use her accrued benefits was not an admission that she was totally disabled for purposes of a workers\u2019 compensation award.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Additionally, acceptance of the Medical Certification Statement did not constitute implicit acceptance of claimant\u2019s total disability claim. The form, although it lists several medical conditions, does not state claimant was totally disabled. The form simply repeats her light duty conditions, necessitated by her <em>partial </em>disability: she cannot lift heavy objects or reach overhead. If acceptance of the form did constitute implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>acceptance of a medical condition, it only suggested employer knew claimant was still partially disabled. We agree with the commission that acceptance of this form did not \u201cprovide a basis for an award of temporary total disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">The commission did not consider the totality of the evidence surrounding claimant\u2019s refusal of selective employment. Therefore, we reverse and remand this case to the commission for further proceedings consistent with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">. On brief, employer claims claimant earned $370 per week in this position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b259-7\">. Kent Taylor, the director of human resources for employer, initially testified, \"When an individual changes from full-time to part-time status, they lose their sick leave that they had accrued on the books.\u201d He later explained, \"She [would] lose sick leave, she [would] lose life insurance, but we indicated in that letter we would hold her sick leave for approximately one year in case she goes into a full-time position, that that would be reinstated.\u201d No testimony ever indicated that claimant would be able to take a full-time job in the future nor that employer would consider her for a full-time job within the one-year grace period. Employer had no jobs available that met claimant\u2019s medical restrictions in the six months after her refusal to accept the \"new\u201d permanent, part-time position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b259-8\">. The record does not indicate whether these benefits were vested and realizable or non-vested. However, employer never contradicted the $14,000 value.
