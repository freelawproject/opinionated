Johnson (appellant) was convicted in a bench trial of two counts of rape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-61, two counts of forcible sodomy in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1 and two counts of indecent liberties with a child in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-370.1. On appeal, appellant contends that: (1) Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9, which allows child victims to testify via closed circuit television, is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied to him; (2) the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden to show that the child was unable to testify in person; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Under familiar principles of appellate review, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Juares v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 154, 156, 493 S.E.2d 677, 678 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">In February 1998, Antrina Stokes Johnson, appellant\u2019s girlfriend, gained temporary custody of her four-year-old cousin, M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In May 1998, appellant, Johnson, her son L, and M moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>to Virginia where appellant worked the night shift as a jail guard. Johnson worked at Wachovia Bank from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and was responsible for the care of both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">In January 1999 appellant and Johnson were married in Virginia. In order to save money for a wedding ceremony in New York, Johnson worked nights at a Food Lion from June 11, 1999 to July 26, 1999. Because appellant also worked nights, Johnson arranged for a neighbor, Keshia Light, to babysit M and L when she worked at Food Lion. From approximately mid-June to mid-July 1999, M visited her grandmother in New York. M returned to Virginia in mid-July, with L, appellant\u2019s two children from a prior marriage and appellant\u2019s niece. The entire family returned to Buffalo, New York on August 20, 1999, and Johnson returned custody of M to her father at that time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">On December 4, 2000, North Carolina Child Protective Services (CPS) took custody of M, age seven, from her father and placed her in foster care with Matty Williams. When she arrived at Williams\u2019 home, Williams gave her a bath. Consistent with her normal practice, Williams asked M to show Williams her private parts and asked M if anyone had ever touched her there. M replied, \u201cNo ma\u2019am.\u201d A few days later, M complained to Williams of blood in her urine. After a visit to the doctor, M told Williams \u201cwhenever my cousin would go to work, ... her husband would come to my room ... he would make me put his private in my mouth.\u201d At one point, M told Williams that she thought appellant was trying to kill her. When asked why, M said \u201che put his privates into her, and she couldn\u2019t breathe. That\u2019s why she thought he was trying to kill her.\u201d M initially told Williams that she was five when this occurred; but later said she was six. M identified appellant as the person who committed the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Dr. Sarah Sinai, a professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest University, performed a complete physical on the child. She found that the child\u2019s \u201chymen appeared asymmetric with significant narrowing between twelve and two o\u2019clock.\u201d Dr. Sinai stated that \u201csome children have narrower hymens than others. But in general there is a fair amount of symmetry.\u201d Dr. Sinai attributed the condition of M\u2019s hymen to trauma \u201cand as it healed there was a loss of tissue.\u201d Dr. Sinai stated that M \u201chad a physical injury ... that was compatible with having been painfully penetrated.\u201d Dr. Sinai\u2019s medical opinion was that M was \u201ca sexually abused child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The Commonwealth filed a pretrial motion pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 to allow M to testify via two-way closed circuit television. The trial court conducted two hearings on the motion and received testimony from two experts, Detective Sherry Kendall and Dr. Pamela Waaland, a licensed clinical psychologist who specialized in child and adolescent psychology and neuropsychology. Dr. Waaland testified that \u201cit would be very traumatic\u201d for M to testify. \u201cIn fact, [M] told [Waaland] she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it and she would <em>run out of court and run away.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). M told Waaland she would feel \u201cscared\u201d if she had to testify in front of appellant. The experts concluded that M would likely suffer severe emotional trauma if she had to testify in front of appellant. The trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion over appellant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The trial court convicted appellant of two counts of rape, two counts of forcible sodomy and two counts of indecent liberties with a child and sentenced him to 40 years for each charge of rape and each charge of forcible sodomy, and 5 years for each count of indecent liberties, for a total of 170 years. The trial court ordered that appellant serve his sentences concurrently, and suspended 30 years and 9 months of each rape and sodomy sentence, leaving nine years, three months to be served.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">II. Constitutionality of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Appellant first contends that Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 is constitutionally infirm, both facially and as applied to him, because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>violates Ms Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">A. Facial Validity</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">\u201cIn assessing the constitutionality of a statute, we must presume that the legislative action is valid. The burden is on the challenger to prove the alleged constitutional defect.\u201d <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 848, 447 S.E.2d 530, 534 (1994). \u201cEvery act of the legislature is presumed to be constitutional, and the Constitution is to be given a liberal construction so as to sustain the enactment in question, if practicable.\u201d <em>Moses v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 293, 298, 498 S.E.2d 451, 454 (1998).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">It has long been established that every presumption is to be made in favor of an act of the legislature, and it is not to be declared unconstitutional except where it is clearly and plainly so. Courts uphold acts of the legislature when their constitutionality is debatable, and the burden is upon the assailing party to prove the claimed invalidity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-8\"><em>Santillo v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 470, 476, 517 S.E.2d 733, 736 (1999) (citing <em>Peery v. Virginia Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers, </em>203 Va. 161, 165, 123 S.E.2d 94, 97 (1961)).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: \u2018In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 79, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2546, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). However, the Supreme Court has \u201cnever held ... that the Confrontation Clause guarantees criminal defendants the <em>absolute </em>right to a face-to-face meeting with witnesses against them at trial.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 U.S. 836, 844, 110 S.Ct. 3157, 3163, 111 L.Ed.2d 666 (1990) (emphasis in original). Instead, \u201ccertain narrow circumstances ... may warrant dispensing with confrontation at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 848, 110 S.Ct. at 3165.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">To be sure, face-to-face confrontation may be said to cause trauma for the very purpose of eliciting truth but we think <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>that the use of Maryland\u2019s special procedure, where necessary to further the important state interest in preventing trauma to child witnesses in child abuse cases, adequately ensures the accuracy of the testimony and preserves the adversary nature of the trial. Indeed, where face-to-face confrontation causes significant emotional distress in a child witness, there is evidence that such confrontation would in fact <em>disserve </em>the Confrontation Clause\u2019s truth-seeking goal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AF2\"><em>Id. </em>at 856-57, 110 S.Ct. at 3169 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">In <em>Craig, </em>the Supreme Court considered a Maryland statute similar to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 and held that where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3G\">the State makes an adequate showing of necessity, the state interest in protecting child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is sufficiently important to justify the use of a special procedure that permits a child witness in such cases to testify at trial against a defendant in the absence of face-to-face confrontation with the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 855, 110 S.Ct. at 3169. <em>Craig </em>established three further requirements: (1) the finding of necessity must be case-specific; (2) the child must be \u201ctraumatized, not by the courtroom generally, but by the presence of the defendant\u201d; and (3) the emotional distress suffered by the child witness must be more than \u201cmere nervousness or excitement or reluctance to testify.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 855-56, 110 S.Ct. at 3169. All three requirements are embodied in Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">A. The provisions of this section shall apply to an alleged' victim who was fourteen years of age or under at the time of the alleged offense and is sixteen or under at the time of the trial and to a witness who is fourteen years of age or under at the time of the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-9\">In any criminal proceeding, including preliminary hearings, involving an alleged offense against a child, relating to a violation of the laws pertaining to kidnapping (\u00a7 18.2-47 et seq.), criminal sexual assault (\u00a7 18.2-61 et seq.) or family offenses pursuant to Article 4 (\u00a7 18.2-362 et seq.) of Chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ter 8 of Title 18.2, or involving an alleged murder of a person of any age, the attorney for the Commonwealth or the defendant may apply for an order from the court that the testimony of the alleged victim or a child witness be taken in a room outside the courtroom and be televised by two-way closed-circuit television. The party seeking such order shall apply for the order at least seven days before the trial date or at least seven days before such other preliminary proceeding to which the order is to apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-5\">B. The court may order that the testimony of the child be taken by closed-circuit television as provided in subsection A if it finds that the child is unavailable to testify in open court in the presence of the defendant, the jury, the judge, and the public, for any of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">1. The child\u2019s persistent refusal to testify despite judicial requests to do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-7\">2. The child\u2019s substantial inability to communicate about the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-8\">3. The substantial likelihood, based upon expert opinion testimony, that the child will suffer severe emotional trauma from so testifying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-9\">Any ruling on the child\u2019s unavailability under this subsection shall be supported by the court with findings on the record or with written findings in a court not of record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">C. In any proceeding in which closed-circuit television is used to receive testimony, the attorney for the Commonwealth and the defendant\u2019s attorney shall be present in the room with the child, and the child shall be subject to direct and cross-examination. The only other persons allowed to be present in the room with the child during his testimony shall be those persons necessary to operate the closed-circuit equipment, and any other person whose presence is determined by the court to be necessary to the welfare and well-being of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-11\">D. The- child\u2019s testimony shall be transmitted by closed-circuit television into the courtroom for the defendant, jury, judge and public to view. The defendant shall be provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>with a means of private, contemporaneous communication with his attorney during the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">By its terms, the statute requires a \u201ccase-specific\u201d showing of necessity. Specifically, in accordance with <em>Craig\u2019s </em>mandate, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9(B) requires the trial court to find that the child is unavailable to testify in open court in the presence of the defendant because: the child refuses to testify; the child is unable to communicate; or there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood ... that the child will suffer severe emotional trauma.\u201d Thus Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 satisfies all the requirements set forth in <em>Craig. </em>Additionally, any ruling that the child is unavailable must be supported by findings on the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">Furthermore, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 preserves for the defendant all of the other elements of the confrontation right: the child witness must be competent to testify and must testify under oath; the defendant retains full opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination; and the judge, jury, and defendant are able to view (albeit by video monitor) the demeanor (and body) of the witness as he or she testifies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Az1\"><em>Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 851, 110 S.Ct. at 3166. Indeed, Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 goes beyond the requirements of <em>Craig </em>by providing for testimony via two-way closed-circuit television, rather than the one-way closed-circuit television testimony upheld in <em>Craig. </em>This additional element provides even greater protections for a criminal defendant and more closely mirrors a courtroom environment. For example, it allows the trial judge to make instantaneous rulings on objections or give instructions to the witness without any break in the proceedings. \u201c[W]e think these elements of effective confrontation not only permit a defendant to \u2018confound and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coached by a malevolent adult,\u2019 but may well aid a defendant in eliciting favorable testimony from the child witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Coy v. Iowa, </em>487 U.S. 1012, 1021, 108 S.Ct. 2798, 2803, 101 L.Ed.2d 857 (1988)). Accordingly, we hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 comports with the requirements of both <em>Craig </em>and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>B. Validity as Applied</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\">Next, appellant contends that even if Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 is constitutional as drafted, it is unconstitutional as applied to him. Appellant argues that the trial court failed to require that the trauma would have a \u201cdistorting\u201d effect on the child\u2019s testimony or that the trauma was so severe that the use of the closed-circuit television system was \u201cnecessary\u201d because the witness would otherwise be unable to testify. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Having found Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 constitutional, we need only determine whether the trial court adhered to the statutory requirements in this case. The trial court found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUy\">that the victim is unable to testify in open court in the presence of the defendant, the jury, the judge and the public; and ... the finding of unavailability is based on expert testimony that there is a substantial likelihood that the child will suffer severe emotional trauma from so testifying.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The record establishes that the trial court took the additional step of requiring the Commonwealth to have M undergo an independent psychological examination prior to making a decision on the necessity of using closed-circuit television at trial. The psychologist opined that \u201cit would be very traumatic\u201d for M to testify in open court in front of appellant. Dr. Waaland specifically stated that if required to testify, M said \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t be able to [testify in front of appellant] and she would <em>run out of court and rum, away.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Despite appellant\u2019s contention that there was no connection between M\u2019s fear of testifying in front of appellant and her ability to testify, the record is clear. Thus, there was a finding of \u201cnecessity\u201d in the instant case and the evidence before the trial court supported that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">The record also proves that the \u201cother elements\u201d of appellant\u2019s confrontations rights were met. Specifically, the trial court found M to be competent to testify; she testified under oath; appellant retained' the full opportunity for contemporaneous cross-examination; and the fact finder was able to view M\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Craig, </em>497 U.S. at 851, 110 S.Ct. at 3166. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Additionally, appellant had the opportunity to communicate privately with his counsel during M\u2019s remote testimony. The trial court followed the statutory requirements and applied them correctly. We therefore conclude that the application of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 in the instant case did not violate appellant\u2019s constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">III. Unavailability of Child Victim</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Next, appellant contends that the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of proving a substantial likelihood that the child victim would suffer severe emotional trauma as a result of testifying in open court in his presence. Appellant argues that the experts did not sufficiently substantiate their conclusions of \u201csevere emotional trauma.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\u201cIn determining the weight to be given the testimony of an expert witness, the fact finder may consider the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion. The credibility and weight of witnesses\u2019 testimony is determined by the fact finder.\u201d <em>Parrish v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 607, 613, 567 S.E.2d 576, 578-79 (2002). \u2018While ... nervousness by itself is insufficient to establish severe emotional trauma, the evidence here included more than nervousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 612-13, 567 S.E.2d at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">The Commonwealth offered two experts at the pretrial hearing to determine the appropriateness of closed-circuit television testimony. Both experts, Dr. Waaland and Detective Kendall, opined that M would suffer severe emotional distress if she had to testify in front of appellant and was \u201cwithdrawn.\u201d Because of this, it would be unlikely M would be capable of testifying in appellant\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">Dr. Waaland stated that she met personally with M and performed various psychological tests. These included self-esteem and anxiety measurements, \u201cprojective drawings\u201d and \u201csome intelligence testing to make sure that [M\u2019s] reasoning, judgment, memory was intact [sic].\u201d Dr. Waaland stated, \u201c[M] has low self-esteem. She reports feeling ashamed. On the anxiety measures, [M] scored very high, which puts her at risk.\u201d Dr. Waaland testified that \u201cit would be very traumatic\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>for M to testify in front of appellant. \u201cIn fact, [M] told [Dr. Waaland] she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it and she would run out of court and run away.\u201d M told Dr. Waaland she would feel \u201cscared\u201d if she had to testify in front of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.9 does not require a finding that the testimony would be \u201cdistorted.\u201d Rather it requires the trial court to find a substantial likelihood that M would suffer severe emotional trauma as a result of testifying in open court in front of appellant. This determination was based on the testimony of two experts, whose credibility was for the trier of fact to determine. Credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">IV. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Lastly, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. He argues that the victim\u2019s testimony was inherently incredible and the evidence proved a lack of opportunity for him to commit the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">\u2018When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, we determine whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the Commonwealth, and the reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence support each and every element of the charged offense.\u201d <em>Haskins v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 145, 149-50, 521 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1999). \u201cIn so doing, we must discard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">A. M\u2019s Credibility</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">\u2018Witness credibility, the weight accorded the testimony and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder.\u201d <em>Byers v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 174, 179, 554 S.E.2d 714, 716 (2001). \u201cThe judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 153, 163, 515 S.E.2d 808, 813 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">M testified unequivocally that appellant \u201ctold [her] to suck his private part\u201d and that he put his private part \u201cin [her] mouth.\u201d Then, \u201cHe told me to lay back down____He got on top of me ... [and][h]e put his private part into mine.\u201d M stated that she could not breathe because appellant, who weighed 310 pounds, was laying on her stomach. When asked how she knew appellant was inside her, M stated \u201cbecause I feeled [sic] it---- It hurted [sic].\u201d She stated that this activity happened on more than one occasion and that each time was the same. M said she told appellant to \u201cstop\u201d but that he did not. She explained that she did not tell her cousin \u201cCause he told me not to. I was scared.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">This account comports with the other evidence adduced at trial. First, M gave her foster mother, Matty Williams, a substantially similar account when she initially made her complaint. Williams stated that M told her that she thought that appellant was trying to kill her because he was so heavy she could not breathe. \u201c[M] said [appellant] put his privates into her, and she couldn\u2019t breathe. That\u2019s why she thought he was trying to kill her.\u201d Additionally, M\u2019s testimony is consistent with a drawing she did at Dr. Waaland\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">She drew a picture of herself underneath, on the bed, [appellant] on top of her. At first she draw [sic] him her size, then she erased and said he was big, he smothered me, and very large out of her mouth she draw [sic] a little [balloon] that said, Stop, and she was screaming.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Finally, the medical evidence showed that M \u201cis a sexually abused child.\u201d Dr. Sinai explained that M\u2019s hymen had narrowing at the twelve to two position and that it was asymmetrical. Dr. Sinai stated that in her medical opinion the condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>tion of M\u2019s hymen was consistent with \u201ca painful penetrating injury.\u201d Credible evidence supported M\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">B. Lack of Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Lastly, appellant contends that he lacked the opportunity to commit the crimes. M stated that appellant subjected her to the abuse at night while her cousin was at work. She also stated that the only other person in the house on these occasions was Johnson\u2019s son, L.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">At trial, appellant submitted his work records and those of his wife.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several witnesses testified regarding the summer visitation M had with her paternal grandmother and appellant\u2019s summer visitation -with his children from a prior marriage. Taken together, this evidence showed that there were only two possible nights (June 11 and 15) that satisfied the conditions M gave. Although both Johnson and Light testified that Light generally watched the children when Johnson was working, neither could say whether the children were with Light on those two evenings.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The trial court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\">I think the case is about who you believe ... it basically comes down to two people. It comes down to [M] and it comes down to [appellant]. And it comes down to who I believe. Because if I believe [M], then [appellant] can\u2019t be telling the truth. And if I believe [appellant] then [M] can\u2019t be telling the truth....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">[T]here are some issues of timing and elements of time and where she was and who [M] was with ... and [counsel] does a good job of narrowing it down to possibly two nights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">^ ^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-12\">It comes down to who I believe.

Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-11\">. M had been living with her paternal grandmother in New York state since she was three days old. The record shows that M was bom while her mother was in jail. M\u2019s grandmother had physical custody of her continuously until she was 18 months old. After that time, M lived with her mother and her grandmother during the time her mother was incarcerated. The record is unclear why custody changed from the grandmother to the Johnsons.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. M then spent approximately a month with her father before leaving with her paternal grandmother to go to California. At the end of one year, M was returned to North Carolina and remained in North Carolina with her father and stepmother.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b660-13\">.
