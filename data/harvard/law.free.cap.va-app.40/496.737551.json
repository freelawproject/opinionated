For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">On August 14, 2001, Deputy Sheriff H.L. Gatewood, of the Pittsylvania County Sheriffs Department, spotted Norman\u2019s vehicle travelling east on Route 57. Because he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>given a B.O.L. (\u201cbe on the lookout\u201d) message for that car by the dispatcher, Deputy Gatewood stopped the car. When he approached the car, he observed that Norman was the sole occupant of the car. He asked Norman for identification, but Norman was unable to produce his driver\u2019s license. However, he told Gatewood that he had \u201ca license at home and it was a piece of paper issued by the Court.\u201d Deputy Gatewood observed that Norman had a gun in the car, which was lying on the front floorboard, with the barrel pointed toward the driver\u2019s side door. He further observed that Norman was \u201cseverely intoxicated.\u201d Gatewood arrested Norman for drunk driving and brandishing a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Gatewood checked Norman\u2019s social security number through his dispatcher and was told that Norman\u2019s driver\u2019s license was either \u201csuspended or revoked.\u201d He then proceeded to Norman\u2019s home to obtain Norman\u2019s license. Norman\u2019s girlfriend gave Deputy Gatewood a \u201cgreen sheet of paper,\u201d stating that Norman\u2019s privilege to drive was restricted pursuant to a May 4, 2001 court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">When he arrived at the police station, Deputy Gatewood ran Norman\u2019s criminal history and learned that he was a convicted felon. He also ran Norman\u2019s driver\u2019s license and found that he was indeed, driving on a restricted license. Norman was then additionally charged with driving as an habitual offender, second or subsequent offense, and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">At trial, the Commonwealth and Norman introduced several documents pertaining to the habitual offender charge. The documents are summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">1. An October 13, 1989 order from the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County, entering judgment on Norman\u2019s guilty plea of operating a motor vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender. The order directed that Norman be sentenced on the conviction to two years in prison, but suspended one year of the sentence on the conditions of good behavior and supervised probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>2. A December 20, 1999 order from the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County on Norman\u2019s petition \u201cfor restoration of his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Virginia,\u201d which had been suspended since April 12, 1984. The order directed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">Accordingly, the prayer of the petition should be granted, subject to the conditions set forth below ... it is ORDERED that pursuant to \u00a7 46.2-360 of the Virginia Code Annotated the privileges to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of Virginia should be restored and they are hereby restored to George Halcott Norman, III.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">It is further ORDERED that this is not a license or privilege to drive in itself; that ... petitioner is referred to Dan River ASAP for monitoring and supervision for twelve (12) months from the date of this Order; that the petitioner shall not possess or use alcohol, alcoholic beverages or drugs ...; that should petitioner incur any alcohol or drug related offense during the period of supervision as set forth herein, the Court may in its discretion issue process to the petitioner to show cause why his privilege to drive should not be suspended permanently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">The object of this proceeding having been accomplished, it is ORDERED that the same be, and it is hereby, removed from the docket and place[d] among the ended of cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">3. An order dated May 4, 2001, from the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County finding that Norman \u201cviolated the terms of the Court\u2019s Order of December 20, 1999,\u201d and granting Norman a restricted license to drive to work and to medical providers on the condition that he be monitored by Dan River ASAP for twelve months. The order directed that \u201cshould [Norman] have any violations of law during the period of supervision,\u201d his license would be \u201cpermanently\u201d revoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">4. An order issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, dated May 7, 2001, stating that Norman sought \u201ca restricted license after having been declared an habitual offender or having had [his] license revoked pursuant to Virginia Code \u00a7 46.2-391(B) three years or more prior to this date,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>giving Norman a one-year restricted license, pursuant to the May 4, 2001 court order, authorizing him to drive to and from work, to and from the Dan River ASAP office, and when medically necessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Norman argued that despite the May 4, 2001 order, restricting his driving privileges, the December 20, 1999 order had fully restored his driving privileges and, thus, he could no longer be considered an habitual offender for the purpose of the charge at issue. The Commonwealth responded that the December 20, 1999 order did not fully restore Norman\u2019s privileges, but only restored them on a conditional basis. The Commonwealth further contended that the conditional restoration was revoked by the circuit court when Norman violated the terms of the December 20, 1999 order and was issued a restricted license on May 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth, finding that by signing the DMV order of May 7, 2001, Norman acknowledged that his status as an habitual offender remained in effect, despite the purported restoration of his driving privileges in the December 20, 1999 order. The court then found him guilty of the habitual offender charge and sentenced him to serve two years in prison on that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">On appeal, Norman contends that the trial court erred in finding the evidence sufficient to support his conviction for operating a motor vehicle after having been declared an habitual offender. As he argued below, Norman maintains that the circuit court fully restored his driving privileges in its December 20,1999 order and that, therefore, he was no longer an habitual offender at the time of the offense at issue. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">We first note that the standard for appellate review of criminal convictions is well established. \u2018When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we are required to review the evidence \u2018in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deduc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ible therefrom.\u2019\u201d <em>Collins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 177, 179, 409 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1991) (quoting <em>Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975)). \u201cThe conviction will not be reversed unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Id.; see also </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-680.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) defines the felony offense of driving after being declared an habitual offender. \u201cIn pertinent part, Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A) states that \u2018[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to drive any motor vehicle ... on the highways of the Commonwealth while the revocation of the person\u2019s driving privilege remains in effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Varga v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 547, 550, 536 S.E.2d 711, 713 (2000) (quoting Code \u00a7 46.2-357(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-360 permits any person declared an habitual offender to petition the court for restoration of his or her driving privileges, providing as follows in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Any person who has been found to be an habitual offender where the determination or adjudication was based in part and dependent on a conviction as set out in subdivision 1 b of former \u00a7 46.2-351, may petition the court in which he was found to be an habitual offender, or the circuit court in the political subdivision in which he then resides to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">1. Restore his privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth, provided that five years have elapsed from the date of the final order of a court entered under this article, or if no such order was entered then the notice of the determination by the Commissioner. On such petition, and for good cause shown, <em>the court may, in its discretion, restore to the person the privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth on whatever conditions the court may </em>prescribe....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">2. Issue a restricted permit to authorize such person to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth in the course of his employment, to and from his home to the place of his employment or such other medically necessary travel as the court deems necessary and proper upon written verification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of need by a licensed physician, provided that three years have elapsed from the date of the final order, or if no such order was entered then the notice of the determination by the Commissioner....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">Reading the habitual offender statutes <em>in pa\u00f1 materia, </em>it is clear that once a person is declared an habitual offender by order of a trial court, he retains that status and loses his driving privilege for so long as the order is effective. Thus, ... the habitual offender status of the person so declared continues until that person successfully petitions the court to have that status removed and his privilege to drive restored under one of the code sections permitting such petitions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\"><em>Varga, </em>260 Va. at 551, 536 S.E.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Code \u00a7 46.2-360 is one of the code sections that allows a court to remove an individual\u2019s status as an habitual offender and to restore his or her privilege to drive. Indeed, that particular code section permits the court to: 1) fully restore an individual\u2019s driving privileges; 2) restore an individual\u2019s driving privileges on certain conditions; or 3) grant an individual a restricted driving privilege, allowing the individual to drive only to and from work, when medically necessary, or to where the trial court otherwise deems necessary. <em>See Travis v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 410, 415, 457 S.E.2d 420, 422 (1995) (noting that relief under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2) provides for a restricted license, whereas Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1) provides for \u201ca full restoration of driving privileges\u201d); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">The parties do not dispute that here, in its December 20, 1999 order, the trial court granted Norman a \u201crestoration\u201d of his driving privileges, as opposed to a \u201crestricted\u201d privilege to drive. However, although the order appears somewhat inartfully written, when read as a whole, the trial court\u2019s order makes it clear that it granted Norman\u2019s petition for restoration, subject to certain conditions contained in the order. Specifically, the order required Norman to \u201cpresent himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and [the] Order to the Department of Motor Vehicles for such administrative proceedings and payment of fees and costs as may be required,\u201d to present himself \u201cto Dan River ASAP for monitoring and supervision for twelve (12) months from the date of [the] Order,\u201d and to refrain from possessing or using \u201calcohol, alcoholic beverages or drugs.\u201d The order further provided that if Norman were to \u201cincur any alcohol or drug related offense during the period of supervision as set forth herein, the Court may in its discretion issue process to [Norman] to show cause why his privilege to drive should not be suspended permanently.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the court\u2019s actions, most significantly its conditional restoration of Norman\u2019s driving privileges and its continuing retention of authority over Norman\u2019s privilege to drive, belie Norman\u2019s assertion that his adjudication as an habitual offender was no longer valid pursuant to the December 20, 1999 order. <em>See Travis, </em>20 Va.App. at 415, 457 S.E.2d at 422.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Moreover, as the trial court correctly noted, Norman was aware that he retained habitual offender status when the circuit court found that he violated the provisions of the December 20, 1999 order and, by its order of May 4, 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>revoked his \u201cfull\u201d driving privileges, granting him instead, restricted driving privileges. Indeed, when he signed the resulting Restricted Driver\u2019s License Order, on May 7, 2001, Norman acknowledged that he was granted the restricted license privilege \u201cafter having been adjudicated/determined to be an habitual offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly found the evidence sufficient to establish Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender at the time of the offense, and we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b537-14\">. Norman was also convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol, second offense within five years, possessing a firearm as a convicted felon and brandishing a firearm. Norman pleaded guilty to these charges and does not raise any issues as to these convictions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\">. Since the issue is not before us, we need not consider here the authority of the trial court to \"permanently\u201d suspend the privilege to drive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">. The dissent\u2019s contrary interpretation of the statute renders the plain and unambiguous language of the statute meaningless. Indeed, the dissent recognizes that a conditional restoration is available pursuant to the terms of the statute. Nevertheless, in its analysis, the dissent ignores the term \"conditional\u201d and finds that <em>any </em>\"restoration\u201d of an individual\u2019s privilege to drive necessarily operates to remove the individual\u2019s status as an habitual offender and <em>fully </em>\"restores\u201d their privilege to drive, despite any statutorily permitted conditions imposed by a trial court. <em>See Shelor Motor Co. v. Miller, </em>261 Va. 473, 479, 544 S.E.2d 345, 348 (2001) (\"When the legislature has used words of a plain and definite meaning, courts cannot accord those words a meaning that amounts to holding that the legislature did not mean what it actually expressed.\u201d); <em>see also Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Partnership, </em>255 Va. 335, 340, 497 S.E.2d 335, 338 (1998) (noting the \"settled principle of statutoiy construction that every part of a statute is presumed to have some effect and no part will be considered meaningless unless absolutely necessary\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b544-7\">CLEMENTS, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AR9\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion. The dispositive issue in this case is whether the trial court\u2019s December 20, 1999 order restoring Norman\u2019s driving privileges terminated his status as an habitual offender. The majority concludes that, because the December 20, 1999 order provided, pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-360, for the conditional, rather than full, restoration of Norman\u2019s driving privileges, that order did not terminate Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender. I disagree with the majority\u2019s premise and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">As the majority notes, \u201cthe habitual offender status of [a] person so declared continues until that person successfully petitions the court to have that status removed and his privilege to drive restored.\u201d <em>Varga v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 547, 551, 536 S.E.2d 711, 714 (2000). Here, as reflected in the trial court\u2019s December 20, 1999 order, Norman petitioned the court \u201cfor restoration of his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in Virginia.\u201d The trial court, finding that Norman\u2019s petition to restore his driving privileges \u201cshould be granted, subject to the conditions set forth\u201d in the order, ordered that \u201cpursuant to [Code] \u00a7 46.2-360 ... the privileges to operate a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth of Virginia should be restored and they are hereby restored to\u201d Norman. The trial court further ordered that Norman (1) report to the Depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment of Motor Vehicles before driving \u201cfor such administrative proceedings and payment[s] ... as may be required,\u201d (2) be monitored and supervised by \u201cDan River ASAP\u201d for one year, and (3) \u201cnot possess or use alcohol ... or drugs.\u201d The court further stated that, should Norman \u201cincur any alcohol or drug related offense during the period of supervision as set forth herein, the Court may in its discretion issue process to the petitioner to show cause why his privilege to drive should not be suspended permanently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1), which pertains to petitions to restore driving privileges,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides, in pertinent part, that the court may, in granting a petitioner\u2019s request for restoration of his or her driving privileges, \u201crestore to the person the privilege to drive a motor vehicle in the Commonwealth on whatever conditions the court may prescribe\u201d or, \u201cin lieu of restoring the person\u2019s privilege to drive, authorize the issuance of a restricted license.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">Under basic rules of statutory construction, we examine a statute in its entirety, rather than by isolating particular words or phrases. When the language in a statute is clear and unambiguous, we are bound by the plain meaning of that language. We must determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent from the words appearing in the statute, unless a literal construction of the statute would yield an absurd result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-7\"><em>Cummings v. Fulghum, </em>261 Va. 73, 77, 540 S.E.2d 494, 496 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Applying these principles, I find that the legislature clearly intended that a court acting on a petition for restoration of driving privileges be permitted to take one of three actions under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(l):(l) deny the petition; (2) restore the person\u2019s driving privileges, with or without conditions; or (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>grant a restricted license. The statute draws no distinction between a \u201cfull restoration\u201d and a \u201cconditional restoration.\u201d Hence, an individual\u2019s privilege to drive is either restored or not restored under Code \u00a7 46.2-360(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Citing <em>Travis v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 410, 415, 457 S.E.2d 420, 422 (1995), Norman acknowledges in his appellate brief that one who has been granted only a restricted license \u201cretains his habitual offender status.\u201d As the majority points out, however, it is undisputed in this case that the trial court did not grant Norman a restricted license but granted him a \u201crestoration\u201d of his privilege to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Accordingly, the conclusion must be reached that, in entering the December 20, 1999 order, the trial court restored Norman\u2019s driving privileges. Based on that order, the Department of Motor Vehicles would have undoubtedly issued Norman a full, unrestricted operator\u2019s license. The fact that the court prescribed certain conditions in restoring Norman\u2019s privilege to drive and, thus, retained authority to enforce those conditions does not alter the conclusion that Norman\u2019s privilege to drive was restored. Indeed, given that the court cannot logically suspend what does not exist, the trial court\u2019s admonition that it might suspend Norman\u2019s \u201cprivilege to drive\u201d permanently if he failed to comply with the court\u2019s conditions only buttresses the conclusion that the court intended to restore Norman\u2019s driving privileges on December 20, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">I would hold, therefore, that the trial court\u2019s order of December 20, 1999, terminated Norman\u2019s status as an habitual offender on that date. <em>See Varga, </em>260 Va. at 552, 536 S.E.2d at 714 (holding that one\u2019s habitual offender status \u201cremains in force until that person actually has his privilege to drive restored\u201d). I would also hold that, because no court declared him an habitual offender subsequent to that date, Norman was not an habitual offender when he drove on August 14, 2001,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the trial court erred in finding him so.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>For these reasons, I would reverse Norman\u2019s conviction for driving as an habitual offender, second or subsequent offense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-9\">. In reciting what it says is the \"relevant part\u201d of Code \u00a7 46.2-360, the majority includes subsection 2 of that statute in its recitation. That subsection, however, relates only to petitions for the issuance of a restricted license. Thus, because Norman\u2019s petition was for restoration of his privilege to drive rather than for a restricted license. Code \u00a7 46.2-360(2) is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b546-7\">. I believe the majority\u2019s reliance on the trial court\u2019s finding that \"Norman was aware that he retained habitual offender status\u201d after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>December 20, 1999, is misplaced. Norman\u2019s perceptions and beliefs have no bearing on the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s December 20, 1999 order terminated his status as an habitual offender, the resolution of which is purely a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
