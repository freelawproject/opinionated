Reed medical benefits for coal workers\u2019 pneumoconiosis (CWP) pursuant to our decision in <em>Jones v. E.I DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>24 Va.App. 36, 480 S.E.2d 129 (1997). The appellant, Clinchfield Coal Company, appeals this award urging us to reverse <em>Jones. </em>Short of that, Clinchfield argues that we should limit <em>Jones </em>to cases involving asbestosis and not apply it to claimants with CWP. Finally, Clinchfield asserts that the medical evidence fails as a matter of law to demonstrate that Reed has CWP at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-12\">We affirm the commission and hold that (i) we have no authority to revisit <em>Jones, </em>(ii) both the rationale and the holding of <em>Jones </em>govern CWP as well as asbestosis, and (iii) the commission did not err in finding that Reed has CWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">On appeal, \u201cwe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party\u201d before the commission. <em>Tomes v. James City (County Of) Fire, </em>39 Va.App. 424, 429, 573 S.E.2d 312, 315 (2002); <em>Grayson County Sch. Bd. v. Cornett, </em>39 Va.App. 279, 281, 572 S.E.2d 505, 506 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Dr. Kathleen DePonte diagnosed Reed with CWP (sometimes known as black lung disease) on April 6, 2001. \u201cCoal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis is a disease of the lung that results from the accumulation of coal dust in the lungs.\u201d <em>Penley v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>8 Va.App. 310, 312, 381 S.E.2d 231, 233 (1989). On April 13, 2001, Reed filed an occupational disease claim seeking benefits for the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Clinchfield conceded Dr. DePonte\u2019s communication of diagnosis and stipulated that Reed was \u201clast injuriously exposed to the hazards of coal dust while working\u201d for Clinchfield. Reed, in turn, agreed to be bound by the diagnostic findings of The Medical College of Virginia Occupational/Pulmonary Committee (the \u201cpulmonary committee\u201d). <em>See </em>Va. Work. Comp. R. 10.2 &amp; 10.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The deputy commissioner found \u201cfrom the opinion expressed by the pulmonary committee that claimant has less than a category one level of the disease and is therefore not entitled to weekly benefits.\u201d The deputy commissioner, however, noted \u201cthe pulmonary committee advised that claimant does have evidence of the disease and that he has small opacities classified as qq in the four upper lung zones with a profusion of 0/1.\u201d Since there was \u201cno contrary medical opinion of record,\u201d the deputy commissioner held, on the basis of <em>Jones, </em>that Reed was entitled to a medical award. Clinch-field requested review by the full commission, which affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Though we defer to the commission in its role as fact finder, we \u201creview questions of law <em>de novo,\u201d Rusty\u2019s Welding Serv., Inc. v. Gibson, </em>29 Va.App. 119, 127, 510 S.E.2d 255, 259 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>(1999), and do not consider ourselves \u201cbound by the legal determinations made by the commission.\u201d <em>Grayson County Sch. Bd., </em>89 Va.App. at 281, 572 S.E.2d at 506 (quoting <em>Robinson v. Salvation Army, </em>20 Va.App. 570, 572, 459 S.E.2d 103, 104 (1995)); <em>see also Sturtz v. Chesapeake Corp., </em>38 Va.App. 672, 675, 568 S.E.2d 381, 383 (2002). Even so, with regard to the commission\u2019s interpretation of its enabling statutes, \u201cwe follow the settled rule that the construction accorded a statute by public officials charged with its administration is entitled to be given weight by the courts.\u201d <em>Sturtz, </em>38 Va.App. at 675, 568 S.E.2d at 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should be regarded as \u201cremedial legislation and should be liberally construed in favor of the injured employee.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Eggleston, </em>264 Va. 13, 17, 563 S.E.2d 685, 687 (2002) (citing <em>Byrd v. Stonega Coke &amp; Coal Co., </em>182 Va. 212, 221, 28 S.E.2d 725, 729 (1943)). That liberality, however, has its limits. We cannot \u201cpermit a liberal construction to change the meaning of the statutory language or the purpose of the Act.\u201d <em>American Furniture Co. v. Doane, </em>230 Va. 39, 42, 334 S.E.2d 548, 550 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Clinchfield first urges us to overrule <em>Jones v. E.I DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>24 Va.App. 36, 480 S.E.2d 129 (1997). Under our rule of interpanel accord, however, we lack the authority to revisit <em>Jones. See Commonwealth v. Burns, </em>240 Va. 171, 174, 395 S.E.2d 456, 457 (1990) (quoting <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987)). The decision of one panel \u201cbecomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis\u201d </em>and cannot be overruled except by the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 425, 430, 478 S.E.2d 539, 541 (1996). This principle applies not merely to the literal holding of the case, but also to its <em>ratio decidendi </em>\u2014 the essential rationale in the case that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>determines the judgment. For this reason, we reject Clinch-field\u2019s request that <em>Jones </em>be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Clinchfield next argues that <em>Jones </em>does not apply to cases involving medical benefits for CWP. On this point, Clinchfield appears to divide the fact-specific holding of <em>Jones </em>from its <em>ratio decidendi </em>\u2014 urging that only the former, but not the latter, has <em>stare decisis </em>weight. We do not accept this segmentation of <em>Jones, </em>finding its rationale and result equally applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\"><em>Jones </em>addressed the question whether an employee with asbestosis was entitled to medical benefits even though the disease had not risen to the level of a \u201cpermanent loss\u201d under Code \u00a7 65.2-503. The employer argued that an occupational disease which \u201chas not reached a ratable level under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 is not a compensable occupational disease and renders the claimant ineligible for any benefits under the Act.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>24 Va.App. at 38, 480 S.E.2d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\"><em>Jones </em>rejected the employer\u2019s argument, ruling that \u201c[s]imply because the disease fails to rise to the level of a permanent loss on the schedule of Code \u00a7 65.2-503 does not automatically preclude an award of medical benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, \u201cCode \u00a7 65.2-403 allows an award of medical benefits to employees who have an occupational disease covered by the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After reviewing the \u201cstatutory language and the factual findings of the commission,\u201d <em>Jones </em>found that the employee\u2019s condition fell \u201cwithin the definition of an occupational disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this analysis, \u201cwhether a permanent loss compensable under Code \u00a7 65.2-503 accompanies the disease has no impact upon an award under Code \u00a7 65.2-403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The employee in <em>Jones, </em>therefore, was \u201centitled to medical benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-403.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\"><em>Jones </em>relies on the plain language of Code \u00a7 65.2-403(B), which states that an \u201cemployee who has an occupational disease that is covered by this title shall be entitled to the same hospital, medical and miscellaneous benefits as an em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>ployee who has a compensable injury by accident.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>24 Va.App. at 38, 480 S.E.2d at 130. Nothing in Code \u00a7 65.2-403(B) requires that the occupational disease qualify for permanent loss or disability compensation before medical benefits may be awarded. Under Code \u00a7 65.2-403(B), the sole inquiry is whether the disease qualifies as an \u201coccupational disease that is covered by this title\u201d \u2014 if so, medical benefits may be awarded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><em>Jones </em>equates occupational diseases to injuries by accident for purposes of medical benefits. By doing so, <em>Jones </em>recognizes that both sets of conditions can give rise to two unique categories of benefits. <em>See generally </em>Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 57.10 (1999). The first category of benefits consists of \u201cwage loss payments based on the concept of disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second category consists of the \u201cpayment of hospital and medical expenses occasioned by any work-connected injury, <em>regardless of wage loss or disability.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>We disagree with Clinchfield that, for purposes of medical benefits under <em>Jones, </em>CWP should be treated differently than asbestosis. It is true that the Act often distinguishes between the two. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 65.2-405 (notice provisions); Code \u00a7 65.2-406 (limitations); Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-503 and 65.2-504 (permanent loss and disability). But on the critical point \u2014 medical benefits \u2014 Code \u00a7 65.2-403(B) makes no distinction between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Moreover, as the commission noted, \u201cpneumoconiosis is a generic term used to describe a chronic fibrous reaction in the lungs related to the inhalation of dust, and includes asbestosis, silicosis, byssiniosis, coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and siderosis.\u201d As the commission further noted, \u201cAsbestosis is but one of the several occupationally-induced pneumoconioses for which workers\u2019 compensation benefits, including medical benefits, are available.\u201d Like other pneumoconioses, the Act treats asbestosis and CWP substantially alike when measuring the progressive \u201cstages\u201d of the diseases. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.2-503, 65.2-504; Va. Work. Comp. R. 11. The rationale of <em>Jones, </em>therefore, applies equally to CWP as well as to asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Clinchfield also argues that, even if Code \u00a7 65.2-403 authorizes medical benefits in the absence of a compensable occupational disease, the claimant must still prove he has a disease in the first place. As Clinchfield sees it, Reed\u2019s condition cannot be treated as a \u201cdisease\u201d because the pulmo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>nary committee rated his radiographs as category 0/1 as defined by the <em>Guidelines for the Use of ILO International Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses, </em>ILO Occup. Safety and Health Ser. No. 22 (rev. ed.1980). That rating, Clinchfield asserts, means that no recognizable CWP can exist as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Clinchfield bases its argument predominantly on a chart contained in a law review article written by a physician. <em>See </em>N. LeRoy Lapp, <em>A Lawyer\u2019s Medical Guide to Black Lung Litigation, </em>83 W. Va. L.Rev. 721, 729-31 (1981). The chart, reproduced below, purports to divide the ILO categories into two diagnostic subsets: \u201cNo Pneumoconiosis\u201d and \u201cDefinite Pneumoconiosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">0/- 0/0 0/1 1/0 1/1 1/2 2/1 2/2 2/3 3/2 3/3 3/4</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Category 0 Category 1 Category 2 Category 3</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">No Definite Pneumoconiosis</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">Pneumoconiosis</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">We published this chart in <em>Penley, </em>8 Va.App. at 312, 381 S.E.2d at 233, as a part of a general description of the \u201cradiology of coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis.\u201d Though we treated the chart as informative, neither our holding in <em>Penley </em>nor its rationale turned on the line drawn between the \u201cNo Pneumoconiosis\u201d and the \u201cDefinite Pneumoconiosis\u201d subsets separating ILO category 0 from categories 1, 2, and 3.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether such a categorical line exists, therefore, merits closer scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Our analysis begins with Code \u00a7 65.2-403(B), which <em>Jones </em>held authorizes medical benefits when the claimant\u2019s disease qualifies as an \u201coccupational disease that is covered by this title.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree with Clinchfield that the 1980 ILO Guidelines play a valuable role in determining whether the disease of CWP exists. To be sure, the three statutory \u201cstages\u201d employed by Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.503(B) and 65.2-504(A) incorporate by reference the 1980 ILO Guidelines. <em>See also </em>Va. Work. Comp. R. 11 (table converting multiple ILO \u201ccategories\u201d to one of three statutory \u201cstages\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The principal purpose of the 1980 ILO Guidelines, however, is to provide \u201ca means for recording systematically the radiographic abnormalities in the chest provoked by the inhalation of dusts.\u201d 1980 ILO Guidelines at 1. The ILO Guidelines do not \u201cdefine pathological entities,\u201d <em>id., </em>or serve as an inflexible matrix for pinpointing the moment a nascent condition develops into a diagnosable lung disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">We reject Clinchfield\u2019s argument that, under ILO interpretative principles, Reed\u2019s 0/1 profusion rating disqualifies him as a matter of law from receiving a CWP diagnosis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That rating does not, standing alone, disprove the existence of CWP. Under the ILO Guidelines, if the pulmonary committee had concluded that the appearances were \u201cdefinitely not pneu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>moconiosis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 3, no profusion rating would have been assigned at all and the committee would have relied only on the Symbols and Comments sections of the ILO Form. Symbols denote alternative diagnoses such as cancer, emphysema, fractured ribs, tuberculosis, and the like. <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. \u201cComments must be recorded about appearances which are definitely or probably not pneumoconiosis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. In addition, the pulmonary committee noted that the size and shape of Reed\u2019s small, rounded opacities fit within the \u201cq\u201d level, denoting sizes between 1.5 and 3 millimeters. <em>Id. </em>at 6. For these reasons, we hold that the commission had before it credible medical evidence that Reed suffered from CWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In sum, we have no authority to revisit <em>Jones. </em>Both the rationale and the holding of <em>Jones </em>apply to CWP just as much as they do to asbestosis. Under <em>Jones, </em>the commission had sufficient evidence to conclude that Reed has CWP, an occupational disease warranting medical benefits under Code \u00a7 65.2-403(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b115-5\">. Clinchfield cites dicta in <em>Parris v. Appalachian Power Co., </em>2 Va.App. 219, 343 S.E.2d 455 (1986), to support its argument that \"occupational diseases are not per se compensable.\u201d This language was taken from a headnote in <em>Long v. W. Va. Pulp &amp; Paper Co., </em>46 O.I.C. 140, 141 (1964), and was unnecessary to our decision in <em>Parris </em>regarding whether the statute of limitations had run on a workers\u2019 compensation claim. Moreover, <em>Long, </em>the opinion underlying the <em>Parris </em>dicta, decided only the issue whether the claimant was entitled to wage compensation \u2014 it made no rulings regarding medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Clinchfield also cites <em>Merrimac Anthracite Coal Corp. v. Showalter, </em>158 Va. 227, 163 S.E. 73 (1932), for the proposition that \"in a case of injury by accident, a medical award cannot be issued unless the claimant suffered a compensable injury by accident.\u201d In <em>Merrimac, </em>however, the claimant was denied not only medical benefits, but all benefits because the \u201cinjury was the result of his wilful [sic] misconduct. ...\u201d The Act, therefore, expressly barred the claimant from receiving any compensation at all. <em>Merrimac </em>does not distinguish medical benefits from wage and disability compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">.
