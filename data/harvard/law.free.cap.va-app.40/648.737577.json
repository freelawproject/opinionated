For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">On appeal, we view the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below, together with all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Ortega v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 779, 786, 525 S.E.2d 623, 627 (2000). Viewed accordingly, the evidence shows that Walter Sorto was called as a prospective juror for SamudioPerez\u2019s trial in October 2001. The prosecutor asked the prospective jurors if any of them or a family member had been the victim of a sexual assault. Sorto told the court his nephew had assaulted his daughter four years earlier. After the prosecution informed Sorto the case did not involve sexual assault within a family, Sorto indicated he could be fair to both sides. Defense counsel did not ask Sorto any questions and did not move to strike him for cause. The court impaneled the jury, including Sorto, and counsel gave opening statements. After a short recess, the judge discovered that a detective in the case, David E. Moore, had investigated the case involving Sorto\u2019s daughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sorto had not recognized Detective Moore during opening statements. The judge brought Sorto into the courtroom and counsel questioned him about his relationship with Detective Moore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>THE COURT: Mr. Sorto, over break, it came to my attention that Detective Moore, who is involved with this case, may have been involved with yonr daughter\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">MR. SORTO: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">THE COURT: Has that come to your recollection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">MR. SORTO: I was actually \u2014 I didn\u2019t see him sitting right there. But later on, when we were talking, I saw him right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">THE COURT: Now that you\u2019ve come to that realization that he is the same one, how does that affect your feeling about the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">MR. SORTO: It doesn\u2019t really affect me at all. I\u2019ve been through this. He was professional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-10\">THE COURT: Did you talk to Detective Moore in the course of the investigation of your daughter\u2019s case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-11\">MR. SORTO: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-12\">MS. SWART: Mr. Sorto, in your dealings with Detective Moore \u2014 we\u2019re not asking if you liked him or disliked him as a person or anything like that. In this case, as I told you in opening statements, he\u2019s going to be testifying as to the entire interview with this defendant. Are you going to be able to set aside your personal experience with Detective Moore with your daughter\u2019s case and listen to the whole statement and assess his credibility, what he says, on what he says here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-13\">MR. SORTO: Basically, whatever comes here right now\u2014 comes up right now is basically what I have to decide. I\u2019m not going to through [sic] anybody\u2019s judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-14\">MS. SWART: That\u2019s all the questions I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-15\">THE COURT: All right, Mr. Finch. Do you have any questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-16\">MR. FINCH: One or two. Sir, you had a phone sting that was done in your house with Detective Moore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-17\">MR. SORTO: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-18\">MR. FINCH: He conducted it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-19\">MR. SORTO: That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>MR. FINCH: So you got to know each other a little bit. If it was his word against somebody else\u2019s, wouldn\u2019t you favor Mr. Moore\u2019s word?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">MR. SORTO: Not at all. It comes to my mind that if I\u2019m here, as she mentioned right now, just basically whatever is proved or any other type problems that comes up [sic], that\u2019s basically it. See, I don\u2019t see Mr. Moore as somebody who\u2019s going to interrupt [sic] this kind of situation. I mean, he\u2019s been through my case and I know him basically for that particular occasion, but that\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">MR. FINCH: But you were favorably impressed with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">MR. SORTO: Well, I can\u2019t say that right now. I can\u2019t say he was favorable or not. But I haven\u2019t heard anything yet to say, you know, of anything [sic]. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">MS. SWART: Did you have a favorable impression of Detective Moore from that incident [his daughter\u2019s investigation]? Not now, but back then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">MR. SORTO: From that particular incident, I did. He was a very professional man for that particular case. We should believe he did a great job personally on that case [sic]. I don\u2019t know about this. So I can\u2019t say anything right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">MS. SWART: Today, when he raises his right hand and swears to tell the truth, in your mind are you going to sit there and say, whatever he says is going to be the truth or are you going to sit and listen to his while testimony and try to figure it out then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-11\">MR. SORTO: Well, I\u2019d rather say listen to the testimony than rather say something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-12\">THE COURT: All right. Thank you, sir. You may go back to the jury room.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-13\">Defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on Sorto\u2019s prior relationship with Detective Moore.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>motion, stating \u201cI just can\u2019t conclude that he\u2019s got any kind of a bias or pre-disposition one way or another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">During the investigation, Detective Moore was not the lead investigator on the case, however, he interviewed SamudioPerez because he speaks Spanish, Samudio-Perez\u2019s native language. Detective Moore did not record Samudio-Perez\u2019s statements and relied only on his notes from the interview for his testimony. Detective Moore testified that Samudio-Perez made an incriminating statement to him, specifically noting Samudio-Perez\u2019s admission that the sexual encounter between Samudio-Perez and the victim occurred without her consent. On direct examination, Samudio-Perez denied making the incriminating statement to Detective Moore and stated Moore suggested he write a letter to the victim. Samudio-Perez wrote the letter, which also incriminated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Samudio-Perez\u2019s appeal comes to us on a denial of a motion for a mistrial. Upon familiar principles, we will not reverse the denial of a motion for a mistrial unless a manifest probability exists that the trial court\u2019s ruling was prejudicial. <em>See Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 12, 17, 486 S.E.2d 108, 110 (1997) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We turn now to the substantive issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>II. <em>Denial of Motion for Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Under the standard of review set forth above, the party moving for mistrial, in this case, Samudio-Perez, has the burden of establishing a manifest probability of prejudice. <em>See Taylor, 25 </em>Va.App. at 17, 486 S.E.2d at 110. To determine if a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial was prejudicial, when a juror\u2019s conduct is at issue, we must look to the juror\u2019s possible bias. The existence of an individual juror\u2019s possible bias or partiality is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. <em>See Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 480, 331 S.E.2d 422, 431 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099, 106 S.Ct. 1503, 89 L.Ed.2d 903 (1986). Additionally, \u201c[i]t is well settled that the credibility of witnesses [and] the weight accorded witnesses\u2019 testimony ... are matters that are within the province of the fact finder.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 171, 192, 487 S.E.2d 248, 258 (1997) (citing <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 107, 341 S.E.2d 190, 193 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The trial court was in the best position to consider Sorto\u2019s response to counsel\u2019s questions and resolved the issue of possible bias in favor of Sorto and the Commonwealth. Sorto repeatedly informed the court he was able to address the issues impartially and stated he would not favor Detective Moore\u2019s testimony over another witness\u2019 testimony. Furthermore, Sorto stated he could not determine if Detective Moore had conducted himself professionally in the case at bar until he considered the evidence. After further questioning of Sorto by counsel, the trial judge made a finding of fact that Sorto could be a fair and impartial juror, stating she could not conclude \u201c[Sorto]\u2019s got any kind of a bias or pre-disposition one way or another.\u201d Viewing this evidence in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>favorable to the Commonwealth, we find there was no \u201cmanifest probability\u201d that the denial of a mistrial was prejudicial to Samudio-Perez. <em>See Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 558, 499 S.E.2d 522 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>527 U.S. 116, 119 S.Ct. 1887, 144 L.Ed.2d 117 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Samudio-Perez further argues that, if we find Sorto could have been stricken for cause, then the denial of the motion for a mistrial should be reversed. In determining a juror\u2019s possible bias, we may consider whether the juror could have been stricken for cause. <em>See Taylor, </em>25 Va.App. at 18, 486 S.E.2d at 111. When there are no grounds to strike a juror for cause, the juror\u2019s presence on the jury will not affect the essential fairness of a trial and, therefore, we cannot find that prejudice exists. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In the case at bar, as we have noted, the trial court found as fact that Sorto was a fair and unbiased juror. Thus, no ground for a strike for cause was established. Moreover, Sorto\u2019s relationship with Moore does not establish a <em>per se </em>disqualification of Sorto as a juror under Virginia law. <em>See Clozza v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 124, 135, 321 S.E.2d 273, 279 (1984) (holding a prospective juror is not subject to \u201cautomatic exclusion because of an association with law enforcement\u201d). We have long held that a juror\u2019s relationship to a witness does not require his dismissal <em>per se. See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 569-70, 499 S.E.2d at 531. In <em>Lilly, </em>the Supreme Court evaluated the propriety of seating a juror who had a prior relationship with a police officer witness and stated: \u201cA juror\u2019s relationship to such a police officer witness does not require <em>per se </em>dismissal of that juror from the venire, and the juror may be retained if the trial court is satisfied that the juror can set aside considerations of the relationship and evaluate all the evidence fairly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570, 499 S.E.2d at 531. Given these principles and the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Sorto could set aside his prior relationship with Detective Moore and evaluate the evidence fairly and impartially, we find that Samudio-Perez\u2019s grounds for reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of his mistrial motion are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Samudio-Perez finally argues that permitting Sorto to remain on the jury would erode public confidence in the integrity of criminal trials. To support his argument, Samudio-Perez relies on several recent cases, decided by the Virginia Supreme Court, in which the court determined that \u201c \u2018[p]ublic confidence in the integrity of the process is also at stake,\u2019 \u201d when a juror\u2019s selection is questioned, and is a factor to consider in determining whether a potential juror should be seated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 51, 523 S.E.2d 502, 504 (2000); <em>see also Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 553 S.E.2d 731 (2001); <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">In <em>Cantrell, </em>a juror was a client of a law firm representing one of the parties at trial. Although the trial court determined that the juror could be fair to both sides, the Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, stating, \u201c[Public confidence in the integrity of the process] cannot be promoted when a sitting juror is, at the time of trial, a client of the law firm representing one of the parties to the litigation____\u201d <em>Cantrell, </em>259 Va. at 51, 523 S.E.2d at 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The Supreme Court addressed the issue again in <em>Medici, </em>a case in which a potential juror\u2019s husband had been murdered and the person accused of his murder was represented by the same public defender\u2019s office as Medici, the defendant. The juror stated she could judge the evidence fairly and impartially and she was impaneled. The Supreme Court reversed and held the trial court erred in not striking the juror for cause, concluding that \u201cpermitting her to sit as a juror, in the circumstances of this case ... weakened] public confidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the integrity of criminal trials.\u201d <em>Medici </em>260 Va. at 227, 582 S.E.2d at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Finally, the Supreme Court underscored the importance of safeguarding public confidence in jury selection in <em>Barrett, </em>where a prospective juror\u2019s brother was a police officer who would testify for the Commonwealth during the trial. The trial court found the juror could be fair and impartial and denied Barrett\u2019s motion to strike the juror for cause. The Supreme Court reversed the trial court\u2019s decision, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">Our consideration of prospective juror Wade\u2019s answers gives us no reason to question the honesty and sincerity of his determination to discharge his duties as juror in an unbiased manner----However in <em>[Medici </em>and Cantrell] ... we recognized that in constituting the jury panel, \u201c[pjublic confidence in the integrity of the process\u201d is also \u201cat stake.\u201d ... In the recited circumstances of this case we think that a refusal to strike the prospective juror for cause makes it unlikely that the public would have confidence in the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\"><em>Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826-27, 553 S.E.2d at 733 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Citing these principles, Samudio-Perez contends the relationship between Sorto and Detective Moore \u201ccreates the perception that the integrity of the [judicial] process is at stake\u201d and that permitting Sorto to remain on the jury would \u201cweaken the public confidence in the integrity of criminal trials.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">All the challenged jurors in <em>Cantrell, Medici, </em>and <em>Barrett </em>had in common a contemporaneous and continuing relationship with legal counsel or a witness in the case. By contrast, Sorto had a single contact with Moore four years earlier, but had no contemporaneous or continuing relationship with him. Thus, Sorto\u2019s prior \u201crelationship\u201d with Detective Moore bears no affinity to the types of juror relationships found prejudicial in <em>Cantrell </em>and its progeny. We, therefore, find no error in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>trial court\u2019s refusal of Samudio-Perez\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-8\">. The jury acquitted Samudio-Perez on a charge of animate object penetration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-9\">. The detective recognized Sorto and wrote a note to the assistant Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, who brought the matter to the judge\u2019s attention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b693-14\">. Samudio-Perez also asserted Sorto could have been stricken for cause had the relationship come to light during <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b694-9\">. Samudio-Perez argues the case at bar is governed by the same standards we set forth in <em>Green v. Commonwealth, 26 </em>Va.App. 394, 494 S.E.2d 888 (1998). We find his reliance on <em>Green </em>is misplaced. In <em>Green, </em>the defendant moved for a mistrial based on a juror\u2019s failure to truthfully answer a question during <em>voir dire. Id. </em>at 399, 494 S.E.2d at 890. The court recited the standard of review as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">CT]o be entitled to a mistrial for <em>jury misconduct arising from voir dire, </em>\"a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <em>voir dire, </em>and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 401, 494 S.E.2d at 891 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 12, 18, 486 S.E.2d 108, 111 (1997)) (additional citations omitted). Samudio-Perez does not allege juror miscon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>duct resulting from <em>voir dire; </em>thus, the <em>Green </em>standard is inapplicable. Moreover, even if we were to accept the general principles from <em>Green </em>regarding challenges for cause, the outcome would remain the same. In evaluating both the denial of a mistrial and a refusal to strike a juror for cause, our ultimate inquiry is whether the trial court\u2019s decision prejudiced the defendant. Thus, the result reached in the case at bar would remain the same under both standards.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">. The Commonwealth argues Samudio-Perez's reliance on <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000), is barred procedurally because he failed to raise the issue at trial. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:18. This Court recently held, in <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 658, 576 S.E.2d 222 (2003), that an analysis of \"public confidence\u201d is inherent in any appellate review of a juror's impartiality. We assume without deciding that <em>Patterson </em>applies here and consider the issue on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b699-5\">AGEE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWn\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">I agree with the majority opinion, but write separately because I would also hold Rule 5A:18 bars the issue first raised on appeal that seating juror Sorto would erode public confidence in the integrity of criminal trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">\u201cNo ruling of the trial court ... will be considered as a basis for reversal <em>unless the objection was stated together with the grounds therefor </em>at the time of the ruling, except for good cause shown or to enable the Court of Appeals to attain the ends of justice.\u201d Rule 5A:18 (emphasis added). \u201cThe main purpose of requiring timely specific objections is to afford the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently on the issues presented, thus avoiding unnecessary appeals and reversals.\u201d <em>Ohree v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 299, 307, 494 S.E.2d 484, 488 (1998). When such specific objections have not been made, this Court will not consider an argument on appeal which was not presented to the trial court. <em>Id. </em>at 308, 494 S.E.2d at 488 (citing <em>Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991)). This rule also applies to constitutional claims. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Deal v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 157, 161, 421 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">At no time did Samudio-Perez raise for the trial court\u2019s consideration the argument he makes on appeal that \u201cthe relationship between Detective Moore and Juror Sorto is of the sort that creates the perception that the integrity of the process is at stake.\u201d He cites <em>Medici v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28 (2000), as the foundation for his new appellate claim although he failed to present that case (or any other) to the trial court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Samudio-Perez\u2019s failure to raise this argument at trial forecloses his ability to raise the claim for the first time on appeal. Further, Samudio-Perez has cited no \u201cgood cause\u201d for his failure to raise the issue or proffered any reason as to why the ends of justice exception should apply. Therefore, the application of Rule 5A:18 should dispose of SamudioPerez\u2019s appeal on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has rendered several recent decisions where new trials were ordered because a juror was inappropriately seated. <em>See Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 823, 553 S.E.2d 731 (2001); <em>Medici, </em>260 Va. 223, 532 S.E.2d 28; <em>Cantrell v. Crews, </em>259 Va. 47, 523 S.E.2d 502 (2000). The Supreme Court found in these cases the trial court had abused its discretion in the seating of the juror in question because seating that juror would cause \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the process\u201d to be diminished. However, none of these cases address whether the appellant raised the issue of \u201cpublic confidence and the integrity of the process\u201d at trial or whether the opposing party argued the application of Rule 5:25.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">I do not read our recent decision in <em>Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 658, 576 S.E.2d 222 (2003), to void the application of Rule 5A:18 when a <em>\u201cMedici\u201d </em>claim is made.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Patterson, </em>a panel of this Court found a <em>Medici </em>claim was not procedurally barred by Rule 5A:18. The <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the panel opinion was not that <em>Cantrell </em>and its progeny established, as a matter of law, the inapplicability of Rule 5A:18 when a \u201cpublic confidence\u201d claim is raised for the first time on appeal. Instead, based on the facts in the record of that case, the <em>Patterson </em>panel held that although the \u201cappellant did not specifically use the words \u2018public confidence\u2019 at trial, he did ask the court to strike the juror for cause, based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>relationship with the Orange County Sheriffs Department and the information he received from them.\u201d 39 Va.App. at 666, 576 S.E.2d at 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">This finding in <em>Patterson </em>represents a determination that the appellant in that case sufficiently raised the issue in the trial court so as to vitiate the application of Rule 5A:18. It was not a holding that a <em>Medici </em>claim cannot be procedurally barred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently affirmed in evaluating error in the seating of a juror, that \u201cAs an appellate court, we must defer to a trial court\u2019s ruling on the issue of whether to retain or excuse a prospective juror for cause and that ruling will not be disturbed on appeal unless there has been manifest error amounting to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826, 553 S.E.2d at 732 (citing <em>Medici, </em>260 Va. at 227, 532 S.E.2d at 30); <em>see also Cantrell, </em>259 Va. at 50, 523 S.E.2d at 504; <em>Vinson v. Commonwealth, </em>258 Va. 459, 467, 522 S.E.2d 170, 176 (1999). While \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the process is one of the elements a trial court should consider when deciding whether a juror should be struck for cause,\u201d <em>Barrett, </em>262 Va. at 826-27, 553 S.E.2d at 733, nothing in that maxim contradicts or overrides the obligation of a party to raise that issue in the trial court and not for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">To the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly reiterated the primacy of Rule 5:25. For example, in <em>Buck v. Commonwealth, </em>247 Va. 449, 443 S.E.2d 414 (1994), a case involving <em>Batson </em>objections to the exclusion of certain persons on the basis of race from the venire, Buck\u2019s \u201cfailure to raise these arguments before the trial court precludes him from raising them for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452-53, 443 S.E.2d at 416 (citing Rule 5:25). Similarly, the failure to request that the trial court give an instruction to the jury on the abolition of parole pursuant to <em>Fishback v. Commonwealth, </em>260 Va. 104, 532 S.E.2d 629 (2000), cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v. Jerman, </em>263 Va. 88, 556 S.E.2d 754 (2002). The Court specifically noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>\u201cthe consistent application of Rule 5:25 advances the rule\u2019s purpose of avoiding unnecessary reversals and trials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 556 S.E.2d at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">While \u201cpublic confidence in the integrity of the process\u201d is an important consideration, it is of no higher rank than the assertion of racial prejudice in the selection of jurors under <em>Batson </em>or in the fair instruction of the jury for sentencing through their knowledge of the abolition of parole under <em>Jerman. </em>We open a Pandora\u2019s box of subjective hindsight if appellate review of juror selection is based on first-time, post-trial conjecture as to what does or does not constitute appropriate \u201cintegrity of the process\u201d to a majority of the appellate court hearing the argument years after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Accordingly, I would also affirm the ruling of the trial court, denying Samudio-Perez\u2019s motion for a mistrial, because his <em>Medici </em>argument on appeal is barred from consideration under Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b699-9\"><em>. Medici </em>was released June 9, 2000. Samudio-Perez\u2019s trial was sixteen months later, October 24, 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. For present purposes, I assume Rules 5:25 and 5A:18 are interchangeable and what is said in application to one applies to the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b700-8\">. By <em>Medici </em>claim, I mean the assertion that the seating of a juror was error because the juror\u2019s presence would cause public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system to be diminished.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
