Lawrence contends the warrantless search was unlawful. We agree and reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The evidence proved Officer Christopher Jernigan went to a residence to investigate \u201ca trouble unknown\u201d report, which vaguely suggested someone was inside the residence. While walking to the residence, the officer saw a woman sleeping in an automobile with the engine running. After learning that the homeowner, who only spoke Spanish, was attempting to report cars racing along the street, the officer left the residence. Believing \u201csomething [was] not right\u201d with the woman who was sleeping in the automobile, the officer initiated a conversation -with her. She told the officer she was waiting for the driver to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The officer \u201cran the tags\u201d on the automobile and learned they were registered to a pickup truck. After he obtained that information, the woman exited the automobile and asked if she was free to leave. The officer testified that he \u201csaid certainly, I have nothing. Go ahead.\u201d Shortly after she walked away, Lawrence approached the automobile. When the officer asked \u201cis that your car?,\u201d Lawrence said it was. The officer then directed Lawrence to step toward him, told Lawrence he was \u201cnot free to leave,\u201d and \u201cput him in handcuffs.\u201d The officer testified that he uses \u201cthe same\u201d proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>dure when detaining persons and that he had no reason to believe Lawrence posed a threat to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The officer described the events that followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">I believe he asked if he was under arrest at that time. I said no, you\u2019re under investigative detention. I said do you have a driver\u2019s license? He said it\u2019s in my pocket....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">I said where was his license located. He told me that it was in his inner jacket pocket. When I went into the pocket to retrieve it, pulled out his license and also unknown to me, a cellophane bag, in which it contained a brownish substance that I believed at that point in time to be heroin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">At that point in time, I placed him under arrest, and he was transported to lockup, charged with felony possession with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The trial judge denied Lawrence\u2019s motion to suppress the heroin. At the conclusion of further evidence, which consisted of the officer\u2019s testimony concerning the heroin, the trial judge convicted Lawrence of possession of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">Lawrence contends that the officer lacked authority to handcuff and to search him. The Commonwealth replies that all aspects of the detention were lawful and that the search was based upon Lawrence\u2019s consent or, in the alternative, upon probable cause to believe \u201cLawrence\u2019s driver\u2019s license was in his pocket and ... would be \u2018useful as evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">We apply the following standards on our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201c[t]he burden is upon [the appellant] to show that th[e] ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d \u201cUltimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search\u201d involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. In performing such analysis, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u201cplainly wrong\u201d or -without evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to support them____We analyze a trial judge\u2019s determination whether the Fourth Amendment was implicated by applying <em>de novo </em>our own legal analysis of whether based on those facts a seizure occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\"><em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The essential facts are not disputed. The officer first noticed the automobile because its engine was running and it was occupied by a woman who was asleep. When he spoke to the woman, she said she had come to that location with the driver but did not know his name, or the house he entered, or when he was expected to return. The officer \u201cran the tags on the [automobile]\u201d and learned that they belonged to a truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Various statutes, including Code \u00a7 46.2-715, require that license plates assigned to a motor vehicle be displayed on that motor vehicle. Under certain conditions, however, the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles may permit \u201cthe use of license plates on a vehicle other than the vehicle for which the license plates were issued.\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-719. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-720. Nonetheless, the officer had a sufficient basis to reasonably suspect a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-715 and to detain Lawrence for an investigation when Lawrence identified himself as the operator of the automobile. Unless otherwise stated, however, violations of the motor vehicles statutes are \u201ctraffic infractions,\u201d Code \u00a7 46.2-113, and ordinarily subject the violator to the issuance of a summons. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-936.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The Commonwealth argues that the officer could have \u201creasonably ... suspect[ed] that the car was stolen.\u201d We disagree. The evidence in the record did not prove circumstances that raised a reasonable suspicion the automobile had been stolen. After the officer \u201cran the tags,\u201d he received no report either that the automobile in his presence had been stolen or that the truck whose license plates were on the automobile had been stolen. The officer did not testify that he observed any damage suggesting a forced entry or rigging of the ignition. The automobile\u2019s keys were in the ignition, and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>person was in the automobile. Significantly, when the woman in the automobile asked if she could leave, the officer \u201csaid certainly, I have nothing. Go ahead.\u201d At that time, the officer knew that the license plates belonged to another vehicle. The totality of the circumstances negates any suggestion of a reasonable belief the automobile was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">In light of the circumstances, it was unreasonable for the officer to put handcuffs on Lawrence while investigating a traffic violation that would warrant only the issuance of a summons for the violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">[T]he investigative methods employed [during an investigative detention] should be the least intrusive means reasonably available to verify or dispel the officer\u2019s suspicion in a short period of time. It is the State\u2019s burden to demonstrate that the seizure it seeks to justify on the basis of a reasonable suspicion was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\"><em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">The Commonwealth attempts to justify the officer\u2019s use of the handcuffs by noting that another man was with Lawrence and that \u201c \u2018several\u2019 other individuals were on the scene interfering with the encounter.\u201d The record, however, refutes the Commonwealth\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">Q. When you put him in handcuffs, did you conduct a pat down of the outside of his clothing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">A. No, I hadn\u2019t gotten that far yet, sir. I put him in handcuffs, and I said where\u2019s your license? My next thing is going directly to the Social Security number to find out if this guy has got any warrants, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">At that point in time, he\u2019s in handcuffs. At that point in time, I run the license to do my pat down. The same thing every time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-12\">The officer merely testified that he used the handcuffs because Lawrence was \u201cunder investigative detention.\u201d Beyond this generalized statement of the officer\u2019s usual proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>dure, nothing in the record supports the officer\u2019s decision to use handcuffs while investigating a traffic infraction that was subject to a summons for the violation. The officer never testified that the presence of Lawrence\u2019s companion or any other person compelled him to place Lawrence in handcuffs. In addition, the officer did not testify that he believed Lawrence was armed and dangerous. Indeed, he testified that the circumstances did not indicate Lawrence did anything to threaten his continued investigation. Finally, the officer\u2019s own testimony undermines the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the officer used the handcuffs because the circumstances so required. It is clear from the officer\u2019s testimony that he always places suspects in handcuffs while conducting investigative detentions. He testified he does \u201c[t]he same thing every time.\u201d We hold that the officer\u2019s decision to handcuff Lawrence was a more serious intrusion on personal liberty than is allowable under these circumstances and, thus, constituted unreasonable restraint. <em>Cf. Sattler v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 366, 369, 457 S.E.2d 398, 400 (1995) (holding that an officer\u2019s \u201cgeneralized policy of (risking all [detained] persons\u201d is unreasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The Commonwealth contends Lawrence consented to the officer\u2019s actions in retrieving his license. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Recently, we addressed the issue of the determinations to be made when consent to search is raised.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201c \u2018Consent to a search ... must be unequivocal, specific and intelligently given ... and it is not lightly to be inferred.\u2019 \u201d Although the consent need not be oral, mere acquiescence is not enough. Additionally, the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving that consent was in fact given, and \u201cthat burden is heavier where the alleged consent is based on an implication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\"><em>Jean-Laurent v. Commonwealth, </em>34 Va.App. 74, 78-79, 538 S.E.2d 316, 318 (2000). In addition, and pertinent to this case, we held that \u201cconduct which evidences nothing more than an acquiescence, particularly when no request to search has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>made, has been held insufficient to constitute consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 538 S.E.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">The evidence proved that the officer did not ask for consent to obtain Lawrence\u2019s license or to reach into his pocket. The officer testified that after he put the handcuffs on Lawrence he asked Lawrence \u201cwhere was his license located.\u201d When Lawrence said the license \u201cwas in his inner jacket pocket,\u201d the officer \u201cwent into the pocket to retrieve it.\u201d On cross-examination, the officer very clearly confirmed that he did not seek Lawrence\u2019s consent to a search.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">Q. Now, it was when Mr. Lawrence was in handcuffs that you asked him for his license; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">A. I didn\u2019t ask him for his license. I asked him where his license was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">Q. And he told you while he was in handcuffs; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">A. That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-13\">Q. And then you reached inside his jacket pocket?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">A. He wasn\u2019t able to do so, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">No evidence in the record proves consent was either requested or obtained. \u201cThe burden was upon the officer to obtain consent, not on [Lawrence] to affirmatively deny consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 538 S.E.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge erred in denying the motion to suppress, and we reverse the conviction and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
