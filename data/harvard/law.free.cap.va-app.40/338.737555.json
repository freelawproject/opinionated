Horner\u2019s (Horner) grievance hearing appeal and reinstating him to his former position. DMH argues (1) Horner failed to perfect his appeal to the circuit court, (2) the circuit court misinterpreted Code \u00a7 2.2-3003(D),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (3) the circuit court misapplied Code \u00a7 2.2-3004(D), (4) the court erred by finding the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution (EDR) compliance rulings were appealable, (5) the court erred by finding appellate review was not precluded, (6) the court\u2019s decision renders DMH management powerless to discipline its employees, (7) the court erred by finding the first level respondent provided a remedy, and (8) the court improperly allowed Horner to address and introduce new materials into evidence in violation of its pre-hearing order.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Horner contends DMH failed to abide by the requirements of the state grievance procedure and that an e-mail he transmitted to the Inspector General did not violate Policies 6.05 and 6.10 concerning patient confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">We agree that the circuit court erred by finding DMH was bound by the determination of the first level respondent. Therefore, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision and remand for the court to address Horner\u2019s other bases for challenging the decisions of the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">Horner was an internist at DMH\u2019s Western State Hospital. Horner\u2019s conduct was governed by the Department of Human Resource Management\u2019s (DHRM\u2019s) Standards of Conduct, DHRM Policies 6.05 and 6.10, DMH\u2019s Departmental Instruction 201, and the Grievance Procedure Manual. On May 15, 2001, pursuant to the Standards of Conduct, Horner was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>issued three Group II written notices and terminated for failure to follow a supervisor\u2019s instructions and for failure to comply with Policies 6.05 and 6.10. Dismissal is warranted on the accumulation of two such notices. Horner contested the notices under the statutory grievance procedure. The grievances were qualified for a hearing, pursuant to the Commonwealth\u2019s three-step grievance qualification process. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-3004(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">At the first level of management review, Horner\u2019s immediate supervisor, Dr. Michael T. Clayton, stated he supported the reversal of the notices and he concluded Horner should be reinstated with back pay and benefits. However, in the subsequent two levels of management review, management disagreed with Clayton\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The matters then went before an EDR hearing officer, as the next level of review. Following a two-day evidentiary hearing, the hearing officer, in an August. 20, 2001 written decision, affirmed Horner\u2019s termination and two of the Group II notices. Horner sought and obtained reconsideration by the hearing officer, but the hearing officer affirmed his original decision. Horner appealed both decisions to EDR and DHRM. Horner then appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The court agreed with Horner\u2019s contention that the statutory grievance procedure requires that DMH give effect to Clayton\u2019s decisions and ordered Horner be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">In administratively implementing the statutory grievance procedure, pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-3003(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> EDR produced the \u201cGrievance Procedure Manual\u201d (GPM). In the GPM, EDR provided for three levels of management review for the purpose of resolving an employee\u2019s grievance short of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>elevating the matter to a formal hearing. GPM \u00a7 2.1 and \u00a7\u00a7 3.1 through 3.3. Under the GPM procedure, the first of three potential \u201cManagement Resolution Steps\u201d is conducted by the \u201cFirst-Step Respondent.\u201d GPM \u00a7 3.1. The \u201cFirst-Step Respondent\u201d is the employee\u2019s immediate supervisor. GPM \u00a7 9. The subsequent two steps are conducted by an individual in a senior management position and the agency head, respectively. GPM \u00a7\u00a7 3.2, 3.3, and 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Code \u00a7 2.2-3003(D) provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cmanagement shall review the grievance and respond to the merits thereof. Each level of management review shall have the authority to provide the employee with a remedy.\u201d The circuit court found that Clayton, the first level respondent, provided Horner with a remedy and that, therefore, DMH was precluded from pursuing the matter to the next levels of management review.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Such an interpretation of the statute and the manual would essentially allow an immediate, lower-level supervisor to make a final, conclusive determination and would provide the lower-level supervisor with more authority on disciplinary matters than an agency director.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The stated policy of the State Grievance Procedure is to \u201cafford an immediate and <em>fair </em>method for the resolution of employment disputes____\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 (emphasis added). A system which provides such disparate remedies and which allows only the employee to proceed to subsequent resolution steps would hardly be \u201cfair.\u201d More importantly, such an interpretation of the statute and the procedure is absurd and irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently held that statutes \u201cmust be given a rational interpretation consistent with [their] purposes, and not one which will substantially defeat [their] objectives.\u201d <em>City of Chesapeake v. Gardner Enterprises, </em>253 Va. 243, 247, 482 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1997) (citing <em>Mayor v. Industrial Dev. Auth., </em>221 Va. 865, 869, 275 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1981)). Furthermore, \u201c[a] provision of a section of a statute ought not to receive a mere literal inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>pretation, when it would contravene the intention of the Legislature apparent from the other sections and provisions thereof, but the words are to be expanded or qualified to effectuate the intention.\u201d <em>Tabb v. Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 47, 56-57, 34 S.E. 946, 949 (1900). Allowing the lower-level first respondent more authority than the agency head in determining the proper disciplinary actions for employees clearly contravenes the stated and apparent intention of the grievance procedure. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et. seq. </em>Therefore, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s decision. We remand the case for the circuit court to determine the merits of Horner\u2019s additional claims which it initially refused to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-9\">.
