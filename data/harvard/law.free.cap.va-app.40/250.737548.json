Wilson (defendant) was convicted in a bench trial for driving after being declared an habitual offender,, a second or subsequent offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. On appeal, he contends the Commonwealth failed to prove the requisite prior conviction. We disagree and affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">In accordance with well established principles, \u201c \u2018we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archer v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 1, 11, 492 S.E.2d 826, 831 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">Viewed accordingly, the evidence established that Virginia State Trooper J.S. Copenhaver effected a traffic stop of a vehicle operated by defendant. A routine \u201crun\u201d of defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal ... or traffic history\u201d and \u201cDMV transcript\u201d by Copenhaver disclosed that defendant had been previously adjudicated an habitual offender and twice convicted of operating a vehicle in violation of the related order.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>At trial, the Commonwealth introduced the DMV transcript, which reported the prior convictions, and a certified copy of the warrant charging one such offense, \u201cdriving] a motor vehicle ... after having been found to be an habitual offender,\u201d committed on October 19,1999, in the City of Chesapeake. The warrant clearly recites that defendant appeared before the Chesapeake General District Court, accompanied by counsel, and entered a plea of \u201cguilty.\u201d However, the face of the warrant fails to memorialize a finding of guilt by the judge of the general district court, although defendant was sentenced to sixty days in jail, with forty-five days suspended, together with a fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant maintained that neither the warrant nor the DMV record proved the predicate prior conviction for a violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-357. The trial court, however, noting defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the offense alleged in the warrant, \u201cdriv[ing] a motor vehicle ... after having been found to be an habitual offender,\u201d and a sentence consistent with such offense, found the evidence sufficient to convict. Defendant now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"AFc\">\n<em>ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u201cA court speaks through its orders and those orders are presumed to accurately reflect what transpired.\u201d <em>McBride v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 30, 35, 480 S.E.2d 126, 128 (1997). Thus, when an accused collaterally attacks a prior conviction in a subsequent trial, \u201cthe Commonwealth is entitled to a presumption of regularity which attends the prior conviction ... \u2018 \u201ctill the contrary appears.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Nicely v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 579, 584, 490 S.E.2d 281, 283 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-307 requires \u201ca court not of record ... to memorialize its judgment by setting forth \u2018[the] plea, [the court\u2019s] verdict or findings and the adjudication and sentence.\u2019\u201d <em>McBride, </em>24 Va.App. at 34-35, 480 S.E.2d at 128 (citing Code \u00a7 19.2-307; <em>see Bellinger v. Commonwealth, </em>23 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Va.App. 471, 474, 477 S.E.2d 779, 780 (1996)). Accordingly, in <em>McBride, </em>this Court reversed a conviction for a second violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266 based upon a warrant that \u201cfail[ed] to state that the court found [the accused] guilty\u201d of the alleged prior offense, a circumstance that rebutted the presumption of regularity and, absent \u201cother evidence to indicate\u201d the intent of the district court, resulted in a failure of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 480 S.E.2d at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Significantly, however, unlike McBride, defendant entered a plea of guilty to the warrant in issue.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201c[A] voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty by an accused is, in reality, a self-supplied conviction authorizing imposition of the punishment fixed by law.\u201d A guilty plea \u201cis an admission ... of a solemn character.... [I]t is competent evidence against him.... [I]t is evidence of each and every element needed to constitute the offense admitted as a crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\"><em>Rose v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 728, 735-36, 561 S.E.2d 46, 50 (2002) (citations omitted). Thus, defendant\u2019s plea constituted an unequivocal admission of the crime, a \u201cself-supplied conviction.\u201d Moreover, the resulting sentence comported with the prescribed punishment for the offense, providing additional evidence of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">\u201cWhile \u2018the most efficient way to prove the prior ... conviction is to offer in evidence an authenticated copy of the prior order or conviction,\u2019 the prior conviction may be proven by any competent evidence.\u201d <em>McBride, </em>24 Va.App. at 33-34, 480 S.E.2d at 128 (citations omitted). Our review of the instant record discloses such other \u201ccompetent evidence\u201d sufficient to prove the previous conviction, notwithstanding the absence of a finding of guilt appearing on the warrant and the attendant \u201cpresumption of regularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
