On appeal, Alston contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the marijuana found on his person and in his car as the product of an unlawful seizure that violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence and all reasonable inferences fairly deducible from that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the party prevailing below. <em>See Weathers v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 652, 656, 529 S.E.2d 847, 849 (2000). So viewed, the evidence presented in this case established that on July 27, 2001, Richmond City Police Officer Brian Hixson was on routine patrol with Officer Timothy DeGrauwe and Officer Durham. The three officers were in one patrol car, which Hixson was driving. At approximately 10:55 a.m., the officers pulled into the property known as the Ruffin Road apartment complex. The apartment complex was posted with \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">After driving approximately fifty yards into the complex, Hixson observed a purple Nissan car in the complex \u201ccome around the corner\u201d and head in the officers\u2019 direction. Alston, whom Hixson did not know at the time, was driving the car, and there were two passengers in the rear seat and one in the front seat. As Alston drove by the patrol car, Hixson recognized the passenger in the front seat as Pierre Stanberry, someone who Hixson knew had been banned by court order from entering the Ruffin Road apartment complex. Hixson had previously arrested Stanberry for trespassing on that property at least twice, the last time occurring in September or October of 2000. Hixson turned the patrol car around to investigate Stanberry\u2019s presence in the complex. The officers observed Alston pull up to Ruffin Road at the entrance/exit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>the apartment complex and activate his turn signal \u201cindicating [he was] going to make a left-hand turn\u201d onto Ruffin Road. Then, \u201c[a]ll of a sudden[,] the left turn signal went off and [Alston] made a quick right turn\u201d onto Ruffin Road. Almost immediately, Alston pulled to the side of the road directly in front of a parked car, parked, and \u201cquickly\u201d got out of the car and started walking away.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Hixson, who had followed Alston onto Ruffin Road, pulled over next to Alston\u2019s car, stopping in the road. He then stepped out of his vehicle and \u201casked\u201d Alston, who had walked \u201cinto the roadway, right in front of [the police] vehicle,\u201d to \u201chave a seat back in his car.\u201d Because the patrol car was \u201cin the travel lane of Ruffin Road,\u201d Hixson activated the car\u2019s emergency lights at some point.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Complying with Hixson\u2019s request to return to his car, Alston went back to his car and got in. Hixson then approached Alston\u2019s car and immediately noticed a \u201cbox of open sandwich baggies\u201d and an \u201copen beer\u201d in the car\u2019s center console. He also smelled the odor of marijuana emanating from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Hixson asked Alston for identification, which Alston provided. Returning to the patrol car, Hixson ran Alston\u2019s information through \u201cRichmond-Henrico NCIC\u201d and learned that Alston had an outstanding warrant on file with the City of Richmond. Hixson arrested Alston on that warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Incident to that arrest, Officer Durham searched Alston and his car. As a result of the search, Durham found marijuana on Alston\u2019s person and in his car. Additional charges were then brought against Alston. Pierre Stanberry was also charged with several offenses, including trespassing.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">On cross-examination at the suppression hearing, Hixson acknowledged that, as far as he knew, Alston was legally parked and had not engaged in any criminal activity when he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>asked him to get back in his car. He further acknowledged that his investigation of Stanberry\u2019s trespassing would not have been hindered if Alston had left because he could have gone directly to Stanberry, who stayed in the car, and asked him questions. When asked to describe the \u201creasonable and articulable suspicion\u201d that served as the basis for having Alston get back in his car, Hixson explained, \u201cIt seemed suspicious to me the way he pulled out of the complex and then just pulled over right in front of the complex that he had just exited from, and then he quickly got out of the vehicle and walked.\u201d Hixson further testified: \u201cIt all seemed very suspicious to me. Mr. Stanberry I knew was banned from the property. I knew him by name, and I just asked Mr. Alston to have a seat back in the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Officer DeGrauwe, who was called as a witness for Alston, testified that, when he saw Alston get out of his car and start to walk \u201cacross the street,\u201d he got out of the patrol car and \u201cgot ready to run\u201d after him, because, based on his training and experience, that was what normally happened under such circumstances. When asked to explain the circumstances that made him believe that Alston was going to try to run away, DeGrauwe stated that Alston\u2019s \u201cquick right turn\u201d after signaling to turn left, his pulling over suddenly and parking, and his getting out of the car are occurrences that are generally followed by \u201ca foot pursuit.\u201d Ultimately, however, he did not have to pursue Alston, DeGrauwe stated, because \u201cOfficer Hixson looked at [Alston] and said get back in the car,\u201d and Alston, who was approximately ten feet away, complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Alston testified at the suppression hearing. According to his testimony, he had never been banned from the Ruffin Road apartment complex and did not know that Stanberry, his cousin, had been. On the day in question, he had been visiting another cousin who lived at the apartment complex. When he was leaving the complex, she called on his cell phone to tell him he had left something at her place. He immediately pulled over to the side of the road, parked, and had started to walk the short distance back to his cousin\u2019s apartment when the police pulled up. One of the \u201cthree or four\u201d officers who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>were there \u201ctold [him] to get back in the car.\u201d Believing, based on the officer\u2019s tone of voice, that he was not free to leave, he got back in the car, as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Alston admitted that he had missed an earlier court date and that he knew he had an outstanding warrant for failure to appear. He admitted there was a can of beer in his car but denied it was open. He also denied that there were \u201cbaggies\u201d in the car or that anyone in the car had been smoking marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">In a pretrial motion, Alston moved to suppress the marijuana as the product of an unlawful seizure. Ruling that, under the circumstances of this case, Hixson could ask Alston to get back in his car in order \u201cto secure the situation just long enough to find out what [was] going on,\u201d the trial court denied Alston\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Alston then entered a conditional plea of guilty, preserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Upon that plea, the trial court found Alston guilty of possession of more than one-half ounce but less than five pounds of marijuana with the intent to distribute and sentenced him to thirty-six months of incarceration, with thirty months suspended for a period of five years on certain conditions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u2018[t]he burden is upon [the defendant] to show that th[e] ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980)). \u2018\u201cUltimate questions of reasonable suspicion and probable cause to make a warrantless search\u2019 involve questions of both law and fact and are reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 691, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1659, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996)). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>\u201cwe are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 487 S.E.2d at 261 (citing <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. at 1663).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Encounters between the police and citizens \u201cgenerally fall into one of three categories.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">First, there are consensual encounters which do not implicate the Fourth Amendment. Next, there are brief investigatory stops, commonly referred to as <em>\u201cTerry </em>\u201d stops, which must be based upon reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is or may be afoot. Finally, there are \u201chighly intrusive, full-scale arrests\u201d or searches which must be based upon probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by the suspect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Alston contends he was unlawfully seized under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 16, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1877, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), when Officer Hixson stopped him from walking away by ordering him back to his car. At that moment, Alston argues, Hixson did not have grounds to support a reasonable, articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity. The officer\u2019s observation of his \u201ccommonplace\u201d driving behavior, his walking away from his lawfully parked car, and his having someone in his car who was suspected of trespassing, gave rise, at best, Alston maintains, to a mere inchoate hunch that he was engaged in criminal activity. Thus, Alston concludes, Officer Hixson violated his Fourth Amendment rights in ordering him back to his car and the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the subsequently discovered marijuana, a product of the unlawful seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The Commonwealth contends Alston was not seized for Fourth Amendment purposes until he was arrested on the outstanding warrant. Prior to that, the Commonwealth ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>gues, the encounter between Officer Hixson and Alston was entirely consensual.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that Alston was \u201cseized\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when Officer Hixson stopped him from walking away, we agree with the trial court that, on the facts of this case, that seizure was not in violation of Alston\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights because Hixson was entitled to briefly detain Alston for investigative purposes in order to question him and maintain the status quo.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">\u201cThe Fourth Amendment does not forbid all ... seizures but only those that are unreasonable.\u201d <em>Cabbler v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 520, 522, 184 S.E.2d 781, 782-83 (1971) (citing <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 9, 88 S.Ct. at 1873). Whether a seizure is unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment depends on \u201cthe particular facts of [the] case.\u201d <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 407, 414, 551 S.E.2d 606, 609 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">\u201c[I]f there are articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that a person has committed a criminal offense, that person may be stopped in order to identify him, to question him briefly, or to detain him briefly while attempting to obtain additional information.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Florida, </em>470 U.S. 811, 816, 105 S.Ct. 1643, 1647, 84 L.Ed.2d 705 (1985). Indeed, \u201c[a] brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.\u201d <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">an officer need not suspect an individual of a particular crime in order to justify a <em>Terry </em>stop. A general suspicion of some criminal activity is enough, as long as the officer can, based on the circumstances before him at the time, articulate a reasonable basis for his suspicion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-9\"><em>Hatcher v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 487, 490, 419 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1992). Likewise, \u201c[ajctual proof that criminal activity <em>is </em>afoot is not necessary; the record need only show that it <em>may </em>be afoot.\u201d <em>Harmon v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 440, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>444, 425 S.E.2d 77, 79 (1992). The investigatory stop, however, \u201cmust be based on something more than the officer\u2019s \u2018inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or \u201chunch.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Ramey v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 624, 629, 547 S.E.2d 519, 522 (2001) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We are further mindful in assessing an officer\u2019s justification for a seizure that \u201c[tjhere are no bright line rules to follow when determining whether a reasonable and articulable suspicion exists to justify an'investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Hoye v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 132, 135, 442 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1994). As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124-25, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">In reviewing the propriety of an officer\u2019s conduct, courts do not have available empirical studies dealing with inferences drawn from suspicious behavior, and we cannot reasonably demand scientific certainty from judges or law enforcement officers where none exists. Thus, the determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">In deciding whether to make an investigatory stop, \u201can officer is \u2018entitled to rely upon \u201cthe totality of the circumstances \u2014 the whole picture.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Peguese v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 349, 351, 451 S.E.2d 412, 413 (1994) <em>(en banc) </em>(quoting <em>Lansdown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 204, 212, 308 S.E.2d 106, 112 (1983) (quoting <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 695, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981))). The police officer is also entitled \u201cto view the circumstances confronting him in light of his training and experience, and he may consider any suspicious conduct of the suspected person.\u201d <em>James v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 740, 745, 473 S.E.2d 90, 92 (1996). \u201c[A] trained law enforcement officer may [be able to] identify criminal behavior which would appear innocent to an untrained observer.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 384, 388, 369 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">Applying these principles to the present case, we conclude that, based on the totality of the circumstances confronting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>him, Officer Hixson acted reasonably in stopping Alston from walking away and asking him to return to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Hixson initially observed Alston driving on property that was posted \u201cno trespassing.\u201d As Alston drove by the patrol car, Hixson saw a passenger in the car who he knew had recently been barred from the property. On the basis of that observation, Hixson had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the passenger in Alston\u2019s car was trespassing. Hixson was therefore entitled to stop Alston\u2019s vehicle in order to investigate the suspected criminal activity. <em>See Freeman v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 658, 660-61, 460 S.E.2d 261, 262 (1995) (noting that \u201c[a] police officer may stop the driver or occupants of an automobile for investigatory purposes if the officer has \u2018a reasonable articulable suspicion, based on objective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jacques v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 591, 593, 405 S.E.2d 630, 631 (1991))).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Intending to conduct such an investigatory stop, Hixson turned his patrol car around and proceeded after Alston\u2019s car. However, before the officer could initiate the stop, Alston, after signaling he was going to turn left upon leaving the property, abruptly turned right and almost immediately pulled to the side of the road and parked. Alston then \u201cquickly\u201d got out of his car and started to walk away. Hixson pulled up next to Alston\u2019s car and, finding Alston\u2019s conduct \u201csuspicious\u201d asked him to return to his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">We conclude that Alston\u2019s behavior reasonably suggested that criminal activity may be afoot. In light of Alston\u2019s evasive driving maneuvers after passing Hixson\u2019s patrol car and his quick exit and departure from his parked car, a reasonable officer could conclude that Alston sought to avoid contact with the police in order to elude their investigation. <em>See Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 490, 419 S.E.2d at 258 (finding that a passenger of a lawfully stopped car who walked away from the car did so to evade the police officer\u2019s investigation). Hence, Hixson\u2019s observations of Alston\u2019s suspicious conduct provided him with a reasonable basis independent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>passenger\u2019s suspected trespassing to believe that Alston also might be involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Alston argues that his behavior was consistent with innocent conduct and showed \u201cno indicia of criminal activity.\u201d We find, however, that, taken together as a whole, Alston\u2019s actions after he drove by the patrol car were sufficiently suspicious to provide Hixson with the requisite reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop Alston from walking away from the scene. <em>See Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 22-23, 88 S.Ct. at 1880-81 (concluding that defendant\u2019s \u201cseries of acts, each of them perhaps innocent in itself,\u201d in combination warranted further investigation by the police). Hixson\u2019s brief detention of Alston was therefore reasonable to allow the officer to confirm or dispel his suspicion and to maintain the status quo during the course of the lawful roadside investigatory stop. <em>See Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 491-92, 419 S.E.2d at 259 (holding that a police officer\u2019s brief detention of a passenger who walked away from a lawfully stopped vehicle is warranted to promote the officer\u2019s \u201csignificant interest in gaining control of and monitoring a potentially hazardous roadside stop in order to conduct his lawful investigation,\u201d particularly when \u201cevents subsequent to the lawful traffic stop focus suspicion on [the] passenger\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Mancillas, </em>183 F.3d 682, 698 (7th Cir.1999) (finding that a police officer had reasonable suspicion to stop and briefly detain the defendant based, in part, on the defendant\u2019s \u201cquickly\u201d exiting and walking away from his vehicle in a parking lot when the officer, responding to a radio dispatch, arrived at the parking lot and illuminated the defendant\u2019s vehicle with a spotlight).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Alston further contends that, even if Hixson had grounds to support a reasonable and articulable suspicion that he was engaged in criminal activity, the officer could only detain him briefly \u201cat the point where he stood, after he immediately stopped when hailed by the police.\u201d By ordering him back into the confines of the car, Alston argues, Hixson transformed any possible investigatory detention into a custo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>dial seizure requiring probable cause, which, at that point, did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">We disagree with Alston that, by asking him to get back into his car rather than questioning him outside the car \u201cwhere he stood,\u201d Hixson changed the nature of the detention from an investigatory stop into a full-fledged arrest. \u201cThe perception ... that one is [in custody] is insufficient to convert a <em>Terry </em>stop into an arrest. A brief but complete restriction of liberty is valid under <em>Terry.\u201d United States v. Moore, </em>817 F.2d 1105, 1108 (4th Cir.1987). For example, an investigatory stop does not necessarily become a custodial arrest when circumstances cause a police officer to draw his gun upon a suspect. <em>See Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 554, 562, 500 S.E.2d 257, 261 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Moreover, \u201c[c]ourts have routinely allowed officers to insist on reasonable changes of location when carrying out <em>Terry </em>stops.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>648 F.2d 29, 37 (D.C.Cir.1981). Indeed, it is well established that police officers who are conducting a lawful investigatory stop are \u201cauthorized to take such steps as [are] reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 235, 105 S.Ct. 675, 683-84, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985). The personal safety of the driver and other occupants of a lawfully stopped vehicle is also a legitimate concern for the police. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111, 98 S.Ct. 330, 333, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Thus, \u201c[f|ollowing a lawful traffic stop, the Fourth Amendment permits the police to order the passengers to get out of the car pending the completion of the stop.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>27 Va.App. at 562, 500 S.E.2d at 261 (citing <em>Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 414, 117 S.Ct. 882, 886, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997)). Likewise, we have \u201cpreviously held that police officers may ... detain passengers beside an automobile until completion of a lawful traffic stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 491-92, 419 S.E.2d at 259). The police may also order the driver to exit the car, <em>see Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 111 n. 6, 98 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>333 n. 6, and it follows that \u201ca police officer has the power to reasonably control the situation by requiring [an occupant of the vehicle] to remain <em>in </em>[the] vehicle during a traffic stop.\u201d <em>Rogala v. District of Columbia, </em>161 F.3d 44, 53 (D.C.Cir.1998). These additional intrusions upon the personal liberties of the occupants of the vehicle, who \u201c \u2018are already stopped by virtue of the [lawful] stop of the vehicle,\u2019 \u201d are <em>\u201cde minimis </em>\u201d and are reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because of the \u201c \u2018weighty [public] interest in officer safety* \u201d and the need to \u201cmaintain the status quo during the course of the investigatory traffic stop.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>27 Va.App. at 562, 500 S.E.2d at 261 (quoting <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. at 414, 117 S.Ct. at 886).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Applying these principles to the circumstances of the present case, we conclude that Officer Hixson did not violate Alston\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights by having him get back in his car before questioning him. In doing so, Hixson took steps that were reasonably necessary not only to protect Alston, himself, and his fellow officers from the dangers inherently associated with a roadside stop but also to maintain the status quo during the stop. Even though this case did not involve a situation that was overtly dangerous, such as \u201ca dark and deserted spot or one lone officer facing a carful of suspects, our reluctance to second-guess the judgment of experienced officers is not limited to such extreme situations.\u201d <em>White, </em>648 F.2d at 36 (footnote deleted). Moreover, the additional intrusion upon Alston\u2019s personal liberty was minimal. We conclude, therefore, that Hixson acted reasonably in asking Alston to get back in his car in order to control and monitor the situation during the course of the investigatory stop. <em>See Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 491-92, 419 S.E.2d at 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Thereafter, Officer Hixson, in approaching Alston\u2019s car to investigate the suspected trespassing and Alston\u2019s possible criminal involvement, saw a \u201cbox of open sandwich baggies\u201d and an open container of beer in plain view in the center console of the car and detected an odor of marijuana emanating from the car. Based on those observations, Hixson had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>ther investigation of Alston\u2019s suspected criminal activity. Hixson\u2019s subsequent discovery that there was an outstanding warrant for Alston then provided the officer with the probable cause necessary to arrest Alston. Incident to that arrest, the police conducted a search that led to the discovery of the marijuana on Alston\u2019s person and in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">We hold, therefore, based upon our <em>de novo </em>review, that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in denying Alston\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Alston\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\">. Hixson acknowledged at the suppression hearing that the patrol car\u2019s emergency lights were activated during the course of the investigation. However, he could not recall whether he activated the emergency lights before or after he asked Alston to return to his car. Alston testified that he did not \"remember [the] emergency lights being on.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
