The trial judge, the husband argues, misapplied the manifest injustice exception to Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B)\u2019s statutory bar against awarding support to adulterers. In addition to defending her award of support, Mary Evelyn Davis Congdon claims that the trial court erred in its equitable distribution calculation of the marital share of the appreciation of her husband\u2019s separately owned stock in the family trucking business.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">We agree with the husband that the trial judge misread our precedents on the manifest injustice exception, but we nonetheless affirm because his factual findings support the result reached under a proper interpretation of the law. As to the equitable distribution calculation of stock appreciation, we disagree with the wife and find no reversible error in the trial court\u2019s method of classifying the increase in stock value.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s decision on appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting it the benefit of any reasonable inferences. <em>Wright v. Wright, </em>38 Va.App. 394, 398, 564 S.E.2d 702, 704 (2002); <em>Donnell v. Donnell, </em>20 Va.App. 37, 39, 455 S.E.2d 256, 257 (1995). That principle requires us to \u201c \u2018discard the evidence\u2019\u201d of the appellant which conflicts, either directly or inferentially, with the evidence presented by the appellee at trial. <em>Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002) (quoting <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>26 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Va.App. 335, 348, 494 S.E.2d 859, 866 (1998)). We view the facts of this case, therefore, through this evidentiary prism.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Mary Evelyn Davis (known as Lynn) and John Rhodes Congdon married in 1977. During their twenty-two year marriage, the couple had three children. John filed for divorce in 1999 alleging adultery, and Lynn filed a cross-bill asserting cruelty and constructive desertion. The parties agreed to the appointment of a judge <em>pro tempore </em>to decide the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In addition to receiving depositions, the trial judge heard testimony <em>ore terms </em>from multiple witnesses over four days. Much of the testimony described the nature of the marriage and the circumstances that led to its dissolution. At the beginning of the trial, Lynn conceded that she was guilty of adultery and did not contest John\u2019s request for a final divorce on this ground. The evidence showed that she engaged in an extramarital affair for at least five years during the marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Lynn, however, the evidence also portrayed John as a profane and verbally abusive man. John frequented \u201cstrip joints and topless bars\u201d and told Lynn about, among other things, the \u201coil wrestlers\u201d that performed at these places. He would indiscriminately engage in these conversations in the presence of his children and Lynn\u2019s family, at times even \u201cboasting or bragging about those places.\u201d \u201cIt was not an infrequent topic of conversation.\u201d John went to these places, he explained to one witness, \u201cbecause they have the best p-.\u201d John \u201cfrequently talked crudely about sexual type things.\u201d He carried on with this practice \u201c[pjretty much the same the whole 20 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">John also directed his profanity toward his children. In one instance, John\u2019s son Michael had accidentally kicked his father\u2019s head while both were lying on a bed watching television. Though realizing it was simply an accident, John \u201cstarted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>yelling ... God damn you, Michael. Why in the f\u2014 did you kick me in the face----Why did you f \u2014 ing have to kick me in the face?\u201d In response, Michael ran out of the house. On another occasion, John was having a \u201cfood fight\u201d with his twelve-year-old daughter when John accidentally got hit in the eye. He \u201cstarted screaming ... God damn you. God damn, you hit me in the eye.\u201d His daughter \u201cjust sat there and started crying,\u201d not at all understanding her father\u2019s outburst. Other times John would come home from work angry and declare, in ear-shot of his children, that \u201cone of the girls at the office\u201d was a \u201cbitch or a c \u2014 .\u201d His use of vulgarity, in the presence of his family and others, \u201cwas quite frequent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Several witnesses who knew John and Lynn over the years testified that they had never once seen John show any affection or any kindness toward Lynn. Over the course of the marriage, John chronically complained (both to Lynn and others) about Lynn\u2019s weight, appearance, housekeeping, and spending habits. John referred to Lynn as Witch.\u201d He was a \u201cheavy drinker,\u201d sometimes starting as early as \u201c10:00 in the morning.\u201d Because John maintained strict control over the financial accounts, Lynn was not \u201cprivy to the family finances at any time during the marriage.\u201d John particularly disliked Lynn\u2019s family and threatened on one occasion to move her out of town if she did not \u201cstop speaking with her parents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Despite these problems, John and Lynn enjoyed considerable financial security. John has a college degree, a stable and long-term career in a family trucking business, an annual salary exceeding $250,000, and additional income from corporate dividends and family related gifts. John\u2019s interests in stocks, real estate, and tangible assets exceeded $6 million. In contrast, Lynn has not held a full time job since the early years of her marriage, choosing instead to stay at home to raise their three children. She has no college degree, giving her a future earning capacity far below her husband\u2019s. At the time of trial, Lynn was earning $10.00 an hour as a receptionist.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The trial court also heard evidence that John\u2019s stock in his family business increased in value over the course of the marriage. Conceding that John acquired the shares as a gift from his family and thus should be considered separate property, Lynn argued that under Code \u00a7 20-107.S(A)(3)(a) the appreciation portion of the stock\u2019s present value should be treated as marital property. In reply, John presented extensive testimony on the internal management of the business and the role of six other key employees in the company\u2019s success.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">After the close of the evidence, the trial court issued a comprehensive letter opinion detailing each aspect of the court\u2019s rulings on divorce grounds, equitable distribution, and spousal support. On the first issue on appeal, the adultery bar against spousal support, the court invoked the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d exception in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B). After considering the additional factors in Code \u00a7 20-107.1(E), the court awarded support of $2,300 per month to Lynn to continue until her death or remarriage. On the second issue on appeal, the classification (marital or separate property) of the stock appreciation, the court found that 90% of the increase in value should be deemed separate property given the extensive efforts of other key employees and the extent of \u201cpassive growth\u201d in the stock value.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Under Code \u00a7 8.01-680, a factual determination cannot be reversed on appeal unless \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>See Schweider v. Schweider, </em>243 Va. 245, 250, 415 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1992); <em>Torian v. Torian, </em>38 Va.App. 167, 181, 562 S.E.2d 355, 362 (2002). This standard applies to a \u201ctrial court\u2019s decision to award spousal support to a party despite his or her adultery\u201d as it does to any other domestic relations case. <em>Rahbaran v. Rahbaran, </em>26 Va.App. 195, 212, 494 S.E.2d 135, 143 (1997) (citing <em>Williams v. Williams, </em>14 Va.App. 217, 219, 415 S.E.2d 252, 253 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cWhether and how much spousal support will be awarded is a matter of discretion for the trial court.\u201d <em>Northcutt v. Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. 192, 196, 571 S.E.2d 912, 914 (2002) (quoting <em>Barker v. Barker, </em>27 Va.App. 519, 527, 500 S.E.2d 240, 244 (1998)). On appeal, a trial court\u2019s decision on this subject will not be reversed \u201cunless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Moreno v. Moreno, </em>24 Va.App. 190, 194-95, 480 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1997)); <em>see also Gottlieb v. Gottlieb, </em>19 Va.App. 77, 84, 448 S.E.2d 666, 671 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">An abuse of discretion can be found if the trial court uses \u201can improper legal standard in exercising its discretionary function,\u201d <em>Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 216, 233, 559 S.E.2d 652, 661 (2002), because a trial court \u201c \u2018by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law,\u2019 \u201d <em>Shooltz v. Shooltz, </em>27 Va.App. 264, 271, 498 S.E.2d 437, 441 (1998) (quoting <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 2047, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). <em>See also Mughrabi v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 538, 545, 567 S.E.2d 542, 545 (2002). An abuse of discretion also exists if the trial court fails to consider the statutory factors required to be part of the decisionmaking process, <em>Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 139, 480 S.E.2d 760, 767 (1997), or makes factual findings that are plainly wrong or without evidence to support them, <em>Northcutt, </em>39 Va.App. at 196, 571 S.E.2d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">John challenges the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support to his wife. Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) bars an award of support to any spouse found guilty of adultery, John argues, except in narrow circumstances not present in this case. John disagrees with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B), as well as its factual findings in support of applying the statutory exception. We agree with John that the trial court restated the \u00a7 20-107.1(B) standard incorrectly, but conclude that the trial court\u2019s factual findings support its decision in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>With respect to spousal support, Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) provides that \u201cno permanent maintenance and support shall be awarded from a spouse if there exists in such spouse\u2019s favor a ground of divorce under the provisions of subdivision (1) of \u00a7 20-91,\u201d which includes adultery. This statute bar, however, is subject to a narrow exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">However, the court may make such an award notwithstanding the existence of such ground if the court determines from clear and convincing evidence, that a denial of support and maintenance would constitute a manifest injustice, based upon the respective degrees of fault during the marriage and the relative economic circumstances of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B). The language of this statute circumscribes the scope of the exception in three ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">First, the evidence must rise to the level of \u201cclear and convincing\u201d proof. A more stringent standard than preponderance of the evidence, \u201cclear and convincing\u201d proof requires \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established.\u201d <em>Lanning v. Va. Dept. of Transp., </em>37 Va.App. 701, 707, 561 S.E.2d 33, 36 (2002) (citations omitted). \u201cIt is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance,\u201d but less than the criminal \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standard. <em>Gifford v. Dennis, </em>230 Va. 193, 198 n. 1, 335 S.E.2d 371, 373 n. 1 (1985) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Second, the exception applies only in cases of \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d The expression, often found outside of domestic relations law, has been used synonymously with the phrase \u201cmiscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Harris v. DiMattina, </em>250 Va. 306, 318, 462 S.E.2d 338, 343 (1995) (interpreting the duty imposed by Code \u00a7 8.01-1 on trial courts to prevent unjust results in the application of a new provision of law). The \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d expression also serves as shorthand for the narrow exception to Rule 5A:18\u2019s contemporaneous objection requirement. <em>M. Morgan Cherry &amp; Assocs. v. Cherry, </em>38 Va.App. 693, 702, 568 S.E.2d 391, 396 (2002). The legislature has put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the expression to use limiting the ability of a criminal defendant to withdraw a guilty plea after judgment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-296 (after judgment, a guilty plea may be withdrawn only \u201cto correct manifest injustice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Third, the statute limits the fact finder\u2019s discretion to two specific variables: (i) the relative degrees of fault and (ii) the economic disparities between the parties. The statute requires the decision to be \u201cbased upon\u201d these factors. Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B). This language implies a higher level of justification than a statutory command that merely requires the trial judge to consider this or that factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In this case, the dispute focuses on whether the trial court must base its decision on both variables or may rest it exclusively on only one. John argued before the trial court that under Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) a trial court \u201cmust consider and weigh <em>both </em>prongs of the test for manifest injustice.\u201d (emphasis in original). The trial court disagreed, concluding that under <em>Calvin v. Calvin, </em>31 Va.App. 181, 186, 522 S.E.2d 376, 378 (1999), \u201cit can be argued that only a finding of a manifest injustice as to <em>either </em>prong is sufficient to overcome the bar to support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The trial judge erred in reading our precedent to permit a purely disjunctive test, one in which the manifest injustice conclusion could be based on either the relative degrees of fault or the economic disparities of the parties. \u201cIn order to find that denial of support will constitute a manifest injustice, the court must base that finding on the parties\u2019 comparative economic circumstances <em>and </em>the respective degrees of fault.\u201d <em>Barnes v. Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. 98, 101-03, 428 S.E.2d 294, 298 (1993) (emphasis in original). We italicized the word \u201cand\u201d in <em>Barnes </em>precisely because the statute makes clear that the decision must be rooted in both factors.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>We disagree with the trial court\u2019s view that <em>Calvin </em>effectively retooled Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) into a disjunctive test. In <em>Calvin, </em>we noted only that the \u201crespective degrees of fault\u201d in that case weighed \u201cheavily\u201d in favor of the husband because of the wife\u2019s adultery and, thus, any manifest injustice resulting from a denial of spousal support \u201cmust derive from the relative economic circumstances of the parties.\u201d <em>Calvin, </em>31 Va.App. at 186, 522 S.E.2d at 378. We made that observation based upon the facts in the appellate record and the specific argument presented to us on appeal. The appellee in <em>Calvin </em>did not file a brief on appeal or participate in oral argument. <em>Id. </em>at 182, n. 1, 522 S.E.2d at 376, n. 1. <em>Calvin </em>did not expressly mention, much less analyze, whether Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) requires a conjunctive or a disjunctive test. To be sure, <em>Calvin </em>cited <em>Barms </em>without noting any conflict between the two decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Under Virginia law, a decision of one panel \u201cbecomes a predicate for application of the doctrine of <em>stare </em>decisis\u201d and cannot be overruled except by the Court of Appeals sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Virginia Supreme Court. <em>Johnson v. Commonwealth, </em>252 Va. 425, 430, 478 S.E.2d 539, 541 (1996). This principle applies not merely to the literal holding of the case, but also to its <em>ratio decidendi </em>\u2014 the essential rationale in the case that determines the judgment. Absent a clear indication to the contrary, therefore, we must presume that the panel deciding <em>Calvin </em>did not intend to undermine <em>Barnes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Despite the trial court\u2019s mistaken restatement of the legal standard, the court made alternative factual findings on both prongs of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B). On the \u201crespective degrees of fault\u201d factor, the trial court correctly observed that in this context fault \u201cencompasses all behavior that affected the marital relationship, including any acts or conditions which contributed to the marriage\u2019s failure, success, or well-being.\u201d <em>See Barnes, </em>16 Va.App. at 102, 428 S.E.2d at 298. Using this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>definition, the trial court rejected the contention that Lynn\u2019s adultery rendered the balance of wrongdoing \u201ccompletely one-sided.\u201d Though the trial court did not enumerate the various aspects of fault attributable to John, Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) does not require that this enumeration be done. What \u00a7 20-107.1(B) does require, the trial judge did. He weighed the respective degrees of fault by considering the essential question of culpability for the marriage\u2019s demise.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The ultimate issue remains, then, whether clear and convincing evidence of John\u2019s and Lynn\u2019s respective degrees of marital fault \u2014 coupled with an examination of the economic disparities between them \u2014 supports a finding of manifest injustice. This issue resolves itself under our appellate review standard. Under this standard, if \u201cthe record contains credible evidence in support of the findings made by that court, we may not retry the facts or substitute our view of the facts for those of the trial court.\u201d <em>Calvin, </em>31 Va.App. at 183, 522 S.E.2d at 377 (quoting <em>Ferguson v. Stafford County Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>14 Va.App. 333, 336, 417 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">On the \u201crespective degrees of fault\u201d issue, the evidence before the trial judge pits Lynn\u2019s admitted adultery against John\u2019s twenty-year showing of base and profane behavior, not only with his wife, but with his children and his extended family. We believe a reasonable jurist could put John\u2019s \u201cfault\u201d in a league apart from the type of mere incivility or petulance of manners ordinarily alleged, and often proved, in nearly every contested divorce case. We thus dismiss as exaggerated John\u2019s argument that sustaining the trial court\u2019s finding on these facts would effectively write the \u201crespective degrees of fault\u201d factor out of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B). Nor do we believe, as John contends, that the trial court\u2019s finding essentially declares that John\u2019s behavior \u201camounted to a justification for adultery.\u201d The law does not excuse, condone, or justify Lynn\u2019s infidelity. But neither does the law turn a blind eye to John\u2019s behavior, which multiple witnesses described as both unrestrained and longstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>On the second factor, the \u201crelative economic circumstances of the parties,\u201d Code \u00a7 20 \u2014 107.1(B), the trial court found \u201cextreme disparities in their relative economic situations, both in terms of earning capacity, current incomes and other economic assets and resources.\u201d Ample evidence supports this finding. John has a secure job -with a family company paying over $250,000 a year plus corporate dividends and family related gifts. John\u2019s interests in stocks, real estate, and tangible assets exceeds $6 million. On the other hand, Lynn has no separate assets of any significance and holds down a $10.00-an-hour job as a receptionist.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">For these reasons, the trial court was not plainly wrong in finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that denying spousal support under Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B) would constitute a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d based upon the respective degrees of fault attributable to John and Lynn as well as their disparate financial circumstances. Because credible evidence supports that conclusion, we affirm the trial court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Lynn contends that the trial court erred by not classifying as marital the full appreciation in John\u2019s stock in his family\u2019s trucking company that occurred during the marriage. The court divided the appreciation component of the stock value into 90% separate and 10% marital. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s factual findings on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Separate property that increases in value during the marriage \u201cshall be marital property only to the extent that marital property or the personal efforts of either party have contributed to such increases, provided that any such personal efforts must be significant and result in substantial appreciation of the separate property.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A)(3)(a). Separate property that has appreciated in value due to forces other than either party\u2019s efforts, such as passive appreciation or the personal efforts of others, remains separate property. <em>See Martin v. Martin, </em>27 Va.App. 745, 750, 501 S.E.2d 450, 452 (1998) <em>(en banc). </em>In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the nonowning spouse shall bear the burden of proving that (i) contributions of marital property or personal effort were made and (ii) the separate property increased in value. Once this burden of proof is met, the owning spouse shall bear the burden of proving\u2019 that the increase in value or some portion thereof was not caused by contributions of marital property or personal effort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Code \u00a7 20-107.S(A)(3)(a); <em>see Gilman v. Gilman, </em>32 Va.App. 104, 120, 526 S.E.2d 763, 771 (2000). Slight efforts are not enough; the nonowning spouse must prove that personal efforts \u201cwere significant and resulted in substantial appreciation of separate property.\u201d <em>Bchara v. Bchara, </em>38 Va.App. 302, 314, 563 S.E.2d 398, 404 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In this case, credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that John\u2019s stock appreciated greatly because of passive growth and the efforts of others. The court examined in detail the \u201cextent that Mr. Congdon\u2019s efforts were an active part of the company\u2019s overall growth.\u201d Taking into account that John\u2019s father, brother, and other key officers played more active managerial roles in the family business, the trial court found John\u2019s efforts contributed to only 10% of the stock appreciation. <em>See Rowe v. Rowe, </em>24 Va.App. 123, 133-34, 480 S.E.2d 760, 764-65 (1997) (recognizing that brother\u2019s efforts and growth in surrounding areas undermined the significance of husband\u2019s contributions to the stock\u2019s increase in value); <em>Decker v. Decker, </em>17 Va.App. 12, 17-18, 435 S.E.2d 407, 411-12 (1993) (finding that husband\u2019s value to company illustrated his \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to the stock\u2019s increase in value). Lynn has not shown this factual finding to be plainly erroneous or without evidence to support it.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">The trial court did not err in awarding spousal support under the \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d exception to the adultery bar of Code \u00a7 20-107.1(B). Despite articulating the legal standard incorrectly, the court\u2019s factual findings show that it applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>both factors in reaching its decision. We thus reject John\u2019s challenge to the support award.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We also affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to classify 90% of the stock appreciation as separate property. The court applied Code \u00a7 20-107.3(A) properly and rested its conclusion on a satisfactory factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-11\">.
