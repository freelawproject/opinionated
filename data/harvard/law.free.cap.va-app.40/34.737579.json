On appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Shropshire alleges that the evidence was insufficient to establish all the elements necessary to prove grand larceny by false pretenses. For the following reasons, we reverse the conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">On May 16, 2001, Shropshire looked at a Ford Taurus in the inventory of Oakridge Toyota and told salesman Michael Stanley that he would buy the car \u201cwith a check he was going to get from his credit union.\u201d The record does not reflect the parties reached an agreement as to the purchase price of the car. Marshall Wilson, the finance manager, then assisted Shropshire in filling out \u201ca Buyer\u2019s Order, Odometer Statement, the standard documents.\u201d None of these documents are in the record, nor is there any description of their terms or if these documents were executed by Shropshire. Wilson testified he \u201cfilled out\u201d the documents \u201cin expectation that he [Shropshire] would come back and purchase it.\u201d Stanley testified that because Shropshire had previously purchased a car from him, he gave Shropshire possession of the Taurus on May 16, 2001, based on his representation that he would return with a credit union check because he had \u201csigned all the paperwork\u201d and \u201cpurchased the vehicle.\u201d No \u201cpaperwork\u201d is in the record, nor is there a description of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On May 23, 2001, the manager of Oakridge Toyota received a check from Shropshire which he left in Marshall Wilson\u2019s desk drawer. Nothing appears on the face of the check to denote its purpose. The check was payable to Oakridge Toyota in the amount of $4,200 and was drawn on an account at Carolina Federal Credit Union, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Oakridge Toyota was later notified that the check could not be cashed and was \u201creturned unpaid insufficient funds.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The record indicates \u201cat some point the car was returned,\u201d but does not specify when or by whom.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Shropshire was charged in an indictment with grand larceny by false pretenses from Oakridge Toyota in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-178. At trial, the $4,200 check was introduced into evidence. The Commonwealth then sought to prove Carolina Federal Credit Union did not exist and the check was therefore fraudulent. To do so the Commonwealth offered an affidavit from Joe Ostrowidzki, the Acting Director of Insurance of Region III of the National Credit Union Administration (\u201cNCUA\u201d). Over Shropshire\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted the affidavit into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Mr. Ostrowidzki certified in the affidavit that he is the custodian of all NCUA records for federally chartered and/or insured credit unions in the state of South Carolina. He also certified that a review of those records showed that Carolina Federal Credit Union was neither federally insured nor chartered at any time in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The trial court convicted Shropshire of obtaining the Taurus by false pretenses from Oakridge Toyota in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-178. Shropshire now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">When considering the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal in a criminal case, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth (as the prevailing party in the trial court), granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). On review, this Court does not substitute its own judgment for that of the trier of fact. <em>See Cable v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 236, 239, 415 S.E.2d 218, 220 (1992). The trial court\u2019s judgment will not be set aside unless it appears that the judgment is plainly wrong or without supporting evidence. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Shropshire asserts that the evidence was insufficient to establish all the requisite elements of the offense of grand larceny by false pretenses. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In order to sustain a conviction for larceny by false pretenses the Commonwealth must prove the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201c(1) an intent to defraud; (2) an actual fraud; (3) use of false pretenses for the purpose of perpetrating the fraud; and (4) accomplishment of the fraud by means of the false pretenses used for the purpose, that is, the false pretenses to some degree must have induced the owner to part with his property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\"><em>Riegert v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 511, 518, 237 S.E.2d 803, 807 (1977) (citation omitted). In addition to the elements above, \u201c \u2018[a]n essential element of larceny by false pretenses is that both title to and possession of property must pass from the victim to the defendant (or his nominee).\u2019 \u201d <em>Baker v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 192, 194, 300 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1983) (quoting <em>Cunningham v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 399, 402, 247 S.E.2d 683, 685 (1978)). \u201cThe gravamen of the offense ... is the obtainment of ownership of property, by false representations or pretenses.\u201d <em>Quidley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 963, 966, 275 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1981). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proved all other elements of the crime, the record does not contain evidence that Shropshire acquired any type of ownership interest in the Taurus.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">In <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 164, 503 S.E.2d 222 (1998), this Court held that the defendant acquired a sufficient property interest to support his conviction for larceny by false pretenses by receipt of a temporary certificate of ownership. The Commonwealth argues that the issuance of a temporary certificate of ownership was not necessary to support the holding in <em>Lewis </em>and was not required in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>this case to prove the requisite element of ownership.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We agree that ownership or title sufficient to support a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-178 regarding a motor vehicle, could be proven by evidence other than a temporary certificate of ownership or other state issued muniment of title as under Code \u00a7 46.2-628. However, the record in this case does not contain such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">We discussed in <em>Lewis </em>that certain documentation of a sale could effectively vest sufficient indicia of ownership to a motor vehicle in an alleged thief so as to satisfy the requirement for obtaining title (as opposed to mere possession) as an element of the crime of obtaining the vehicle by false pretenses. Depending on the facts of a case, title might be sufficiently proven by a conditional sale contract, promissory note and security agreement or similar evidence. <em>Lewis, </em>28 Va.App. at 168-69, 503 S.E.2d at 223-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In the case at bar there is no temporary certificate of ownership or any other state issued title document in the record. Neither is there a promissory note, sales contract, or other document that would evidence some type of ownership transfer, either equitable or legal, from Oakridge Toyota to Shropshire. The record reflects only that \u201cpaperwork\u201d was prepared. To deduce a transfer of ownership based on unknown \u201cpaperwork\u201d is utter speculation and conjecture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>The record lacks evidence that Shropshire had anything other than mere possession of the vehicle. Our precedent is clear that a conviction for larceny by false pretenses requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that title to the property purloined passes to the perpetrator. <em>See Baker, </em>225 Va. at 194, 300 S.E.2d at 789; <em>Cunningham, </em>219 Va. at 402, 247 S.E.2d at 685. That proof is not contained in the record before us. Without such evidence, the Commonwealth has failed to establish a transfer of title took place to vest Shropshire with ownership rights sufficient to support the conviction. Based on the record in this case, the trial judge\u2019s determination that title or ownership of the Taurus passed to Shropshire was plainly wrong and without evidence to support it. For this reason we reverse Shropshire\u2019s conviction and dismiss the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-8\">. Shropshire alleged two other errors by the trial court: (1) that a continuance granted the Commonwealth violated his due process rights and (2) the use of an affidavit under Code \u00a7-8.01-390(B) violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. As we reverse the decision on other grounds, we do not address Shropshire\u2019s other claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\">. For purposes of the element of proof for larceny by false pretenses, we read the terms \"title\u201d and \u201cownership\u201d to be synonymous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b80-9\">. The dissent represents that Shropshire and Oakridge Toyota entered into a binding oral conditional sales contract which transferred a sufficient, but undefined, ownership interest to Shropshire so as to meet the criminal ownership element for obtaining property by false pretenses. This claim was not argued at trial and the trial court made no such finding. Assuming, but not deciding, that ownership for purposes of the title element of obtaining a motor vehicle by false pretenses can be proven solely by an oral conditional sales contract, the record in this case does not contain evidence establishing such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">While Shropshire and Stanley discussed Shropshire purchasing the Taurus, the record does not show the parties reached an agreement as to the purchase price of the Taurus, much less, what that price was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>be. The record does not reflect the time within which a contract was to be performed, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-10\">While Shropshire apparently indicated he was going to get a credit union check, the record is silent as to whether such a check was to represent a refundable deposit, a down payment, full payment, or something else. Further, nothing in the record represents Oakridge Toyota was retaining a security interest in the car or that it had parted with anything other than mere possession when Shropshire drove the Taurus off the Oakridge Toyota lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-11\">In short, the covenants sufficient to create a binding contract just don\u2019t appear in the record. Inference from surmise on appeal cannot supply the evidence the Commonwealth failed to present at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b81-6\">KELSEY, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">In cases where \u201cgoods are sold under a conditional sales contract and the legal title is merely retained for purposes of security, the vendee gets a sufficient property interest to support a conviction of obtaining money by false pretenses provided the other requisites of the offense are present.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 164, 168, 503 S.E.2d 222, 224 (1998) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The majority accepts this principle of law, but finds the facts insufficient to establish that Shropshire entered into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>conditional sale contract -with the seller. This holding rests on the assertion that the \u201crecord lacks evidence that Shropshire had anything other than mere possession of the vehicle.\u201d The majority comes to this conclusion, I believe, by (i) restating the facts in the light most favorable to Shropshire, (ii) assuming that a conditional sale contract requires some measure of formality not present in this case, and (iii) applying a less-than-deferential standard of appellate review. For these three reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence \u2014 coupled with inferences reasonably deduced from it \u2014 proved that on May 16, 2001, Shropshire and Oak-ridge Toyota entered into a sale contract that identified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">\u25a0 the object of the sale agreement (a Ford Taurus);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u25a0 the purchase price ($4,200);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">\u25a0 the date of delivery (May 16, 2001);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">\u25a0 the timing of payment (as soon as he could \u201cget a check from his credit union to pay for it\u201d); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">\u25a0 the seller\u2019s retention of the document of title as security for the buyer\u2019s payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">Oakridge Toyota agreed to deliver the vehicle to Shropshire on May 16, 2001, based on his promise that he would bring back \u201ca check from his credit union.\u201d Relying on this representation, the salesman testified that he \u201cfilled the paperwork out and took it to our finance manager.\u201d The finance manager, comfortable that Shropshire \u201cwas going to bring [him] a check,\u201d allowed Shropshire to take the Ford Taurus that day. At that point, Oakridge Toyota had fully performed its part of the contract. Under this arrangement, if Shropshire\u2019s check (which arrived \u201cthe next day or the day after\u201d the sale) had been valid, he would have received the document of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">This evidence proved that the contract was fully formed on May 16, 2001 \u2014 the day Shropshire picked out the vehicle he wanted to buy, negotiated the price, agreed on the payment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>terms, signed all the relevant paperwork, and drove the car away. If this transaction was not a sale, it is hard to imagine what it might be. As the Oakridge Toyota salesman testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\">Q: Did you have occasion to assist one Matthew Shropshire for the <em>purchase </em>of a car at Oakridge Toyota?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">A: <em>Yes, I did.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">* Hi H\u00ab Hi Hi *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">Q: And, Mr. Stanley, how was it that you came in contact with Mr. Shropshire in May of this year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">A: He had previously <em>purchased </em>a car from me before that \u25a0with cash money; and he came in and wanted to <em>purchase </em>another one.

What paperwork did you assist him in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-26\">A: A <em>Buyer\u2019s Order, </em>Odometer Statement, the standard documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Q: So how did [Shropshire] first approach you then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">A: He came \u2014 the salesman brought the paperwork in and said, this gentleman <em>is buying an automobile; </em>here\u2019s the paperwork, go to the computer and print the paperwork.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">$$$$$$</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">Q: And then after that, that\u2019s when you did \u2014 filled out all the paperwork?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">A few days later, Shropshire delivered a $4,200 check to Oakridge Toyota. A co-manager on duty that day, who had not participated in the sale, accepted the check from Shropshire \u201cfor payment on a vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">At no point at trial or on appeal has Shropshire argued that he entered into some agreement other than a purchase contract. Nor has he ever contended that the promised check referred to something other than payment of the purchase price. In his brief on appeal, Shropshire summarizes the transaction this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">Matthew Shropshire initially said he wanted to trade a 1988 Blazer for the Taurus but later decided to <em>purchase it </em>without a trade-in. He went on to say he would have to get a check from his credit union. Mr. Stanley [the salesman] completed the necessary paperwork and turned it over to Marshall Wilson, the finance manager. He also gave Matthew Shropshire possession of the vehicle prior to <em>delivery of payment </em>and without seeing a check. Marshall Wilson <em>completed the paper work for Matthew Shropshire\u2019s purchase of the Taurus on May 16, 2001. Mr. Wilson did not receive a deposit for the car and understood a check would be delivered as payment.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6-7 (citations to transcript omitted and emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In a conditional sales contract, the purchaser secures \u201cthe right to acquire\u201d the property \u201cby completing the payments pursuant to the terms of the contract.\u201d <em>Chappell v. State, </em>216 Ind. 666, 25 N.E.2d 999, 1001 (1940). The vendor in such a transaction retains title to the goods. This \u201cretention of title,\u201d however, is not absolute ownership; it is \u201cat most, a form of security for the payment of the purchase money.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>28 Va.App. at 169, 503 S.E.2d at 224 (citation omitted). As the United States Supreme Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-5\">The parties to a conditional sale have divided property interests in the goods. <em>The buyer is the beneficial and substantial owner, with such attributes of ownership as possession, </em>use and control, and has his equity of redemption sedulously guarded by the law. The seller, on the other hand, reserves title to the goods solely as security for payment or performance by the buyer. Essentially a conditional sale is only a credit device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-6\"><em>Int\u2019l Harvester Credit Corp. v. Goodrich, </em>350 U.S. 537, 545 n. 11, 76 S.Ct. 621, 100 L.Ed. 681 (1956) (emphasis added and citation omitted). Purchasers thereby become \u201cowners of the property\u201d subject only to the security interest rights of their sellers. <em>Lewis, </em>28 Va.App. at 169, 503 S.E.2d at 224 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Virginia common law has an unbroken history of recognizing this form of secured transaction. <em>See, e.g., C.I.T. Corp. v. Guy, </em>170 Va. 16, 21, 195 S.E. 659, 660 (1938) (\u201cConditional sales of automobiles is a practice widely adopted and are often financed by corporations organized for that purpose.\u201d); <em>Jones v. Morris Plan Bank, </em>168 Va. 284, 290, 191 S.E. 608, 609 (1937) (\u201cThe sole purpose of the conditional sales contract was to retain the title in the seller until the note was paid.\u201d); <em>Royal Indem. Co. v. Hook, </em>155 Va. 956, 960, 157 S.E. 414, 415 (1931) (\u201cThis purchase was made under a conditional sales contract whereby title remained in the vendor to secure to it the balance due.\u201d); <em>Transit Corp. v. Four Wheel Drive Auto Co., </em>151 Va. 865, 873, 145 S.E. 331, 333 (1928) (the \u201cpurpose\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>of a conditional sales contract is \u201cto secure the unpaid purchase money as contemplated by the original contract of purchase\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Virginia statutory law likewise treats conditional vendees as beneficial owners. Under the Virginia Motor Vehicle Act, Code \u00a7 46.2-100, an \u201cowner\u201d includes not only a person holding \u201clegal title\u201d but also one acquiring the vehicle pursuant to a \u201cconditional sale ... with an immediate right of possession vested in the conditional vendee\u201d pursuant to the contract. <em>See also </em>Code \u00a7 46.2-1500 (\u201cRetail installment sale\u201d includes sales \u201cin which the price of the vehicle is payable in one or more installments and in which the seller has ... retained title to the goods\u201d under a \u201cconditional sale\u201d contract.).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">While not immediately passing absolute legal title, a conditional sales contract passes equitable title \u2014 thereby setting in motion the process by which the purchaser will eventually, by satisfying the contractual obligations, obtain absolute legal title. <em>See Lewis, </em>28 Va.App. at 169, 503 S.E.2d at 224.

Instead, the relevant question is whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 (emphasis in original). This deference applies not only to the historical facts themselves, but the inferences from those facts as well. \u201cThe inferences to be drawn from proven facts, so long as they are reasonable, are within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>Hancock v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 774, 783, 407 S.E.2d 301, 306 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Governed by this standard of review, the evidence satisfies the sufficiency test. A rational fact finder could have found (and, in this case, did find) that Shropshire and Oakridge Toyota entered into a sales contract on May 16, 2001. The rationality of this conclusion rests on the uncontradicted testimony of the Oakridge Toyota salesman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">Q: Did you help fill out any of the paperwork, Mr. Stanley?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-7\">A: I filled the paperwork out and took it to our finance manager, Mr. Wilson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">Q: <em>And at that time had he, in fact, purchased the vehicle?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-9\">A: <em>Yes, he had.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Because Shropshire was \u201cbuying an automobile,\u201d the finance manager required him to fill out the necessary \u201cpaperwork\u201d which included a \u201cBuyer\u2019s Order, Odometer Statement, the standard documents.\u201d As the salesman put it, Shropshire had \u201csigned all the paperwork and done the contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Under Virginia law, a \u201cbuyer\u2019s order\u201d is a statutory term of art with a discrete meaning. A buyer\u2019s order must be issued by a dealer \u201cfor each sale or exchange of a motor vehicle.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.2-1530. A buyer\u2019s order must include, among other things, the \u201cdate of the sale or trade,\u201d the \u201csale price of the vehicle,\u201d and other terms of the sale. <em>Id. </em>The issuance of a buyer\u2019s order in this case confirms that Shropshire entered into a purchase agreement with Oakridge Toyota at the time he took possession of the vehicle. Aside from that fact \u2014 the character of the transaction as a purchase agreement \u2014 it matters not, for purposes of showing a transfer of ownership interest under false pretenses law, what other specific contractual covenants accompanied the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The trial judge did not, as the majority asserts, \u201cdeduce a transfer of ownership based on unknown \u2018paperwork\u2019 \u201d and thereby engage in \u201cutter speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 40, 577 S.E.2d at 524. The trial judge\u2019s deduction follows from the fact that Shropshire (i) \u201cpurchased\u201d the Taurus \u201cat that time,\u201d (ii) \u201csigned all the paperwork and [had] done the contracts,\u201d and after doing so (iii) took immediate possession of the vehicle and drove it off the lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">The conditional sale aspect of the contract, sufficient to transfer an ownership interest under <em>Lewis, </em>also rested on undisputed evidence. The \u201creason\u201d Shropshire was allowed \u201cto drive off the lot\u201d was because, as the salesman explained, \u201cI trusted him.\u201d Shropshire obtained immediate possession because he agreed to bring back \u201ca check from his credit union.\u201d At that point, Oakridge Toyota had fully performed its part of the contract. And the essential elements of that contract place it squarely within the definition of a conditional sale. Under this arrangement, if Shropshire\u2019s check (which arrived \u201cthe next day or the day after\u201d the sale) had been valid, he would have had an indisputable right to the document of title.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Finally, I disagree that the conditional sales contract point \u201cwas not argued at trial and. the trial court made no such finding.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 40, n. 3, 577 S.E.2d at 524, n. 3. Both the trial judge and Shropshire\u2019s counsel commented on <em>Lewis </em>during the closing argument colloquy. Shropshire\u2019s counsel claimed <em>Lewis </em>required the physical transfer of a temporary document of title before a vendee could obtain any ownership interest \u2014 completely overlooking the concept of equitable title endorsed by <em>Lewis </em>and accepted by the majority, see <em>ante </em>at 40, 577 S.E.2d at 524.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In reply, the Commonwealth correctly observed: \u201cWith respect to his argument about how the car was transferred, I think [Shropshire\u2019s counsel is] getting extremely technical on a distinction without a difference.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court agreed, holding that \u201cthe dealership parted with possession and Title even though Legal Title [had] not actually transferred at that point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">As to the contention that the \u201ctrial court made no such finding,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 40, n. 3, 577 S.E.2d at 524, n. 3, the court\u2019s conviction order is all the \u201cfinding\u201d we need. Under settled principles, \u201ca reviewing court \u2018faced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume \u2014 even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>if it does not affirmatively appear in the record \u2014 that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution^]\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright v. West, </em>505 U.S. 277, 296-97, 112 S.Ct. 2482, 120 L.Ed.2d 225 (1992) (quoting <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Upon entering into a conditional sales contract and receiving unrestricted possession, Shropshire obtained equitable title of the vehicle and became its beneficial owner for purposes of false pretenses law. <em>See Lewis, </em>28 Va.App. at 169, 503 S.E.2d at 224. Given the evidence before the trial court, the majority errs in finding no \u201crational trier of fact\u201d could have come to this conclusion. <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-10\">. The Uniform Commercial Code codified this principle by retooling the reservation of title into mere retention of a security interest. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.2-401(1) (\u201cAny retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">.

The distinction drawn between an oral versus a written conditional sale contract is one raised only by the majority. <em>See Ante </em>at 40, n. 3, 577 S.E.2d at 524, n. 3. At no point in this case (either during trial, in the appellate briefs, or at oral argument) has anyone argued that false pretenses law includes some <em>de facto </em>statute of frauds requirement. Nothing in <em>Lewis </em>imposes such a rule, and it cannot be extrapolated from any of the precedent cited by the parties or the court. At trial, the Commonwealth offered extensive evidence of a conditional sale and, on appeal, argues that the evidence of the sale was sufficient to support the conviction.
