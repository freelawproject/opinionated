On appeal, she contends the trial court\u2019s admission of her testimony from the previous trial of her boyfriend violated Code \u00a7 19.2-270: We hold the prior testimony was inadmissible against appellant under Code \u00a7 19.2-270 because it was not \u201ca statement ... made when [she was] examined as a witness in [her] own behalf.\u201d Thus, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">On June 5, 2000, Ampazzio Warren was tried by a jury for three felonies, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, possession of a firearm while in possession of cocaine, and possession of a concealed weapon, second offense. While the jury was deliberating in the guilt phase of the trial, Warren left the courthouse and failed to return.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">Warren was subsequently arrested in Burlington, North Carolina. On September 8, 2000, he was tried on a charge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>failure to appear based on his flight from the June 5, 2000 trial. Warren entered a plea of not guilty. Appellant appeared at that proceeding and testified on Warren\u2019s behalf. Appellant, through counsel, claimed to have been subpoenaed on Warren\u2019s behalf, and the Commonwealth \u201cassum[ed]\u201d \u201cfor the purposes of [the subsequent proceedings against appellant]\u201d \u201cthat she was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Appellant testified that Warren was her boyfriend and that she was pregnant with his child both at the time of his June 5, 2000 trial and the time of the September 8, 2000 trial. Appellant testified that while the jury was deliberating, she spoke to Warren in the hall and told him the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">I didn\u2019t think he was havin\u2019 a fair trial given to him ..., and I was just real upset, and ... I spoke with him in private, and I told [him] I was scared, and \u2018dat I didn\u2019t want him to stay here. I wanted him to leave with me, and I told him that if he didn\u2019t[,] \u201cI\u2019ll kill myself and our child\u201d that I\u2019m carryin\u2019.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Appellant admitted that while Warren was a fugitive, he \u201cwas staying down in Burlington with [her] and [her] father.\u201d Appellant said she was \u201cconcerned about [her] boyfriend and the father of this child[ ] going to prison\u201d and admitted \u201c[she] knew it was wrong for [Warren] to leave Court.\u201d The following exchange then took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-8\">[PROSECUTOR:] And you encouraged him to do it anyway, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-9\">[APPELLANT:] Yes sir, and that\u2019s what I came to Court for today ... to accept that responsibility and whatever punishment seems fit for it ... that I knew I\u2019d done wrong, and I made a lot of wrong decisions. It affected [Warren], me, his aunt, my father ... a lot of people, also.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-10\">[PROSECUTOR:] Well, you ... do you have any comprehension that you have just admitted to committing a felony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">[APPELLANT:] Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">In November 2000, appellant was indicted for aiding and abetting Warren\u2019s failure to appear. On July 17, 2001, she was tried for that offense. The parties agreed on the relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>factual and procedural background. The Commonwealth\u2019s only substantive evidence of appellant\u2019s acts of aiding and abetting was appellant\u2019s testimony from Warren\u2019s trial on the charge of failure to appear. Appellant argued that the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-270 rendered that prior testimony inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The trial court framed the issue as \u201cwhether or not the defendant, Ms. Frazier, was examined as a witness in her own behalf at Mr. Warren\u2019s trial\u201d and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-6\">[T]he transcript not only provides evidence that Ms. Frazier directly involved herself in Mr. Warren\u2019s decision to leave the courtroom, but it also provides evidence of a strong relationship.... [I]n <em>[Thornton v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 2, 467 S.E.2d 820 (1996)], ... it was brothers, I think.... In this case, it\u2019s a situation where we have a boyfriend and girlfriend relationship, but more than that, we have a situation where the defendant, Miss Frazier, was carrying Mr. Warren\u2019s child. So I think [Thornton] does apply ... and I think <em>[Thornton] </em>says that ... circumstances such as the relationship and additional circumstances concerning whether or not the person was compelled to testify at the request of the Commonwealth, are issues [with which] the Court needs to concern itself. Here, it\u2019s no question, just as in <em>[Thornton], </em>that Ms. Frazier and Mr. Warren had a joint interest in the prior case.... [S]o in this case, ... I think the exception in 19.2-270 applies, because I think that she felt that she had an interest in that prior case, ... and that she was testifying, in essence, not only in Mr. Warren\u2019s behalf, but also in her own behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_n\">The trial court then found appellant guilty of the charged offense, and appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-270 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">In a criminal prosecution, other than for perjury, or in an action on a penal statute, evidence shall not be given against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the accused of any statement made by him as a witness upon a legal examination, in a criminal' or civil action, unless such statement was made when examined as a witness in his own behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">At issue in this case is the meaning of the phrase, \u201cwhen examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The statute originally contained no such language, providing only that, \u201c \u2018In a criminal prosecution other than for perjury, or an action on a penal statute, evidence shall not be given against the accused of any statement made by him as a witness upon a legal examination.\u2019\u201d <em>Thaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>132 Va. 795, 801-02, 111 S.E. 259, 261 (1922) (quoting Code of 1873, c. 195, \u00a7 22, which it listed as \u201csubsequently amended and now appearing as section 4781\u201d). The General Assembly added the final clause of the statute to reverse the holding in <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>77 Va. 681 (1883). <em>See Thaniel, </em>132 Va. at 802, 111 S.E. at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\"><em>Kirby </em>involved two trials, with the accused testifying only in the first one. <em>Kirby, </em>77 Va. at 689-90. At the second trial, Kirby offered testimony from two witnesses that was at odds with his own testimony in the first trial. <em>Id. </em>at 690. The trial court allowed the Commonwealth to introduce Kirby\u2019s testimony from the first trial to show the conflict, but the Supreme Court, based on the language of the statute, held that the admission was error. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[That] decision was in conformity with the terms of the statute ... then in force; and it was doubtless to meet the effect of that decision that the statute was subsequently amended by adding the words, \u2018unless such statement was made when examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thaniel, </em>132 Va. at 802, 111 S.E. at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The Supreme Court has subsequently held that the person testifying in the prior proceeding need not have been a party to that proceeding in order for the testimony to have been given \u201cwhen [the person was] examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u201d <em>Hansel v. Commonwealth, </em>118 Va. 803, 88 S.E. 166 (1916). In <em>Hansel, </em>the accused was charged with forging and uttering an option contract for the sale of land. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>807, 88 S.E. at 166. A codefendant was charged with aiding and abetting the accused in the forgery. <em>Id. </em>Before Hansel and the codefendant were criminally charged, the codefendant filed a civil action to recover commissions due under the contract. <em>Thornton, </em>22 Va.App. at 8, 467 S.E.2d at 823. Hansel was not a party to the civil suit but testified as a witness for the codefendant and was entitled to receive one-third of the commissions sought in the civil suit. <em>Hansel, </em>118 Va. at 808, 88 S.E. at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In the subsequent criminal proceeding, the trial court admitted Hansel\u2019s testimony from the civil suit. <em>Id. </em>at 808-09, 88 S.E. at 167. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding \u201cit is sufficient to say that though Hansel was called as a witness for the [codefendant in the civil suit,] [Hansel and the codefendant] had a joint interest in the recovery. So that in point of fact he was \u2018examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809, 88 S.E. at 167. Thus, <em>Hansel </em>established that a non-party who testified as a witness in a prior proceeding and had a joint financial interest in that proceeding gave that prior testimony \u201cas a -witness in his own behalf\u2019 for purposes of admitting that testimony into evidence against him in a subsequent criminal proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">More recently, we have recognized that the joint interest motivating the witness\u2019 testimony in the prior proceeding need not have been limited to a financial interest. <em>Thornton, </em>22 Va.App. at 9-10, 467 S.E.2d at 823-24; <em>Boney v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 638, 641-42, 432 S.E.2d 7, 9 (1993) (holding that if codefendant were forced to testify, he would have been \u201c \u2018examined as a witness in his own behalf \u201d because codefendant \u201cwas in custody on charges arising out of the same incident\u201d for which Boney was being prosecuted). Boney\u2019s interest was to avoid criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In <em>Thornton, </em>for example, Thornton and his brother were charged with possessing and distributing heroin. 22 Va.App. at 4, 467 S.E.2d at 821. Thornton\u2019s brother was tried first, and Thornton was subpoenaed to testify. <em>Id. </em>Against the advice of his own attorney, Thornton informed the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\u201che understood the consequences of his actions\u201d and testified that he alone possessed and distributed the drugs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We held Thornton\u2019s testimony in his brother\u2019s trial was admissible in his own trial. <em>Id. </em>at 10, 467 S.E.2d at 824. We noted that \u201cwhether a person has been \u2018examined as a witness in his own behalf may depend, in part, upon circumstances of the prior legal examination,\u201d \u201cincluding] whether the person has been charged criminally when giving the first testimony or whether the proceeding in which the prior testimony was given was one that was adversarial to the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, 467 S.E.2d at 823 (citing <em>Thaniel, </em>132 Va. at 800, 803, 111 S.E. at 260, 261, in which Court held that Thaniel\u2019s exculpatory testimony at inquest, given when he was under subpoena and had not been charged with a crime, was admissible in subsequent criminal proceeding only for impeachment purposes). We reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">The evidence in this case proved that Thornton and his brother were arrested and charged with identical offenses arising out of the same transaction. Although not a party to his brother\u2019s earlier criminal trial, Thornton had an interest in the outcome comparable to the joint interest discussed in <em>Boney. </em>The Commonwealth\u2019s case against the brothers arose from the same transaction and rested on the same set of facts. The resolution of factual and legal issues in one case had the potential to affect the issues in the other case. Thus, we conclude that Thornton had a personal interest in the outcome of his brother\u2019s trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">Moreover, Thornton also had a familial interest in the outcome of his brother\u2019s prosecution. An acquittal of his brother or a lessening of the punishment that his brother received would have been a favorable result for him and his brother. Thornton took responsibility for the crime at his brother\u2019s trial and sought to exonerate his brother. His testimony was not compelled. Indeed, he freely testified after receiving and rejecting his counsel\u2019s advice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">As a consequence, we hold that Thornton\u2019s testimony at his brother\u2019s trial constituted statements that he made \u201cwhen examined as a witness in his own behalf.\u201d Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u00a7 19.2-270. Thus, Thornton was not \u201centitled to any protection under the statute\u201d when the prosecutor sought to use his testimony against him. <em>Boney, 16 </em>Va.App. at 642, 432 S.E.2d at 10.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 10, 467 S.E.2d at 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">Here, the trial court\u2019s ruling admitting appellant\u2019s prior testimony was based primarily on its finding of \u201ca strong relationship\u201d between appellant and Warren because she was pregnant with his child. We recognize the significance of such a relationship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the existence of such a relationship, standing alone, is insufficient to permit a finding that appellant was \u201cexamined as a witness in [her] own behalf.\u201d Had the Commonwealth, rather than Warren, called Frazier as a witness at his previous trial and had the Commonwealth elicited the same evidence which incriminated not only Warren but also herself, there can be little doubt that she would not have been testifying \u201cas a witness in her own behalf.\u201d The fact that Warren compelled her to give this testimony rather than the Commonwealth does not render the testimony substantively favorable or on \u201cher own behalf.\u201d Appellant, like Thornton did for his brother, took the stand and claimed some responsibility for Warren\u2019s failure to appear. However, in <em>Thornton, </em>the defendant and his brother had both actually been charged with identical offenses and the defendant was represented by counsel, with whom he had consulted before deciding to testify. In appellant\u2019s case, by contrast, only Warren had been charged when appellant took the stand. Further, although appellant said she knew her testimony admitting her actions could result in her being prosecuted, no evidence established that she had consulted with an attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>prior to testifying. Finally, appellant\u2019s compelled testimony did not tend to exculpate Warren or herself and was, at most, a mitigating factor explaining why Warren fled the jurisdiction mid-trial. Thus, the holding in <em>Thornton </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Citing <em>Hansel, </em>the Commonwealth argues that appellant also had a significant financial interest in the outcome of Warren\u2019s trial for failure to appear. We hold that any financial interest appellant may have had also was insufficient to permit a finding that she testified \u201cas a witness in [her] own behalf.\u201d In <em>Hansel, </em>the defendant\u2019s financial interest in the prior proceeding was a contractual right to one-third of any award received as a result of that prior proceeding. 118 Va. at 808, 88 S.E. at 166. Here, by contrast, any right of support appellant\u2019s unborn child might have after its birth was owed to the child rather than to appellant. <em>See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Rodriguez, </em>1 Va.App. 87, 91, 334 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1985) (\u201cChild support is not a property right of the custodial parent____\u201d). In the absence of marriage, appellant herself had no right of support from Warren under Virginia law. <em>See Kelderhaus v. Kelderhaus, </em>21 Va.App. 721, 725, 467 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1996) (\u201cVirginia does not recognize domestic common-law marriages .... \u201d). Thus, any financial benefit appellant might receive if appellant avoided incarceration was a mere expectation rather than a contractual or statutory right. We hold such an expectation was insufficient to render her prior testimony admissible against her under Code \u00a7 19.2-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">As we have recognized previously,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-270 benefits both the witness-in-jeopardy and the accused by immunizing the witness. Benefit to the witness from use of immunity is manifest. The benefit to the accused lies in taking away the obstacle to confrontation posed by the witness\u2019 continued assertion of the fifth amendment privilege. A third, and equally important, benefit accrues to the truthfinding process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-10\"><em>Cunningham, v. Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va.App. 358, 363, 344 S.E.2d 389, 391 (1986). While extending the decisions in <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Hansel </em>to uphold the admission of appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>prior testimony would benefit the truth-finding process in this particular case, such an extension of <em>Thornton </em>and <em>Hansel </em>will inhibit the ability of other defendants to obtain truthful testimony from witnesses in future cases if those witnesses perceive that the protections of Code \u00a7 19.2-270 are illusory or have been eviscerated. We are unwilling to further extend the exceptions to Code \u00a7 19.2-270 to include any witness who knows the defendant and gives testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial. Thus, we hold that when appellant testified at Warren\u2019s trial for failing to appear and admitted that Warren fled the jurisdiction in the middle of his earlier trial for drug and firearms charges, albeit upon appellant\u2019s encouragement and threats of harm to herself and her unborn child, appellant did not give that testimony \u201cas a witness in [her] own behalf.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">For these reasons, we reverse appellant\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">. The legislature has recognized this significance in other contexts. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228 (recognizing intensity of relationship that may result from such status by defining \"Family or household member\u201d to include \"any individual who has a child in common with the person, whether or not the person and that individual have been married or have resided together at any time\u201d for purposes of juvenile and domestic relations district court\u2019s jurisdiction); Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 (imposing heightened penalties for repeated assault and battery against a \"family or household member\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 16.1-228).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b401-7\">FITZPATRICK, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AfC\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Based on the reasoning in <em>Hansel v. Commonwealth, </em>118 Va. 803, 88 S.E. 166 (1916), and <em>Thornton v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 2, 467 S.E.2d 820 (1996), I would affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The trial court ruled that, at Ampazzio Warren\u2019s trial for failing to appear, appellant \u201cwas testifying, in essence, not only in Mr. Warren\u2019s behalf, but also in her own behalf.\u201d Appellant\u2019s testimony established that Warren was her boyfriend and that, at both the time she encouraged him to flee the jurisdiction and at the time she testified at his resulting trial for failing to appear, she was pregnant with his child. <em>Cf. </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-228 (recognizing intensity of relationship that may result from such status by defining \u201cFamily or household member\u201d to include \u201cany individual who has a child in common with the person, whether or not the person and that individual have been married or have resided together at any time\u201d for purposes of juvenile and domestic relations district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>jurisdiction); Code \u00a7 18.2-57.2 (imposing heightened penalties for repeated assault and battery against a \u201cfamily or household member\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 16.1-228); <em>Bennett v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., </em>22 Va.App. 684, 691-92, 472 S.E.2d 668, 672 (1996) (discussing duty of parents to provide support for minor child).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Appellant admitted she encouraged Warren to flee his trial for drug and weapons offenses on June 5, 2000, because she did not want \u201c[her] boyfriend and the father of this child[ ] going to prison.\u201d A reasonable inference is that her feelings were the same when she testified at Warren\u2019s trial of September 8, 2000, for failing to appear and that she hoped to help him avoid incarceration for that offense or at least to lessen his punishment. Thus, although the facts are not identical, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that appellant had the type of personal, financial and familial interests set out in <em>Hansel </em>and <em>Thornton </em>and, thus, that her testimony from Warren\u2019s trial for failing to appear was admissible in her subsequent trial for aiding and abetting that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Although no charges were pending against appellant when she testified in Warren\u2019s trial for failing to appear and no evidence established that appellant obtained legal advice before giving self-incriminating testimony at Warren\u2019s trial, nothing in the case law holds that such advice is a prerequisite to the admissibility of such testimony in a subsequent proceeding. <em>See Thornton, </em>22 Va.App. at 8, 467 S.E.2d at 823 (noting that resolution of admissibility issue \u201cmay depend, in part, upon circumstances of the prior legal examination\u201d); <em>id. </em>(noting that, in <em>Hansel, </em>prior testimony in civil suit was given <em>before </em>filing of criminal charges against Hansel). We merely recognized, in reciting the facts in <em>Thornton, </em>that the accused had received such advice. <em>Id. </em>at 4, 467 S.E.2d at 821.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Further, appellant clearly contemplated that the institution of a criminal prosecution against her was likely to result from her testimony in Warren\u2019s trial for failing to appear. She expressly testified that the reason she \u201ccame to Court\u201d for that proceeding was \u201cto accept ... responsibility\u201d for encour<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>aging Warren to flee \u201cand whatever punishment seems fit for it.\u201d When asked by the prosecutor, \u201c[D]o you have any comprehension that you have just admitted to committing a felony?\u201d appellant responded, \u2018Tes sir.\u201d Thus, despite the fact that appellant had not yet been charged with aiding and abetting Warren\u2019s flight, she expressly recognized the possibility that charges for aiding and abetting might be forthcoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Although Code \u00a7 19.2-270 is designed to \u201cbeneflt[ ] both the witness-in-jeopardy and the accused by immunizing the witness,\u201d we have recognized that \u201c[a] third, and equally important benefit, accrues to the truthfinding process.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 358, 363, 344 S.E.2d 389, 391 (1986). As the legislature acknowledged in amending the statute after <em>Kirby v. Commonwealth, </em>77 Va. 681 (1883), and as this Court and the Supreme Corat have acknowledged in interpreting the amended language, applying the statute to immunize (a) a defendant on retrial or (b) a witness with strong ties to a defendant, on whose behalf he has testified, so that both the witness and the defendant may avoid liability for a particular crime, would subvert rather than protect the truth-finding process.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Because I believe the evidence supports a finding that . appellant testified \u201cas a witness in [her] own behalf\u2019 at Warren\u2019s trial for failing to appear, I would hold the trial court\u2019s admission of that testimony in appellant\u2019s subsequent trial for aiding and abetting Warren\u2019s offense was not error. Thus, I would affirm appellant\u2019s conviction and respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
