Hardesty, </em>39 Va.App. 102, 570 S.E.2d 878 (2002). The panel affirmed a judgment of the trial court declaring that, pursuant to the parties\u2019 final decree of divorce, Samuel Hardesty\u2019s obligation to pay spousal support to his former wife, Francesca Hardesty, must terminate upon her remarriage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>By order dated November 26, 2002, we granted wife\u2019s petition for a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>stayed the mandate of that decision, and reinstated the appeal. Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Husband and wife were married in 1990 and separated in 1999. No children were born of the marriage. In 1999, wife filed a bill of complaint seeking a divorce on the grounds of adultery, cruelty and separation. Husband filed a cross-bill seeking a divorce on the grounds of separation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The parties participated in mediation on January 13, 2000, and entered into a written property settlement agreement (PSA) as a result. The PSA provided for the division of the parties\u2019 assets. The PSA also provided the following as to spousal support, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">15. <em>Spousal Support. </em>Husband and Wife agree that Husband has an obligation to pay Wife spousal support as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-9\">a. Beginning February 1, 2000 and continuing through to and including the final payment on January 1, 2007, Husband shall pay $5,000.00 per month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-10\">i\u00a1: j: $ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-11\">d. This support cannot be terminated for any reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">In addition, the PSA provided as follows, in pertinent part, concerning the parties\u2019 tax obligations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-13\">13. Tax Consequences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">sj: :ji ij:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-15\">c. Husband shall fund an escrow account with $300,000.00 [$150,000.00 of this shall be considered Wife\u2019s funds] on or before May 15, 2000 ... to be held in an interest bearing account. These funds shall be held for payment of the taxes, penalties, interest, and fines, for Hardesty Construction, Inc. and American Gutter through 1998. If any monies are left over after all taxes, penalties, interest, and fines are paid in full, the balance shall be equally distributed to each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>party.... If taxes, penalties, interest, and fines are owed after the depletion of all monies for payment of the taxes, penalties, interest and fines, personal, Hardesty Construction, Inc. and American Gutter through 1998, then each party shall be equally liable for the balance. Upon depletion of the escrow balance, Husband shall immediately pay the entire balance for any taxes, penalties, interest, and fines owed within six [6] months, time being of the essence. Thereafter, he may deduct [right of set off] Wife\u2019s half from the spousal support by shortening support by the number of months necessary to repay the amount to Husband. For example, if $10,000.00 is owed after the escrow is depleted, Husband shall pay said amount in full and shorten support by one month [$5,000.00] at the end of the support period____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Finally, the PSA provided that it would be \u201caffirm[ed], ratified] and incorporate^],\u201d but not \u201cmerge[d],\u201d into the final divorce decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Prior to the court\u2019s entry of the final decree, wife filed a separate action with the trial court in July of 2001, seeking a declaratory judgment holding the PSA precluded the termination of spousal support upon her remarriage. Husband demurred to the declaratory judgment action contending that the language contained in the PSA was insufficient as a matter of law to bar termination of spousal support upon remarriage. By order entered July 20, 2001, the action was consolidated with the parties\u2019 pending divorce action.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">After reviewing supporting memoranda filed by the parties and a hearing <em>ore tenus, </em>the trial court advised counsel as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">After considering the authorities, I have decided to sustain the demurrer or motion to suppress of the defendant. The Court finds that, under applicable case law, it is required, in order of [sic] the spousal support to survive remarriage, that the property settlement explicitly state that it will survive remarriage. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>And I will note [wife\u2019s] exception but will hold that spousal support will terminate upon the remarriage of [wife].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The trial court incorporated its finding in this regard into the final decree of divorce, entered February 4, 2002, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMN\">[T]he Court treats the demurrer as a dispositive motion and enters the following declaratory judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">[I]f the plaintiff remarries the defendant is relieved from any further obligation to pay spousal support to the Plaintiff. The [PSA] does not contain \u201cexpress language either citing the statute [Va.Code \u00a7 20-109] or expressly stating that remarriage does not terminate the obligation\u201d as required by Virginia law. <em>MacNelly v. MacNelly, </em>17 Va.App. 427, 430, 437 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1993) and <em>Langley v. Johnson, </em>27 Va.App. 365, 499 S.E.2d 15 (1998). Accordingly, declaratory judgment in favor of the defendant is entered as set forth herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Wife appeals only this portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">Code \u00a7 20-109(D) provides that \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided by stipulation or contract, spousal support and maintenance shall terminate upon the death of either party or remarriage of the spouse receiving support.\u201d Code \u00a7 20-109, We have held that the \u201c \u2018language [of Code \u00a7 20-109] contemplates an expressed, not implied, provision that support shall not terminate upon death or remarriage. By resolving ambiguity, Code \u00a7 20-109 reduces litigation. To permit its mandate to be overcome by implication would introduce ambiguity, encourage litigation and, thereby, undermine the statute\u2019s purpose----\u2019 \u201d <em>MacNelly, </em>17 Va.App. at 429-30, 437 S.E.2d at 584 (quoting <em>Radford v. Radford, </em>16 Va.App. 812, 813, 433 S.E.2d 35, 36 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">We have further held that \u201cin order to accomplish the stated objective of the statute to resolve ambiguity and thereby reduce litigation, any attempt to abrogate the effect of the statute requires express language either citing the statute or expressly stating that remarriage does not terminate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 437 S.E.2d at 584. \u201c \u2018The public policy clearly declared by Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-109 and 20-109.1 is that spousal support does not survive the recipient\u2019s remarriage. To create an exception to that policy, the agreement must be equally clear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Langley, </em>27 Va.App. at 371-72, 499 S.E.2d at 18 (quoting <em>Miller v. Hawkins, </em>14 Va.App. 192, 195-97, 415 S.E.2d 861, 863-64 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In <em>Gayler v. Gayler, </em>20 Va.App. 83, 85, 455 S.E.2d 278, 279 (1995), the agreement provided that \u201cthe payments [of spousal support] ... shall terminate upon the Wife\u2019s remarriage or death.\u201d However, the agreement was later modified by an addendum stating that \u201cthe payments ... shall terminate only upon the Wife\u2019s death.\u201d 20 Va.App. at 85, 455 S.E.2d at 279. There, we held \u201cthat the addendum\u2019s excision of the reference to remarriage and the addition of the word \u2018only' evince[d] the parties\u2019 intent that spousal support would survive wife\u2019s remarriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 455 S.E.2d at 280. Nevertheless, in a footnote to that holding, we made an important distinction, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">The use of the term \u201conly\u201d by the parties is alone not determinative of the issue. Absent the reference to the effect of remarriage in the original agreement, the language of the addendum standing alone would not be sufficient to evince an intent of the parties to avoid the operation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-109 and 20-109.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 86 n. 2, 455 S.E.2d at 280 n. 2; <em>see also Langley, </em>27 Va.App. at 373-74, 499 S.E.2d at 19.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>In the agreement that we review in this appeal, the terms provide that spousal support \u201ccannot be terminated for any reason.\u201d However, no language in any part of the PSA explicitly evinces the parties\u2019 intent to avoid operation of the statute as to remarriage. Indeed, the language of the parties\u2019 agreement is very similar to \u201cthe language of the <em>[Gayler </em>] addendum [which] standing alone[,] would not be sufficient to evince an intent of the parties to avoid the operation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-109 and 20-109.1.\u201d <em>Gayler, </em>20 Va.App. at 86 n. 2, 455 S.E.2d at 280 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Moreover, we find it significant that since our decisions in <em>Radford </em>and <em>Gayler, </em>and before the proceedings in the instant case, the legislature has met several times, amending Code \u00a7 20-109 on two of those occasions; yet, it has given no indication of a desire to change our long-standing interpretation of the statute, requiring precise and express language to overcome the operation of Code \u00a7 20-109(D). <em>See </em>1998 Acts, ch. 604; 2001 Acts, chs. 725 and 740. \u201c \u2018[W]here the General Assembly acts in an area in which this Court has already spoken, it is presumed to know the law as the Court has stated it and to acquiesce therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>McFadden v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 226, 230, 348 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1986) (quoting <em>Burns v. Board of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984)); <em>see also Christensen v. Christensen, </em>26 Va.App. 651, 656, 496 S.E.2d 132, 134 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Thus, although on its\" face the language of the PSA seems to clearly reflect the intent of the parties, we reiterate our stated rationale in <em>Radford, </em>that the statutory \u201clanguage contemplates an expressed, not implied, provision that support shall not terminate upon death or remarriage\u201d and that \u201c[t]o permit its mandate to be overcome by implication would introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>ambiguity, encourage litigation and, thereby, undermine the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d 16 Va.App. at 813, 433 S.E.2d at 36.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-8\">. Judge Annunziata's dissent argues that this footnoted language in <em>Gayler </em>is mere dicta. However, it is clear that the footnoted language was not dicta, but was central to the <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the opinion. <em>See Black's Law Dictionary </em>1262 (6th ed.1990) (defining <em>ratio decidendi </em>as \"the ground or reason of decision\u201d). Indeed, in reaching its determination, the court in <em>Gayler </em>specifically held \"that the addendum\u2019s excision of the reference to remarriage and the addition of the word \u2018only,\u2019 sufficiently evinced the \u201cparties' intent that spousal support would survive wife\u2019s remarriage.\u201d <em>Gayler, </em>20 Va.App. at 86, 455 S.E.2d at 280. The footnote reinforces the importance of both elements \u2014 the addendum's excision of the reference to remarriage and the word \"only\u201d \u2014 to its holding. Therefore, the language was clearly crucial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>the court\u2019s resolution of the dispute in that case, and thus provides us with distinct precedent to guide our decision in this case. <em>See Langley, </em>27 Va.App. at 373-74, 499 S.E.2d at 19 (noting that <em>\u201cGayler </em>turned on the fact that the addendum's alteration of the original support provisions was a 'critical change in the original agreement,\u2019 which necessarily evinced in a clear and express fashion the parties\u2019 intent that the support would continue after remarriage\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-9\">. Judge Kelsey\u2019s dissent is founded upon the proposition that our \"extrapolation[sj\u201d in <em>Gayler </em>and <em>MacNelly </em>take \"too far\u201d \"our construction of the statute.\u201d And, although precedential, the decisions are based upon \u201cunsettled\u201d \"piling[sj [of] <em>dicta </em>upon <em>dicta.\" </em>As set forth above, we differ with this conclusion. While he is quite correct that we clearly have the authority to overrule long-standing precedent, whether it originates from a panel of this Court or the full Court sitting <em>en banc, </em>his dissent omits any recognition that we do so rarely, and certainly not lightly. The precedential value of our opinions to this Court, the lower courts and members of the bar, is well settled. The courts of this Commonwealth have long acknowledged that \u201d[i]n Virginia, the doctrine of stare decisis is more than a mere clich\u00e9,\u201d and is not to be taken lightly. <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987). The \"doctrine plays a significant role in the orderly administration of justice by assuring consistent, predictable, and balanced application of legal principles.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">Moreover, [this] \"respect for precedent helps promote public confidence in the law.\u201d [Note, <em>Constitutional Stare Decisis, </em>103 Harv. L.Rev. 1344, 1349 (1990).] If an appellate court does not respect its own precedent, then the public, the bench, and the bar are less likely to have confidence in the decisions that are made. Furthermore, employing the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>assures the public that an appellate court\u2019s judgments are not arbitrary and that the court is controlled by precedent that is binding without regard to the personal views of its members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-11\"><em>Newman v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em>256 Va. 501, 510, 507 S.E.2d 348, 353 (1998) (Compton, J., joined by Carrico, C.J., dissenting). In keeping with the principles articulated immediately above, we recognize that our existing precedent on this issue has provided a longstanding \"bright line rule\u201d for the bar and the public, which ought not lightly be cast aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b710-6\">ANNUNZIATA, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADh\">with whom CLEMENTS, and FELTON, JJ., join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision. I would find the parties\u2019 PSA expressly states that spousal support does not terminate upon wife\u2019s remarriage and that the statutory requirements of Code \u00a7 20-109(D) have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">Code \u00a7 20-109(D) provides that spousal support terminates upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the spouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>receiving support \u201cunless otherwise provided by stipulation or contract.\u201d Contrary to the majority\u2019s reasoning, I do not believe this Court\u2019s prior decisions require that the parties\u2019 stipulation or contract contain particular language to avoid the application of the statute\u2019s termination provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The majority relies on the holdings in <em>Radford v. Radford, </em>16 Va.App. 812, 433 S.E.2d 35 (1993), <em>MacNelly v. MacNelly, </em>17 Va.App. 427, 437 S.E.2d 582 (1993), <em>Gayler v. Gayler, </em>20 Va.App. 83, 455 S.E.2d 278 (1995), and <em>Langley v. Johnson, </em>27 Va.App. 365, 499 S.E.2d 15 (1998), to affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that husband\u2019s support obligation to wife terminated upon her remarriage. In these decisions, we construed Code \u00a7 20-109(D) and found that, to avoid application of the statute\u2019s termination provision, the parties must include \u201cexpress\u201d language in the agreement, evincing their intent that the support obligation survive the payee spouse\u2019s remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">In <em>Radford, </em>the parties agreed in writing that \u201cthe husband shall pay unto the wife the sum of $200.00 per month for a period of 5 years.\u201d Wife remarried before the expiration of the 5-year period referenced in the agreement, and the trial court terminated husband\u2019s obligation to pay support, relying on Code \u00a7 20-109. On appeal, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-9\">Because ... the agreement contained no express provision for continuation upon the death or remarriage of the spouse receiving support, the spousal support terminated upon the wife\u2019s remarriage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-10\"><em>Radford, </em>16 Va.App. at 813-14, 433 S.E.2d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Shortly thereafter, we applied the <em>Radford </em>holding in <em>Mac-Nelly, </em>where the parties agreed husband would pay wife $7,000 per month in support, but \u201c[i]n the event that the husband or wife dies before February 1, 1996, then the obligation for support ... shall cease.\u201d The agreement did not address the effect of wife\u2019s remarriage on husband\u2019s obligation. When wife remarried, husband ceased paying support. Wife argued that the inclusion of a provision concerning termination of the obligation upon the death of either party, coupled with the absence of any reference to the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>of remarriage on spousal support, evinced the parties\u2019 intent to avoid application of the Code. We disagreed and held, \u201cin order to accomplish the stated objective of the statute to resolve ambiguity ... any attempt to abrogate the effect of the statute requires express language either citing the statute or expressly stating that remarriage does not terminate the obligation.\u201d <em>MacNelly, </em>17 Va.App. at 430, 437 S.E.2d at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">In <em>Gayler, </em>the parties\u2019 original agreement provided that support would terminate upon the death of either party or the remarriage of the wife. The parties later executed an addendum stating that support would terminate \u201conly upon the wife\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Gayler, </em>20 Va.App. at 85, 455 S.E.2d at 279. We held that \u201cthe addendum\u2019s excision of the reference to remarriage and the addition of the word \u2018only,\u2019 to the phrase, \u2018upon [her] death,\u2019 evinces the parties\u2019 intent that spousal support would survive remarriage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86, 455 S.E.2d at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In <em>Langley, </em>the parties executed a settlement agreement that provided for the husband to pay wife weekly spousal support \u201cuntil her death.\u201d When wife remarried, husband sought to have his support obligation terminated pursuant to Code \u00a7 20-109(D). We held that the phrase \u201cuntil her death\u201d does not constitute \u201cexpress language\u201d stating that the parties intended that husband\u2019s support obligation would survive remarriage. <em>Langley, </em>27 Va.App. at 370, 499 S.E.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">I acknowledge that the holdings in <em>Radford, MacNelly, Gayler </em>and <em>Langley </em>support the principle that, where an agreement does not expressly address the duration of -spousal support in the event of remarriage, we will not read such language into the agreement by implication. Indeed, the language employed by the parties in each of these cases was ambiguous and susceptible to more than one interpretation and amply supports the result.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I also acknowledge that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>rule requiring express language is well settled and salutary, existing \u201cif for no other reason than ... it encourages the considered judgment inherent in clarity and certainty.\u201d <em>Bird v. Henke, </em>65 Wash.2d 79, 395 P.2d 751, 753 (1964). However, none of this Court\u2019s decisions holds that the rule can only be served if the parties use particular contract language.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">A review of the authorities on which this Court relied in <em>Miller v. Hawkins, </em>14 Va.App. 192, 415 S.E.2d 861 (1992), the progenitor of the <em>MacNelly </em>line of cases, is instructive. In <em>Miller, </em>we first construed Code \u00a7 20-109(D) and held that a property settlement provision must contain clear and express language evincing the parties\u2019 intent that spousal support will continue after remarriage, to rebut the statutory presumption that it ends with that event. <em>Miller, </em>14 Va.App. at 196-97, 415 S.E.2d at 864. In resolving the issue, we adopted the views expressed by appellate courts in sister states. <em>See, e.g., Edwards v.

Even more instructive is this Court\u2019s continuing silence on the issue. None of the decisions that follow <em>Miller </em>holds that a specific reference to \u201cremarriage\u201d is the sole drafting technique that will be deemed sufficient to clearly express the parties\u2019 intent with respect to the effect of remarriage on spousal support.

In adopting this approach, the majority improperly \u201cread[s] into contracts language which ... add[s] to or take[s] away from the meaning of the words already contain[ed] therein.\u201d <em>Great Falls Hdwe.

The majority relies, in part, on a footnote in our decision in <em>Gayler </em>to support its conclusion. In <em>Gayler, </em>as noted earlier, we found the parties intended that spousal support continue in the event of remarriage based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>a merged reading of the parties\u2019 property settlement agreement and its addendum. 20 Va.App. at 86, 455 S.E.2d at 280. We stated in a footnote, however:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">The use of the term \u201conly\u201d [as in the phrase \u201conly upon the death of the wife\u201d] by the parties is alone not determinative of the issue. Absent the reference to the effect of remarriage in the original agreement, the language of the addendum standing alone would not be sufficient to evince an intent of the parties to avoid Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-109 and 20-109.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlS\"><em>Id. </em>at 86 n. 2, 455 S.E.2d at 280 n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The majority reasons that the terms of the Hardesty agreement, stating spousal support \u201ccannot be terminated for any reason,\u201d are \u201cvery similar\u201d to the language in <em>Gayler </em>and that, consistent with <em>Gayler, </em>the decision of the trial court must be affirmed. It is apparent that the meaning of the term \u201conly\u201d in the <em>Gayler </em>footnote differs in no material respect from the meaning of the terms used in the property settlement agreement before us, which states that support would not terminate for \u201cany reason.\u201d While it is arguable that the word \u201conly\u201d and the phrase \u201cfor any reason\u201d produce a semantically indistinguishable result, the semantic analysis is not determinative. The <em>Gayler </em>footnote does not construe or adopt a definition of the term, \u201conly,\u201d in the abstract; rather, it construes the term in the context of the contract provision hypothesized in the footnote, viz., spousal support is to terminate \u201conly upon death.\u201d The <em>Gayler </em>observation that such a formulation is sufficient to overcome the effect of Code \u00a7 20-109(D) is not unexpected. As framed in footnote two, the contract provision deemed insufficient is the very same provision we found inadequate in <em>MacNelly. </em>However, the restatement of the <em>MacNelly </em>principle in the <em>Gayler </em>footnote does not, in itself, establish the rule that the parties must use the term, \u201cremarriage,\u201d to signal their contemplation of the circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Furthermore, to the extent the treatment of the word, \u201conly,\u201d in <em>Gayler </em>footnote two was intended to address its use in other contexts, or to extend to the treatment of any synonymous terms such as those in the present matter, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>questions were not before us in <em>Gayler. </em>The meaning of such terms was not necessary for the resolution of the case and constitutes dicta.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is therefore not binding upon us in addressing whether an agreement in which the parties fail to explicitly use the word, \u201cremarriage,\u201d but are otherwise clear and unmistakable about their intent that spousal support continue, cannot be construed to reflect that intent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To the extent the majority extrapolates from the <em>Gayler </em>footnote the \u201cholding\u201d that the divorcing parties are required to use, as a matter of law and -without exception, the term, \u201cremarriage,\u201d to overcome the reach of the statute, the \u201cholding\u201d is likewise dicta and not binding upon us.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Applying contract principles to the case at bar, I would find the parties intended that spousal support not terminate upon the wife\u2019s remarriage. Section 15(d) of the Hardestys\u2019 PSA states, \u201cThis support cannot be terminated for any reason.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>The use of the word \u201cany\u201d encompasses all possible reasons and circumstances which might require termination of the support obligation. To state that the support obligation would not terminate for \u201cany\u201d reason is no different than stating there is no reason whatsoever that husband\u2019s support obligation not continue. As a matter of necessary logic, it follows that wife\u2019s remarriage is not a reason for terminating her support in the case at bar. The parties\u2019 intent is clear and unmistakable from its plain meaning. As such, it is express; there is nothing to infer or imply from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b712-8\">. For example, the phrases \"for a period of 5 years,\u201d \"in the event wife dies,\u201d and \"until her death\u201d are each open to more than one reading, thus, we are unable to determine the parties\u2019 intentions regarding termination of support.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b715-7\">. When the legislature requires specific language be used, it generally states that requirement in the Code. <em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 8.2-316(2) (requiring disclaimers of an implied warranty of merchantability to \"mention\u201d the word \"merchantability\u201d); Code \u00a7 8.01-433.1 (requiring contracts authorizing confession of judgment to include specific statutory verbiage).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\">. The legislature has amended Code \u00a7 20-109(D) twice since our decision in <em>Miller. </em>As the majority points out, it has not changed this Court\u2019s long-standing interpretation of the statute, requiring precise and express language to overcome the operation of \u00a7 20-109(D). However, although the legislature is presumed to thus \" \u2018acquiesce\u2019 \u201d in the interpretation, <em>McFadden v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 226, 230, 348 S.E.2d 847, 849 (1986) (quoting <em>Burns v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984)), it cannot be presumed that they acquiesced in the dicta of the <em>Gayler </em>footnote or in subsequent holdings that rely on the dicta, including <em>Langley. See Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, </em>515 U.S. 291, 299, 115 S.Ct. 2144, 2149, 132 L.Ed.2d 226 (1995). Nor can it be presumed to acquiesce in a requirement that the parties must use the word, \"remarriage,\u201d in a provision regarding its effect on spousal support to overcome the statutory presumption when none of our holdings stand squarely for that proposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>defines dicta as: \"Opinions of a judge which do not embody the resolution or determination of the specific case before the courts.

Relying on <em>Gayler </em>footnote 2, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number><em>Langley </em>held that the separation agreement \u201cfailed expressly to state that the husband\u2019s support obligation would not terminate upon the wife\u2019s remarriage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 376, 499 S.E.2d at 20, and any contractual language less than that would not suffice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In doing so, <em>Langley </em>successfully refuted the maxim, \u201cBreath spent repeating <em>dicta </em>does not infuse it with life.\u201d <em>Metro.

For that reason, if I were sitting on a three-judge panel deciding this case, I too would take the majority\u2019s view \u2014 being bound by prior panel precedent under the inter-panel accord component of the <em>stare decisis </em>doctrine. <em>See Hardesty, </em>39 Va.App. at 108, 570 S.E.2d at 881 (Agee, J., concurring) (\u201cAccordingly, bound by the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>I concur in the result.\u201d). \u201cThis principle applies not merely to the literal holding of the case, but also to its <em>ratio decidendi </em>\u2014 the essential rationale in the case that determines the judgment.\u201d <em>Clinchfield Coal Co. v. Reed, </em>40 Va.App. 69, 73-74, 577 S.E.2d 538, 540 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">In view of this principle, the issue now is whether the <em>en banc </em>court should overrule the intended (per the majority) or unintended (per the dissent) consequences of these prior panel decisions. We certainly have the authority to do so. <em>See Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 581, 562 S.E.2d 139, 143 (2002) (recognizing that prior panel decisions remain \u201csubject to review by the Court of Appeals sitting en banc\u201d); Code \u00a7 17.1-402(D) (\u201cThe court sitting <em>en banc </em>shall consider and decide the case and may overrule any previous decision by any panel or of the full court.\u201d). We should exercise that authority if a \u201cdetailed inquiry\u201d demonstrates that \u201ca mistake exists in our prior decisions.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 312, 321, 549 S.E.2d 641, 645 (2001) (citations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>internal quotation marks omitted). For two reasons, I believe a mistake of that magnitude exists here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">First, the extrapolation introduced into the law by <em>MacNelly </em>and <em>Gayler, </em>when carried to its logical extreme, as this case illustrates as well as any, produces a truly anomalous result. The majority holding boils down to a simple proposition: An agreement stating that spousal support \u201ccannot be terminated for <em>any </em>reason\u201d does not include termination for the reason of remarriage. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, the agreement should have said something along these lines: \u201cSupport cannot be terminated for any reason, and, by saying \u2018for any reason,\u2019 we mean to include for the reason of remarriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The majority argues that even though \u201con its face the language of the PSA seems to clearly reflect the intent of the parties,\u201d the agreement\u2019s failure to use talismanic words creates ambiguity \u2014 the kind that could lead to further litigation and thereby \u201cundermine the statute\u2019s purpose.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 670, 581 S.E.2d at 217; <em>see also Hardesty, </em>39 Va.App. at 107, 570 S.E.2d at 880 (also noting that \u201con its face the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>PSA seems to clearly reflect the intent of the parties\u201d). The hunt for the statutory purpose of Code \u00a7 20-109(D), however, has led to a self-defeating irony: But for the magic words requirement, the contractual provision \u201con its face,\u201d <em>ante, </em>at 669, 581 S.E.2d at 217; <em>see also Hardesty, </em>39 Va.App. at 107, 570 S.E.2d at 880, provides sufficient clarity to discern the intent of the parties. The alleged ambiguity exists only because the majority discards the obvious and unqualified meaning of the word \u201cany\u201d in the property settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Had this case been decided by the application of the plain-meaning rule (which governs most other contracts in Virginia and, except for this one topic, still governs separation agreements), the trial court, the majority, and the dissent would be in full accord. Each would agree that the phrase \u201cfor any reason\u201d means what it says and thus includes remarriage. No inductive inference is required here. The meaning comes directly from the words themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">In no other context have Virginia courts struggled over whether the term \u201cany\u201d means any. <em>See, e.g., Sussex Cmty.

In this case, therefore, the quest for greater clarity and less litigation has produced neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Second, when the legislature requires that a verbatim contractual term be used, its enactments usually say exactly that. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number><em>See, e.g., </em>Code \u00a7 8.2-316(2) (requiring disclaimers of an implied warranty of merchantability to \u201cmention\u201d the word \u201cmerchantability\u201d); Code \u00a7 8.01-433.1 (requiring contracts authorizing confession of judgment to include specific statutory verbiage). Because Code \u00a7 20-109(D) includes no such requirement, it should not be added by interpretative accretion even if we could be persuaded that doing so would improve upon the basic point of the statute. \u201cCourts are not allowed to write new words into a statute plain on its face.\u201d <em>Shenk v. Shenk, </em>39 Va.App. 161, 171, 571 S.E.2d 896, 901 (2002) (quoting <em>Flanary v. Milton, </em>263 Va. 20, 23, 556 S.E.2d 767, 769 (2002)); <em>see also SIGNAL Corp. v. Keane Fed. Sys., Inc., </em>265 Va. 38, 46, 574 S.E.2d 253, 257 (2003) (courts are \u201cnot free to add language\u201d to statutes under the guise of interpretation); <em>Woods v. Mendez, </em>265 Va. 68, 75, 574 S.E.2d 263, 267 (2003) (courts cannot \u201cadd words to the statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that today\u2019s decision represents a cautious, and thus commendable, deference to the legislature is unconvincing. <em>See Ante, </em>at 669, 581 S.E.2d at 216-17. We are asked to believe that the General Assembly has implicitly endorsed the majority\u2019s holding because the legislature has not amended the statute to repeal our prior panel decisions. From that inaction, the majority reasons, we should infer the General Assembly has by silence put its legislative imprimatur on the majority\u2019s interpretation of Code \u00a7 20-109(D) because the legislature is \u201cpresumed to know the law.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 669, 581 S.E.2d at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">I concede the value of the general principle underlying this view. <em>See, e.g., Burns v. Bd. of Supervisors, </em>227 Va. 354, 360, 315 S.E.2d 856, 860 (1984). But I would not apply it to cases where, as here, the interpretation that the legislature has allegedly endorsed by inaction is both unsettled and a product of piling <em>dicta </em>upon <em>dicta. See Metro. Stevedore Co., </em>515 U.S. at 299-300, 115 S.Ct. at 2149-50. Legislative inaction \u201clacks persuasive significance,\u201d <em>Brown v. Gardner, </em>513 U.S. 115, 121, 115 S.Ct. 552, 557, 130 L.Ed.2d 462 (1994) (citation omitted), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>when it can be shown that \u201cseveral equally tenable inferences may be drawn from such inaction,\u201d <em>Cent. Bank of Denver, N.A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N.A., </em>511 U.S. 164, 187, 114 S.Ct. 1439, 1453, 128 L.Ed.2d 119 (1994) (quoting <em>Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., </em>496 U.S. 633, 650, 110 S.Ct. 2668, 2678, 110 L.Ed.2d 579 (1990)). <em>See also Zuber v. Allen, </em>396 U.S. 168, 185-86 n. 21, 90 S.Ct. 314, 324 n. 21, 24 L.Ed.2d 345 (1969) (\u201cThe verdict of quiescent years cannot be invoked to baptize a statutory gloss that is otherwise impermissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">We need go no further than the differing views of the majority and the principal dissent in this case to see that neither interpretation of our prior precedents has claimed a strong consensus. That being true, how confident can we be that the General Assembly previously guessed the interpretation the majority adopts today and then silently decided to endorse that particular interpretation by not rewriting the statute? Under these circumstances, legislative silence is a \u201cpoor beacon to follow in discerning the proper statutory route.\u201d <em>Zuber, 396 U.S. </em>at 185, 90 S.Ct. at 323. The only sure guide is the altogether ordinary task of reading the statutory text and applying its plain meaning. <em>See Patterson v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 610, 617, 575 S.E.2d 583, 586-87 (2003). Because the magic-words extrapolation of our prior panel opinions cannot be grounded in the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 20-109(D), and therefore reflects that a mistake exists in our prior decisions, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b720-7\">. \"Indeed, the language of the parties\u2019 agreement is virtually identical to 'the language of the [Gayler] addendum standing alone [which] would not be sufficient to evince an intent of the parties to avoid the operation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 20-109 and 20-109.1.\u2019 20 Va.App. at 86 n. 2, 455 S.E.2d at 280 n. 2.\u201d <em>Langley, </em>27 Va.App. at 374, 499 S.E.2d at 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\">.
