Goad, M.D., appeals from an order of the circuit court affirming an order of the Virginia Board of Medicine (Board)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> finding him guilty of unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and imposing sanctions under Code \u00a7 54.1-2915(A)(3). On appeal, Goad contends the circuit court erred in affirming the Board\u2019s order because (1) the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to support the conclusion that Goad was guilty of unprofessional conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13), (2) the Board erred in distributing irrelevant and prejudicial materials to the Board members prior to the formal hearing, and (3) the Board erred in its conduct of the formal hearing by \u201crelinquishing] control\u201d of the hearing to the Board\u2019s counsel and allowing its counsel to be present in the Board\u2019s deliberations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finding the record lacks substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s determination that Goad was guilty of having engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1 \u2014 2914(A)(13), we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand the case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The relevant facts in this case are undisputed. Following his 1991 graduation from the University of Virginia School of Medicine, Goad was accepted into a residency program in psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University\u2019s Medical College of Virginia. In February 1993, while sharing a call room at the hospital with a third-year medical student, Goad, who was the supervising resident in the psychiatry section of the hospital at the time, asked the medical student if she wanted a backrub. When the student declined, Goad apologized several times for having asked her. The student informed her supervisor, Dr. James Levenson, of the incident, but made it clear she did not want to file a complaint or get Goad \u201cinto trouble.\u201d She further indicated that, while the incident made her uncomfortable, there was no coercion or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>sexual contact involved. Goad had no input with respect to grading or evaluating the medical student\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">In response to that incident, Levenson and Dr. John Urbach, the director of residency education at the Medical College of Virginia, met with Goad. Goad admitted in that meeting that he knew \u201calmost immediately\u201d after asking the medical student about the backrub that he had \u201ccrossed a boundary with [the] student,\u201d for which he had \u201ctried to apologize.\u201d Cautioning him that such lack of respect for \u201cprofessional boundaries\u201d might harm his professional reputation, Levenson and Urbach gave Goad a copy of the Virginia Commonwealth University \u201cSexual Harassment Guidelines\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and encouraged him to pursue personal psychotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Goad was subsequently promoted by Urbach and his colleagues to the position of chief resident. In April 1994, Goad was issued a full and unrestricted license to practice medicine in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In June 1994, Urbach learned of another female medical student who had complained about Goad\u2019s behavior. The student reported that she and Goad, whom she had met at the \u201cV.A. hospital,\u201d initially discussed her concerns about trying to decide whether to pursue a career in medicine or surgery. Their ongoing discussions soon shifted to questions about religious and spiritual matters. Goad, who did not supervise the student, informed her that \u201che was not acting as her psychiatrist or ... therapist\u201d but was willing to talk with her about her concerns, in meetings he characterized as \u201cspiritual counseling.\u201d Goad and the student met several times in the following weeks. At some point, however, the student \u201csuddenly became aware that [Goad] was sexually interested in her.\u201d Feeling \u201cvulnerable and upset\u201d over Goad\u2019s \u201cbetrayal,\u201d the student reported Goad\u2019s interaction with her to the associate dean for students at the Medical College of Virginia. The student did not allege any sexual involvement with Goad and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>did not file a formal sexual harassment charge with the Medical College of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">On July 14, 1994, after meeting with Urbach and Dr. Joel Silverman, the department of psychiatry chairman, Goad was found to have engaged in a \u201cpattern of repeated inappropriate overtures\u201d and was formally suspended from the residency program. It was noted, however, that \u201cno inappropriate behaviors or boundary violations toward patients had been identified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">In August 1994, Goad agreed to participate in a psychological evaluation. Following that evaluation, his status in the residency program was upgraded to \u201cprobationary.\u201d The terms of the probation required that Goad resign his position as chief resident, attend regularly scheduled treatment sessions, and submit to an additional psychological evaluation in the future. Goad was also warned that \u201c[a]ny further evidence of inappropriate advances toward medical students or other medical center/University personnel [would] be considered a violation of probation and grounds for dismissal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In the ensuing months, Goad\u2019s conduct was \u201cclosely monitored.\u201d His \u201cclinical performance,\u201d it was noted, \u201cwas reportedly very good\u201d at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">However, in April 1995, Silverman received information from the director of Snowden Psychiatric Hospital regarding Goad\u2019s \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d toward a staff social worker at that facility during his on-call weekend. The social worker, who was employed part-time as the admissions counselor at the hospital, reportedly stated that she experienced \u201cconsiderable emotional distress\u201d when Goad came into her office to speak with her and, during their conversation, \u201crepeatedly made comments of a sexually suggestive nature\u201d while simultaneously acknowledging he would never act on them because \u201cthey were both Christians.\u201d The social worker also reported that she \u201cfelt embarrassed, angry, and threatened\u201d by Goad\u2019s comments and told the director of the hospital that she did not want to be assigned to work when Goad was scheduled to work at the facility. No sexual involvement was alleged, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Goad did not supervise the social worker. The social worker never saw or spoke to Goad again.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Meeting with Silverman and Urbach on May 4, 1995, Goad admitted he had acted inappropriately toward the social worker at the Snowden facility and that he was \u201csexually excited\u201d during his conversation with her. He added, however, that he was unaware that his comments had made her feel uncomfortable. He further indicated at a subsequent hearing that his conversation with the social worker was a philosophical discussion regarding Christianity and Freudian theory and that his sexually suggestive remarks were merely an illustrative example of the \u201cconflict between maintaining fellowship with God ... and being governed by the desires of the flesh.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">On May 18, 1995, having found Goad had violated his probation and engaged in \u201can ongoing pattern of unprofessional conduct,\u201d the department of psychiatry dismissed him from its residency program. In accordance with procedures set forth by the Medical College of Virginia, Goad appealed the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">On June 30, 1995, during a department of psychiatry committee hearing convened to consider Goad\u2019s appeal, Goad recounted an incident in February 1994 in which he and a female medical student engaged in fondling, while fully unclothed, in a call room during an on-call shift at the Medical College of Virginia. No other evidence regarding this incident was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Goad\u2019s dismissal from the residency program was upheld at each level of review by the Medical College of Virginia. On February 27, 1996, following the final review by the dean of the medical school, the department of psychiatry informed the Board of Goad\u2019s dismissal from the Medical College of Virginia\u2019s residency program.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">On October 27, 2000, the Board sent Goad a letter informing him that the Board would hold an informal conference to consider whether, based on allegations that he had engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13), his license should be suspended or re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>voked under Code \u00a7 54.1-2915(A)(3).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The letter alleged, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\">From approximately February 1993 to June 1994, while a psychiatry resident at the Medical College <em>of </em>Virginia, Richmond, Virginia (\u201cMCV\u201d), you engaged in a recurrent pattern of inappropriate behavior toward female medical students which represented a pattern of sexual harassment under MCV\u2019s guidelines, as well as inappropriate use of a supervisory role during clinical on-call time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The letter went on to describe Goad\u2019s allegedly inappropriate interactions with, among others, the social worker and three medical students discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">On January 26, 2001, the Board held an informal conference. Following that conference, the Board, citing the incidents described in the October 27, 2000 letter of notification, found that Goad had engaged in \u201cinappropriate behavior toward female medical students which represented a pattern of sexual harassment under MCV\u2019s guidelines, as well as inappropriate use of a supervisory role during clinical on-call time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">On March 5, 2001, Goad requested a formal administrative hearing and the Board\u2019s order from the informal conference was vacated. On May 4, 2001, the Board sent Goad a letter notifying him that the Board would hold a formal administrative hearing to consider the allegations in the statement of particulars attached to the letter. The attached statement of particulars stated, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">The Board alleges that [Goad] may have violated [Code \u00a7 ] 54.1-2915(A)(3), as further defined in [former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13) ], in that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">1. From approximately February 1993 to June 1994, while a psychiatry resident at the Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia (\u201cMCV\u201d), Dr. Goad engaged in inappro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>priate behavior toward female medical students which represented a pattern of sexual harassment under MCV\u2019s guidelines, as well as inappropriate use of a supervisory role during clinical on-call time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The statement of particulars went on to describe Goad\u2019s allegedly inappropriate interactions with the social worker and three medical students discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">On June 7, 2001, the Board held a formal administrative hearing to determine whether Goad should be sanctioned under Code \u00a7 54.1-2915(A)(3). As a preliminary matter, the Board permitted the Commonwealth to introduce into evidence, over Goad\u2019s objection, copies of Section 3.08 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Annotation 14 under Section 4 of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In response to Goad\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>claim that the mere admission of the two documents did not constitute the establishment of a standard of ethics that was binding on Virginia doctors, the presiding member of the Board agreed, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re just accepting them as exhibits.\u201d The assistant attorney general representing the Commonwealth added, \u201cThe Commonwealth would assert that the respondent is free to provide any other ethical codes that he believes his conduct is in conformity with and this is merely something for the Board to look to for ethical guidelines and use as a comparison.\u201d Goad\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cOf course, ... the burden is not upon Dr. Goad to provide such. It\u2019s upon the state to show that he has violated the laws of Virginia as set forth in the [Statement] of Particulars against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">At the formal administrative hearing, no witness called by the Commonwealth testified about the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics or the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry or the two specific sections of those respective sets of ethical guidelines introduced by the Commonwealth. Nor did the Commonwealth present any other evidence regarding those guidelines. Similarly, the Commonwealth introduced no evidence regarding the standards set forth in the Medical College of Virginia\u2019s \u201cguidelines\u201d referenced in the statement of particulars or any other evidence regarding the governing ethical standard referenced in former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">When, later in the hearing, Goad\u2019s attorney attempted to ask Urbach if the Medical College of Virginia disciplinary committee that reviewed Goad\u2019s conduct was in compliance with Section 9.05 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the presiding member of the Board disal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>lowed such questioning, ruling that Section 9.05 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics \u201cis not a statute\u201d but \u201ca recommendation.\u201d Goad then moved to have the previously admitted excerpts from the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics and the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry stricken from the record \u201cbased on [the Board\u2019s] ruling.\u201d The Board denied the request. Clarifying his earlier ruling regarding Section 9.05 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics, the presiding Board member added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">The ruling I\u2019m making is the composition of the committee and so forth is a different issue from the medical ethics and other recommendations by the [American Medical Association] and it does not relate to the fundamental ethics of medicine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Upon conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Goad moved to strike the case, contending, among other things, that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was insufficient to find him \u201cguilty of professional misconduct as ... charged in the statement of particulars\u201d because no ethical standard had been established and there was no showing in the cited incidents of any (1) sexual involvement, (2) supervisor-trainee relationship, or (3) harm to the public. The Board, finding that \u201cthe evidence demonstrated that Dr. Goad on at least four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>occasions acted in violation of medical ethics, specifically Section [4]-14 of the Principles of Medical Ethics [with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry] regarding sexual involvement with a student,\u201d denied Goad\u2019s motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Goad subsequently attempted to introduce into evidence the affidavits of two doctors, one purportedly an \u201cexpert in the field of medical ethics\u201d and the other \u201cin the field of medicine.\u201d Both doctors stated in their affidavits that the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics was not binding on doctors practicing in Virginia. The assistant attorney general representing the Commonwealth argued that the affidavits were inadmissible because (1) one must \u201cbe <em>voir dired </em>and qualify as an expert before the Board,\u201d (2) the legal opinions of a doctor are irrelevant in the case, and (3)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">the ethics presented in this case are not the issue; Dr. Goad\u2019s behavior is the issue. The ethics are merely guideline principles that we\u2019re basing our action upon. The Board is certainly free to use its own standards and the respondent is free to submit other ethical standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The Board refused to admit the affidavits \u201cfor the reasons stated by\u201d the assistant attorney general representing the Commonwealth. Goad presented no further evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Following deliberations, the Board found Goad guilty of having engaged in unprofessional conduct in violation of Code \u00a7 54.1 \u2014 2915(A)(3), as further defined in former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13). In reaching that decision, the Board recited as findings of fact the incidents described in the statement of particulars and specifically found that Goad had engaged in \u201cinappropriate behavior toward female medical students which represented a pattern of sexual harassment under MCV\u2019s guidelines, as well as inappropriate use of a supervisory role during clinical on-call time.\u201d The Board\u2019s ruling made no mention of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics or the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>Based on its findings, the Board ordered that Goad\u2019s license to practice medicine and surgery in Virginia \u201cbe placed on indefinite probation\u201d until certain specified conditions were met. The Board entered an order reflecting its findings of fact and conclusions of law on June 11, 2001. Like the Board\u2019s rulings at the hearing, that order lacked any reference to the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics or the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Goad subsequently appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the circuit court. Finding no error of law, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">On appeal, Goad contends the evidence presented by the Commonwealth at the formal administrative hearing was insufficient to support the Board\u2019s determination that he was guilty of having engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13). Specifically, .he argues the evidence was insufficient to establish either an ethical standard by which his conduct could be adjudicated under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) or a violation of any ethical standard under that statute. He further argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he performed \u201cany act likely to deceive, defraud or harm the public\u201d under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Code \u00a7 54.1-2915(A)(3) authorizes the Board to suspend or revoke a doctor\u2019s license to practice medicine and surgery in Virginia if that doctor engages in \u201c[Unprofessional conduct.\u201d Hearings conducted by the Board to determine whether to revoke or suspend a doctor\u2019s license under Code \u00a7 54.1-2915(A)(3) are subject to the provisions of the Virginia Administrative Process Act. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 54.1-2920.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Accordingly, in reviewing a decision of the Board to suspend or revoke a doctor\u2019s license pursuant to Code \u00a7 54.1-2915(A)(3), we are limited \u201cwith respect to issues of fact ... to ascertaining whether there was substantial evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>[Board] record upon which the [Board] as the trier of the facts could reasonably find them to be as it did.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027; <em>see also Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 268-69, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983). In <em>Bias, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQx\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, adopted by the General Assembly, is designed to give great stability and finality to the fact-findings of an administrative agency. The phrase \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d refers to \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind <em>might </em>accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 217, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938) (emphasis added). Under this standard, ... the court may reject the agency\u2019s findings of fact \u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d B. Mezines, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 51.01 (1981) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">226 Va. at 269, 308 S.E.2d at 125. \u201c[T]he substantial evidence standard accords great deference to the findings of the administrative agency, but even under this standard the evidence must be relevant to the conclusion reached.\u201d <em>Atkinson v. Virginia Alcohol Beverage Control Comm\u2019n, </em>1 Va.App. 172, 178, 336 S.E.2d 527, 531 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Additionally, in accordance with familiar principles of appellate review, \u201cwe review the facts in the light most favorable to sustaining the Board\u2019s action,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 176, 336 S.E.2d at 530, and \u201ctake due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted,\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-4027.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">In this case, Goad was charged with having engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13). Former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">Any practitioner of the healing arts regulated by the Board shall be considered guilty of unprofessional conduct if he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>9. Conducts his practice in such a manner contrary to the standards of ethics of his branch of the healing arts[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In seeking to have the Board suspend or revoke Goad\u2019s license, the Commonwealth had the burden to prove his guilt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See </em>former Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12(0 (now Code \u00a7 2.2^1020(0). Hence, for the Board to find Goad guilty of unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9), the Commonwealth had to establish three things: first, the applicable \u201cstandards of ethics of [Goad\u2019s] branch of the healing arts\u201d by which his conduct was to be adjudicated under the statute; second, the specific ethical standard Goad was alleged to have violated; and, third, Goad\u2019s violation of that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">To that end, the Commonwealth introduced into the record, as exhibits, copies of Section 3.08 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics and Annotation 14 under Section 4 of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry. The Commonwealth concedes on appeal, however, that the Board has promulgated no regulation establishing the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics, the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry, or any other set of ethical standards as the applicable \u201cstandards of ethics of [Goad\u2019s] branch of the healing arts\u201d under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Moreover, the Commonwealth presented no evidence or rationale at the hearing demonstrating that the standards it introduced or any other standards were applicable to Goad in this case. Indeed, to the contrary, upon introducing Section 3.08 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics and Annotation 14 under Section 4 of the American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry, the assistant attorney general representing the Commonwealth insisted that Goad could introduce his own ethical standards and that the ethical standards set forth in the Commonwealth\u2019s exhibits were \u201cmerely something for the Board to look to for ethical guidelines and use as a comparison.\u201d Later, the assistant attorney general representing the Commonwealth stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\">[T]he ethics presented in this case are not the issue; Dr. Goad\u2019s behavior is the issue. The ethics are merely guideline principles that we\u2019re basing our action upon. The Board is certainly free to use its own standards and the respondent is free to submit other ethical standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">For its part, the Board acknowledged, after admitting the two ethical standards presented by the Commonwealth into evidence, that the admission of those exhibits alone was insufficient to establish a standard of ethics by which Goad\u2019s conduct could be judged. The Board later appeared to rule, in prohibiting Goad\u2019s cross-examination of a witness on a section of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics unrelated to the instant prosecution, that the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics was merely \u201ca recommendation\u201d and, thus, not binding in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Furthermore, in finding Goad guilty of having engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9), the Board made a number of findings of fact regarding Goad\u2019s conduct but drew no connection between that conduct and Section 3.08 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics or Annotation 14 under Section 4 of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry. Indeed, the Board\u2019s only reference in its order to any possible standards of ethics appears in its finding that Goad engaged in \u201cinappropriate behavior toward female medical students which represented a pattern of sexual harassment under [the Medical College of Virginia\u2019s] guidelines.\u201d Those guidelines, however, are not included in the record. Nor is there anything in the record that describes those standards or even remotely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>suggests they constitute a \u201cstandard of ethics of [Goad\u2019s] branch of the healing arts,\u201d as required by former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Because no evidence was presented establishing the \u201cstandards of ethics of [Goad\u2019s] branch of the healing arts\u201d by which his conduct was to be adjudicated under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9), we find there is not substantial evidence in the record upon which the Board could reasonably find that Goad \u201cconducted his practice in a manner contrary to the standards of ethics of his branch of the healing arts,\u201d in violation of former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The Board also found Goad engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(13). Former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(1S) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">Any practitioner of the healing arts regulated by the Board shall be considered guilty of unprofessional conduct if he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">sk * H* # sfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">18. Performs any act likely to deceive, defraud or harm the public[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">There is no evidence in the record that demonstrates, absent reliance on speculation and pure conjecture, that Goad performed any act likely to deceive, defraud, or harm the public. Indeed, nothing in the record shows that Goad\u2019s interactions with the social worker and three medical students interfered with or was likely to interfere with his ability to provide care to his patients. Likewise, the record is devoid of evidence showing that Goad\u2019s conduct interfered with or was likely to interfere with the ability of the social worker and medical students to perform their duties at work or school or otherwise prevent them from providing suitable care to patients and other members of the public with whom they dealt. Nor, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertions, did the Board make any such findings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find, therefore, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>there is not substantial evidence in the record upon which the Board could reasonably find that Goad \u201c[p]erform[ed] any act likely to deceive, defraud or harm the public,\u201d in violation of former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In conclusion, having found there was not substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings that Goad was guilty of having engaged in unprofessional conduct under former Code \u00a7\u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) and 54.1-2914(A)(13), we reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment affirming the Board\u2019s imposition of sanctions against Goad under Code \u00a7 54.1 \u2014 2915(A)(3). Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court with instructions to set aside the Board\u2019s June 11, 2001 order placing Goad\u2019s license to practice medicine and surgery in Virginia \u201con indefinite probation\u201d and to remand the matter to the Board for such further proceedings as may be requisite, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b663-11\">.

Code \u00a7 54.1-2914 having been amended, former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(9) is now Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(7) and former Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(13) is now Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(11).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">. Goad also contends on appeal that the Board's notice of hearing and statement of particulars did not give him sufficient notice of the charges against him. However, having failed to raise that issue before the Board, he is precluded from raising it on appeal. <em>See Pence Holdings, Inc. v. Auto Center, Inc., </em>19 Va.App. 703, 707, 454 S.E.2d 732, 734 (1995) (holding that an appellant may not raise an issue on appeal from a decision of an administrative agency that he did not raise before the agency); Rule 5A:18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. In view of this holding, we do not address the remaining assignments of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">. As conceded by the Commonwealth at oral argument, neither these nor any other ethical guidelines associated with the Medical College of Virginia were ever introduced into the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b668-10\">. While the Board\u2019s prosecution of Goad more than four and a half years after receiving notification from the Medical College of Virginia of Goad\u2019s alleged unprofessional conduct is not precluded by the doctrine of laches or any statute of limitations, we find the Board\u2019s protracted delay in instituting such proceedings troubling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b669-7\">. Section 3.08 of the American Medical Association\u2019s Code of Medical Ethics provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">Sexual harassment may be defined as sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when (1) such conduct interferes with an individual\u2019s work or academic performance or creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work or academic environment or (2) accepting or rejecting such conduct affects or may be perceived to affect employment decisions or academic evaluations concerning the individual. Sexual harassment is unethical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-9\">Sexual relationships between medical supervisors and their medical trainees raise concerns because of inherent inequalities in the status and power that medical supervisors wield in relation to medical trainees and may adversely affect patient care. Sexual relationships between a medical trainee and a supervisor even when consensual are not acceptable regardless of the degree of supervision in any given situation. The supervisory role should be eliminated if the parties involved wish to pursue their relationship.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">. Annotation 14 under Section 4 of the American Psychiatric Association's Principles of Medical Ethics with Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-11\">14. Sexual involvement between a faculty member or supervisor and a trainee or student, in those situations in which an abuse of power can occur, often takes advantage of inequalities in the working relationship and may be unethical because (a) any treatment of a patient being supervised may be deleteriously affected; (b) it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>damage the trust relationship between teacher and student; and (c) teachers are important professional role models for their trainees and affect their trainees\u2019 professional behavior.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b670-8\">. Section 9.05 of the American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics provides, in substantial part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>The basic principles of a fair and objective hearing should always be accorded to the physician or medical student whose professional conduct is being reviewed. The fundamental aspects of a fair hearing are a listing of specific charges, adequate notice of the right of a hearing, the opportunity to be present and to rebut the evidence, and the opportunity to present a defense. These principles apply when the hearing body is a medical society tribunal, medical staff committee, or other similar body composed of peers. The composition of committees sitting in judgment of medical students, residents, or fellows should include a significant number of persons at a similar level of training.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">These principles of fair play apply in all disciplinary hearings and in any other type of hearing in which the reputation, professional status, or livelihood of the physician or medical student may be negatively impacted.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b675-9\">. As neither party raised before the Board or on appeal the question of what burden of proof should be applied in this case, that issue is not before us. Because the statutes at issue here are silent regarding the applicable standard of proof, we assume, without deciding, for purposes of this appeal that the evidentiary burden of proof to be applied is a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b677-10\">. The Commonwealth contends in its appellate brief as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>[T]he Board reasonably concluded that Goad's behaviors were harmful to the medical students and his co-worker at the psychiatric hospital. Further, the Board determined that the behaviors could have resulted in harm to patients due to the disruption of the work routine because the individuals were unwilling to work with Goad following his inappropriate behavior. Additionally, the Board appropriately found the behaviors occurring in a call room while Goad was on-call for emergency room services could have been harmful to patients who would have had to wait for Goad to refocus his attention from his sexual arousal to his medical work and resume the concentration necessary to provide safe patient care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Nothing in the record, however, shows that the Board ever reached or made such \"conclusions,\u201d \"determinations,\u201d or \"findings.\u201d Hence, we find the Commonwealth\u2019s inclusion in its brief of the foregoing representations troubling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
