Employer contends the commission erred as a matter of law in finding claimant was entitled to COLA benefits beginning in June 1994 because her monthly Social Security benefits, com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>bined with her workers\u2019 compensation disability benefits, exceeded eighty percent of her pre-injury average monthly wages at all times after that date. Because we find that the commission\u2019s opinion does not contain an adequate statement of the findings of fact or an award which would allow this Court to review claimant\u2019s entitlement to COLA benefits beginning in February 2000, we remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Code \u00a7 65.1-99.1 (now Code \u00a7 65.2-709), in effect at the time of claimant\u2019s injury by accident, provided in pertinent part the formula for determining COLA benefits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AES\">In the event that the combined disability benefit entitlement of a claimant or his dependents under the Virginia Worker\u2019s Compensation Act and the Federal Old-Age Survivors and Disability Insurance Act is less than eighty percent of the average monthly earnings of the claimant before disability or death, cost of living supplements shall be payable, in addition to other benefits payable under this Act, in accordance with the provisions of this section to those recipients of awards resulting from occupational disease, accident, or death occurring on or after July 1, 1975, under \u00a7 65.1-54, 65.1-56(18), 65.1-56.1(4), 65.1-65 and 65.1-65.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The purpose of the COLA provision is to ensure that the value of a compensation award is not lessened due to inflation. <em>See Circuit City Stores v. Bower, </em>243 Va. 183, 189, 413 S.E.2d 55, 58 (1992). The COLA provision found in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act \u201cis not self-executing____ [A] claim for a cost-of-living supplement [is] cognizable only under the change-of-condition sections of the Act____ [T]hese sections require an application and a showing of eligibility by the claimant and an award by the Commission.\u201d <em>Jewell Ridge Coal v. Wright, </em>222 Va. 68, 70, 278 S.E.2d 820, 821 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Thus, claimant bore the burden of proving her entitlement to COLA benefits. <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, employer was required to file a change-in-condition application with the commission if it wished to seek a credit for any overpayment of COLA benefits it had made to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>On September 18, 2000, claimant filed a letter application with the commission requesting that it determine whether she was entitled to COLA benefits after she reached age sixty-two and began receiving Social Security retirement benefits. Although advised to do so on at least two occasions, employer did not file a change-in-condition application seeking a credit for overpayment of COLA benefits it had allegedly made to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Thus, claimant\u2019s September 18, 2000 application presented the sole issue properly before the commission, which was whether claimant was entitled to an award of COLA benefits after she began receiving Social Security retirement benefits in February 2000. Claimant did not contest the amount of COLA benefits she had received before she began receiving Social Security retirement benefits nor did employer file any application seeking a credit for COLA benefits previously paid to claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In considering claimant\u2019s application, the deputy commissioner found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Mitchell\u2019s entitlement to COLA commenced with the February 1, 1992 award on October 1, 1992. During the period June 1994 through September 1994, however, her SSI benefit was such that she was not entitled to COLA supplements during that period. Furthermore, <em>the Commission finds that Mitchell\u2019s entitlement ended on November SO, 1999 at which time, her Social Security payments increased. </em>The Commission therefore concludes that from the total COLA of $19,390.47, $611.74 must be deducted. Consequently, Mitchell\u2019s COLA entitlement is $18,778.73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">(Emphasis added.) The deputy commissioner entered an award in favor of claimant for the payment of $18,778.73 in COLA benefits, and stated that \u201c[t]he employer is to receive credit for any supplements paid.\u201d The deputy commissioner did not award COLA benefits to claimant after November 30, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In its opinion, the full commission rejected employer\u2019s argument that claimant\u2019s Social Security disability benefits and lost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>wage benefits had always exceeded 80% of her pre-injury average weekly wage. In doing so, the commission found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\">[Employer] also argues that an unknown portion of [claimant\u2019s] retirement benefits are actually disability benefits. This latter argument is incorrect. The Social Security Administration notes that the claimant began receiving retirement benefits in February 2000. Although [claimant\u2019s] \u201ctechnical entitlement to disability continues,\u201d she is not receiving sums which represent disability as opposed to retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">With regards to the Commission\u2019s calculations dated August 2001, we find that these calculations are accurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">The Opinion below is therefore AFFIRMED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In affirming the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision and award, the full commission affirmed the finding that claimant was entitled to COLA benefits from October 1, 1992 to June 1994, and September 1994 to November 30, 1999. The deputy commissioner did not award claimant COLA benefits after November 30, 1999 and, therefore, if the full commission intended to award COLA benefits to claimant beginning February 2000 because she was receiving Social Security retirement benefits, not Social Security disability benefits, the commission was required to make specific factual findings with respect to that issue and to enter an appropriate award. It did not do so. Moreover, the commission referred to August 2001 calculations as support for its decision; however, the record does not contain any calculations dated August 2001. Furthermore, the deputy commissioner\u2019s August 17, 2001 opinion does not contain any mathematical calculations to support the deputy commissioner\u2019s findings and award.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Code \u00a7 65.2-705(A) requires the commission to \u201cmake an award, which together with a statement of the findings of fact, rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to the questions at issue, shall be filed with the record of the proceedings.\u201d Because the commission did not comply with the statute, we vacate the commission\u2019s opinion and remand this case to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>commission for it to provide adequate factual findings and an award with respect to claimant\u2019s entitlement to COLA benefits beginning in February 2000. <em>See Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Pierce, </em>5 Va.App. 374, 384, 363 S.E.2d 433, 438 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\n<em>Vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
