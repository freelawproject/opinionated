Kingsbur contends that the evidence failed to prove that the handgun he possessed constituted a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Finding no error, we affirm the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-11\">On appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Morrisette v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 386, 389, 569 S.E.2d 47, 50 (2002). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 522, 528, 574 S.E.2d 756, 758-59 (2003) <em>(en banc) </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">Kingsbur was convicted in 1982 for attempted armed robbery. On October 31, 2002, two officers of the Portsmouth Police Department observed Kingsbur trespassing on Ports<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>mouth Redevelopment and Housing Authority property. One of the officers had previously warned Kingsbur about trespassing. As they approached Kingsbur, both officers observed him holding a plastic bag. One of the officers saw Kingsbur putting the bag down next to a trash receptacle. The officer retrieved the bag and found a Daws Model P-32, .32 caliber, chrome handgun in the bag. The officers arrested Kingsbur for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Kingsbur claimed that he found the handgun lying in the street adjacent to Prentis Park and that \u201cthe chambers just fell off of it\u201d when he picked it up. Kingsbur nonetheless thought the handgun sufficiently dangerous, as he explained to the officers, to \u201cget rid of it\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want no kid to get ahold of it.\u201d When the officers asked Kingsbur if he \u201cknew he was not supposed to have the gun,\u201d Kingsbur replied \u201cof course, I knew, but I just didn\u2019t want to leave it there and a child might have gotten ahold of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">At a bench trial on an indictment charging Kingsbur under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2, the trial court received into evidence a certificate of analysis stating that the handgun was missing enough internal parts to render it inoperable and incapable of being test fired.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On this ground, Kingsbur moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The trial judge denied the motion, ruling that our opinion in <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>36 Va.App. 312, 549 S.E.2d 641 (2001) <em>(en banc), </em>rendered the question of the firearm\u2019s operability a non-issue. Noting that the Virginia Supreme Court had agreed to review <em>Armstrong, </em>Kingsbur preserved his objection pending the outcome of that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">On April 19, 2002, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed our decision in <em>Armstrong. </em>\u201cIt is not necessary,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Court held, \u201cthat the Commonwealth prove the instrument was \u2018operable,\u2019 \u2018capable\u2019 of being fired, or had the \u2018actual capacity to do serious harm\u2019 \u201d to obtain a conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. <em>Armstrong v. Commonwealth, </em>263 Va. 573, 584, 562 S.E.2d 139, 145 (2002). Instead, the Commonwealth need only prove the firearm was \u201cdesigned, made, and intended to expel a projectile by means of an explosion.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. The statute nowhere requires a showing that the firearm can actually be fired. It is enough, <em>Armstrong </em>held, that the firearm was designed, made, and intended to be fired. <em>See also McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 429, 574 S.E.2d 234 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Kingsbur points out, however, that dicta in <em>Armstrong </em>noted that a firearm \u201ccould fall into a state of such significant disrepair or be altered in such a way that it would cease to be a \u2018firearm\u2019 for purposes of applying Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2.\u201d <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 584, 562 S.E.2d at 145. \u201cCommon sense and experience leave no room for doubt that an instrument originally designed, made, and intended to expel a projectile by force of an explosion can lose this characteristic in many ways such that it would no longer be fairly considered a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, n. 6, 562 S.E.2d at 145, n. 6. The Court, however, expressed no opinion \u201con the degree of disrepair or alteration\u201d that would be required. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Kingsbur concedes that the firearm he possessed was designed, made, and intended to be fired. Even so, Kingsbur argues, the firearm had fallen into such a state of disrepair that it could no longer be fairly considered a firearm under the statute. We hold that the issue raised in the <em>Armstrong </em>dicta, and relied upon here by Kingsbur, is a question of fact for the fact finder. As such, it must be upheld unless \u201cplainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Pease v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 342, 350, 573 S.E.2d 272, 275 (2002) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197-98, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">The evidence supports the conclusion that the handgun possessed by Kingsbur had not lost its character as a firearm. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>The Davis Model P-32, .32 caliber handgun was readily identifiable as a \u201cgun\u201d by Kingsbur, the police officers, a forensic scientist, and the trial judge. The weapon obviously had not lost its visual characteristics as a firearm. To be sure, Kings-bur was concerned enough about the firearm being perceived to be a firearm that (according to his own testimony) he saw the need to keep it from getting into the hands of children, and also knew that, as a convicted felon, he could not legally possess it.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Moreover, the handgun had not been altered, disfigured, or damaged in any way. True, it could not be fired. But that was because of missing \u2014 and thus potentially replaceable\u2014 internal parts, not because of any irreversible physical disfigurement severe enough to change the character of the object into something other than a firearm. As in <em>Armstrong, </em>263 Va. at 585, 562 S.E.2d at 146, the very evidence that the handgun \u201cwas inoperable indicates that it could have been repaired\u201d and rendered functional by simply replacing those missing parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">The trial court did not err in finding that the Davis Model P-32 handgun possessed by Kingsbur, a convicted felon, constituted a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-308.2. We thus affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\">.
