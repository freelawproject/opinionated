Disagreeing with both assertions, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-15\">On appeal, we review the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\u201d <em>Morrisette v. Commonwealth, </em>264 Va. 386, 389, 569 S.E.2d 47, 50 (2002). That principle requires us to \u201cdiscard the evidence of the accused in conflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the credible evidence favorable to the Commonwealth and all fair inferences that may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Holsapple v. Commonwealth, </em>39 Va.App. 522, 528, 574 S.E.2d 756, 758-59 (2003) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted); <em>see also Wactor v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 375, 380, 564 S.E.2d 160, 162 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On April 17, 2001, Officer Robert Barlow of the Richmond Police Department conducted a \u201croutine patrol\u201d through a \u201chigh drug\u201d area of Richmond. He observed a \u201cgroup of gentlemen standing on the corner.\u201d Barlow exited his patrol vehicle, approached the men, and asked for identification. Once he received each man\u2019s identification, Barlow performed a record check on each \u201cto see if there were any warrants on file.\u201d Barlow learned that pending process existed charging Craddock with \u201cfailure to appear on a felony narcotics charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Barlow arrested Craddock and placed him in the police cruiser for transport to the \u201cdetention center.\u201d The detention center served as an \u201cannex of the jail, under the jurisdiction of the Sheriff of the City of Richmond.\u201d The center processed about \u201c450 to 500 prisoners\u201d each week and anywhere \u201cfrom 130 to 500\u201d prisoners would be in the center at any given time. The guards at the detention center were responsible for \u201csending those particular prisoners to each and every court in the city in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">While en route to the detention center, Officer Barlow received a phone call from Officer Michael Bender. Bender had heard Craddock\u2019s name over the radio dispatch and called Barlow to explain that, in the recent past, Craddock had kept drugs \u201chidden in his underwear\u201d and \u201cwas known to carry drugs in his buttock area.\u201d Bender knew this because he \u201cwas the officer who got the search warrant for the prior drugs that had been retrieved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Barlow relayed this information to Deputy Sheriff Kenneth Droddy, the assistant commander of the detention center. Droddy testified that he was informed that Craddock was on bail for a \u201cfelony possession with intent to distribute\u201d charge. In that earlier proceeding, which occurred about \u201ctwo months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>prior,\u201d a search warrant had been issued \u201cbecause Mr. Craddock had secreted the particular narcotics in his anal cavity.\u201d Deputy Droddy was also \u201cfamiliar with Mr, Craddock because of previous incarcerations.\u201d Craddock had been previously convicted of two felonies. Droddy also knew Officer Barlow had arrested Craddock at a place known to be a \u201changout or location for the sale of narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">After his arrival at the detention center, Craddock was \u201cprocessed to go into jail\u201d with the understanding that he had been \u201cbrought into the sheriffs custody on a commitment brought by the magistrate for failure to appear.\u201d Craddock initially appeared calm and did not seem \u201cnervous or agitated in any way.\u201d When a deputy conducted a routine pat-down search of Craddock, however, Craddock \u201cseemed to be a little jumpy.\u201d After the pat-down search, Barlow brought Craddock to the \u201clockup\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\u201cWhen he got down to lockup,\u201d Barlow testified, Craddock \u201cstarted to get nervous.\u201d Barlow asked Craddock if he was carrying any contraband and explained to him \u201cthat it is an additional charge for bringing any illegal type of contraband into the jail setting.\u201d Acting \u201cvery nervous,\u201d Craddock denied having any contraband. Deputy Droddy then \u201ccalled Mr. Craddock over and expressed to him ... that I possibly thought that he may have something on him.\u201d \u201cAt that very second\u201d Craddock\u2019s demeanor changed \u201cone hundred percent,\u201d going \u201cfrom being very calm and collective to being very nervous, very fidgety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Pursuant to written policies promulgated by the sheriff, deputies had authority to \u201cstrip search\u201d a detainee at the detention center if they had \u201creason to believe\u201d the detainee may be hiding contraband. Acting in accord with this policy, Deputy Droddy informed Craddock that the deputies would conduct a strip search. Craddock initially consented. The deputies escorted him to a \u201csecluded\u201d cell where the search could take place with some measure of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">After entering the holding cell, Craddock claimed that it was \u201ctoo cold\u201d for a strip search. On three occasions during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>this conversation, Deputy Droddy explained to Craddock that it was necessary to conduct a strip search. When Craddock began to resist, the deputies used \u201cpepper spray\u201d to subdue him. Craddock then \u201cbegan fighting and thrashing around so dramatically that it was impossible\u201d for the officers to conduct the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Craddock continued to fight the deputies for about three to four minutes. During this struggle, Droddy informed Craddock \u201cfor the fourth and fifth times that he had to submit to the test.\u201d Droddy also informed Craddock that if he \u201ccalmed down,\u201d Droddy would allow him to remove his own garments. Craddock nonetheless \u201ccontinued thrashing around, hollering no, and kicking at the officers holding his feet.\u201d Only after several minutes of struggling did Craddock grow tired enough that he relaxed. At that point, Droddy determined that the deputies could remove Craddock\u2019s clothing \u201cwithout injuring him or without one of us getting injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">A deputy removed Craddock\u2019s socks and shoes, \u201cthen pulled his pants down by using the outer pants legs.\u201d Despite Craddock\u2019s renewed struggles, the deputies pulled Craddock\u2019s underwear down. Droddy observed a plastic bag with suspected narcotics between Craddock\u2019s \u201cbutt cheeks.\u201d Droddy made this initial observation without the need to spread Craddock\u2019s \u201cbutt cheeks apart\u201d or to \u201cmanipulate his cheeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Craddock began to clench \u201chis buttocks together so forcefully that it was almost like he was lifting weights or something like that.\u201d Droddy could still see the bag \u201cprotruding from his butt cheeks.\u201d As the physical struggle continued, the deputies eventually pulled Craddock\u2019s legs apart. Droddy picked up the bag, which was then resting \u201con top\u201d of Craddock\u2019s anus. Droddy testified that he did not \u201cpull it out\u201d from Craddock\u2019s buttocks. \u201cAll I had to do,\u201d Droddy explained, \u201cwas pick it up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Craddock continued to fight with the deputies even after they removed the narcotics from his body. As Droddy gathered some of Craddock\u2019s belongings from the floor of the cell, \u201cCraddock lunged up off of the bench\u201d at Droddy. Because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>this, Droddy \u201chad to engage in another physical altercation with Mr. Craddock, restraining him again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Deputy Droddy testified that he conducted the strip search of Craddock because of two concerns. First, \u201cit is necessary for me to prevent those items from getting into the facility.\u201d Inmates \u201ctend to use contraband, especially ... narcotics, as a source of power within the facility.\u201d Internal strife and violence inevitably result from the introduction of drugs into the jail. Second, Droddy believed the narcotics created \u201chealth issues as far as Mr. Craddock was concerned.\u201d Drugs in the anal cavity could make inmates \u201csick to the point where they are actually deathly ill, and we have had to take them to the hospital.\u201d A physician specializing in toxicology testified at trial that the amount of crack cocaine possessed by Craddock would have been \u201clethal\u201d if the bag had burst and the cocaine had been absorbed directly into the anal membranes.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">These were not hypothetical concerns, Droddy testified. On at lease twelve occasions, deputies had \u201crecovered drugs off of people being brought in through the lockup.\u201d On two occasions, detainees had secreted narcotics \u201cin a body cavity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The bag of narcotics taken from Craddock contained twelve, separately wrapped, \u201cplastic bag corners\u201d with a total weight of 2.556 grams of crack cocaine. The grand jury indicted Craddock for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-248. Craddock remained incarcerated up to the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Prior to trial, Craddock\u2019s counsel moved to suppress the cocaine obtained during the strip search. The trial judge overruled the motion, holding that \u201cthe officers had an obligation and duty to search the gentleman before he went into the population of the lockup and/or the jail, of which I consider one to be a part of the other.\u201d After hearing the evidence, the trial court found Craddock guilty of obstruction of justice, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C), and guilty of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Though the ultimate question whether the officers violated the Fourth Amendment triggers <em>de novo </em>scrutiny on appeal, the trial court\u2019s findings of \u201chistorical fact\u201d bind us due to the weight we give \u201cto the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Davis v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 421, 429, 559 S.E.2d 374, 378 (2002) (citing <em>Neal v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va.App. 233, 237, 498 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1998)). We examine the trial court\u2019s factual findings only to determine if they are plainly wrong or devoid of supporting evidence. <em>See Mier v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 827, 828, 407 S.E.2d 342, 343 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In addition, the appellant must shoulder the burden of showing that the trial court\u2019s decision \u201cconstituted reversible error.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 197, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citations omitted); <em>see also Davis, </em>37 Va.App. at 429-30, 559 S.E.2d at 378. \u201cAbsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977); see also <em>Oliver v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 286, 297, 544 S.E.2d 870, 875 (2001) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s judgment is presumed to be correct.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Relying on cases addressing searches incident to arrest, Craddock argues that the officers conducted a warrant-less and personally intrusive search in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In reply, the Commonwealth contends that no constitutional violation occurs where, as here, guards conduct a strip search of a detainee being admitted into the general population of a penal facility for the express purpose of preventing contraband from entering the facility. This partie<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ular search, the Commonwealth continues, did not exceed reasonable scope and manner limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We begin our analysis with a definition of terms. A \u201cstrip search\u201d involves \u201can inspection of a naked individual, without any scrutiny of his body cavities.\u201d <em>Kidd v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 433, 446, 565 S.E.2d 337, 343 (2002). A \u201cvisual body cavity search\u201d goes further and \u201cextends to a visual inspection of the anal and genital areas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). A \u201cmanual body cavity search,\u201d the most intrusive search, entails \u201csome degree of touching or probing of body cavities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted); <em>see also McCloud v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 276, 282-83, 544 S.E.2d 866, 869 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\"> We next turn to the governing legal principles. The Fourth Amendment proscribes only \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d <em>McNair v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 559, 563, 513 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1999) <em>(en </em>banc), not reasonable ones. A standard \u201cnot capable of precise definition or mechanical application,\u201d <em>Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 559, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1884, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979), reasonableness hinges on the facts of each case. Depending upon the circumstances, reasonableness may permit police officers to conduct warrantless searches ranging from \u201ca generalized search of the person to the more intrusive strip search or body cavity search.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 447, 455, 524 S.E.2d 155, 159 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer\u2019s authority to conduct a \u201cfull search\u201d incident to arrest \u201cis only skin deep.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Gilmore, </em>27 Va.App. 320, 328, 498 S.E.2d 464, 468 (1998). Officers cannot, for example, strip search \u201cminor non-jailable offenders\u201d incident to their arrest without a showing of \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d that they possess contraband or weapons. <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 638, 642, 507 S.E.2d 661, 663 (1998) (barring a strip search of an arrestee on a misdemeanor charge of public intoxication where the arrestee was not being admitted to the general jail population). Officers may not conduct a manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>body cavity search unless \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exist, coupled with a \u201cclear indication\u201d that evidence is \u201clocated within a suspect\u2019s body.\u201d <em>Gilmore, </em>27 Va.App. at 330-31, 498 S.E.2d at 469; <em>see also Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 219, 226, 516 S.E.2d 246, 249-50 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">A different set of principles governs institutional searches of pretrial detainees being processed for admission in the general population of a penal facility. In <em>Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 558, 99 S.Ct. at 1884, pretrial detainees challenged a prison policy requiring them \u201cto expose their body cavities for visual inspection as a part of a strip search conducted after every contact visit with a person from outside the institution.\u201d The prison policy did not require any showing of individualized suspicion, but rested solely on the institutional goal of deterring \u201cthe smuggling of weapons, drugs, and other contraband into the institution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The United States Supreme Court upheld the search policy, which included both strip searches and visual body cavity searches, holding that \u201csignificant and legitimate security interests of the institution\u201d warranted the intrusive search. <em>Id. </em>at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\"><em>Bell </em>grounded its holding on unique institutional concerns, well known to the courts, about the prevalence of drugs and weapons in the nation\u2019s correctional facilities.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-7\">A detention facility is a unique place fraught with serious security dangers. Smuggling of money, drugs, weapons, and other contraband is all too common an occurrence. And inmate attempts to secrete these items into the facility by concealing them in body cavities are documented in this record[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885 (citations omitted); <em>see also Marrero v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 754, 757, 284 S.E.2d 809, 811 (1981) (Possession of \u201cdrugs and weapons by inmates is a problem facing prison officials everywhere.\u201d); <em>Beamon v. Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 707, 709, 284 S.E.2d 591, 592 (1981) (Correction officials face an \u201curgent necessity of preventing, so far as possible, the introduction into the prison of drugs and weapons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Though the record in <em>Bell </em>disclosed only one prior occasion where a detainee attempted to smuggle contraband into the facility, that fact did not dilute the rationale for the strip searches.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-5\">That there has been only one instance where an MCC inmate was discovered attempting to smuggle contraband into the institution on his person may be more a testament to the effectiveness of this search technique as a deterrent than to any lack of interest on the part of the inmates to secrete and import such items when the opportunity arises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVH\"><em>Id. </em>at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In the context of detainee strip searches, the rule of reason enforced by the Fourth Amendment cannot be simplified into an analytical tool of \u201cmechanical application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the reasonableness test requires a fact-specific balancing of individual and institutional interests:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. <em>Courts must consider the scope of the particular intrusion, the manner in which it is conducted, the justification for initiating it, and the place in which it is conducted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">In our case, guided by the balancing test of <em>Bell, </em>we first address the \u201cscope of the particular intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. The trial court found that the deputies discovered the contraband during a strip search of Craddock, not a visual or manual body cavity search. This factual finding rests on credible evidence. Deputy Droddy observed the bag between Craddock\u2019s \u201cbutt cheeks\u201d before the deputies spread his legs apart during the struggle. The bag was \u201csitting actually on top of his anus.\u201d To retrieve the bag, Droddy \u201cdidn\u2019t have to pull it out\u201d of Craddock\u2019s anus. Instead, Droddy explained, \u201call I had to do was pick it up.\u201d These facts describe an inspection of the exterior of Craddock\u2019s buttocks, not a specific visual or manual examination of his anal cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>We next consider the \u201cmanner\u201d in which the search was conducted. <em>Id. </em>The deputies removed Craddock\u2019s clothes, but did not intrude into any body cavity. Although the deputies physically restrained Craddock, who forcibly resisted the search, their force was necessary to prevent Craddock from injuring himself and the deputies. The search took place in a secluded holding cell, a reasonable place for a strip search. No other detainees or officers were present. Given these circumstances, the officers did not \u201cconduct the search in an abusive fashion.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 560, 99 S.Ct. at 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Finally, we must examine the \u201cjustification\u201d for the search and the \u201cplace in which it is conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 99 S.Ct. at 1885. This particular detention center served as \u201can annex of the jail\u201d and housed hundreds of detainees, many of whom required transportation to local courts. In this respect, the detention center appears quite similar to the \u201cshort-term custodial facility\u201d in <em>Bell, </em>which had been \u201cdesigned primarily to house pretrial detainees\u201d and was \u201clocated adjacent\u201d to the federal courthouse. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 99 S.Ct. at 1865.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The justification for the search given in <em>Bell </em>likewise applies here. The detention center faced an urgent need to prevent the entry of drugs into the facility. The entry of drugs into the facility compromised the safety of inmates and officers alike. Inmates hiding cocaine in the anal cavity faced an additional danger, possibly a lethal one, of drugs being released into the rectal membranes. These concerns amply justify the sheriffs policy of authorizing strip searches where the deputies had, as Deputy Droddy did here, \u201creason to believe\u201d the detainee was concealing contraband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence concerning the scope, manner, justification, and place of Craddock\u2019s strip search comports with the standard of reasonableness required by the Fourth Amendment. The trial court, therefore, did not err in denying Craddock\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs discovered during this search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Craddock next argues that the Commonwealth failed to provide sufficient evidence to support his conviction for obstruction of justice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The crime of obstruction of justice occurs when \u201cany person by threats of bodily harm or force knowingly attempts to intimidate or impede ... any law enforcement officer, lawfully engaged in the discharge of his duty....\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-460(C). To violate the statute, the defendant must intend to impede an officer \u201cin the performance of his duties.\u201d <em>Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 787, 795, 421 S.E.2d 1, 6 (1992). Impeding an officer\u2019s duties does not require the defendant to commit \u201can actual or technical as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sault upon the officer.\u201d <em>Love v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 492, 494, 184 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1971). Rather, \u201cthere must be acts clearly indicating an intention on the part of the accused to prevent the officer from performing his duty, as to \u2018obstruct\u2019 ordinarily implies opposition or resistance by direct action.\u201d <em>Ruckman v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 428, 429, 505 S.E.2d 388, 389 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In this case, Craddock physically resisted a lawful search and continued his obstructive behavior even after the search. The trial court, therefore, did not err in finding the evidence sufficient to demonstrate Craddock\u2019s intent to prevent the officers from performing their duties. <em>Ruckman, </em>28 Va.App. at 429, 505 S.E.2d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">Craddock\u2019s final challenge contends that the evidence failed to prove that he possessed the cocaine with an intent to distribute. Once again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">An individual violates Code \u00a7 18.2-248(A) when he possesses \u201cthe controlled substance contemporaneously with his intention to distribute that substance.\u201d <em>Christian v. Commonwealth, </em>33 Va.App. 704, 716, 536 S.E.2d 477, 483 (2000) <em>(en </em>banc) (citation omitted). Because of the difficulty of proving intent directly, the Commonwealth may (and often must) rely instead on circumstantial evidence. <em>Morrison v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 273, 281, 557 S.E.2d 724, 728 (2002). Several factors, when viewed together, can provide circumstantial \u201cprobative evidence of intent\u201d to distribute drugs. <em>McCain v. Commonwealth, </em>261 Va. 483, 492, 545 S.E.2d 541, 547 (2001). Many of these factors exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">First, the trial court qualified Officer Barlow as an expert witness \u201cin the field of street drug distribution.\u201d He had arrested \u201cnumerous\u201d drug users, as well as dealers, and had coordinated controlled buys from street-level sellers. In the process, he had debriefed users and dealers on various aspects of the drug trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Barlow testified that \u201cmost users would use one rock a day.\u201d One rock, he explained, weighs approximately .2 grams. Craddock carried \u201c12 rocks of crack cocaine\u201d weighing 2.556 grams, considerably more than one would expect to find on a mere user. This amount, in Barlow\u2019s opinion, was \u201cinconsistent with personal use.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Clarke v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 286, 304, 527 S.E.2d 484, 493 (2000) (possessing drugs in an amount greater than that for personal use indicates intent to distribute). The toxicologist agreed, testifying that the amount of cocaine possessed by Craddock \u201cwould be lethal if it was given to an individual all at one time.\u201d \u201cIt is about ten times what people would normally take.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Second, Craddock did not possess any drug paraphernalia and, as Barlow testified, typical users of crack cocaine ordinarily \u201cwould have some type of smoking device on them.\u201d <em>See Welshman v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 20, 37, 502 S.E.2d 122, 130 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (recognizing the absence of drug \u201cparaphernalia suggestive of personal use\u201d as evidence of an intent to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Third, each of the twelve rocks of crack had been \u201cindividually packaged,\u201d indicating that the cocaine could be sold in small, individual quantities. <em>Id. </em>(method of packaging should be considered). Drug users usually carry one or two individually packaged rocks for personal use, Barlow explained, while retail dealers usually carry more as inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Fourth, despite his many arrests and debriefing sessions, Barlow testified that he personally had never observed users \u201chave the drugs in their buttocks.\u201d In contrast, he pointed out, dealers often concealed drugs \u201cin between their butt cheeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Fifth, Barlow arrested Craddock in a \u201cknown hangout or location for the sale of narcotics.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Kidd v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 433, 448-49, 565 S.E.2d 337, 344-45 (2002) (\u201c[T]he characterization of the area in which an accused was arrested as an area known for drug transactions has been found to be another relevant factor in determining intent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Sixth, Craddock argued at trial that a \u201creasonable hypothesis would be he was holding the drugs as accommodation, not for profit.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-248, however, does not distinguish between profit and not-for-profit distribution for purposes of criminal liability. \u201cWhether a defendant acted only to accommodate another is a determination to be made after guilt has been decided and in contemplation of the penalty to be imposed.\u201d <em>Foster v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 549, 555, 567 S.E.2d 547, 550 (2002). An intent to accommodate, conceptually speaking, is a subset of the intent to distribute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 18.2-248(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The combined force of these evidentiary factors, coupled with Craddock\u2019s concession on accommodation, provided a sufficient basis for the trial court to find that Craddock intended to distribute the drugs found in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">In sum, the trial court did not err by denying Craddock\u2019s motion to suppress. Applying the balancing test of <em>Bell, </em>the pre-admission strip search of Craddock did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscription against unreasonable searches. The evidence also sufficiently established Craddock\u2019s guilt for obstructing justice and for possessing cocaine with an intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-7\">. The Commonwealth argues that the sheriff\u2019s strip search policy, by imposing a form of individualized suspicion requirement, goes considerably further than the Fourth Amendment balancing test in <em>Bell </em>demands \u2014 particularly given the fact that Craddock was changed with a felony drug offense and placed in the general population of the jail. <em>See Illinois v. Johnson, </em>334 Ill.App.3d 666, 268 Ill.Dec. 506, 778 N.E.2d 772, 779-80 (2002) (Under the <em>Bell </em>rationale, \"good penal practices not only permit, they require strip searches before placing detainees into the general jail population.\u201d). Because this case does not present that specific issue for us to decide, however, we decline the \"invitation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>render an advisory opinion\u201d on the subject. <em>Commonwealth v. Harley, </em>256 Va. 216, 220, 504 S.E.2d 852, 854 (1998). Whether <em>Bell </em>forbids suspicionless strip searches of pretrial felony detainees is a question that we do not resolve.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-9\">. In his suppression motion, Craddock also asserted that the strip search violated the Virginia Constitution and Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1. Neither assertion has merit. Virginia courts \u201chave consistently held that the protections afforded under the Virginia Constitution are co-extensive with those in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Sabo v. Commonwealth, </em>38 Va.App. 63, 77, 561 S.E.2d 761, 768 (2002) (quoting <em>Henry v. Commonwealth, </em>32 Va.App. 547, 551, 529 S.E.2d 796, 798 (2000), and <em>Bennefield v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 729, 739-40, 467 S.E.2d 306, 311 (1996)). In concluding that Craddock\u2019s search does not violate the Fourth Amendment, therefore, we likewise find no violation of the analogous provisions of the Virginia Constitution. Further, Code \u00a7 19.2-59.1 does not apply to felony detainees, <em>McCloud, 35 </em>Va.App. at 281, 544 S.E.2d at 868, and, in any event, does not provide a statutory suppression remedy for alleged violations, <em>Taylor, </em>28 Va.App. at 641, 507 S.E.2d at 663.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
