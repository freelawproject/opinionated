DSS contends that the trial court erred in relying on Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), as opposed to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2), in support of its determination. In the alternative, DSS argues that the trial court erred in determining that it failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that Winslow\u2019s residual parental rights should be terminated pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>283(C)(2). For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">DSS initially removed Winslow\u2019s children from her home in July of 1998. DSS removed the children because of the extremely poor condition of Winslow\u2019s home and Winslow\u2019s apparent inability, due to a bi-polar disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder, to accept responsibility for the condition of the home and the resulting danger posed to her children. On December 28, 2001, after several years of working with Winslow and her children, DSS filed permanency plans with the goal of adoption and petitions to terminate Winslow\u2019s residual parental rights with the Newport News Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (J &amp; DR court). The petitions and permanency plans alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Th\u00e9 parents, without good cause, have been unwilling or unable with [sic] a reasonable period not to exceed twelve month [sic] to remedy substantially the conditions which led to the child\u2019s foster care placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end. (Virginia Code Section 16.1 \u2014 283[C](2) [sic]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">On March 4 and 5, 2002, the J <em>&amp; </em>DR court heard evidence on the petitions. On April 24, 2002, the court approved the goal of adoption and terminated Winslow\u2019s parental rights to the children finding that, pursuant to \u201cCode \u00a7 16.1-283(C),\u201d Winslow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">without good cause, has been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the date the child was placed in foster care to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster placement, notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or rehabilitative agencies to such end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Winslow subsequently appealed the J &amp; DR court\u2019s order to the circuit court (trial court) for a <em>de novo </em>review. On June 28, 2002 and September 27, 2002, the trial court heard evidence on the matters. DSS presented several witnesses having knowledge of the circumstances. At the close of DSS\u2019s evidence, Winslow raised a motion to strike contending that DSS failed to prove,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">by clear and convincing evidence, that not only is it in the best interest of the children that the parental rights be terminated, but also that the mother through the abuse and neglect place [sic] the children in serious, substantial threat to their life, health, and development, and that it\u2019s not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in that neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the deficiency to be gone [sic].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">DSS responded, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">the Code allows the City to proceed on any of the sections in 16.1-283, and the City has chosen to proceed on Section C-2, wherein, the mother has without good cause been unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 12 months from the date the children came into care, to remedy substantial [sic] any conditions that places the children in foster care placement despite the efforts of Newport News Department of Social Services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">After hearing the arguments, the trial court granted the motion, finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">a child is not entitled to the best mother on earth. A child is entitled to their birth parent unless it causes irremediable harm to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">There\u2019s no doubt at the time [the children] were removed that the department of social services was absolutely correct. I don\u2019t think the mother would dispute that knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>what she knows now, <em>that there was a serious threat to their life, health or development living in that milieu in which they lived.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-4\">But the question before the Court today is [sic] not reasonably likely that those conditions which resulted in their neglect and abuse at that time can be substantially corrected or eliminated [sic]. And, see, we also when these cases go on like that, we also lose sight of the fact that it\u2019s the original abuse and neglect that we\u2019re concerned \u2022with, not what\u2019s happened from intervening causes such as sexual abuse or other placements or what\u2019s happened at other places. She can\u2019t be expected \u2014 she\u2019s never been expected to remedy those situations. <em>She\u2019s always been asked to remedy those situations that were there present when she lost the children, and I can\u2019t see by clear and convincing evidence that it\u2019s not reasonably likely that those conditions could be substantially corrected. </em>I\u2019m going to grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">(Emphases added). The trial court issued its written order, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>on October 24, 2002, which stated as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">This matter came to be heard on September 27, 2002. The parties having last appeared before the Court on June 28, 2002 for Jeanette Winslow\u2019s appeal of the Newport News Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court order, dated April 18, 2002, terminating her residual parental rights to the above-named children, pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-288(C)(2) of the Code of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">Upon consideration, the Court FINDS the evidence insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the termination of parental rights petition filed by the Newport News Department of Social Services. WHEREFORE, the Court GRANTS the motion to strike the evidence and the petition to terminate the residual parental rights of Jeanette Win-slow is HEREBY dismissed and remanded to the Newport News Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">On appeal, DSS contends the trial court erred in granting the motion to strike, because in so doing it failed to \u201capply the standard contained in \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(C)(2)\u201d and instead \u201cimproperly applied the standard contained in \u00a7 16.1-283(B).\u201d In the alternative, DSS contends the trial court erred in finding it failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that Winslow\u2019s residual parental rights should be terminated pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">We first note that \u201c[a]bsent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, the judgment of a trial court comes to us on appeal with a presumption that the law was correctly applied to the facts.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 978, 234 S.E.2d 286, 291 (1977). Furthermore, the Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently \u201cstated that \u2018it is the firmly established law of this Commonwealth that a trial court speaks only through its written orders.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walton v. Commonwealth, </em>256 Va. 85, 94, 501 S.E.2d 134, 140 (1998) (quoting <em>Davis v. Mullins, </em>251 Va. 141, 148, 466 S.E.2d 90, 94 (1996)). Appellate courts thus \u201cpresume\u201d that the trial judge\u2019s order \u201caccurately reflects what transpired\u201d during the proceedings below.. <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 260, 280-81, 257 S.E.2d 808, 822 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283 establishes the procedures and grounds under which a court may order the termination of residual parental rights. The statute provides as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">B. The residual parental rights of a parent or parents of a child found by the court to be neglected or abused and placed in foster care as a result of (i) court commitment; (ii) an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent or parents; or (iii) other voluntary relinquishment by the parent or parents may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>1. The neglect or abuse suffered by such child presented a serious and substantial threat to his <em>life, health or development; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">2. It is not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in such neglect or abuse <em>can be substantially corrected or eliminated </em>so as to allow the child\u2019s safe return to his parent or parents within a reasonable period of time....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">C. The residual parental rights of a parent or parents of a child placed in foster care as a result of court commitment, an entrustment agreement entered into by the parent or parents or other voluntary relinquishment by the parent or parents may be terminated if the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interests of the child and that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">2. The parent or parents, without good cause, <em>have been unwilling or unable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months </em>from the date the child was placed in foster care <em>to remedy substantially the conditions which led to or required continuation of the child\u2019s foster care placement, </em>notwithstanding the reasonable and appropriate efforts of social, medical, mental health or other rehabilitative agencies to such end....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) and (C)(2) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Both subsection (B) and subsection (C)(2) of Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 283 address substantially similar grounds for the termination of parental rights. <em>See Richmond Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. L.P., </em>35 Va.App. 573, 583, 546 S.E.2d 749, 754 (2001). However, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) speaks prospectively, as to the ability of the parent or parents to \u201csubstantially\u201d remedy, \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time,\u201d the conditions which led to the foster care placement. Conversely, Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2) is retrospective in nature, focusing on whether the parent or parents \u201chave been [Jwilling or [Jable within a reasonable period of time not to exceed twelve months,\u201d to \u201cremedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>substantially\u201d the conditions which led to the foster care placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Despite these distinctions, we have previously upheld terminations under both subsections of Code \u00a7 16.1-283, as well as under one or either of the individual subsections. <em>See Ferguson v. Stafford County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>14 Va.App. 333, 340, 417 S.E.2d 1, 5 (1992) (upholding the trial court\u2019s decision to terminate residual parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(13) and (C)(1)); <em>Lowe v. Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>231 Va. 277, 281-82, 343 S.E.2d 70, 73 (1986) (upholding termination of residual parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B)(2)); and <em>Lecky v. Reed, </em>20 Va.App. 306, 313-14, 456 S.E.2d 538, 541 (1995) (ordering termination of residual parental rights pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)). Furthermore, each subsection, although similar in nature, is written as a distinct and grammatically independent provision of the statute. Accordingly, it is clear that Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) and (C)(2) set forth individual bases upon which a petitioner may seek to terminate residual parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Here, the record clearly reflects that DSS sought termination of Winslow\u2019s residual parental rights based upon Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2), not \u00a7 16.1-283(B). In fact, DSS pointed the trial court to this subsection of the statute in its response to Winslow\u2019s motion to strike. Moreover, both foster care plans, filed in conjunction with the termination petitions, state specifically that they are based upon Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, the juvenile and domestic relations district court relied upon Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C), as reflected in its written orders of April 24, 2002, in terminating Winslow\u2019s residual parental rights after the district court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Nevertheless, in support of her motion to strike, Winslow argued that DSS failed to demonstrate that Winslow, \u201cthrough the abuse and neglect place [sic] the children in serious, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>substantial threat to their life, health, and development, and that it\u2019s not reasonably likely that the conditions which resulted in that neglect or abuse can be substantially corrected or eliminated so as to allow the deficiency to be gone [sic].\u201d Winslow\u2019s argument in this regard clearly tracked the bases of proof necessary to establish termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1 \u2014 283(B), as opposed to those necessary to establish termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In response, the trial court found \u201cI don\u2019t think [Winslow] would dispute that knowing what she knows now, that there was a serious threat to their life, health or development living in that milieu in which they lived,\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t see by clear and convincing evidence that it\u2019s not reasonably likely that those conditions could be substantially corrected.\u201d The trial court\u2019s written order notes that the juvenile and domestic relations district court granted the termination pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(0(2), but merely states that, after hearing the matter <em>de novo, </em>it found the \u201cevidence insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the petition filed by\u201d DSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Based upon the trial court\u2019s statements during the hearing, and because we discern no guidance from its broadly written final order, we find that the trial court improperly applied the law to the facts in this case. The trial court first made a factual finding concerning the initial threat to the \u201clife, health, [and] development\u201d of the children and then made a prospective determination, finding that it was \u201cnot reasonably likely that\u201d Winslow could substantially remedy those conditions. As set forth above, these criteria are pertinent to a finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B), not to a finding pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-283(C)(2). Furthermore, there is no ambiguity created between the trial court\u2019s statements in the transcript and its written order. <em>See Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>262 Va. 661, 668, 553 S.E.2d 760, 763 (2001) (noting that the maxim that \u201ca court speaks only through its written orders\u201d \u201cgenerally refers to instances when some conflict or ambiguity exists between the language expressed in a transcript and a court\u2019s order, when an order fails to reflect an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>action allegedly taken by one or more parties, or when a court\u2019s order fails to reflect compliance with a jurisdictional requirement\u201d). Indeed, the written order fails to state which subsection the trial court relied upon to sustain its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the trial court, granting Winslow\u2019s motion to strike under the guise of Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We further remand this matter for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-9\">. On April 10, 2003, we granted Winslow's motion for leave to file a \"late reply brief\u201d and allowed her counsel to present oral argument. During her oral argument, Winslow withdrew her motion to dismiss, filed with this Court on April 4, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\">. The petitions also sought to terminate the residual parental rights of each of the children\u2019s fathers. There is no issue in the present appeal with regard to the termination of the fathers\u2019 rights. Therefore, we do not address these matters further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\">. We note that although the Appendix on appeal contains a copy of both foster care plans (dated December 28, 2001), only one plan appears in the circuit court\u2019s record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b605-15\">. Because we have found that the trial court improperly relied upon Code \u00a7 16.1-283(B) in reaching its determination, we do not reach DSS\u2019s alternative argument that the trial court erred in failing to find DSS established the necessary elements of proof under Code \u00a7 16.1\u2014 283(C)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
