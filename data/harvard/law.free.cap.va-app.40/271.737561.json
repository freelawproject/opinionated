Appellant contends the trial court erred by: (1) excluding one of the complaining witnesses\u2019 journals pursuant to the rape shield statute; (2) imposing a harsher sentence on retrial after a successful appeal and remand; (3) finding the evidence proved the element of \u201cintimidation\u201d; <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (4) finding the evidence sufficient to convict him. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions and the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"Abg\">A. Factual History-</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">On October 11, 1998 Dewayne Martin (Martin) and two other men entered appellant\u2019s home and removed his stepdaughter, daughter and two sons. Martin took them to a local church because he had information that the two girls, W and N, were being sexually abused. Martin called police who met with W,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> age 14, and her sister, N, age 11. W told the police that appellant, her stepfather, and her mother had been sexually abusing the two children. W and N stated that on several occasions dating from February 1998, their parents had engaged in \u201coral sex\u201d with them. The abuse also included \u201ctruth or dare\u201d games, in which appellant dared W and N to perform sexual acts on him, the mother and each other, strip poker and the use of \u201csexual favors\u201d to avoid or mitigate punishments. W also stated that appellant had engaged in vaginal intercourse with her in September 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Additionally, the girls claimed that appellant made two videotapes depicting them performing fellatio on him and cunnilingus with each other and with their mother. Appellant made them watch the videotapes and later told the girls he had \u201csnowed them all out\u201d after they watched the tapes. The girls\u2019 brother, who was 13 at the time of the abuse, testified that he inadvertently found one of the videos, and saw his \u201clittle sister [N] on her knees [performing fellatio on] my dad\u201d before turning off the tape. W told the police that she kept three journals, one of which contained a detailed account of the abuse. Police searched the family home pursuant to a warrant and found one journal kept by W but no videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Police arrested both parents that night. Appellant admitted to the police that his daughters had been in the room when he and their mother had sex and that W had been in the bed with them on more than one occasion. Appellant also stated that he dared W and a friend to get in the shower together during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>a truth or dare game. Finally, appellant conceded to police that he dared W to have oral sex with her boyfriend and that he and his wife watched while she did so. He denied any other sexual conduct with the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">In May 1999, appellant and the girls\u2019 mother were tried jointly in a bench trial. The trial court originally convicted appellant of four counts of forcible sodomy, one count of rape and one count of producing sexually explicit materials and sentenced him to 25 years, with 15 years suspended on each of the sodomy counts; 50 years, with 80 years suspended on the rape count; and 5 years, all suspended on the producing sexually explicit material count.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those convictions were overturned in <em>Cairns v. Commonwealth, </em>35 Va.App. 1, 542 S.E.2d 771 (2001), and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">On remand, the trial judge granted appellant\u2019s motion to recuse himself and a different judge was assigned to preside at the second trial. Appellant noticed a hearing on the admissibility of W\u2019s journals pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7, the rape shield statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Commonwealth filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the journals. The journals documented dozens of sexual encounters with numerous partners, listed all W\u2019s partners and kept a tally of her sexual activities, beginning in the summer of 1997 and continuing after appellant\u2019s arrest. After a closed hearing on both motions, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and precluded appellant from introducing the journals into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">On the day of trial, appellant, the Commonwealth and the trial court waived a trial by jury. Appellant again sought to introduce W\u2019s journals as possible impeachment testimony at trial. Appellant contended that the journals, which contain explicit details of Ws sexual activities, served two impeach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ment purposes. First, they cast doubt on the abuse because there is no mention of the abusive activities in the contemporaneous journal. Second, they impeach W\u2019s statement to the police that she kept a detailed record of the abuse. The trial court again ruled that the rape shield statute barred admission of the journals.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Appellant also moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s case, contending that the evidence failed to prove \u201cintimidation.\u201d That motion was also denied. The trial court dismissed one sodomy count; but convicted appellant of three counts of forcible sodomy, one count of rape and one count of producing sexually explicit material. The trial court sentenced appellant to 30 years on each of the sodomy counts, with 20 years suspended; 50 years on the rape count; and 10 years on the producing sexually explicit material count, with 10 years suspended. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s request to reconsider the term of his sentence because it exceeded the time imposed at his original trial. Appellant appeals the convictions and the increased sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">II. Rape Shield Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Appellant contends that it was error to exclude W\u2019s journals because (1) they were not \u201cconduct\u201d within the meaning of the rape shield statute and (2) they were relevant to attack her specific allegations and contradict her statements to police. Appellant argues the journals were necessary to impeach W\u2019s testimony and challenge her credibility.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant further argued the journals were probative on the issue of W\u2019s vulnerability because they showed she \u201cwas involving herself in sexual activities with anybody who came down the pike.\u201d Any use of the journals for this purpose is clearly barred by the rape shield statute because it goes only to promiscuity. However, we hold that the trial court erred in excluding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>journals as valid impeachment evidence, but find such error to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">A. Application of the Rape Shield Statute</p>\n<p id=\"AFn\">The rape shield statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-6\">A. In prosecutions under this article, general reputation or opinion evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s unchaste character or prior sexual conduct shall not be admitted. Unless the complaining witness voluntarily agrees otherwise, evidence of specific instances of his or her prior sexual conduct shall be admitted only if it is relevant and is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-7\">1. Evidence offered to provide an alternative explanation for physical evidence of the offense charged which is introduced by the prosecution, limited to evidence designed to explain the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease, or physical injury to the complaining witness\u2019s intimate parts; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">2. Evidence of sexual conduct between the complaining witness and the accused offered to support a contention that the alleged offense was not accomplished by force, threat or intimidation or through the use of the complaining witness\u2019s mental incapacity or physical helplessness, provided that the sexual conduct occurred within a period of time reasonably proximate to the offense charged under the circumstances of this case; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">3. Evidence offered to rebut evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s prior sexual conduct introduced by the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">B. Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit the accused from presenting evidence relevant to show that the complaining witness had a motive to fabricate the charge against the accused. If such evidence relates to the past sexual conduct of the complaining witness with a person other than the accused, it shall not be admitted and may not be referred to at any preliminary hearing or trial unless the party offering same files a written notice generally describing the evidence prior to the introduction of any evidence, or the opening statement of either counsel, whichever first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>occurs, at the preliminary hearing or trial at which the admission of the evidence may be sought.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\u201c[T]he General Assembly intended to preclude evidence of general reputation or opinion of the unchaste character of the complaining witness in all circumstances.\u201d <em>Winfield v. Commonwealth, 225 </em>Va. 211, 220, 301 S.E.2d 15, 20 (1983); <em>Hoke v. Commonwealth, </em>237 Va. 303, 309, 377 S.E.2d 595, 599 (1989); <em>Clinebell v. Commonwealth, </em>235 Va. 319, 322, 368 S.E.2d 263, 264 (1988). \u201c[W]here relevant evidence of the complaining witness\u2019s prior sexual conduct does not fit within the specific exceptions set forth in the statute, it is not admissible.\u201d <em>Evans v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 118, 122-23, 415 S.E.2d 851, 854 (1992). However, our rape shield statute \u201cpermit[s] the introduction of evidence of specific acts of sexual conduct between the complaining witness and third persons in carefully limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Winfield, 225 </em>Va. at 218, 301 S.E.2d at 19. In addition, \u201cthe trial judge must admit other relevant, material evidence, not \"within the enumerated exceptions, when the exclusion of such evidence would deny the defendant the constitutional right to a fan-opportunity to present evidence probative of his defense of the charges against him.\u201d <em>Neeley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 349, 358, 437 S.E.2d 721, 726 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\u201c \u2018Prior sexual conduct\u2019 is defined as \u2018any sexual conduct on the part of the complaining witness which took place before the conclusion of the trial, excluding the conduct involved in the offense alleged under this article.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clinebell, </em>235 Va. at 322, 368 S.E.2d at 264 (quoting Code \u00a7 18.2-67.10(5)); <em>see also Currie v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 204, 391 S.E.2d 79 (1990). Nevertheless, \u201cwhere relevant evidence is not of prior sexual \u2018conduct,\u2019 Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7 does not apply.\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>29 Va.App. 199, 215, 510 S.E.2d 751, 759 (1999) (citing <em>Evans, </em>14 Va.App. at 122-23, 415 S.E.2d at 854). We have not yet addressed whether a complainant\u2019s written journal or diaries cataloguing sexual events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>qualifies as \u201cprior sexual conduct,\u201d and is thus subject to exclusion under Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">While this is an issue of first impression for us, in <em>State v. Vonesh, </em>135 Wis.2d 477, 401 N.W.2d 170, 176-77 (App.1986) (cited with approval in <em>Clinebell, </em>235 Va. 319, 368 S.E.2d 263), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals considered whether written notes containing sexual references by a rape victim constituted prior sexual conduct and would thus be inadmissible under their existing rape shield statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u201cthe act of writing about sexual desires or activities is not itself prior sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Vonesh, </em>401 N.W.2d at 176-77.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In <em>Clinebell, </em>the Supreme Court recognized that evidence of prior false accusations of sexual assault is proper impeachment and not subject to exclusion. <em>See Clinebell, </em>235 Va. at 325, 368 S.E.2d at 266; <em>see also Brown, </em>29 Va.App. at 215, 510 S.E.2d at 759 (questioning the complaining witness about prior testimony in another sexual assault is permissible to show fabrication and impeach the complaining witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">\u201c \u2018[C]alling for evidence in one\u2019s favor is central to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system. It is designed to ensure that the defendant in a criminal case will not be unduly shackled in his effort to develop his best defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>31 Va.App. 96, 109, 521 S.E.2d 313, 319 (1999) (quoting <em>Massey v. Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 436, 442, 337 S.E.2d 754, 757 (1985)). Therefore, \u201cno legislation, however salutary its purpose, can be so construed as to deprive a criminal defendant of his Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>right to confront and cross-examine his accuser and to call witnesses in his defense.\u201d <em>Winfield, </em>225 Va. at 218, 301 S.E.2d at 19 (citing <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974)); <em>see also Neeley v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 349, 355, 437 S.E.2d 721, 724 (1993). \u201cAt least in the context of prosecutions of sexual offenses, evidentiary constraints must sometimes yield to a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination. Cross-examination is an absolute right guaranteed to a defendant by the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment and is fundamental to the truth-finding process.\u201d <em>Clinebell, </em>235 Va. at 325, 368 S.E.2d at 266 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In <em>Clinebell, </em>the Supreme Court reversed the appellant\u2019s five convictions of sexual misconduct because his daughter\u2019s statements were improperly excluded as rape shield evidence. The statements were not offered to show prior sexual conduct, but rather, \u201c[appellant] seeks to prove for impeachment purposes that his daughter makes false statements concerning sexual behavior. We conclude that such statements are not \u2018conduct\u2019 within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7, and therefore, the section is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322, 368 S.E.2d at 264. Similarly, in <em>Brown, </em>we held that prior similar testimony was not \u201csexual conduct\u201d under the statute when offered to impeach the complaining witness by suggesting fabrication. \u201cBrown\u2019s counsel sought to question Doe about prior testimony, not her prior conduct. Furthermore, the testimony sought was not about sexual conduct.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>29 Va.App. at 216, 510 S.E.2d at 759. In holding that Doe\u2019s prior testimony could have affected her credibility, we reversed Brown\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The rationale of <em>Clinebell </em>and <em>Brown </em>is equally applicable here. In her proffered testimony, W acknowledged that the accounts listed in her journals were true and not fantasies. The journals, however, do not mention any sexual encounter with appellant. Appellant sought to show that her contemporaneous journal, while cataloguing numerous other sexual encounters, did not mention appellant\u2019s sexual contacts with her. Additionally, appellant argued that the contemporaneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>journal did not comport with W\u2019s statements to the police that she kept a detailed account of appellant\u2019s abuse. Therefore, the journal was necessary to impeach her trial testimony with her prior inconsistent statements. Similarly, the second journal <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> fails to mention appellant, even though it purports to list all those with whom W had sexual encounters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[t]he purpose of introducing the [journals] was to attack [W\u2019s] credibility,\u201d as to her specific allegations against appellant. <em>Clinebell, </em>235 Va. at 322, 368 S.E.2d at 264. Appellant sought \u201cto prove for impeachment purposes\u201d that W\u2019s journals are prior statements inconsistent with her trial testimony and with her statements to the police. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the journals were not offered to prove the kind of \u201csexual conduct\u201d prohibited by Code \u00a7 18.2-67.7. Under these circumstances, it was error to exclude the journals because while not admissible on the merits, they were proper impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">B. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The Commonwealth maintains that any error in excluding the journals was harmless in this case. We agree that excluding the journals for impeachment purposes was harmless.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">We must reverse a criminal conviction unless it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the error did not affect the verdict. An error does not affect the verdict if we can determine, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same. <em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 173, 190, 416 S.E.2d 14, 24 (1992) (citing Code \u00a7 8.01-678; <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>A reviewing court must take into account the burden of proof applied at trial when evaluating the impact of an error upon a verdict. To the extent that the impact of an error on a verdict is affected by the burden of proof, in a criminal case, the reviewing court must consider that the fact finder was required to reach its verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\"><em>Lavinder, 12 </em>Va.App. at 1006, 407 S.E.2d at 911 (internal quotations omitted). \u201cThe effect of an error on a verdict varies widely depending upon the circumstances of the case. Each case must, therefore, be analyzed individually to determine if an error has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1009, 407 S.E.2d at 913 (internal citations and quotations omitted). \u201cIn criminal cases, the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a constitutional requirement of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1007, 407 S.E.2d at 912. Thus, the error is harmless only if we can say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The trial court, the fact finder in this case, had overwhelming evidence before it to support the convictions. The testimony of the two child victims was buttressed by appellant\u2019s own admissions about his sexual contacts with them. Appellant admitted to police that he allowed W to be in the bed when he and his wife had sex and that he had watched W perform oral sex on her boyfriend. Such admissions establish a sexual relationship between himself and his stepdaughter. Additionally, the victims\u2019 brother corroborated and detailed the offenses when he testified that he viewed a videotape in which his sister engaged in fellatio with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Furthermore, the trial court explicitly stated on the record, \u201cthat though the court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s motion with respect to [the journals], I reviewed that carefully and I\u2019m aware of it\u201d and \u201chad [the journals] been considered as part of the evidence in the case, it wouldn\u2019t have caused me to change my mind or to rule any differently.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, we can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>say, beyond a reasonable doubt and without usurping the fact finding function, that the verdict would have been the same had the journals been introduced into evidence. Accordingly, while it was error to exclude the journals, under the facts of this case, we find the error to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">III. Vindictiveness on Retrial</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Next, appellant contends that it was error for the trial court to impose a harsher sentence at his second trial after his successful appeal. Appellant asserts that allowing the trial court to impose a greater sentence on remand would have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on appeals. Appellant relies on <em>North Carolina v. </em>Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), for the proposition that a harsher sentence indicates \u201cvindictiveness\u201d on the part of the trial judge because there were no subsequent convictions or bad conduct that would justify the increased sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u201c\u00a1V]indictiveness, manifesting itself in the form of increased sentences upon conviction after retrial, can have no place in the resentencing process.\u201d <em>Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 24, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 1981, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYe\">Due process of law ... requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such vindictiveness may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. And the factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 725-26, 89 S.Ct. at 2080-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The presumption outlined in <em>Pearce </em>has since been \u201crestricted ... to areas where its objectives are thought most efficaciously served. Accordingly, in each case, we look to the need, under the circumstances, to guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process.\u201d <em>Texas v. McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 138, 106 S.Ct. 976, 979, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986) (internal citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 799, 109 S.Ct. 2201, 2204, 104 L.Ed.2d 865 (1989) (\u201cWhile the <em>Pearce </em>opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness does not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.\u201d). <em>\u201cPearce </em>did not turn simply on the fact of conviction, appeal, reversal, reconviction, and a greater sentence.\u201d <em>Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 116, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1960, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972); <em>see also Smith, </em>490 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. at 2204-05.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u201cBeyond doubt, vindictiveness of a sentencing judge is the evil the Court sought to prevent rather than simply enlarged sentences after a new trial. The <em>Pearce </em>requirements thus do not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>475 U.S. at 138, 106 S.Ct. at 978. For example, \u201c[t]he presumption of <em>Pearce </em>does not apply in situations where the possibility of vindictiveness is ... speculative, particularly since the presumption may often operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus block a legitimate response to criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 139, 106 S.Ct. at 979. \u201cThe presumption is also inapplicable [where] different sentences assessed the varying sentences\u201d imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 979. This is true because the judge imposing the second sentence has \u201cno personal stake in the prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>and no motivation to engage in self-vindication.\u201d <em>Chaffin, </em>412 U.S. at 27, 93 S.Ct. at 1983. Thus, in cases \u201c[w]here there is no ... reasonable likelihood [of vindictiveness], the burden remains upon the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>490 U.S. at 799, 109 S.Ct. at 2205.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">No Virginia case has yet addressed the question of applying the <em>Pearce </em>presumption to situations where different sentencing judges are involved. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has made clear that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption does not apply in cases where the jury has imposed sentence. <em>See Chaffin, </em>412 U.S. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1977. The fact that appellant elected to have a new trial judge hear the evidence and impose sentence should not put appellant in a better position than he would have been had he exercised his right to a jury trial. Moreover, the weight of authority is that \u201cno presumption of vindictiveness is present when the second sentence was delivered by a different judge and the record indicates nonvindictive reasons supporting the harsher sentence.\u201d <em>Macomber v. Hannigan, </em>15 F.3d 155, 156 (10th Cir.1994). <em>See also United States v. Newman, </em>6 F.3d 623, 630 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cwhen second sentencing judge provides an on the record, wholly logical, non-vindictive reason for the sentence, the requirements of <em>Pearce </em>are met, particularly since trial judges must be accorded broad discretion in sentencing\u201d (internal citations and quotations omitted)); <em>United States v. Cheek, </em>3 F.3d 1057, 1064 (7th Cir.1993) (\u201cthe presumption of vindictiveness is not present when a different judge imposes the second sentence\u201d); <em>Rock v. Zimmerman, </em>959 F.2d 1237, 1257 (3d Cir.1992) (\u201cthe <em>Pearce </em>presumption does not apply where the second sentence is imposed by a different sentencer and the record provides affirmative assurance that the harsher sentence reflects simply a fresh look at the facts and an independent exercise of discretion\u201d); <em>United States v. Perez, </em>904 F.2d 142, 146 (2d Cir.1990) <em>(Pearce </em>presumption does not apply in situations where the possibility of vindictiveness is speculative); <em>State v. Faria, </em>254 Conn. 613, 758 A.2d 348 (2000) (no presumption of vindictiveness when second sentence imposed by a different judge); <em>State v. Robbins, </em>123 Idaho 527, 850 P.2d 176 (1993) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>(no reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness where different judge imposes sentence); <em>State v. Macomber, </em>244 Kan. 396, 769 P.2d 621 (1989) (\u201cno presumption of vindictiveness arises where original judge does not pronounce sentence after the second conviction\u201d); <em>Bush v. State, </em>667 So.2d 26 (Miss.1996) (no presumption of vindictiveness where there are two different sentencers); <em>New Hampshire v. Hurlburt, </em>135 N.H. 143, 603 A.2d 493, 496 (1991) (\u201cWe decline to find that there exists a \u2018reasonable likelihood\u2019 that a sentencing judge who was not involved in the first trial would increase the sentence for the sake of vindicating a fellow judge.\u201d); <em>Graham v. State, </em>681 So.2d 1178 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996) (no presumption of vindictiveness where second sentence not imposed by same judge who imposed original sentence); <em>State v. Starr, </em>998 S.W.2d 61, 70 (Mo.Ct.App.1999) (\u201cwhen a second, different judge imposes a harsher sentence, we do not see the necessity in applying a prophylactic rule because there is little reason for the second judge to be vindictive since he or she did not preside at the first trial\u201d); <em>Davila v. State, </em>871 S.W.2d 806 (Tex.App.1994) (fact that different judge tried case on remand sufficient to overcome presumption of vindictiveness). We adopt the majority view and hold that there is no presumption of vindictiveness when a different judge imposes the sentence and the record shows a nonvindictive reason for the sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In the instant case, a different trial judge heard the evidence on remand and imposed the new sentence. Accordingly the <em>Pearce </em>presumption does not apply. The trial court was unaware of the parameters of the original sentence. \u201cThe first prerequisite for the imposition of a retaliatory penalty is knowledge of the prior sentence.\u201d <em>Chaffin, </em>412 U.S. at 26, 93 S.Ct. at 1982. When appellant raised the issue of vindictiveness, the trial court stated, \u201cI knew generally, not the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>number of years, but I had a general idea of the range of punishment that had been previously imposed but did not know the specific counts.\u201d This statement is borne out by the colloquy between the trial court and defense counsel regarding the disparity between the original sentences and that imposed by the trial court. Because the trial court was unaware of the specifics of the original sentence and had no personal stake in the outcome, no vindictiveness has been shown.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The record further demonstrates that the sentence before us reflects \u201ca fresh look at the facts and an independent exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Rock, </em>959 F.2d at 1257. Indeed, the trial court dismissed one count of forcible sodomy for which appellant was originally convicted because it found insufficient evidence to support that charge. This demonstrates that the trial court considered only the evidence before it without reference to the prior trial or convictions. As the trial court observed, \u201cI obviously did not hear the evidence when the case was before Judge Shelton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Lastly, appellant voluntarily waived his right to be tried by a jury and elected to have the trial court determine his guilt or innocence and impose sentence if he was convicted. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>McCullough, </em>\u201c[tjhere can hardly be more emphatic affirmation of [appellant\u2019s] appraisal of [the trial court\u2019s] fairness than this choice.\u201d 475 U.S. at 139, 106 S.Ct. at 979. Appellant also agreed that there was no need for a new presentence report; although updated victim impact statements were submitted to the trial court. Under these circumstances, \u201cthere was no realistic motive for vindictive sentencing\u201d and, therefore, the <em>Pearce </em>presumption is inapplicable. <em>Id.; see also Perez, </em>904 F.2d 142 (same). Rather than having any vindictive motive, \u201cthe sentence was arrived at after consideration of the evidence.\u201d Specifically, \u201cthe Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>is persuaded that Mr. Cairns is a sexual predator against whom society\u2019s only remedy is to segregate him from the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Finally, the trial court stated \u201can on-the-record, wholly logical, nonvindictive reason for the sentence\u201d it imposed. <em>McCullough, </em>475 U.S. at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 980. The record reveals that the trial court \u201cfocused on the gravity of the offense and the objectives of criminal sentencing\u201d in imposing the second sentence. <em>Robbins, </em>850 P.2d at 180. The trial court explained the sentence to appellant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">Your conduct demonstrates an unthinkable depravity of mind, a willingness to harm others in order to satisfy some twisted personal gratification, and that involves your own children and is a violation of the ultimate trust they place in you, and that makes it even more horrific.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">It\u2019s the court\u2019s duty in such a circumstance to impose appropriate punishment, and to protect the community, to the extent we can, from repetition of such behavior. The only tool available to the court in this circumstance I think is to segregate you from society, and I think the aggravated nature of these acts compels [the sentence imposed].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">This explanation does not bespeak a vindictive motive. Rather, it demonstrates a focus on the offenses and an exercise of sentencing discretion permitted to a sentencing judge, even on retrial. <em>See Wasman v. United States, 468 </em>U.S. 559, 568, 104 S.Ct. 3217, 3220, 82 L.Ed.2d 424 (1984) (\u201ca judge ... is to be accorded very wide discretion in determining an appropriate sentence\u201d). We hold the trial court did not err in imposing its sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">IV. Failure to Prove Force, Threat or Intimidation</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">Appellant next contends that the Commonwealth failed to prove the requisite element of force, threat or intimidation in the sodomy and rape counts of W. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u201cThe judgment of a trial court sitting without a jury is entitled to the same weight as a jury verdict and will not be set aside unless it appears from the evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>judgment is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>30 Va.App. 153, 163, 515 S.E.2d 808, 813 (1999).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">An accused shall be guilty of forcible sodomy if he or she engages in cunnilingus, fellatio, anallingus, or anal intercourse with a complaining witness who is not his or her spouse, or causes a complaining witness, whether or not his or her spouse, to engage in such acts with any other person, and ... [t]he act is accomplished against the will of the complaining witness, by force, threat or intimidation of or against the complaining witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-67.KA).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">Intimidation requires putting a victim in fear of bodily harm by exercising such domination and control of her as to overcome her mind and overbear her will. Intimidation may be caused by the imposition of psychological pressure on one who, under the circumstances, is vulnerable and susceptible to such pressure. This fear of bodily harm must derive from some conduct or statement of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-h\"><em>Sabol v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 9, 18, 553 S.E.2d 533, 537 (2001) (internal citations and quotations omitted); <em>see also Sutton v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 654, 324 S.E.2d 665 (1985). Nevertheless \u201cproof that the victim feared some type of bodily harm other than the harm inherent in the sexual assault\u201d is not required. <em>Commonwealth v. Bower, </em>264 Va. 41, 46, 563 S.E.2d 736, 738 (2002). Instead \u201c[m]atters such as the victim\u2019s age, the relative size of the defendant and victim, the familial relationship between the defendant and victim, ... are relevant matters to be considered with other testimony when determining whether the victim was put in fear of bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt defies human experience to conclude that fear of the possibility of bodily injury caused by sexual assault is insufficient \u2018fear of bodily harm\u2019 for purposes of establishing sexual assault by intimidation.\u201d <em>Bower, </em>264 Va. at 45, 563 S.E.2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">When questioned on cross-examination about a lack of physical abuse or threat, W stated that appellant \u201cwas physi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>cally abusing me the whole time.\u201d She told appellant \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this\u201d but that \u201cfighting [appellant] didn\u2019t really seem like an option.... I knew he was more powerful than me ... if he was mad, I was afraid.\u201d As in <em>Bower, </em>the familial relationship between appellant and W is an important consideration. Appellant was the stepfather and father of the victims. However, unlike the victim in <em>Bower, </em>W could not rely on her mother for protection because she was a participant in the abuse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Furthermore, the trial court could properly consider the violent atmosphere appellant created in the home in its determination that W was \u201cintimidated\u201d into submitting to the abuse. W stated that appellant had a violent temper and she was afraid of him. While he was not physically abusive to her, W saw appellant punch her brother. The brother stated that, in W and N\u2019s presence, appellant \u201cpicked [him] up by the throat ... and threw [him] against the wall.\u201d Appellant had frequent angry outbursts that resulted in overturned furniture. W also saw appellant \u201cgrab\u201d her mother and threaten her. Credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the Commonwealth proved intimidation beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">V. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"Apv\">Lastly, appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. Appellant argues that there was no physical or medical evidence to support the girls\u2019 allegations and that the Commonwealth\u2019s case was conjectural at best. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u201cWhen reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence after a conviction, we consider that evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, and we affirm the conviction unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>Shackleford v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 196, 209, 547 S.E.2d 899, 906 (2001). \u201cThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight accorded the evidence are matters solely for the fact finder who has the opportunity to see and hear that evidence as it is presented.\u201d <em>Sandoval v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 138, 138, 455 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1995). Given the evidence adduced at trial, the trial court could reasonably find that appellant engaged in a pattern of sexual abuse of W and N beginning in February 1998 and continuing until Martin removed them from the home in October 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The evidence showed that W and appellant engaged in \u201coral sex\u201d in April and May of 1998 while her mother was at work. During a \u201cstrip poker\u201d game, W ran out of clothes and had to do \u201cfavors\u201d for appellant, which included \u201cput[ting] [appellant\u2019s] penis in [her] mouth\u201d and appellant \u201cput[ting] his penis in [W\u2019s] vagina.\u201d In the summer of 1998, W and N made videos at appellant\u2019s direction. These were termed a type of punishment and \u201cmy dad told us to get off our restriction, we had to make a movie for him.\u201d The videos detailed various instances of sexual abuse and at least one was seen by the victims\u2019 13-year-old brother. Although police did not find any videotapes with these encounters, appellant stated to the girls that he \u201csnowed them out\u201d after he watched them. The trial court believed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and disbelieved appellant\u2019s denials. Credible evidence supported the trial court\u2019s finding. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\">. This argument applies only to the convictions relating to W. The other victim, N, was 11 at the time of the abuse, and the Commonwealth did not have to prove the element of force, threat or intimidation as to N. See Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\">.

Appellant further contends that the Commonwealth opened the door for introducing the journals when it elicited testimony from W about prior sexual abuse by a third party and of oral sex with her boyfriend.

Thus, while instructive, the facts do not mirror those in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b326-8\">. The record is silent as to how the second journal came to light.

While the <em>Johnson </em>Court recognized the <em>Pearce </em>presumption of vindictiveness, it held that the presumption did not apply in <em>de novo </em>appeals to the circuit court. <em>See id. </em>This is the same rule die United States Supreme Court adopted in <em>Colten.

United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946),] harmless-error test\u201d for measuring error under Code \u00a7 8.01-678. <em>Clay v. Commonwealth, </em>262 Va. 253, 260, 546 S.E.2d 728, 732 (2001). Applying that test, the United States Supreme Court recently held that \u201cthe principle of <em>Kotteakos </em>[means] that when an error\u2019s natural effect is to prejudice substantial rights and the court is in grave doubt about the harmlessness of that error, the error must be treated as if it had a \u2018substantial and injurious effect\u2019 on the verdict.\u201d <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 U.S. 432, 444, 115 S.Ct. 992, 998, 130 L.Ed.2d 947 (1995) (citing <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764-65, 776, 66 S.Ct. at 1247-48, 1253). Moreover, when a trial error has been shown on direct appeal from a conviction, the government bears the burden of proving harmlessness under this standard. <em>See O\u2019Neal, </em>513 U.S. at 437, 115 S.Ct. at 995. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that \u201cerror will be presumed to be prejudicial unless it plainly appears that it could not have affected the result.\u201d <em>Caldwell v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 291, 296, 269 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Although I disagree with the majority opinion\u2019s characterization that \u201coverwhelming evidence ... supports] the convictions,\u201d I believe it is important to note, as the United States Supreme Court has observed, that an \u201cemphasis and perhaps overemphasis, upon the [concept] of \u2018overwhelming evidence,\u2019 \u201d has the effect of clouding the relevant question \u201c \u2018whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (footnote and citations omitted). Indeed, the principle is well established that a harmless error analysis is entirely distinct from a sufficiency of the evidence analysis. \u201cThe inquiry cannot be merely whether there was enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>support the result, apart from the phase affected by the error. It is rather, even so, whether the error itself had substantial influence. If so, or if one is left in grave doubt, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 765, 66 S.Ct. at 1248. Consistent with these principles, the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the ... verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed [evidence] may well have affected the ... decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v.

Truthfully, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">*:&lt; # <em>% </em># <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">[Detective]: Um, you and your wife have sex?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">[Cairns]: Um, do we?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">[Detective]: No, with [the older girl] in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-12\">[Cairns]: I ain\u2019t sayin\u2019 it might not have ever happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-13\">[Detective]: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">[Cairns]: I\u2019m sayin\u2019 the best what I can remember, I\u2019m not sure, so I won\u2019t answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">Cairns did admit, however, that he and his wife were in the room when the older girl \u201cperformed oral sex on her boyfriend,\u201d but he explained this is a lapse in judgment that occurred because he and his wife were intoxicated. Although Cairns\u2019s conduct in this instance was despicable, it was not one of the offenses charged and it pales in comparison to the charges in the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">Cairns claimed that the girls had a motive to fabricate their accusations and that he needed to introduce the journals to establish (1) the older girl was having sexual relations with a substantial number of people during the period at issue, (2) she explicitly described those sexual encounters and did not name Cairns in the journal as one of those sexual partners, (3) she was untruthful when she told a detective the journal would confirm her allegation, and (4) she had a cause to be angry and to fabricate her accusation after Cairns discovered five or six young men secretly visiting her bedroom late at night.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-18\">The evidence clearly proved Cairns and his wife acted inappropriately in the presence of their children and may have contributed to the older girl\u2019s sexually inappropriate conduct. The evidence that he committed the charged offenses, however, was based solely on the testimony of the children and was unconfirmed by any other evidence. Significantly, the girls did not dispute that Cairns \u201cgrounded\u201d them because five or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>six boys were in the girls\u2019 bedroom at night when all the family had retired to their beds for the night. Moreover, the journals tend to establish the truth of Cairns\u2019s claim that the girls entertained boys in the bedroom late at night and to provide a basis upon which a trier of fact might tend to credit Cairns\u2019s claim of a retaliatory motive by the girls.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The journals establish that by the time the older girl had reached the age of fourteen, she had engaged in various sex acts, including fellatio, cunnilingus, and sexual intercourse, on ninety-six different occasions with twenty-four partners, both male and female. Those journals mention her parents but do not identify them as engaging in any sexual activity with her. Indeed, one entry records the older girl\u2019s fear that her father would awaken in the night and discover her having sexual intercourse in her bedroom with a boy. The admission of the evidence could have had its intended effect of impeaching the testimony of the older girl and proving her complaint to be a fabrication. Thus, the evidence went to the heart of Cairns\u2019s defense and its exclusion prejudiced his right to cross-examine witnesses and to prove evidence in his defense. We cannot say its exclusion played no significant part in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u201c \u2018[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u2019 are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). Thus, we have held that \u201cin determining if an error is harmless, a reviewing court ... determines ... whether as a matter of law, this decision of the fact finder was affected by the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1006, 407 S.E.2d at 911. I believe this record proves as a matter of law that the judge\u2019s decision was affected by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Furthermore, I disagree that the trial judge ruled, as a matter of fact, that the guilty verdict would have been the same if the excluded \u25a0 evidence had been admitted. At the sentencing hearing, when the issue before the judge was the appropriate sentence to impose, Cairns\u2019s attorney argued that the evidence did not prove aggravating circumstances of force and that the journals indicated in mitigation that the older girl <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>\u201chas had significant sexual contact.\u201d In that context and in response to this argument, the trial judge reminded Cairns\u2019s attorney that the journals had been ruled inadmissible and \u201cthat had it been considered as part of the evidence in the case, it wouldn\u2019t have caused me to change my mind or rule any differently.\u201d Because this discussion concerned the issue of sentencing, Cairns\u2019s attorney reminded the judge that \u201cthe court has received victim impact statements which address exactly that.\u201d In short, the judge\u2019s comment, which was made at sentencing and in response to the argument that the older girl\u2019s conduct was a mitigating factor, should not be construed to suggest that the trial judge was commenting upon the impact the excluded evidence potentially might have had at the guilt phase of the trial. Viewed in the context of the discussion about sentencing factors, the judge was not suggesting that the guilt verdict would have been the same if the improperly excluded evidence had been admitted at the guilt phase and had had its proffered effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The exclusion of the journals affects a substantial credibility determination and belies the majority\u2019s determination that the exclusion was harmless. A trier of fact might normally be inclined to disbelieve a fourteen-year-old child would have an independent basis to be familiar with fellatio, cunnilingus, and sexual intercourse as described in her testimony and, as a consequence, to disbelieve she could have fabricated the detailed sexual activities she says her parents committed upon her. Moreover, it is not unreasonable to believe that a trier of fact, after learning of the child\u2019s ninety-four episodes of prior sexual contact with twenty-four different partners, might have concluded as a matter of fact that the girl\u2019s own conduct tended to render her less susceptible to intimidation. The erroneous exclusion of this evidence also substantially negated Cairns\u2019s ability to prove his claim of fabrication. Thus, the exclusion raises a grave concern .that the probative value the trier of fact gave the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence would have been qualitatively diminished if the journals had been admitted. This error was not insignificant; it had a \u201csubstantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and injurious effect\u201d on the trier of fact\u2019s credibility determination and verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">While other evidence amply supports the verdicts, \u201c[ojther evidence of a disputed fact, standing alone, does not establish that an error is harmless.\u201d <em>Hooker, </em>14 Va.App. at 458, 418 S.E.2d at 345. I would hold, as a matter of law, the disputed evidence affected the trier of fact\u2019s credibility decisions and, thus, the verdicts. Accordingly, I conclude that the error in excluding evidence was prejudicial to Cairns and not harmless.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">I also dissent from Part III of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The United States Supreme Court announced a prophylactic rule in <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969), that \u201cplaced a limitation on the power of a sentencing authority to increase a sentence after reconviction following a new trial.\u201d <em>Texas v. McCullough, </em>475 U.S. 134, 137, 106 S.Ct. 976, 978, 89 L.Ed.2d 104 (1986). The Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">Due process of law ... requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial. And since the fear of such vindictiveness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>may unconstitutionally deter a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to appeal or collaterally attack his first conviction, due process also requires that a defendant be freed of apprehension of such a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that <em>whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for his doing so must affirmatively appear. Those reasons must be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing proceeding. </em>And the factual data upon which the increased sentence is based must be made part of the record, so that the constitutional legitimacy of the increased sentence may be fully reviewed on appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 725-26, 89 S.Ct. at 2080-81 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">This ruling clearly denotes that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption \u201coperate[s] in the absence of any proof of improper motive.\u201d <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S. 368, 373, 102 S.Ct. 2485, 2488, 73 L.Ed.2d 74 (1982). Moreover, the Supreme Court has ruled that \u201cthe reach of <em>Pearce </em>is best captured by [its] statement in <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>457 U.S., at 374[, 102 S.Ct., at 2489] ... [that,] \u2018[i]n sum, the Court [in <em>Pearce </em>] applied a presumption of vindictiveness, which may be overcome only by objective information ... justifying the increased sentence.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCullough, </em>475 U.S. at 142, 106 S.Ct. at 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Pearce. </em>In <em>McCullough, </em>the Supreme Court explained that \u201c[t]he facts of this case provide no basis for a presumption of vindictiveness.\u201d 475 U.S. at 138, 106 S.Ct. at 979. There, the retrial occurred because the trial judge who presided at the initial jury trial \u201cgranted McCullough\u2019s motion for a new trial on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d 475 U.S. at 136, 106 S.Ct. at 977. In imposing a higher sentence on retrial than the twenty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>fixed by the jury at the first trial, the judge \u201cfound that ... she relied on new evidence about the murder that was not presented at the first trial and hence never made known to the sentencing jury [at the first trial].\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the judge \u201cexplained that she learned for the first time on retrial McCullough had been released from prison only four months before the later crime had been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In view of this record, the Supreme Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">In contrast to <em>Pearce, </em>McCullough\u2019s second trial came about because the trial judge herself concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct required it. Granting McCullough\u2019s motion for a new trial hardly suggests any vindictiveness on the part of the judge towards him. \u201c[U]nlike the judge who has been reversed,\u201d the trial judge here had \u201cno motivation to engage in self-vindication.\u201d In such circumstances, there is also no justifiable concern about \u201cinstitutional interests that might occasion higher sentences by a judge desirous of discouraging what he regards as meritless appeals.\u201d In granting McCullough\u2019s new trial motion, [the trial judge] went on record as agreeing that his \u201cclaims\u201d had merit. Presuming vindictiveness on this basis alone would be tantamount to presuming that a judge will be vindictive towards a defendant merely because he seeks an acquittal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 138-39, 106 S.Ct. at 979 (citations omitted). In short, based on the record in <em>McCullough, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cnot even \u2018apprehension of ... a retaliatory motivation on the part of the sentencing judge\u2019 could be present.\u201d 475 U.S. at 139, 106 S.Ct. at 979 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Significantly, the Court also ruled that \u201cthe second sentencer provide[d] an on-the-record, wholly logical, nonvindictive reason for the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 980. Indeed, the resentencing judge \u201cmade findings of fact as to why the sentence was longer ... [and] found that ... she relied on new evidence ... that was not presented at the first trial.\u201d 475 U.S. at 136, 106 S.Ct. at 977-78. Noting these circumstances, the Supreme Court \u201cread <em>Pearce </em>to require no more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 980. The Court held \u201cthat the careful explanation by the trial judge for the sentence imposed [in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>McCullough </em>] fits well within [its] prior holdings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 106 S.Ct. at 981.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Supreme Court, thus, has indicated in <em>McCullough </em>and its other decisions since <em>Pearce </em>that, \u201cin each case, we [must] look to the need, under the circumstances, to \u2018guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCullough, 475 </em>U.S. at 138, 106 S.Ct. at 979 (citation omitted). For example, the Court has analyzed the circumstances and the need to guard against vindictiveness when a jury resentences following a new trial. <em>See Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, </em>412 U.S. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973). There, the Court pointed to at least two circumstances that do not exist when a jury sentences. First, the jury typically is unaware of the prior sentence, which is the \u201cfirst prerequisite for the imposition of a retaliatory penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 93 S.Ct. at 1982. Second, the jury \u201cis unlikely to be sensitive to the institutional interests that might occasion higher sentences by a judge desirous of discouraging ... meritless appeals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 93 S.Ct. at 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">I believe Cairns\u2019s case is one that presents circumstances \u201cwhere [the <em>Pearce </em>] \u2018objectives are ... most efficaciously served.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCullough, 475 </em>U.S. at 138, 106 S.Ct. at 979. The sentence was dramatically increased by the trial judge following the second trial. Although the sentencing judge noted that he was basing his sentence on Cairns\u2019s egregious conduct, the record indicates the evidence at the second trial was not substantially different than the evidence at the first trial. Moreover, the trial judge acknowledged that the sentence he imposed was not based on new information concerning conduct after the first trial. Thus, this case is dramatically different than <em>McCullough, </em>where \u201cthe second sentencer provide[d] an on-the-record, wholly logical nonvindictive reason for the sentence.\u201d 475 U.S. at 140, 106 S.Ct. at 980. <em>See also Macomber v. Hannigan, </em>15 F.3d 155, 156 (10th Cir.1994) (noting that several federal \u201ccircuits have determined that no presumption' of vindictiveness is present when the second sentence was delivered by a different judge and the record indicates nonvindictive reasons supporting the harsher sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>The record indicates that, when the trial judge sentenced Cairns, he \u201carrived at the sentences based on what [he] thought was the appropriate disposition in each of those cases.\u201d The judge, however, was aware of the previous reversal and had some knowledge of the prior sentence. He \u201cknew generally, not the specific number of years, but ... had a general idea of the range of punishment imposed but did not know the specific counts.\u201d Indeed, the record reflects that the sentences contain some stark similarities. Both judges imposed a fifty-year sentence for the rape conviction, which has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment. Code \u00a7 18.2-61. Unlike the first judge, who suspended thirty years of the rape sentence, the resentencing judge suspended none. Both judges imposed an active sentence of ten years on each of the sodomy convictions, which also has a statutory maximum of life imprisonment for each conviction. Code \u00a7 18.2-67.1. Based on different sentences, both judges imposed no active sentence for the pornography offense, which has a statutory maximum of ten years imprisonment. The two sentences appear to reflect a similar methodology. The increase in the sentence on retrial, however, is unexplained.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">It bears repeating, as the Court explained in Pearce, that the due process concern requires the \u201cdefendant be freed of apprehension of ... a retaliatory motivation\u201d by an affirmative showing on the record of objective information to explain the increased sentence. 395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081. In this case, the institutional interests that might intrude on a judge\u2019s resentencing after a successful appeal remain unnegated and the due process concern expressed in <em>Pearce </em>is unsatisfied. Therefore, I would hold that the <em>Pearce </em>presumption applies in this case and that the record does not rebut it. The record contains no \u201cobjective information\u201d to justify the increased sentence \u201cbeyond the naked power to impose it.\u201d 395 U.S. at 726, 89 S.Ct. at 2081.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">For these reasons, I would reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b342-10\">. The exclusion, of this evidence also could be said to violate Cairns\u2019s right to confront a witness against him as protected by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. \"[A] major reason underlying the constitutional confrontation rule is to give a defendant charged with crime an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 406-07, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1069, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). As the United States Supreme Court has noted, a trial error may \"rise to the level of a constitutional violation ... if it results in a prejudice so great as to deny a defendant his Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Lane, </em>474 U.S. 438, 446 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 725, 730 n. 8, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Because, in my view, the Commonwealth cannot even establish the lower standard of harmless error under the <em>Kotteakos </em>analysis, I do not address the more onerous standard required by <em>Chapman </em>for constitutional error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
