Pound appeals a judgment of the trial court, finding him ineligible to receive benefits pursuant to the Virginia Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Officer\u2019s Retirement System (\u201cVaLORS\u201d), Code \u00a7 51.1-211 <em>et seq. </em>Pound contends that his status as a \u201cspecial game warden\u201d was sufficient to place him within the relevant provisions of Title 51.1, which create and govern VaLORS. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Pound began work for the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries in November of 1971, as a wildlife biologist. In that role, Pound was responsible for various tasks, including maintaining certain fish and wildlife populations and analyzing biological data.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">On February 11, 1972, Pound was appointed as a \u201cspecial game warden\u201d by the former Director of the DGIF. As evidence of his appointment, Pound was given a certificate stating that he was thereby commissioned as a special game warden, with statewide authority, \u201cso long as [he was] employed\u201d by DGIF. Pound was also given another certificate, stating that he had taken the oath required of such officers, and a \u201cwallet-sized\u201d identification card stating that he was \u201ca qualified Special Game Warden\u201d and that his \u201cauthority\u201d as such would expire \u201cwith termination of employment.\u201d Accordingly, Pound\u2019s employment duties increased with his new \u201cappointment,\u201d permitting him to carry a firearm and to enforce the hunting and fishing laws of the State of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">During the years that followed, Pound and other special game wardens were directed by their supervisors to cease their law enforcement activities for various periods of time, while DGIF reviewed various training and certification requirements. After each occasion, the special game wardens were told to resume their law enforcement activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In May of 1991, however, Pound received a memorandum from Gary Spiers, his regional manager, which stated as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">[Effective immediately you are no longer <em>authorized </em>to perform the duties of a Special Game Warden. Your Job Description and performance Planning and Evaluation form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>will both be revised to reflect this change in work tasks and duties and performance expectations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">(Emphasis added). Pound acknowledged that Spiers gave him the memorandum during a face-to-face meeting and explained to him that DGIF was \u201clooking at doing away with some of the law enforcement activities on national forest property, and that\u2019s why they had chose [sic] to do away with [his] appointment at that time.\u201d Pound further acknowledged that Spiers collected all of the DGIF \u201claw enforcement equipment\u201d that had been issued to him, in addition to his special game warden identification card. Subsequently, in 1994, DGIF \u201cdiscontinued the special game warden appointments for [all other DGIF] employees due to the costs in time and money that would be required for these part-time officers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Nevertheless, after that time, Pound and other employees who had acted as former special game wardens, were asked, on occasion, by DGIF to aid the regular game wardens in enforcement activities. The individuals were also directed to report any violations they observed to the regular game wardens for further investigation. In addition, DGIF reissued pistols to those individuals who had formerly acted as special game wardens, including Pound, and set up a program that would allow those individuals the option of purchasing their pistol upon retirement. However, in issuing the pistols to the \u201cfiled personnel\u201d DGIF emphasized that the pistols were issued for \u201cnon-law enforcement activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In 1999, the General Assembly passed VaLORS (which became effective on October 1,1999), which provides enhanced retirement benefits for certain \u201claw officers.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 51.1-211 <em>et seq. </em>After its enactment, Pound, who was still employed with DGIF as a Wildlife Biologist Assistant, requested to be included in the VaLORS retirement plan arguing that because he was a special game warden, he was an \u201cemployee,\u201d as defined by the legislation governing VaLORS. DGIF denied Pound\u2019s request, contending that his status as a special game warden did not bring him within the meaning of \u201cemployee\u201d pursuant to the VaLORS enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Pound ultimately appealed DGIF\u2019s denial and received a hearing, pursuant to the State Grievance Procedure, before the Department of Employment Dispute Resolution. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 2.2-3001 <em>et seq. </em>After a hearing on the merits, the hearing officer found that Pound was not entitled to benefits under VaLORS as a special game warden. Specifically, the hearing officer found that Pound was a \u201cSpecial Game Warden\u201d \u201cin title only and not in substance.\u201d Further, the hearing officer held that based upon the title of the statutory enactment, as well as its language, the legislative intent of the Act was that it apply only to individuals whose job duties require them to enforce criminal or quasi-criminal laws. Thus, because the hearing officer found that Pound\u2019s position at the time of VaLORS\u2019 enactment required no such duties, nor gave him any such authority, he did not fall within the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d as stated by VaLORS and envisioned by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Pound appealed the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court of Bath County, pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-3006(B). After hearing arguments on the issue and reviewing legal memoranda filed by each party, the trial court affirmed the decision of the hearing officer, finding that \u201cbecause [Pound] was not authorized to engage in law enforcement activities on October 1, 1999, the effective date of VaLORS[,] ... [Pound] is not covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On appeal, Pound contends the trial court erred in affirming the decision of the hearing officer, finding that he was not entitled to benefits pursuant to VaLORS. Specifically, Pound argues that he retained his status as a special game warden even after he was directed by his supervisor to discontinue his law enforcement duties and that accordingly he is an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of VaLORS because he is a \u201cgame warden\u201d as defined by the VaLORS plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">We first note that in conjunction with the Virginia Personnel Act, Code \u00a7 2.2-2900 <em>et seq, </em>the General Assembly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>established a system for handling state employee complaints arising in the workplace by enacting the State Grievance Procedure. Code \u00a7 2.2-3000 <em>et seq.; Virginia Dept. of Envtl. Quality v. Wright, </em>256 Va. 236, 238, 504 S.E.2d 862, 862-63 (1998). Pursuant to Code \u00a7 2.2-3006 of that statutory scheme, a party may appeal a final decision to the appropriate circuit court \u201con the grounds that the determination is contradictory to law.\u201d After a hearing of the appeal \u201con the record,\u201d the court may \u201caffirm the decision or may reverse or modify the decision.\u201d Code \u00a7 2.2-3006. Such determinations of the circuit court may be appealed to this Court, pursuant to Code \u00a7 17.1-405(1), granting any aggrieved party the ability to appeal \u201c[a]ny final decision of a circuit court on appeal from ... a grievance hearing decision issued pursuant to \u00a7 2.2-3005.\u201d Code \u00a7 17.1-405(1). Thus, because the General Assembly granted to the circuit courts only the authority to consider whether the final determination of the hearing officer is \u201ccontrary to law,\u201d we are likewise limited to such review in considering whether the trial court erred in its determination. <em>See Virginia Department of State Police v. Barton, </em>39 Va.App. 439, 573 S.E.2d 319 (2002); <em>see also Shuler v. Virginia Employment Commission, </em>14 Va.App. 1013, 1016-17, 420 S.E.2d 257, 259 (1992) (holding that where statutory language plainly provides the process governing judicial review of determinations, VAPA does not govern such review). \u201cWe review ... statutory interpretations and legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d Rollins v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 73, 79, 554 S.E.2d 99, 102 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The General Assembly created VaLORS in 1999 and ordered that it become effective as of October 1, 1999. <em>See </em>1999 Va. Acts, ch. 585. Code \u00a7 51.1-217(B), as enacted by the legislature, provided for a retirement allowance of $8,952 per annum (until the \u201cmember\u2019s\u201d 65th birthday), payable in addition to the \u201cmember\u2019s\u201d normal retirement benefits. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>However, to qualify as a \u201cmember\u201d of VaLORs, the statute requires \u201cmembership in the Retirement System.\u201d Code \u00a7 51.1-212. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-213, \u201cMembership in the Retirement System [is] compulsory for all employees.\u201d As used in Chapter 2.1 of Title 51.1, \u201c[e]mployee\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-4\">means any (i) member of the Capitol Police Force as described in \u00a7 30-34.2:1, (ii) campus police officer appointed under the provisions of Chapter 17 (\u00a7 23-232 et seq.) of Title 23, <em>(in) game warden in the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries appointed under the provisions of Chapter 2 (\u00a7 29.1-200 et seq.) of Title 29.1, </em>(iv) special agent of the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control appointed under the provisions of Chapter 1 (\u00a7 4.1-100 et seq.), (v) law-enforcement officer employed by the Virginia Marine Resources Commission as described in \u00a7 9.1-101, (vi) correctional officer as the term is defined in \u00a7 53.1-1, and including correctional officers employed at a juvenile correction facility as the term is defined in \u00a7 66-25.3, (vii) any parole officer appointed pursuant to \u00a7 53.1-143, and (viii) any commercial vehicle enforcement officer employed by the Department of State Police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Code \u00a7 51.1-212 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Code \u00a7 29.1-200(A) provides the Director of the DGIF with the authority to \u201cappoint regular and special game wardens as <em>he may deem necessary to enforce the game and inland fish laws.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Code \u00a7 29.1-205 provides as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">All game wardens are vested with the authority, upon displaying a badge or other credential of office, to issue a summons or to arrest any person found in the act of violating any of the provisions of the hunting, trapping, inland fish and boating laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\"><em>Regular game wardens </em>are vested with the same authority as sheriffs and other law-enforcement officers to enforce all of the criminal laws of the Commonwealth. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Any <em>special game warden </em>shall have general police power while performing his duty on properties owned or controlled by the Board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Pound argues that because Code \u00a7 51.1-212 uses the term \u201cgame warden,\u201d versus \u201cregular game warden\u201d or \u201cspecial game warden\u201d as distinguished in Code \u00a7 29.1-205, the General Assembly clearly intended the term to apply to any \u201cgame warden\u201d appointed pursuant to Chapter 2 of Title 29.1. Accordingly, as Pound contends he was still a special game warden at the time of the enactment of the statute, he argues he falls within the definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d under VaLORS.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We agree with Pound\u2019s contention that the language of Code \u00a7 51.1-212, and its related counterparts, is unambiguous and thus, there is no need to resort to statutory construction. <em>See City of Richmond v. Confrere Club, </em>239 Va. 77, 80, 387 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1990) (\u201c[W]hen a statute is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning must be accepted without resort to extrinsic evidence or to the rules of construction. Legislative intent is determined from the plain meaning of the words used.\u201d). Indeed, the phrase \u201cany\u201d \u201cgame warden,\u201d as used in the statute is neither \u201cdifficult to comprehend, of doubtful import, [n]or lacking in clearness and definiteness.\u201d <em>County of Augusta Jail v. Cook, </em>16 Va.App. 247, 252, 430 S.E.2d 546, 549 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">However, we disagree with Pound\u2019s contention that his particular status as a \u201cspecial game warden\u201d brought him within the parameters of the statute. Pursuant to the requisite standard of review here, we are bound by the hearing officer\u2019s factual determination that Pound was a \u201cspecial game warden\u201d in \u201ctitle only\u201d at the time VaLORS was enacted. Nevertheless, Pound conceded during the hearing on his grievance that in May of 1991, DGIF effectively revoked (or \u201c[did] away with\u201d) his authority to \u201cenforce the game and inland fish laws,\u201d of Virginia. Code \u00a7 29.1-200. Indeed, Pound\u2019s regional manager, acting on behalf of his employer, the Director of DGIF, provided Pound with a written memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>randum stating that he was \u201cno longer <em>authorized </em>to perform\u201d such duties and told him that DGIF had chosen to \u201cdo away\u201d with his \u201cappointment\u201d to perform such duties at that time. Furthermore, the regional manager collected items Pound possessed as indicia of any such authority, including his gun, his badge and his special game warden identification card. Thus, as the hearing officer recognized, after May of 1991, Pound had no power to act as either a \u201cgame warden\u201d and/or a \u201cspecial game warden,\u201d pursuant to the authority and duties set forth in Code \u00a7 29.1-205.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, Pound\u2019s job duties, performance plans and performance evaluations were specifically amended by DGIF to reflect this change.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">As stated above, Code \u00a7 29.1-200, governing the appointment of special game wardens, gives the Director of the DGIF the authority to appoint \u201cspecial game wardens ... to enforce the game and inland fish laws,\u201d of Virginia. It does not permit the Director to appoint special game wardens for other purposes, nor does it permit the Director to maintain appointments for other purposes. Accordingly, the reference in Code \u00a7 51.1-212 of VaLORS to \u201cany\u201d \u201cgame warden in the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries appointed under the provisions of Chapter 2 (\u00a7 29.1-200 et seq.) of Title 29.1,\u201d clearly dictates that only \u201cspecial game wardens\u201d with law enforcement duties and authority, fall within the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d within the context of VaLORS.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">This is markedly contrary to the situation reflected in <em>County of Augusta Jail v. Cook, </em>as relied upon by Pound. <em>Cook, </em>16 Va.App. at 252-53, 430 S.E.2d at 549. In <em>Cook, </em>we found that no language in Code \u00a7 65.2-402, the statute pertaining to presumptions of compensability for specified conditions incurred by those engaged in certain occupations, \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>pressly or impliedly limit[ed] its application to deputy sheriffs who [were] primarily law-enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, regardless of whether Pound retained the title of \u201cspecial game warden\u201d at the time VaLORS was enacted, his title as such did not operate to bring him within the definition of an \u201cemployee\u201d under VaLORS.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The Supreme Court of Virginia has consistently held that statutes \u201cmust be given a rational interpretation consistent with [their] purposes, and not one which will substantially defeat [their] objectives.\u201d <em>City of Chesapeake v. Gardner Enterprises, </em>253 Va. 243, 247, 482 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1997) (citing <em>Mayor v. Industrial Dev. Auth., </em>221 Va. 865, 869, 275 S.E.2d 888, 890 (1981); <em>Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Lassiter, </em>193 Va. 360, 364, 68 S.E.2d 641, 643 (1952)); <em>see also Tabb v. Commonwealth, </em>98 Va. 47, 56-57, 34 S.E. 946, 949 (1900) (\u201cA provision of a section of a statute ought not to receive a mere literal interpretation, when it would contravene the intention of the Legislature apparent from the other sections and provisions thereof, but the words are to be expanded or qualified to effectuate the intention.\u201d). Consistent with this policy, we find that the Act governing VaLORS, by its plain language, clearly evinces the legislature\u2019s intent that it apply only to those \u201cgame wardens\u201d described as \u201cemployees\u201d pursuant to Code \u00a7 51.1-212, who are cloaked with both the authority, and the duty, to enforce the game and inland fish laws of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">As found by the hearing officer, the record here demonstrates that since May of 1991, Pound has had no authority to enforce any such laws, nor has the enforcement of such laws been a part of his regular duties in his capacity as a wildlife biologist with DGIF. Therefore, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment, determining that the hearing officer\u2019s decision, denying Pound\u2019s request for benefits pursuant to VaLORS was not \u201ccontradictory to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\">. The additional allowance amount has been adjusted by the Board of Trustees of the Virginia Retirement System, pursuant to the direction of the legislature, and is currently $9,264.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b107-6\">. Indeed, even though DGIF subsequently directed Pound, and others who had acted as special game wardens prior to 1994, to assist regular game wardens in law enforcement on an occasional basis and/or to report any violations observed, Pound and the others were given the directive to do so only in conjunction with the regular game wardens, who possessed the requisite power and authority to enforce the game and inland fish laws of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
