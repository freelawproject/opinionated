J.

Defendant contends that the trial court\u2019s determination in that regard violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution under the principles enunciated in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000). The state cross-appeals, assigning error to the court\u2019s imposition of concurrent sentences, based on the court\u2019s determination that, although it believed that consecutive sentences would be justified, the principles <em>o\u00ed Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>precluded the imposition of such sentences based on judicial factfinding. As explained below, we agree with the state on cross-appeal, and therefore remand for resentencing on the cross-appeal. Given that disposition, we need not reach defendant\u2019s assignment of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">As an initial matter, we note that the issue that the state raises on cross-appeal is reviewable under ORS 138.222(4)(a) (as a claim that the \u201csentencing court failed to comply with requirements of law in * * * failing to impose a sentence\u201d). <em>See State v. Arnold, </em>214 Or App 201, 212, 164 P3d 334 (2007) (appellate court may review a sentencing issue when the sentence that was imposed was an authorized sentence, but the lower court is asserted to have erroneously determined that the defendant was not eligible for a different, also legally authorized, sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The issue raised in the cross-appeal was resolved by this court in <em>State v. Tanner, </em>210 Or App 70, 76, 150 P3d 31 (2006), in which we held that \u201cjudicial factfinding in support of consecutive sentences does not violate the Sixth Amendment.\u201d The trial court erred in its conclusion to the contrary. Given that that error requires us to remand the case for resentencing, ORS 138.222(5), there is no need for us to reach the sentencing issue raised by defendant on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Appeal dismissed as moot. On cross-appeal, sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
