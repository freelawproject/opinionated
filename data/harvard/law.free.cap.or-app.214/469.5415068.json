ORS 426.130. The trial court found that appellant suffers from a mental disorder and, as a consequence of that disorder, was dangerous to others. On appeal, appellant does not dispute that he has a mental disorder but contends that the record is insufficient to establish that, as of the time of the commitment hearing, he was dangerous to others. A discussion of the facts would be of no benefit to the bench, bar, or public. We determine, on <em>de novo </em>review, that there was not clear and convincing evidence that defendant was, in fact, dangerous to others as a result of his mental disorder. <em>See generally State v. Sea, </em>137 Or App 333, 336, 904 P2d 182 (1995) (\u201cTo be \u2018clear and convincing,\u2019 evidence must be of \u2018extraordinary persuasiveness.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
