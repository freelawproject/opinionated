At trial, defendant, a medical marijuana user, presented an affirmative defense to the charges under the Oregon Medical Marijuana Act (OMMA), which, under certain circumstances, excepts users of medical marijuana from criminal prosecution. <em>See </em>ORS 475.300 - 475.346. The jury convicted her on all counts. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s jury instruction that generally tracked the language of the statutory exception to the affirmative defense by stating that an affirmative defense is not available under the OMMA \u201cif the person, in connection with the facts giving rise to such charges, delivers marijuana to any individual who the person knows is not in possession of a medical marijuana card.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 475.316(l)(c) (2001).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the evidence did not support giving the instruction because any delivery by defendant was <em>\u201cde minimus </em>and otherwise unrelated to the charges of manufacture and possession of marijuana.\u201d Because there was evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that defendant delivered at least some of the same marijuana that she was charged with possessing and manufacturing, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">When police officers executed a warrant to search defendant\u2019s home, they seized 11 marijuana plants and approximately three ounces of usable marijuana. Defendant was interviewed by police at her workplace shortly after the search. She told one of those officers, Hoskins, that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>grown the plants from seeds for her personal use, and that both she and her boyfriend, Frederick Still, smoked marijuana \u201c[p]retty much every day.\u201d Defendant also told Hoskins that she taught Still how to grow marijuana, and that Still wanted \u201cto expand the garden and grow more marijuana * * * [s]o he would have more marijuana to smoke.\u201d Defendant told Hoskins that \u201cshe didn\u2019t allow [Still] to smoke as much marijuana as he wanted to,\u201d because \u201c[s]he wanted to make it last as long as possible.\u201d Although Hoskins did not ask whether defendant had shared marijuana with Still within the past three years, \u201cthat was [his] understanding.\u201d Defendant also told the officers that she had given marijuana to chemotherapy patients in Oregon and once traded marijuana to a handyman in exchange for work on her Oregon home. Defendant did not give the officers any information about when she shared marijuana with Still, the chemotherapy patients, or the handyman.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">For reasons that are not disclosed by the record, defendant was neither arrested nor charged with any offense in connection with the marijuana at the time it was seized. Several months later, however, she was arrested and charged with illegally manufacturing, possessing, and delivering for consideration marijuana based on the evidence obtained during the search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The case was tried to a jury. Defendant did not dispute that she manufactured and possessed marijuana, and she admitted on the stand that she had \u201csmoked with [Still] on occasion. Yes, of course.\u201d She nevertheless maintained that she was entitled to an exemption from criminal prosecution as a user of medical marijuana. <em>See </em>ORS 475.319(1) (2001). The state contended that the affirmative defense was unavailable because defendant had delivered marijuana to an individual whom she knew was not in possession of a medical marijuana card by sharing marijuana with Still. <em>See </em>ORS 475.316(l)(c) (2001); ORS 475.005(8) (defining \u201cdelivery\u201d as \u201cthe actual, constructive or attempted transfer * * * from one person to another of a controlled substance * * *\u201d); <em>cf. State v. Frederickson, </em>92 Or App 223, 225, 757 P2d 1366 (1988) (\u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>legislature has defined \u2018delivery\u2019 the way it is commonly understood: as a transfer * * * from one person to another. \u2018Transfer\u2019 is not defined by statute. It means, among other things, \u2018give.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); <em>State v. Graves, </em>73 Or App 172, 174-77, 697 P2d 1348 (1985) (evidence that a defendant shared a marijuana cigarette with a third party can support a conviction for delivery).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">The trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe Oregon Medical Marijuana Act provides a defense to criminal charges of Possession or Manufacture of Marijuana if the person charged with the offense is a person who, one, has been diagnosed with a debilitating medical condition within 12 months prior to her arrest, not to the incident, but to her arrest, and has been advised by her attending physician [that] the medical use of marijuana may mitigate the symptoms or effects of that debilitating medical condition, and two, is engaged in the medical use of marijuana!,] * * * and three, possesses or manufacturers no more than seven marijuana plants and three ounces of usable marijuana, unless the person proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the greater amount is medically necessary, as determined by the person\u2019s attending physician, to mitigate the symptoms or effects of the person\u2019s debilitating medical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cA person asserts this affirmative defense even though she has not received a medical marijuana card. The defendant must prove this defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>This defense is not available if the person, in connection with the facts giving rise to such charges, delivers marijuana to any individual who the person knows is not in possession of a medical marijuana card.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">(Emphasis added.) The jury convicted defendant of one count of possession of marijuana and one count of manufacturing marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury limiting application of the OMMA affirmative defense. A party is entitled to a jury instruction on its theory of the case if the requested instruction correctly states the law, is based on the operative pleadings, and is supported by the evidence. <em>Hernandez v. Barbo Machinery </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number><em>Co., </em>327 Or 99, 106, 957 P2d 147 (1998). In her brief, defendant contended that it is error as a matter of law to give the instruction unless a defendant is charged with delivery of marijuana (here, as noted, the delivery charge was dismissed before the case was sent to the jury), but at oral argument, defendant\u2019s counsel correctly acknowledged that the instruction may be appropriate even if a defendant is charged only with possession and manufacture of marijuana, so long as there is a sufficient nexus between the purported delivery and the charged offenses. Thus, the only question remaining before us is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Defendant argues that there was no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that her sharing marijuana with Still and others was \u201cin connection with\u201d her possessing and manufacturing marijuana on August 20, 2002, and that the trial court therefore erred by giving the instruction. The state responds that Hoskins\u2019s testimony supports a reasonable inference that defendant delivered marijuana to Still \u201cin connection with the facts giving rise to\u201d the charges for possession and manufacture of marijuana, making the instruction appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We agree with the state. Although there was no direct evidence that defendant shared the same marijuana with Still that she was arrested for possessing and manufacturing, the jury could reasonably so infer if it believed Hoskins\u2019s testimony. Defendant told Hoskins that she and Still \u201cboth smoke marijuana\u201d \u201c[p]retty much every day,\u201d that Still \u201chad tried to get her to expand the garden and grow more marijuana\u201d \u201c[s]o he would have more marijuana to smoke,\u201d and that she \u201cdidn\u2019t allow him to smoke as much marijuana as he wanted to\u201d because \u201c[s]he wanted to make it last as long as possible.\u201d Defendant\u2019s statements to Hoskins imply that defendant permitted Still to smoke some of the marijuana she manufactured but limited his use. That inference is bolstered by defendant\u2019s own testimony at trial that she has \u201csmoked with [Still] on occasion. Yes, of course. Be silly to lie to you.\u201d Although defendant argues that her sharing of marijuana was <em>\u201cde minimus,\u201d </em>the law contains no such exception; the affirmative defense is not available for charges involving possession or manufacture if, in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>those charges, the defendant delivered <em>any </em>amount of marijuana to a person not in possession of a registry card. <em>See </em>ORS 475.316(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">We conclude that the circumstantial evidence of defendant\u2019s delivery of marijuana to Still was sufficient to support the giving of the jury instruction. Whether that evidence rendered the affirmative defense unavailable was a question for the jury. The trial court did not err in giving the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> ORS 475.316(l)(c) (2001) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">\u201cNo person authorized to possess, deliver or produce marijuana for medical use pursuant to ORS 475.300 to 475.346 shall be excepted from the criminal laws of this state or shall be deemed to have established an affirmative defense to criminal charges of which possession, delivery or production of marijuana is an element if the person, in connection with the facts giving rise to such charges:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\u201c(c) Delivers marijuana to any individual who the person knows is not in possession of a registry identification card.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\"> The state voluntarily dismissed the delivery for consideration during its casein-chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
