ORS 813.010. He argues that the trial court erred at sentencing when it permanently revoked defendant\u2019s driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235(l)(b) (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 205, ch 436, \u00a7 1, which requires permanent revocation of driving privileges when a defendant has been convicted of DUII \u201cfor a third time.\u201d Defendant contends that, because his current conviction is actually his fourth conviction, the statute does not apply. The state responds that defendant did not preserve the assignment, that it is not reviewable as plain error, and that, in any event, defendant\u2019s reading of the statute is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">At sentencing, defendant\u2019s counsel did object to the permanent revocation of defendant\u2019s driving privileges. What he said, however, was that \u201cI want to preserve [defendant\u2019s] ability to appeal [the permanent revocation] as an excessive sanction.\u201d Defendant did not mention the issue of statutory construction that he now raises, much less assert the particular construction that he now advances before us. In determining whether an issue has been preserved, one of the most significant questions is whether the trial court was given a realistic opportunity to avoid the error that is asserted on appeal. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Tyree, 177 </em>Or App 187, 190, 33 P3d 729 (2001). In this case, the trial court never was given that opportunity. The assignment was not preserved. Nor is it plain error. <em>State v. Dollarhide, </em>214 Or App 329, 164 P3d 1222 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
