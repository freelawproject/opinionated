J.</author>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Defendant pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010. Because this is his third DUII conviction, the trial court permanently revoked defendant\u2019s driving privileges pursuant to ORS 809.235(l)(b) (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 436, \u00a7 1. Defendant now appeals, challenging the constitutionality of the statute that requires the permanent revocation of his driving privileges. The state argues that, because defendant pleaded guilty, the matter is not appealable and that, in any event, defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge is without merit. We conclude that defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge is appeal-able, but we agree with the state that it is without merit. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We begin with the state\u2019s contention that the matter is not appealable. ORS 138.050 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in ORS 135.335, a defendant who has pleaded guilty or no contest may take an appeal from a judgment or order described in ORS 138.053 only when the defendant makes a colorable showing that the disposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201c(a) Exceeds the maximum allowable by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201c(b) Is unconstitutionally cruel or unusual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">ORS 138.053, in turn, provides that a judgment is subject to the appeal provisions and limitations stated in ORS 138.050,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">\u201cif the disposition includes any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-11\">\u201c(a) Imposition of a sentence on conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-12\">\u201c(b) Suspension of imposition or execution of any part of a sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-13\">\u201c(c) Extension of a period of probation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-14\">\u201c(d) Imposition or modification of a condition of probation or of sentence suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-15\">\u201c(e) Imposition or execution of a sentence upon revocation of probation or sentence suspension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-16\">In this case, the state argues that, because defendant pleaded guilty, his challenge to the constitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>the statute requiring the revocation of his driving privileges is \u201cbeyond this court\u2019s scope of review\u201d and therefore requires affirmance of the judgment. According to the state, the scope of our review is limited to the lawfulness of the \u201csentence,\u201d which, the state contends, refers to the imposition of either a term of imprisonment, a fine, or both. The state acknowledges that, strictly speaking, ORS 138.050 permits a defendant who pleads guilty to challenge a \u201cdisposition.\u201d The state nevertheless insists that we should understand that term to refer to a \u201csentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">To begin with, it is perhaps worth noting that, as we explained in <em>State v. Stubbs, </em>193 Or App 595, 604, 91 P3d 774 (2004), ORS 138.050(1) \u201cpertains to appealability rather than reviewability, and embodies a jurisdictional limitation on appeal.\u201d Thus, if the state is correct about the applicability of that statute, the proper remedy is dismissal of the appeal, not affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">As to the merits of the state\u2019s argument, we need not address whether the revocation of driving privileges is part of a \u201csentence\u201d within the meaning of relevant statutes. <em>But see State v. Carney, </em>94 Or App 302, 304-05, 765 P2d 232 (1988) (\u201cBecause ORS 809.420(2) [providing for suspension or revocation of driving privileges on conviction for certain offenses] requires that the length of suspension be based on a defendant\u2019s record at the time when he committed the offense, <em>the court\u2019s sentence </em>exceeded that allowed by statute.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). That is because we do not accept the premise of the state\u2019s argument, <em>viz., </em>that ORS 138.050 limits a defendant to a challenge of the \u201csentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">ORS 138.050(1) plainly states that a defendant who has pleaded guilty may challenge the \u201cdisposition\u201d as being unlawful. It does not state that the defendant may challenge only the \u201csentence.\u201d The state\u2019s argument that the two terms are, in effect, interchangeable, is not persuasive. According to the state, ORS 138.053 \u201cclarifies that \u2018disposition\u2019 refers to various aspects of a \u2018sentence.\u2019 \u201d Actually, ORS 138.053 does not equate the two terms. It states that a \u201cdisposition\u201d may <em>include </em>various aspects of sentencing, but it nowhere suggests that a \u201cdisposition\u201d and a \u201csentence\u201d are synonyms. Although a \u201cdisposition\u201d may include a \u201csentence,\u201d it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>logically follow that a \u201cdisposition\u201d is nothing more than a \u201csentence.\u201d Indeed, as we explained in <em>State v. Anderson, </em>113 Or App 416, 833 P2d 321 (1992), an earlier version of ORS 138.050 did refer to review of a \u201csentence.\u201d But that version was amended, and the word \u201cdisposition\u201d was substituted for the word \u201csentence\u201d precisely to permit review of an order of probation, which at the time was not considered a \u201csentence\u201d within the meaning of the relevant statutes. <em>Id. </em>at 418-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The state offers no other argument in support of the suggestion that a revocation of driving privileges is not a \u201cdisposition\u201d within the meaning of ORS 138.050, and we are aware of none. We therefore conclude that we have jurisdiction to review defendant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of that disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">As to that question, our opinion in <em>State v. Terry, </em>214 Or App 56, 162 P3d 372 (2007), is controlling and adverse to defendant\u2019s arguments. We therefore conclude that the trial court did not err in permanently revoking defendant\u2019s driving privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
