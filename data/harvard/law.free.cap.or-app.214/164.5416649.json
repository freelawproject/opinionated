On appeal, he raises numerous challenges to his convictions, which we reject without discussion. Defendant further contends that the trial court erred in imposing a compensatory fine of $20,000 to pay for future psychological treatment for the victim. Defendant asserts that no evidence was presented to support such a fine. The state concedes that, under <em>State v. Donahue, </em>165 Or App 143, 995 P2d 1202 (2000), such fines cannot be imposed in the absence of evidence that the victim has actually suffered a pecuniary loss and that there was no such evidence here. We find the state\u2019s concession to be well founded and, consequently, accept it.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Compensatory fine vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
