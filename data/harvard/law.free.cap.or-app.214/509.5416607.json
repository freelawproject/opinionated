J.</author>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In this criminal appeal, defendant challenges only his sentence, arguing that the trial court committed plain error in concluding that his conviction and sentence are subject to ORS 137.635.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that defendant is correct and therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. Defendant was charged in Crook County Circuit Court with one count of burglary in the first degree, ORS 164.225, based on conduct committed on or about November 17, 2004. On April 7, 2005, defendant pleaded guilty to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">On April 11, 2005, in Deschutes County Circuit Court, defendant was convicted of multiple counts of burglary in the first degree, based on conduct committed between July and November 28, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">On April 14, 2005, the Crook County Circuit Court imposed sentence. The state argued that, because defendant had been convicted of multiple counts of burglary in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Deschutes County Circuit Court three days earlier, those convictions constituted \u201cprevious convictions\u201d subject to ORS 137.635 for the purposes of sentencing on the Crook County burglary. The trial court agreed. It imposed a presumptive sentence of 45 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months\u2019 post-prison supervision, to be served consecutively to sentences imposed for defendant\u2019s convictions in the Deschutes County case. It then determined that, defendant having previously been convicted of burglary in the first degree in the Deschutes County case, his conviction and sentence are subject to ORS 137.635.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Defendant asked for clarification of the court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I just want to be clear on what your sentence is. It\u2019s forty-five months and he \u2014 you\u2019re saying that he\u2019s not eligible for programs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m saying that he\u2019s eligible \u2014 he\u2019s subject to ORS 137.635, which keeps him from being \u2014 having his sentence reduced <em>under that statute.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: I think he is \u2014 should be eminently eligible for programs <em>within the institution </em>while he\u2019s there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">(Emphasis added.) Shortly after that, defendant\u2019s counsel again raised the question of defendant\u2019s eligibility for \u201cprograms\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your honor, did you intend for him to be eligible for programs? Because I think that\u2019s something specifically contemplated in that little check box on the forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Subject to ORS 137.635.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: So long as it says <em>subject to 137.635, </em>yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMc\">(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">On the form of judgment, there is a preprinted section relating to consideration for sentence modifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>under a different statute, ORS 137.750.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The section is preceded by a check box and also states that the defendant \u201cmay be considered for\u201d such programs \u201cunless the following is checked.\u201d In this case, however, neither the preceding nor the \u201cfollowing\u201d space was checked.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in making the determination that his Crook County conviction and sentence are subject to ORS 137.635. He points out that, in <em>State v. Allison, </em>143 Or App 241, 923 P2d 1224, <em>rev den, </em>324 Or 487 (1996), this court concluded that ORS 137.635 applies when a person has been convicted of one of the listed offenses before <em>committing </em>the offense for which the person currently is being sentenced. Here, he notes, it is undisputed that he committed the offense at issue in this case in November 2004, whereas he was not convicted in the Deschutes County case until April 2005 \u2014 five months after committing the instant offense. Defendant concedes that he did not make that argument below, but asks us to reach the issue as one of plain error, as we have done in other cases involving ORS 137.635. <em>See, e.g., State v. Weikert, </em>145 Or App 263, 267, 929 P2d 1070 (1996), <em>rev den, </em>325 Or 45 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The state concedes that, under this court\u2019s decision in <em>Allison, </em>the trial court erred and that, in a number of post-<em>Allison </em>cases, we have concluded that such an error is reviewable even if not preserved. The state nevertheless argues that, for three reasons, defendant is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">First, relying on <em>State ex rel Huddleston v. Sawyer, </em>324 Or 597, 605-08, 932 P2d 1145, <em>cert den, </em>522 US 994 (1997), the state argues that, notwithstanding ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>138.050(l)(a), providing that a defendant who has pleaded guilty may take an appeal on the ground that the disposition exceeds the maximum allowed by law, and, notwithstanding ORS 138.222(4)(a), authorizing this court\u2019s review of a claim that the sentencing court \u201cfailed to comply with requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence,\u201d this court is barred under ORS 138.222(2)(a) from reviewing on direct appeal any ruling or order that is, in effect, collateral to the imposition of a presumptive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Second, the state argues that, even assuming that defendant\u2019s challenge to imposition of ORS 137.635 is reviewable and has merit, this court should decline to reach the issue because the restrictions that ORS 137.635 imposes on defendant\u2019s sentence \u2014 the inability to obtain leave or earned time sentence reductions under ORS 421.121 \u2014 also are applicable to defendant under ORS 137.750. And, the state argues, where the trial court did not indicate on the judgment that the Department of Corrections (DOC) was authorized to consider defendant for those sentence modifications under ORS 137.750 and defendant does not assign error to that action by the trial court, DOC is precluded from affording those modifications to defendant even if this court determines that defendant is not subject to ORS 137.635.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Third, the state argues that, in any event, the trial court did not err in applying ORS 137.635 to defendant because, according to the state, this court\u2019s interpretation of that statute in <em>Allison </em>has been \u201copenly\u201d called into question by the Supreme Court in <em>Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 112 P3d 320 (2005). In that post-conviction case, the court concluded that the post-conviction petitioner\u2019s criminal trial counsel had not been constitutionally inadequate for having failed to argue, before this court\u2019s decision in <em>Allison, </em>that ORS 137.635 meant what this court later determined it meant. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of <em>Allison </em>in <em>Burdge, </em>the state infers that that court now disagrees with this court\u2019s interpretation of the statute. The state therefore argues that the question of the meaning of ORS 137.635 cannot meet the criterion for plain error that the error be \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">We begin with the state\u2019s contention that, consistently with ORS 138.222(2)(a) and <em>Sawyer, </em>defendant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>of error is not reviewable on direct appeal because it is collateral to a presumptive sentence. In <em>Sawyer, </em>the trial court imposed a presumptive sentence on a convicted offender, notwithstanding that the offender had been convicted of a crime listed in the then newly enacted ORS 137.700 (Measure 11). The state sought mandamus relief in the Supreme Court, contending that the trial court was required to sentence the offender under Measure 11. <em>Sawyer, </em>324 Or at 599-600. The Supreme Court necessarily first decided whether mandamus was an appropriate remedy by reason of other remedies\u2014 specifically, direct appeal \u2014 being unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 600-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The court noted that, under ORS 138.222(2)(a), a sentence that is within the sentencing guidelines presumptive sentence range for a crime is not reviewable on direct appeal and that, under ORS 138.222(2)(e), no other issue relating to sentencing is reviewable \u201c[e]xcept as authorized by\u201d subsections (3) and (4) of that statute. The court determined that, notwithstanding the enactment of ORS 137.700, the sentencing guidelines remain effective for various purposes as to the crimes to which ORS 137.700 applies. Accordingly, the sentence at issue in that case, which indisputedly was imposed as a presumptive sentence under the guidelines \u2014 albeit on a Measure 11 offense \u2014 was unreviewable on direct appeal under ORS 138.222(2)(a). <em>Id. </em>at 602-07. In addition, the court determined that, consistently with <em>State v. Adams, </em>315 Or 359, 365-67, 847 P2d 397 (1993), ORS 138.222(4)(a) (providing that the appellate court may review a claim that the sentencing court \u201cfailed to comply with requirements of law in imposing or failing to impose a sentence\u201d) constitutes an exception only to ORS 138.222(2)(e)\u2014 prohibiting review of \u201cany other issue related to sentencing\u201d \u2014 and not to ORS 138.222(2)(a) through (d). <em>Sawyer, </em>324 Or at 607-08. The court concluded that, because the sentence was unreviewable on direct appeal under ORS 138.222(2)(a) and because ORS 138.222(4)(a) did not provide an exception to its nonreviewability, the sentence was subject to the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. <em>Id. </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><em>Sawyer </em>does not control the reviewability of the sentence in this case. In particular, nothing in that case indicates that aspects of a presumptive sentence other than the length of the sentence <em>as imposed </em>are unreviewable -under ORS 138.222(2)(a) and ORS 138.222(4)(a). Rather, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number><em>Sawyer, </em>the ruling of the trial court that the Supreme Court determined to be unreviewable on direct appeal under those statutes did in fact pertain to the length of the sentence imposed, namely, the trial court\u2019s decision to impose a 20-month presumptive sentence rather than a 75-month minimum sentence under ORS 137.700.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Here, by contrast, although the trial court imposed a presumptive sentence, the challenged ruling of the trial court did not pertain to the length of the sentence imposed, or to some other sentence length asserted to be applicable. Rather, the relevant ruling pertained to the applicability of ORS 137.635, which does not itself establish the length of any sentence but, as discussed above, affects an offender\u2019s eligibility for subsequent modifications of the sentence that are implemented by the custodial or supervisory authority (in this case, DOC), such as temporary leave from custody or earned time reductions. We conclude that that aspect of defendant\u2019s sentence is reviewable under ORS 138.222(2)(e) and ORS 138.222(4)(a), relating to the sentencing court\u2019s asserted \u201cfail[ure] to comply with requirements of law in imposing * * * a sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">We turn next to the state\u2019s argument that, even assuming that the trial court\u2019s application of ORS 137.635 to defendant\u2019s sentence was erroneous, we should decline to reach the issue because the same restrictions on sentence modifications were available to the trial court under ORS 137.750; because the record in this case indicates that the trial court would have imposed the restrictions under the latter statute; and because, on this record, DOC will deem the trial court to have done so. In effect, the state argues that any error by the trial court was harmless. For the following reasons, we reject the state\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">To begin with, the record does not support the state\u2019s characterization of the trial court\u2019s intentions regarding ORS 137.750. As we have noted, in its colloquy with defendant\u2019s counsel, the court referred to defendant\u2019s eligibility for \u201cprograms.\u201d But the court\u2019s first such reference was to programs within the institution, such as drug abuse treatment. The statement sheds no light on the court\u2019s intention regarding defendant\u2019s ability to be considered under ORS 137.750 for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>leave from custody, sentence reductions, and similar \u201cprograms\u201d covered by that statute. However, the court\u2019s response to defense counsel\u2019s follow-up question \u2014 in which counsel expressly asked about programs covered by \u201cthat little check box on the forms\u201d \u2014 does shed light on that issue. Although the relevant \u201ccheck box\u201d section of the form does not refer to ORS 137.750, it precisely tracks the wording of that statute as to the forms of sentence modification at issue. And, again, when expressly asked whether it intended for defendant to be \u201celigible\u201d for the \u201cprograms\u201d relevant to the \u201ccheck box\u201d on the form, the court stated, \u201cSo long as it says <em>subject to 137.635, </em>yes.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We understand from those circumstances that, except to the extent that defendant was ineligible under ORS 137.635 for such \u201cprograms,\u201d the trial court permitted defendant to be considered under ORS 137.750 for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Nor does the written judgment foreclose that understanding of the court\u2019s intention. Again, as we have noted, the section of the preprinted form relating to consideration for sentence modifications under ORS 137.750, indicating that the defendant \u201cmay be considered for\u201d such programs \u201cunless the following is checked,\u201d was not, in fact, checked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Finally, the record does not reflect that the trial court found \u201con the record in open court\u201d the statutorily required \u201csubstantial and compelling reasons\u201d to deny defendant consideration for the relevant programs. In short, on this record, we cannot conclude that, regardless of any error attendant on the trial court\u2019s application to defendant of ORS 137.635, the court in any event intended to, and effectively did, preclude him under ORS 137.750 from obtaining sentence modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">There remains the state\u2019s argument that, if nothing else, the Supreme Court recently has called into question the correctness of <em>Allison </em>and, as a result, the trial court\u2019s failure to comply with it no longer can be regarded as plain error. Under ORAP 5.45(1), this court may exercise its discretion to address an unpreserved error of law that is \u201capparent on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>face of the record.\u201d An error is plain if it is purely legal, obvious and not reasonably in dispute, and depends on undisputed predicate facts, so that we are not required to go beyond the record or choose between competing inferences. <em>State v. Page, </em>197 Or App 72, 78, 104 P3d 616 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006). In deciding whether to exercise our discretion to address such an error, we consider, among other things, \u201cthe gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; * * * and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[.]\u201d Ailes <em>v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">The state\u2019s argument that a trial court\u2019s failure to follow <em>Allison </em>is not plain error is premised on an assertion that the Supreme Court questioned the correctness of that decision in <em>Burdge. </em>Because the court did so, the state reasons, a failure to follow this court\u2019s decision can no longer be regarded as \u201cobvious and not reasonably in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The problem with the state\u2019s argument is that the Supreme Court in <em>Burdge </em>did not address the correctness of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Allison. </em>The issue before the court was not the correctness of <em>Allison, </em>but the question whether a post-conviction petitioner\u2019s criminal trial counsel, who had failed to raise the issue that <em>Allison </em>ultimately decided, had failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment. The court concluded that the lawyer had not failed to exercise reasonable skill and judgment in not raising the issue. To be sure, the court suggested that a \u201cmore technical grammatical analysis <em>could\u201d </em>suggest a reading of the statute different from the one reached in <em>Allison. Burdge, </em>338 Or at 498 n 5 (emphasis added). But the court then cautioned that its conclusion with respect to the narrow issue before it \u201cdoes not depend on whether <em>Allison </em>correctly identified an ambiguity [in the statute] or ultimately interpreted the statute correctly.\u201d <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 498. As a result, our decision in <em>Allison </em>remains good law, and the trial courts of this state remain bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">For that reason, the trial court\u2019s legal error in this case remains obvious and not reasonably in dispute. Moreover, we exercise our discretion to reach the error. The error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>significantly affects defendant\u2019s liberty interest in that, in the absence of some other bar to sentence modifications, such as an order by the trial court denying him consideration under ORS 137.750 for such modifications, application to defendant of ORS 137.635 deprives him of eligibility for a sentence reduction of up to 20 percent under ORS 421.121, among other consequences. In addition, the trial court\u2019s error in applying ORS 137.635 to defendant can easily be corrected. <em>See Weikert, </em>145 Or App at 267 (relying on equivalent factors in exercising court\u2019s discretion to review plain error). The trial court erred in applying ORS 137.635 to defendant\u2019s sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Sentence vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-8\"> ORS 137.635 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">\u201c(1) When, in the case of a felony described in subsection (2) of this section, a court sentences a convicted defendant who has previously been convicted of any felony designated in subsection (2) of this section, * * * the court shall impose a determinate sentence, the length of which the court shall determine, to the custody of the Department of Corrections. * * * The convicted defendant shall serve the entire sentence imposed by the court and shall not, during the service of such a sentence, be eligible for parole or any form of temporary leave from custody.
