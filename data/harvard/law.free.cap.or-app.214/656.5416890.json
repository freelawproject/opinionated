J.</author>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to supply contraband. ORS 162.185 (supplying contraband); ORS 161.450 (conspiracy). On appeal, he argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court\u2019s admission of certain evidence violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as interpreted by the Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 US 36, 124 S Ct 1354, 158 L Ed 2d 177 (2004). On appeal, the state concedes that the trial court erred in that regard. That concession is well founded. Accordingly, and without addressing defendant\u2019s other contentions, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Defendant and his wife, Monnet, were both charged with conspiracy to supply contraband while defendant was a prison inmate. Monnet entered a plea of guilty. Her petition to plead guilty contained the following statement: \u201cIn April 2003, in Marion County, I was involved with a plan to introduce controlled substance into Santiam Correctional Facility and I mailed a letter containing controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Defendant\u2019s trial occurred thereafter. The state subpoenaed Monnet, who invoked her spousal privilege under OEC 505 not to testify against defendant, and thus the state did not call her as a witness. Instead, the state sought to introduce into evidence her plea petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">Defendant argued that the admission of his wife\u2019s statements in the plea petition constituted testimonial hearsay that would violate his confrontation rights as explained in <em>Crawford. </em>The trial court, although agreeing that the plea petition was \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of <em>Crawford, </em>overruled defendant\u2019s objection. The court reasoned that the state \u201cin effect has made [Monnet] available as a witness by subpoenaing her,\u201d even though the state did not call her as a witness due to her invocation of the spousal privilege not to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in determining that Monnet was \u201cavailable\u201d to testify and that the court\u2019s admission of the plea petition into evidence was, thus, error under <em>Crawford. </em>As noted, the state concedes error and further acknowledges that the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>In <em>Crawford, </em>the Court indicated that a statement is testimonial if it is a \u201c \u2018solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d 541 US at 51 (quoting Webster, <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language </em>(1828)). The Court went on to label as \u201cplainly testimonial\u201d accomplice confessions including \u201cplea allocution showing existence of a conspiracy.\u201d 541 US at 64. Prior to <em>Crawford, </em>such statements often were admitted into evidence despite lack of opportunity to cross-examine the declarant on the ground that they fell within firmly rooted hearsay exceptions. <em>Crawford, </em>however, makes it clear that if a declarant\u2019s statement is \u201ctestimonial,\u201d then the defendant must be afforded the right to confront the declarant if the statement is to be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">In this case, Monnet was \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify. <em>See Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 US 415, 419-20, 85 S Ct 1074, 13 L Ed 2d 934 (1965) (accomplice\u2019s assertion of privilege against self-incrimination made him \u201cunavailable\u201d for Confrontation Clause purposes, and thus his confession should not have been admitted against the defendant); <em>State v. Ennis, </em>212 Or App 240, 254-55, 158 P3d 510 (2007) (nontestifying codefendant was \u201cunavailable\u201d for Confrontation Clause purposes). The conclusion that Monnet was not available is not changed by the fact that the state had subpoenaed her before she invoked the privilege. As the Court noted in <em>California v. Green, </em>399 US 149, 162, 90 S Ct 1930, 26 L Ed 2d 489 (1970), there is no Confrontation Clause problem if the declarant \u201cis present <em>to testify and to submit to cross-examination.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Mere presence, without testimony and the opportunity for cross-examination, is not enough. Thus, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting Monnet\u2019s plea petition into evidence against defendant at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Finally, given the totality of the evidence, the admission of Monnet\u2019s statement in the plea petition, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 681, 106 S Ct 1431, 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
