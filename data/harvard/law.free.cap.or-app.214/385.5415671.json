Petitioner paid $6,000 in such fees to each of its three board members, and the Oregon Employment Department (department) assessed petitioner payroll taxes on the payments. Petitioner sought review of that assessment before an administrative law judge (ALJ), arguing that director\u2019s fees were not \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d because corporate directors are not \u201cemployees\u201d of a corporation. The ALJ concluded that, as the terms are defined in ORS chapter 657, such fees did constitute \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d that are subject to unemployment tax. Petitioner now seeks review of the ALJ\u2019s order. We agree with the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">We take the facts, which are undisputed, from the ALJ\u2019s findings. Petitioner is a property management firm incorporated in the State of Oregon and headquartered in Portland. It has been registered as an employer with the department since 1986. It is governed by a board of directors, which meets regularly and sets policy and provides governance and direction for the corporation. <em>See </em>ORS 60.301(1) (requiring all Oregon corporations to have a board of directors); ORS 60.301(2) (providing that, subject to certain limitations, \u201c[a] 11 corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of, the board of directors\u201d). In the third quarter of 2003, petitioner paid $6,000 in \u201cdirector\u2019s fees\u201d to each of three members of its board. It did not report those payments as part of its payroll and it did not pay unemployment taxes on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In 2005, the department\u2019s tax section conducted a routine random audit of petitioner and determined, in accordance with its tax manual,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the $18,000 in director\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>constituted part of petitioner\u2019s 2003 taxable payroll. The department issued to petitioner a notice of tax assessment for approximately $700. Petitioner sought review of the assessment before an ALJ from the Office of Administrative Hearings. At the hearing, petitioner contended that the fees paid to its board of directors could not be \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d because directors, who control the corporation, were not employees. The ALJ determined that the director\u2019s fees met the statutory definitions of \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d and issued an order affirming the tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Petitioner now seeks review of the ALJ\u2019s order, renewing its argument that the fees that it paid to directors cannot be subject to unemployment tax because its directors are not employees and, therefore, that the work of its directors is not \u201cemployment\u201d that is subject to taxation. Petitioner argues that the role of corporate directors is to establish the overall course of a corporation\u2019s management direction, overseeing the corporation\u2019s business and approving major plans and actions \u2014 in short, that the board functions as the corporation\u2019s \u201calter ego\u201d and is not \u201cemployed\u201d by it. The department responds that, irrespective of the manner in which the words may be used in other contexts, the ALJ correctly concluded that director\u2019s fees are \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d as those terms are defined by the legislature in ORS chapter 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Because the issue in this case turns on the proper interpretation of \u201cinexact\u201d statutory terms, <em>see Springfield Education Assn. v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 224, 621 P2d 547 (1980) (distinguishing inexact from exact or delegative terms and explaining that inexact terms are those \u201cembodying complete expressions of legislative meaning, even though that meaning may not always be obvious\u201d), we review the department\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes for consistency with legislative intent. ORS 183.482(8)(a); <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp. v. Real Estate </em>Agency, 331 Or 348, 354, 15 P3d 29 (2000). We ascertain that intent by applying the interpretive principles of <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993), examining the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>of the statute in context, and turning, if necessary, to legislative history and other aids to construction. <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp., </em>331 Or at 354. Where the legislature has specifically defined terms in the statute itself, we construe those terms in accordance with the definitions supplied. <em>See State v. Couch, </em>341 Or 610, 619, 147 P3d 322 (2006) (reviewing court is \u201cobliged to apply the legislature\u2019s definition\u201d); <em>City of Portland v. King, </em>211 Or App 540, 543, 156 P3d 87 (2007) (same). In the absence of explicit definitions, we presume that the legislature intended that words be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meanings. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. In all events, we may not refine the statute by adding words, exceptions, or qualifications that are not there. ORS 174.010; <em>Wheaton v. Kulongoski, </em>209 Or App 355, 364, 147 P3d 1163 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">Applying those principles to the present case, we begin by setting forth the statutes in ORS chapter 657 that, collectively, define the activities that are subject to unemployment taxation. Every Oregon employer must pay unemployment tax into the Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund, ORS 657.505. More specifically, under ORS 657.505(2), all employers must pay unemployment taxes \u201con all <em>wages </em>paid for services.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) \u2018Wages,\u201d in turn, is defined in ORS 657.105 as meaning \u201call remuneration for employment\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis added), and \u201cemployment\u201d is defined in ORS 657.030 as \u201cservice for an employer * * * performed for remuneration or under any contract of hire.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Taken together, the effect of the statutory scheme is to create a broad class of services that constitute \u201cemployment,\u201d payment for which is subject to taxation under ORS chapter 657 \u2014 namely, <em>any service for an employer that is performed for remuneration. </em>Other statutes in ORS chapter 657 then carve exceptions from that broad class, enumerating a wide, and somewhat eclectic, variety of services provided for an employer for remuneration that are nonetheless excluded from the definition of \u201cemployment.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 657.043 (excluding golf caddying); ORS 657.048 (translation and interpretation); ORS 657.080 (newspaper delivery); ORS 657.047 (transportation of logs, poles, and piling); ORS 657.091 (food product demonstration). Also among the various services specifically excluded from the class of subject employment are services for an employer by individuals who would not ordinarily be regarded as \u201cemployees\u201d of the employer, including: an independent contractor, ORS 657.040; services for a limited liability corporation by a member, ORS 657.044(l)(b); and services for a limited liability partnership by a partner, ORS 657.044(l)(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is no exclusion in ORS chapter 657, however, for services provided for a corporation by members of its board of directors acting in their capacity as directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\"> The Supreme Court and this court have long held that the definition of \u201cemployment\u201d for purposes of ORS chapter 657 is intended to be broadly inclusive, encompassing a relationship that is \u201c \u2018broader than the scope of the employer-employee relation or that of master and servant as those terms are known to the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Journal Pub. Co. v. State U. C. Com., </em>175 Or 627, 635, 155 P2d 570 (1945) (quoting <em>Rahoutis v. Unemployment Commission, </em>171 Or 93, 113, 136 P2d 426 (1943)). Consistently with that-understanding, the terms \u201cservice\u201d for \u201cremuneration\u201d in ORS 657.030 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>are broadly construed. <em>North Pacific Supply Co., Inc. v. Emp. Div., </em>100 Or App 553, 556, 787 P2d 495 (1990); <em>Petrol Stops Northwest v. Morgan, </em>10 Or App 620, 625, 501 P2d 341 (1972). If services are performed for an employer for remuneration, the burden is on the employer to prove that it comes within an enumerated exception. <em>North Pacific Supply Co., Inc., </em>100 Or App at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">In light of the legislature\u2019s considered scheme and the case law interpreting it, we readily conclude that the director\u2019s fees paid by petitioner were unambiguously \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d as the legislature has defined those terms. It is undisputed that petitioner is an \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of ORS chapter 657. <em>See </em>ORS 657.025 (defining \u201cemployer\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The dispositive question, therefore, is whether the director\u2019s fees were \u201cremuneration\u201d for a \u201cservice\u201d that the board provided to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Neither \u201cservice\u201d nor \u201cremuneration\u201d is defined in the statute, so we assume that the legislature intended them to have their ordinary meaning. <em>PGE, </em>317 Or at 611. In ordinary parlance, a \u201cservice\u201d is \u201can act done for the benefit or at the command of another,\u201d an act that \u201cprovide [s] information or other assistance,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2075 (unabridged ed 2002), and \u201cremuneration\u201d refers to \u201cpay[ing] an equivalent to (a person) for a service, loss, or expense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1921. Petitioner\u2019s board of directors\u2019 role was to regularly meet to \u201cset policy and provide governance and direction\u201d for the corporation. By setting policy and providing governance and direction, the board certainly acted \u201cfor the benefit\u201d of the corporation. <em>Cf. </em>William E. Knepper and Dan A. Bailey, <em>Liability of Corporate Officers and Directors </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1-3, 6 (1993) (describing corporate board\u2019s responsibility to \u201coversee and monitor the operations of the business\u201d and the board\u2019s fiduciary duty to promote the corporation\u2019s interest); Harry G. Henn, <em>Law of Corporations </em>\u00a7 207, 415 (1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>(same). Thus, petitioner\u2019s board of directors provided a \u201cservice\u201d to petitioner, within the ordinary meaning of that word. In addition, petitioner paid $6,000 to each of the board members for acting in their capacity as board members \u2014 that is, for providing that service. The payments thus constituted \u201cremuneration.\u201d In sum, petitioner\u2019s board of directors provided a \u201cservice\u201d for an \u201cemployer\u201d for which they were \u201cremunerated.\u201d It follows that the services of the corporate directors acting in their capacity as board members are subject \u201cemployment\u201d under ORS 657.030.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Other provisions of ORS chapter 657 support that conclusion. See <em>State v. Carr, </em>319 Or 408, 411-12, 877 P2d 1192 (1994) (for purposes of <em>PGE </em>analysis, \u201c[c]ontext includes other related statutes\u201d). As we have noted, the statutes in ORS chapter 657 establish a broad definition of \u201cemployment,\u201d ORS 657.030, and then carve numerous explicit exceptions into that definition. Although the legislature carved several explicit exceptions into its definition of subject \u201cemployment,\u201d the services provided by corporate directors acting in their capacity as directors are not among them. The legislature, of course, is free to add such an exception; unless and until it does so, however, we are not at liberty to read into the statutes an exception that does not exist. ORS 174.010; <em>Wheaton, </em>209 Or App at 364. Because the services of petitioner\u2019s corporate directors constitute \u201cemployment,\u201d it necessarily follows that the director\u2019s fees for those services were \u201cwages\u201d under ORS 657.105, and that those wages are taxable under ORS 657.505.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. As noted, petitioner contends that director\u2019s fees cannot possibly be \u201cwages\u201d for \u201cemployment\u201d because that would cast corporate directors as employees when their role is, in fact, fundamentally different: they control the corporation and not <em>vice versa. </em>Petitioner argues, in other words, that the fiduciary relationship that a board of directors bears to the corporation it controls is not an \u201cemployment\u201d relationship in any ordinary sense of the term. The difficulty with that argument is that it ignores the fact that the legislature took it upon itself, in ORS 657.030(1), to substantively define \u201cemployment,\u201d and, as we have concluded, it did so quite expansively. <em>See Journal Pub. Co., </em>175 Or at 636; <em>North Pacific Supply Co., Inc., </em>100 Or App at 556. Thus, it may be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>as petitioner asserts, that the legislature\u2019s broad definition of \u201cemployment,\u201d insofar as it encompasses the work of corporate directors acting in their capacity as directors, does not comport with the ordinary use of that word or with the manner in which the word is understood in other contexts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We need not decide whether that is so, however; even assuming it is, it is irrelevant: The legislature is free to define \u201cemployment\u201d in any way that it wants, and, in interpreting a statute, we are obliged to apply the definition that the legislature has supplied. <em>Couch, </em>341 Or at 619 (a term in a statute means \u201cwhatever the legislature says that it means\u201d). For purposes of assessing unemployment tax, the legislature has unambiguously defined \u201cemployment\u201d in such a way as to encompass the services of petitioner\u2019s board of directors, and it has unambiguously defined \u201cwages\u201d in such a way as to encompass the fees that petitioner paid to its directors. The ALJ did not err in affirming the tax assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\"> The department\u2019s tax section maintains and uses a tax manual, which provides guidance to department employees on how to apply the tax laws. Before 2004, the manual held that director\u2019s fees are \u201cgenerally nominal amounts to reimburse director\u2019s expenses for attending board meetings and would not be subject. Directors set policy; they do not manage the company.\u201d In mid-2004, that section was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>changed to read \u201cdirector\u2019s fees are subject. Setting policy for a corporation is a service. When a director is paid for the service, the payment or fee is subject.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-5\"> ORS 657.505 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">\u201c(1) On and after January 1,1936, taxes shall be payable by each employer then subject to this chapter.

It is also worth noting that federal circuit courts construing other statutes and similarly applying traditional common-law principles have concluded that corporate directors acting in that capacity are not \u201cemployees.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Chavero v. Local 241, </em>787 F2d 1154, 1156 (7th Cir 1986) (\u201cmembers of boards of directors are not employees for purposes of Title VII coverage under any standards\u201d); <em>Zimmerman v. North American Signal Co., </em>704 F2d 347, 351-52 (7th Cir 1983) (corporate directors are not employees for purposes of Age Discrimination in Employment Act); <em>see generally Clackamas Gastroenterology Associates, P.

Co., </em>175 Or at 636; <em>see also Stephens v.

Thus, we do not need to turn to common-law master-servant principles to determine the existence of an employment relationship; rather, we are obliged to apply the definitions that the legislature has provided. <em>Couch, </em>341 Or at 619.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
