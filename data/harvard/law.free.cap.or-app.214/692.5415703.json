On appeal, he assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence and to the court\u2019s imposition of upward departure sentences. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the suppression of evidence without discussion. We agree, however, that the upward departure sentences were erroneously imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"AD7\">At sentencing, the court imposed concurrent upward departure sentences of 30 months and 18 months, based on judicial findings concerning the \u201cdegree of organization and the sheer quantity.\u201d Defendant asserts that an enhanced sentence based on such judicial factfinding violates the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). We agree. Defendant is entitled to resentencing because the court imposed an upward departure sentence based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AMz\">Although defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence is unpreserved, in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), we held that the imposition of a departure sentence under similar circumstances constituted plain error. For the reasons set forth in <em>Ramirez, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"AOU\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
