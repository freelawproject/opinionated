The court reasoned that the petition was not timely filed because more than the statutorily permitted 60 days elapsed between the date when the administrative order was entered into the trial court record and the date when petitioner filed her petition. ORS 416.427(6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The case presents only legal issues; the facts are not in dispute. In 1999, respondent Rex M. Wessels (father) was ordered by the court to pay child support in the amount of $356 per month to Gina M. Wessels (mother). In 2004, the state (acting through the Josephine County District Attorney) moved for modification of that 1999 child support order. <em>See </em>ORS 416.425(1) (authorizing state to move for modification of support order). Mother opposed the modification. An administrative hearing ensued on July 7, 2004. <em>See </em>ORS 416.427(2) (administrative hearings are forum for contested modification motions). The administrative law judge (ALJ) from the Office of Administrative Hearings issued a final order on July 26, 2004, reducing father\u2019s child support obligation to $251 per month. The ALJ\u2019s administrative order contained the following text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cUnder the provisions of ORS 416.427(6), you may appeal this order by filing a petition for review in the circuit court of the county in which the order has been entered. <em>Your petition must be filed with the circuit court clerk within 60 days of the date the order is </em>entered, and may be filed <em>only </em>with the circuit court clerk\u2019s office. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">(Boldface and italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">On August 6, 2004, an authorized representative from the Family Support Division of the Josephine County District Attorney\u2019s Office filed in the Circuit Court of Josephine County a document entitled \u201cCertification to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Circuit Court for Filing/Docketing Administrative Documents.\u201d (Uppercase omitted.) The certification states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">\u201cThe Administrator of the District Attorney\u2019s Office, Family Support Division certifies the following documents are originals or true copies of the originals and requests the same be presented for a judge\u2019s signature (if appropriate),[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] filed and docketed in accordance with ORS 416.440.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cSTATE\u2019S MOTION FOR MODIFICATION AND PROPOSED ORDER * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201cADMINISTRATIVE ORDER MODIFYING SUPPORT, dated and mailed on July 26, 2004, and resulting from the hearing of July 7, 2004.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">A copy of the ALJ\u2019s order was included with the certification. Three days later, on August 9, 2004, the following notations were entered in the Oregon Judicial Information Network (OJIN): \u201cCertificate Circuit Court\u201d and \u201cMotion Modify Judgment.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Several affidavits were entered at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">On September 1, 2004, a circuit court judge issued an \u201cOrder Approving Administrative Order\u201d stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">\u201cTHE COURT HEREBY FINDS AS FOLLOWS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">\u201cThe Administrative Order complies with the formula established by ORS Chapter 25.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-13\">\u201cIT IS THEREFORE HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">\u201cThe Administrative Order dated and mailed on July 26, 2004, resulting from the hearing by the Employment Division [sic] of the State of Oregon conducted on July 7, 2004, is approved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-15\">According to OJIN, that approval order was filed on September 1, 2004, and entered on September 2; the OJIN entry reads, \u201cOrder Approving Admin Order.\u201d (Boldface omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Mother filed her petition for review seeking <em>de novo </em>review with the circuit court on October 26, 2004. The timeliness of that petition must be determined under ORS 416.427(6), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">\u201cAppeal of the order of the administrative law judge * * * may be taken to the circuit court of the county in which the order has been entered pursuant to ORS 416.440 for a hearing de novo. The appeal shall be by petition for review filed within 60 days after the order has been entered pursuant to ORS 416.440.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">At the beginning of the hearing regarding that petition, the state moved to dismiss, arguing that mother\u2019s appeal was untimely. The trial court granted the state\u2019s motion, determining that mother\u2019s petition for review was not filed within the applicable 60-day period.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">As noted above, the time limitation for filing an appeal of an administrative child support modification order is set out in ORS 416.427(6): The appeal must be \u201cfiled within 60 days after the [ALJ\u2019s] order has been entered pursuant to ORS 416.440.\u201d ORS 416.440, in turn, provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201c(1) The documents required to be filed for purposes of subsection (2) of this section include all the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\u201c(a) A true copy of any order entered, filed or registered by the administrator or administrative law judge pursuant to ORS 416.400 to 416.470 or ORS chapter 110.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">\u00ab\u00edH sfc #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">\u201c(2) The documents described under subsection (1) of this section shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the circuit court * * * in the county where the court order was entered if the administrative order is an order modifying a court order. Upon receipt of the documents, the clerk shall enter the order in the register of the circuit court and shall note in the register that the order creates a lien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">\u201c(3) Upon entry in the register under subsection (2) of this section, the order shall have all the force, effect and attributes of a judgment of the circuit court, including but not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">\u201c(a) Creation of a judgment lien under ORS chapter 18; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201c(b) Ability to be enforced by contempt proceedings and pursuant to ORS 18.252 to 18.850.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">\u201c(4) Notwithstanding subsection (3) of this section, an administrative order modifying a court order shall not become effective until reviewed and approved by the court under ORS 416.425(10).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Our first task, therefore, is to determine when the ALJ\u2019s order was \u201centered pursuant to ORS 416.440.\u201d ORS 416.427(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">ORS 416.440(2) specifies that entry of the order must be \u201cin the register of the circuit court.\u201d The Supreme Court has explained that \u201c \u2018entered in the register\u2019 * * * refers to the formal entry of the document in the court\u2019s register as described in ORS 7.020.\u201d <em>Ryerse v. Haddock, </em>337 Or 273, 276, 95 P3d 1120 (2004) (footnote and citation omitted). ORS 7.020 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\u201cThe register is a record wherein the clerk or court administrator shall enter, by its title, every action, suit or proceeding commenced in, or transferred or appealed to, the court, according to the date of its commencement, transfer or appeal. Thereafter, the clerk or court administrator shall note therein all the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-8\">\u201c(1) The date of any filing of any paper or process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-9\">\u201c(2) The date of making, filing and entry of any order, judgment, ruling or other direction of the court in or concerning such action, suit or proceeding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-10\">\u201c(3) Any other information required by statute, court order or rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">The register for Oregon circuit courts is OJIN.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, to determine when the ALJ\u2019s order was entered in the register so as to begin the 60-day period, we consult OJIN. We conclude that the order was not entered in OJIN until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>September 2, the first date that an OJIN entry refers to the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">In the context of an inaccurate OJIN entry regarding a judgment, we have observed that \u201cfor the register to be meaningful and useful, both as a public record and as a tool of judicial administration, it must accurately describe <em>what </em>is filed and not merely <em>when </em>it is filed.\u201d <em>Patrick v. Otteman, </em>158 Or App 175, 186, 974 P2d 217, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 594 (1999). That reasoning applies with equal force when a register entry makes no reference at all to the existence of an order. Here, the August 9 entry, although accurate as far as it went, did not describe the filing of the administrative order. Although the clerk received a copy of the ALJ\u2019s order with the certification, no entry in OJIN reflects that an administrative order was entered at that time; instead, OJIN refers to the filing and entry of a \u201cCertificate Circuit Court\u201d on August 9. That entry, which contained no reference to the administrative order, was insufficient to constitute entry of the ALJ\u2019s order \u201cin the register\u201d pursuant to ORS 416.440(2). The ALJ\u2019s order was not entered in OJIN until September 2, when the trial court\u2019s \u201cOrder Approving Admin Order\u201d was entered, effectively incorporating the ALJ\u2019s order. Thus, mother\u2019s petition for review, filed within 60 days of September 2, was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Because the parties fully briefed the issue whether, under ORS 416.440, the clerk could have entered the ALJ\u2019s order before the trial court had reviewed and approved it, and to provide possible guidance on remand, we note that the clerk was not required to wait to enter the ALJ\u2019s order until it had been approved by the trial court. Rather, when the documents listed in ORS 416.440(1), including the administrative order, are filed, the clerk must enter the administrative order in the register, even if the administrative order will have no effect unless it is reviewed and approved by a circuit court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">ORS 416.440(2) provides that, \u201c[u]pon receipt of the documents [including the administrative order], the clerk shall enter the order in the register of the circuit court and shall note in the register that the order creates a lien.\u201d Although subsection (4) provides that \u201can administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>order modifying a court order shall not become effective until reviewed and approved by the court under ORS 416.425(10),\u201d nothing in that subsection limits the time when an order can be <em>entered. </em>If the legislature had intended to limit entry of orders, it could have written subsection (4) to do so; instead, it chose to limit the <em>effectiveness </em>of an administrative order without limiting its entry into the register. The statute contemplates that orders will be entered when they are filed, without any determination as to their effectiveness, but that those orders that are subject to review under ORS 416.425(10) will not become effective until they are reviewed and approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">We acknowledge that it may seem inefficient to require a party to petition for review of an administrative order that, given the circuit court\u2019s required review, may never become effective. However, it would seem at least equally inefficient to require a circuit court to review an administrative order modifying a court order twice- \u2014 once automatically pursuant to ORS 416.425(10) and again on a party\u2019s petition pursuant to ORS 416.427(6). In any event, our view of the relative merits of such possible approaches does not matter, because the statutory directive is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Because the ALJ\u2019s order was not entered pursuant to ORS 416.440 until September 2, mother\u2019s petition for review to the circuit court was timely filed. Accordingly, we also reverse the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees to father.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-9\"> ORS 416.425, ORS 416.427, and ORS 416.440 were amended by the 2005 legislature. ORS 416.440 was again amended by the 2007 legislature. The amendments do not affect our analysis of the issues in this case. In this opinion, all citations and references to those statutes are to the 2003 versions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b602-16\"> The language regarding presentation for a judge\u2019s signature apparently refers to the requirement that, if the ALJ orders modification of a court order, the ALJ\u2019s order must be \u201creviewed and approved by the court that entered the [original support] order,\u201d and, until such review occurs, the order \u201cis not effective.\u201d ORS 416.425(10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-12\"> ORS 7.095(1) provides that \u201cthe Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may authorize records to be kept by use of electronic data processing equipment.\u201d On June 10, 1986, the Chief Justice issued Order No. 86-36, which authorized the courts of Oregon \u201cto keep their records by the use of electronic data processing equipment.\u201d Then on October 8, 1990, the Chief Justice issued Order No. 90-129, providing that, with exceptions not relevant to this case, for Oregon circuit courts \u201call new entries to the \u2018register,\u2019 as defined by ORS 7.020, * * * shall be maintained in the Oregon Judicial Information Network (OJIN) * *</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
