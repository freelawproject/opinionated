Santos, </em>212 Or App 473, 157 P3d 1233 (2007), in which we held that petitioner\u2019s criminal trial counsel provided inadequate assistance because counsel failed to request a jury instruction on lesser-included offenses and that petitioner was thus entitled to post-conviction relief. Defendant argues in his petition that we misapplied the burden of proof. Specifically, defendant points to our statement that \u201cthere is no indication that [petitioner\u2019s] criminal trial counsel made a tactical decision not to request the instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477. Defendant contends that the burden of proof in a post-conviction case is on the petitioner and, accordingly, that any deficiency in the record concerning whether counsel made a tactical decision cuts against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Defendant did not brief that issue. Rather, as to petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error (concerning counsel\u2019s failure to request the lesser-included offense instruction), defendant argued only that counsel\u2019s failure was not prejudicial to petitioner, thereby implicitly conceding that that was the only issue before us. Petitioner even invited defendant to address the question that defendant now raises, asserting in his appellant\u2019s brief, \u201cDefendant may argue that counsel\u2019s failure to request a lesser-included offense instruction was the result of a tactical decision. The post-conviction court, however, did not make that finding, and, moreover, the record would not have supported it.\u201d Notwithstanding that invitation, defendant\u2019s brief, as noted, focused exclusively on the alleged insufficiency of petitioner\u2019s proof of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Given those circumstances, defendant\u2019s \u201ctactical choice\u201d argument comes too late. As we have explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201cif ORAP 6.25(l)(e) were construed as permitting reconsideration on grounds for affirmance never urged on appeal, that provision would essentially become a catch-all, a resort for the belated ingenuity of losing respondents. That, in turn, could, and would, circumvent and subvert the reasoned sequence of briefing, argument, and decision that is the foundation of Oregon\u2019s appellate process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number><em>State v.
