On appeal, defendant raises numerous challenges to his convictions and sentences. We reject without discussion all of defendant\u2019s assignments of error except his challenge to the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal on his first-degree kidnapping conviction. As explained below, we reverse that conviction and remand the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The convictions arose from an incident in which, during an altercation with the victim, defendant grabbed her, moved her six or seven feet across the room, pinned her against a wall, grabbed her breast, and threatened to kill her. Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the kidnapping charge, arguing that the state\u2019s evidence that he had moved the victim six or seven feet across a room during the incident did not demonstrate an \u201cintent to interfere substantially with [the victim\u2019s] personal liberty\u201d within the meaning of ORS 163.225(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, and the jury subsequently convicted defendant of second-degree kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\"> On appeal, defendant asserts that, under <em>State v. Wolleat, </em>338 Or 469, 111 P3d 1131 (2005), evidence that a defendant moves a victim short distances in the course of the commission of other crimes is insufficient, as a matter of law, to demonstrate the requisite intent to interfere with the victim\u2019s liberty. The state concedes the error. We find the state\u2019s concession to be well-founded and, consequently, accept it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 478 (\u201cMoving a victim from one room to another while committing another crime does not constitute moving the victim a substantial distance. * * * In order to find defendant guilty of kidnapping, a reasonable juror would have to be able to infer that defendant intended either to move the victim a greater distance than he did or to transport her to a place of confinement.\u201d). <em>Cf. State v. Murray, </em>340 Or 599, 606, 136 P3d 10 (2006) (\u201c[E]ven if one were to find some sort of asportation [based on evidence that the defendant shoved the victim from driver\u2019s seat into passenger\u2019s seat during a carjacking], it was only \u2018incidental\u2019 * * * to defendant\u2019s theft of the car and, therefore, not the kind of conduct that the legislature intended to permit to serve as the basis for a separate kidnapping charge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Conviction for second-degree kidnapping reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b199-7\"> The jury also found defendant guilty of third-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.415, but the court merged that conviction with the conviction for first-degree sexual abuse before entering judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\"> ORS 163.225 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-9\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of kidnapping in the second degree if, with intent to interfere substantially with another\u2019s personal liberty, and without consent or legal authority, the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-10\">\u201c(a) Takes the person from one place to another!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
