It suffices to say that plaintiff, who was defendant\u2019s insured, sought attorney fees under ORS 742.061, advancing two alternative \u2014 and independently sufficient \u2014 grounds for why the exception to fee entitlement described in ORS 742.061(3)(b) did not apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant responded, disputing the first ground but advancing no response to the second. The trial court ultimately awarded fees, concluding that the exception to fee entitlement described in ORS 742.061(3)(b) did not apply because of the second, alternative ground that plaintiff had urged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant, for the first time, advances arguments responding to that second, alternative and independently sufficient ground on which the trial court relied in awarding attorney fees. Defendant does not contend on appeal that the trial court\u2019s ruling in that regard constituted error apparent on the face of the record. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In sum, defendant had full opportunity to respond to the contention and ground on which the trial court ultimately relied, and now, for the first time, advances arguments for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>why the trial court should not have done so. Given those circumstances, defendant\u2019s present claim of error was unpreserved for our review. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (\u201c[A] party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Rumler, </em>199 Or App 32, 41,110 P3d 115 (2005) (noting \u201ctwo related questions about preservation that [appellate courts] often ask during oral argument: \u2018If the trial judge were sitting here today, would he or she be surprised by your argument?\u2019 And, \u2018If we were to reverse based on your argument, would the trial court feel \u201cblindsided\u201d by our ruling?\u2019 \u201d); <em>State v.
