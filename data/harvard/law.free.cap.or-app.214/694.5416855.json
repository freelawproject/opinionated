On appeal, he argues that the trial court erred in imposing an upward departure sentence on one of the counts of attempting to elude and that the court erred in imposing consecutive sentences. As explained below, we agree that the upward departure sentences were erroneously imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"ATX\">At sentencing, the court imposed an upward departure sentence of six months on one of the attempting to elude convictions, based on a judicial finding that defendant was not amenable to probation. Defendant asserts that an enhanced sentence based on such judicial factfinding violates the rule of law announced in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). We agree. Defendant is entitled to resentencing because the court imposed an upward departure sentence based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"As5\">Although defendant\u2019s challenge to his sentence is unpreserved, in <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>205 Or App 113, 133 P3d 343, <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>207 Or App 1, 139 P3d 981 (2006), <em>rev allowed, </em>342 Or 256 (2007), we held that the imposition of the departure sentence under similar circumstances constituted plain error. For the reasons set forth in <em>Ramirez, </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"ARM\">Sentences vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
