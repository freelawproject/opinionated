In her sole assignment of error, Shipman contends the court improperly taxed as costs deposition and expert witness expenses, subpoena fees, and court reporting services.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-22\">Civ.R. 54(D) gives the trial court discretion, absent statutory provisions to the contrary, to award costs to the prevailing party \u201cunless the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>otherwise directs.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Gravill, v. Fuerst </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 12, 13, 24 OBR 10, 11, 492 N.E.2d 809, 810; <em>Jones v. Pierson </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 447, 2 Ohio App.3d 447, 442 N.E.2d 791. To determine if an expense is taxable as a cost, the court must determine if it is a properly taxable cost, and, if so, whether it is reasonable to tax costs in a particular case. <em>Bookatz v. Kupps </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App.3d 36, 528 N.E.2d 961; <em>Jones, supra. </em>A taxable cost is a necessary litigation expense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">The trial court erred in taxing as costs the expenses the defendant incurred in obtaining: (1). a liability expert ($49.00); (2) a medical expert ($700.00); and (3) a physician\u2019s fee for attending a deposition ($183.34). Expert witness fees are not taxable costs. <em>Moore v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 259, 18 OBR 314, 480 N.E.2d 1101; <em>Dorko v. Woodruff </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 13, 14, 536 N.E.2d 56, 57; <em>Gold v. Orr Felt Co. </em>(1985), 21 Ohio App.3d 214, 21 OBR 228, 487 N.E.2d 347; <em>Glover v. Massey </em>(Jan. 11, 1990), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 56351 and 56802, unreported, 1990 WL 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Likewise, the transcribing and recording costs for expert witness depositions are not recoverable as costs where, as here, the depositions are not introduced into evidence. <em>Moore, supra; Barrett v. Singer Co. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 7, 14 O.O.3d 122, 396 N.E.2d 218; <em>Dorko, supra; Gold, supra; Glover, supra. </em>Therefore, the court improperly taxed as costs the following items which were never used at trial: (1) the court reporter and transcript costs of the plaintiff\u2019s second deposition ($307.50); (2) the court reporter, transcript and video costs of the deposition of a liability expert ($503.20); (3) the court reporter and video costs of the depositions of a damage expert ($405.00); (4) the court reporter\u2019s fees for the deposition of plaintiff\u2019s expert ($50.00); and (5) one-half the cost of the plaintiff\u2019s expert\u2019s deposition transcript ($134.25).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The trial court also improperly taxed the costs of a court reporter\u2019s issuance of a trial subpoena ($37.00). Where a witness never appears at trial, the cost of the court reporter\u2019s subpoena cannot have been necessary and vital to the litigation and so is not properly assessed against the losing party. See <em>Moore, supra; Barrett, supra; Dorko, supra; Gold, supra; Glover, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Finally, C.P.Sup.R. 12(D)(1) deems the expense of playing a videotape recording at trial taxable against the court, not the losing party. The tape in this case was never played and so the court incorrectly taxed the costs of a court reporter\u2019s attendance ($140.00) for the showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">We conclude the trial court improperly assessed the $2,509.29 as court costs. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>only to the extent that the defendant\u2019s expenses of $2,509.29 be deleted from the court costs assessed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remand\u00e9d.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b368-6\">Francis E.
