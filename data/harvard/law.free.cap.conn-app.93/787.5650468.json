On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) denied his motion for a mistrial and (2) considered certain evidence in determining the fair market value of the property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The subject property, owned by the defendant, is at 56 River Street in New Haven. The plaintiff sought to acquire the property as part of the River Street municipal development plan. On April 3, 2003, the plaintiff filed an application for immediate entry and an order to show cause. The plaintiff sought to enter the defendant\u2019s property to conduct a phase II environmental site assessment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to aid in determining the fair market value of the property. Contemporaneously with the filing of the application, the plaintiff also filed a notice of intention to commence condemnation proceedings in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-193 and 8-129.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>On July 11,2003, the plaintiff filed a notice of condemnation and a statement of compensation. The plaintiff represented that it had obtained an appraisal of the property that estimated its fair market value at $175,000, absent any environmental problems and associated remediation costs. Because of possible environmental contamination, however, the plaintiff determined that compensation of $87,500 was merited, and deposited that amount with the clerk of the court. The certificate of taking was filed with the court on August 4, 2003, and with the city clerk on August 11, 2003. The $87,500 was disbursed to the defendant on September 8, 2003. On October 8, 2004, after a phase II environmental site assessment had been conducted, the plaintiff filed an amended statement of compensation. The plaintiff increased the compensation awarded to the defendant by an additional $87,500, which was deposited with the clerk of the court and disbursed to the defendant on October 13, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">On July 18, 2003, the defendant filed an appeal and application for review of the statement of compensation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-132. The appeal was tried to the court on October 13, 2004, and included testimony by several real estate appraisers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a memorandum of decision filed November 22, 2004, the court determined that the fair market value as of the date of taking, August 11,2002, was $210,000, thus awarding the defendant an additional $35,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. Specifically, he argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>that statements by the court draw into question its impartiality. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The following additional facts are pertinent to the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant was seated at counsel table throughout the course of trial. During testimony by a witness, the defendant closed his eyes. The court then cautioned that if the defendant was asleep, he would be escorted from the courtroom.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A brief recess was then taken. Later in the trial, the defendant moved for a mistrial on the basis of the court\u2019s comment during a recess that the defendant\u2019s \u201cattitude and presence in the court, if it continues in the same state, would work against him . . . .\u201d Specifically, counsel argued that the court\u2019s comment created the impression that the defendant\u2019s unintentional conduct may have turned the court against him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. He now argues that bias was, in fact, evidenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>by the court\u2019s finding of a fair market value lower than that established by the appraisals of the defendant\u2019s experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">\u201cThe standard by which we review a court\u2019s ruling on ... a motion for a mistrial is abuse of discretion. ... In determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion, every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling. . . . Reversal is required only where an abuse of discretion is manifest or where injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wallenta </em>v. <em>Moscowitz, </em>81 Conn. App. 213, 226-27, 839 A.2d 641, cert. denied, 268 Conn. 909, 845 A.2d 414 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">The standard of conduct to which we hold judges is well recognized. \u201cAny conduct that would lead a reasonable [person] knowing all the circumstances to the conclusion that the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned is a basis for the judge\u2019s disqualification. Thus, an impropriety or the appearance of impropriety . . . that would reasonably lead one to question the judge\u2019s impartiality in a given proceeding clearly falls within the scope of the general standard .... The question is not whether the judge is impartial in fact. It is simply whether another, not knowing whether or not the judge is actually impartial, might reasonably question his . . . impartiality, on the basis of all of the circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>55 Conn. App. 602, 608, 740 A.2d 424 (1999), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 255 Conn. 477, 774 A.2d 927 (2001).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cNot every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>departure from the norm, however, is reversible error. Prejudice to the unsuccessful party, or at least the possibility of it, must appear to have occurred before this court will be justified in depriving the successful party of the result of the litigation which, so far as it was affected by his actions, he has obtained by fair means.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lo Sacco </em>v. <em>Young, </em>20 Conn. App. 6, 11, 564 A.2d 610, cert. denied, 213 Conn. 808, 568 A.2d 793 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">We first look to the court\u2019s statement that if the defendant was asleep, he would be escorted from the courtroom. \u201cThe trial court is responsible for maintaining a calm demeanor and the decorum of the courtroom.\u201d Id., 11. Certainly, the presence in the courtroom of persons \u2014 let alone parties \u2014 asleep during court proceedings affects the demeanor and decorum of the proceedings. Accordingly, the court acted within its discretion to caution an apparently sleeping party so as to maintain the decorum of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">We next determine whether the court\u2019s statement, made during a recess, that the defendant\u2019s demeanor may \u201cwork against him\u201d indicated a bias against the defendant on the part of the court. In <em>Joyner, </em>this court noted that it has been rare for our Supreme Court to conclude that a judge should have been recused<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> from a case on the basis of conduct indicating bias against a party. <em>Joyner </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 55 Conn. App. 610. In those few cases, however, the alleged misconduct by the court was more egregious than that demonstrated in the current case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>noted in <em>Joyner </em>that \u201c[i]n a myriad of other cases, the denial of a motion to recuse was upheld because the judge\u2019s impartiality was not sufficiently compromised.\u201d Id., 610.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cA judge ... is a human being, and not the type of unfeeling robot some would expect the judge to be. . . . [A] display of exasperation . . . falls far short of a reasonable cause for disqualification for bias or prejudice under [canon 3 (c) (1)] of the Code of Judicial Conduct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barca </em>v. <em>Barca, </em>15 Conn. App. 604, 614, 546 A.2d 887, cert. denied, 209 Conn. 824, 552 A.2d 430 (1988). Here, we are persuaded that the court\u2019s comments were indicative of exasperation with a defendant whom the court believed was sleeping during the presentation of evidence. The court\u2019s comments, although perhaps not made wisely, were not the equivalent of the court\u2019s conduct in those cases in which we have concluded that the impartiality of the court was compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Moreover, the defendant has failed to show prejudice from the court\u2019s comments. The court increased the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>valuation of the subject property, awarding the defendant an additional $35,000 plus interest. In light of our holding on the defendant\u2019s second claim, which is that the court did not abuse its discretion in arriving at the valuation, we cannot conclude that the defendant was prejudiced by the court\u2019s comments. Accordingly, under the circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly considered certain evidence in determining the fair market value of the property. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court improperly considered opinion evidence, contained within one of the appraisals by the plaintiffs expert, of the load bearing capacity of the soil when that witness had not been qualified as an expert in load bearing capabilities. We agree, but find the error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to the defendant\u2019s claim. During the trial, the court heard testimony on the issue of value from three expert appraisal witnesses, all of whom used the direct sales comparison approach.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendant first presented testimony from John Lo Monte, who determined the value of the subject property on the date of taking to be $430,000. The defendant also presented testimony from Charles Wisnioski, who previously had prepared an appraisal report on behalf of the city. He determined that the updated value of the subject property as of the date of the taking was $282,000. The plaintiff presented testimony from Arthur B. Estrada, who determined that the value of the property at the time of the taking was $175,000. During direct examination of Estrada, the plaintiff asked the witness about the load bearing capa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>bilities of soil along River Street. The defendant objected on the ground that the witness was an appraiser, not a geologist, and the court sustained the objection. Later, when asked about adjustments to his valuation during cross-examination, Estrada referred to the load bearing capacities of the subject property. The defendant asked that the portion of the response concerning the load bearing capacities be stricken and not considered by the court, which the court granted. After making numerous findings about the condition of the subject property and the credibility of the expert testimony, the court valued the property as of the date of taking at $210,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The defendant challenges the court\u2019s valuation of the subject property. \u201cValuation is a matter of fact to be determined by the trier\u2019s independent judgment. . . . Because this is a challenge to the court\u2019s finding of facts, we apply the clearly erroneous standard of review. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Bakery Place Ltd. Partnership, </em>83 Conn. App. 343, 350, 849 A.2d 896 (2004). \u201cWhere, however, some of the facts found [by the trial court] are clearly erroneous and others are supported by the evidence, we must examine the clearly erroneous findings to see whether they were harmless, not only in isolation, but also taken as a whole. ... If, when taken as a whole, they undermine appellate confidence in the court\u2019s fact finding process, a new hearing is required.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Grimm </em>v. <em>Grimm, </em>82 Conn. App. 41, 48, 844 A.2d 855 (2004), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 276 Conn. 377, 886 A.2d 391 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>We begin by examining whether it was proper for the court to make a finding on the load bearing capabilities of the soil<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> when similar testimony offered at trial was stricken as inappropriate because Estrada was not qualified as an expert in geology. \u201c[A]nswers that are stricken are to be disregarded by the [trier of fact] and are also not considered as evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>53 Conn. App. 627, 632, 733 A.2d 237, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 909, 734 A.2d 989 (1999); see also Practice Book \u00a7 5-6 (\u201c[w]henever evidence offered upon trial is objected to as inadmissible, the judicial authority or committee trying such case shall not admit such evidence subject to the objection\u201d). A review of the transcript indicates that no expert, other than Estrada, testified about the load bearing capabilities of the soil.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court\u2019s finding on the load bearing capabilities of the soil, therefore, was not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Moreover, as neither party properly introduced evidence on the load bearing capabilities of the soil, that fact was not at issue. \u201cIt is well settled that [a] judgment cannot be founded on a finding of facts not in issue . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Berglass </em>v. <em>Berglass, </em>71 Conn. App. 771, 783, 804 A.2d 889 (2002). The court sustained the defendant\u2019s objections to the plaintiffs introduction of such evidence and struck the testimony. The defendant, therefore, had no opportunity to cross-examine Estrada on his opinion or to introduce contradictory evidence of the nature of the soil to undermine the credibility of the claim. Accordingly, the court\u2019s reliance on its finding of fact that the load <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>bearing capabilities of the soil were compromised was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We must now examine the court\u2019s factual finding on the valuation of the property as a whole to determine whether the error was harmless. \u201cOur cases have reaffirmed the principle that, because each parcel of real property is in some ways unique, trial courts must be afforded substantial discretion in choosing the most appropriate method of determining the value of a taken property.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Montville </em>v. <em>Antonino, </em>77 Conn. App. 862, 865-66, 825 A.2d 230 (2003). \u201cIn assessing the value of . . . property . . . the trier arrives at his own conclusions by weighing the opinions of the appraisers, the claims of the parties, and his own general knowledge of the elements going to establish value, and then employs the most appropriate method of determining valuation. . . . The trial court has the right to accept so much of the testimony of the experts and the recognized appraisal methods which they employed as he finds applicable; his determination is reviewable only if he misapplies, overlooks, or gives a wrong or improper effect to any test or consideration which it was his duty to regard.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Porter v. Porter, </em>61 Conn. App. 791, 799-800, 769 A.2d 725 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">We look to whether the record, aside from the improperly considered evidence, supports the court\u2019s determination of value. \u201cIn determining the value of a condemned property, [t]he general rule ... is that the proper measure of damages is . . . the market value of the property as improved, in view of all the uses to which it is adaptable and available.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Commissioner of Transportation </em>v. <em>Bakery Place Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 83 Conn. App. 350.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Here, the record reveals that the court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>many factors, including location,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> accessibility<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and environmental conditions<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> in determining the fair market value of the property. Accordingly, the record supports the court\u2019s valuation of the property, notwithstanding the court\u2019s improper mention of the excluded evidence concerning the load bearing capabilities of the soil.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">In assessing the evidence to determine the fair market value of the subject property, the court evaluated the credibility of the expert testimony. \u201cIt is axiomatic that we defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the credibility of witnesses and the weight to afford their testimony.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Montville </em>v. <em>Anton-ino, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 870. Here, the court explicitly rejected the $430,000 valuation offered by the defendant\u2019s expert appraiser, Lo Monte, because the differences in the properties relied on for comparable sales were so great as to render his determination of value, even when adjusted for differences, of little value to the court. The court also determined, however, that the comparable sales and ultimate opinion offered by the plaintiffs expert appraiser, Estrada, were not seriously impugned on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Ultimately, the court\u2019s valuation of the property at $210,000 fell between the two values, $175,000 and $282,000, offered by experts the court deemed credible. Although we agree that the court should not have considered the excluded testimony in determining the property\u2019s value, in light of the evidence before the court and its determinations on the credibility of that evidence, we find that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-11\"> At oral argument, the defendant abandoned his additional claim that the court improperly calculated the interest due to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b812-12\"> Because the defendant did not grant the plaintiff permission to enter the property, a phase I environmental site assessment had been conducted without entering the property on September 1, 2001.

But Your Honor\u2019s comment that his attitude and presence in the court, if it continues in the same state, would work against him, I think gives me the impression that perhaps my client has unintentionally crossed the line. He is a man of almost eighty years. He just came back from Arizona or Nevada where he was in the desert. His eyes are hurting, and it may cause some conduct that Your Honor noted twice, that I clearly did not notice because I\u2019m looking the other direction, but I would respectfully ask for a mistrial because I feel that this is a very important case with regard to everyone concerned, for the city and, especially, for my client, and I feel that there should not be any shadow of doubt cast over these proceedings, and whatever the judgment is of the court, I think it should be unclouded by any concern that his presence in the court might have \u2014 might have turned Your Honor one way or the other. So, with respect, I ask for a mistrial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b815-9\"> The standard is derived from canon 3 (c) (1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA judge should disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (A) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b816-8\"> The defendant, in the alternative, could have preserved his claim by making a motion to have the judge recused from the case.

Similarly, the property\u2019s proximity to the Quinnipiac River does not substantially enhance its fair market value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b822-9\"> The court noted that the property is environmentally contaminated with petroleum byproduct, arsenic and lead, which might exert some downward pressure on value when compared to noncontaminated properties. Because there is no regulatory requirement that the contamination be remediated in connection with construction on the property, as long as the soil is kept on site and the property is blacktopped beyond any building constructed on the property, the court found that the contamination did not dramatically affect its fair market value.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
