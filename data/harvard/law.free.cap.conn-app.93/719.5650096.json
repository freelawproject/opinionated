The petitioner claims on appeal that the court improperly (1) denied his petition for certification to appeal, (2) denied his petition for DNA testing of evidence, (3) denied his motion for a continuance to permit DNA testing, (4) dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus without a hearing and (5) took dispositive action on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus without the petitioner being present. We agree with the petitioner and reverse the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">In 1995, after a trial to the jury, the petitioner was convicted of one count of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A) and three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1). He received a total effective sentence of twenty-five years in prison. This court affirmed the conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>54 Conn. App. 361, 738 A.2d 188, cert. denied, 251 Conn. 910, 739 A.2d 1250 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1171, 120 S. Ct. 1197, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1101 (2000). . On September 11,1998, the petitioner filed an amended habeas petition and, after a trial, the court denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>petition on May 17, 1999. He then filed a petition for certification to appeal, which was denied by the court. The petitioner appealed to this court, claiming that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and improperly failed to determine that his trial counsel\u2019s performance constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. On January 25, 2002, this court dismissed the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the decision of the habeas court. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>68 Conn. App. 1, 2-3, 790 A.2d 463, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 903, 793 A.2d 1089 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">On June 6,2001, the petitioner filed his second habeas petition. On November 12, 2002, he filed an amended petition, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, ineffective assistance of habeas counsel, ineffective assistance of habeas appellate counsel and actual innocence. The petitioner also filed a petition for DNA testing of a sex crime kit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a motion to continue the trial to allow for the DNA testing. On January 5, 2004, the court heard the petitioner\u2019s petition and his motion and denied them both. The court then, sua sponte, dismissed the habeas petition without prejudice. The petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal, which was denied. The petitioner filed a timely appeal with this court. He also filed a motion for articulation of the habeas court\u2019s decision. The court denied the motion for articulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The petitioner first claims that the habeas court abused its discretion when it denied the petition for certification to appeal. The standard of review for a denial of certification to appeal from the dismissal of a habeas petition requires a two step analysis. First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>the petitioner, must demonstrate that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion. Second, if the petitioner can show an abuse of discretion, he must then prove that the decision of the court should be reversed on the merits. See id., 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Here, the determinative issue is whether the court abused its discretion when it denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance and dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus without a hearing. We conclude that it did and, therefore, the court abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The petitioner claims that the court improperly denied his petition for DNA testing of evidence. On January 5, 2004, the court denied that petition, dismissed his habeas petition without prejudice and informed the petitioner that according to Public Acts 2003, No. 03-242, \u00a7 7 (P.A. 03-242),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the petition for DNA testing should be brought before the sentencing court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>The court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the petition for DNA testing and, relying on P.A. 03-242 \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> deferred the matter to the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">We conclude, however, that the court did abuse its discretion when it denied the petitioner\u2019s motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>continuance and dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus in its entirety. The applicable standard of review for the denial of a motion for a continuance is as follows. \u201c[T]he determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. ... A reviewing court is bound by the principle that [e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made. . . . Our role as an appellate court is not to substitute our judgment for that of a trial court that has chosen one of many reasonable alternatives.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Hurdle, 85 Conn. App. 128, 134, 856 A.2d 493, cert. denied, 271 Conn. 942, 861 A.2d 516 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Here, when the court denied the motion for a continuance and dismissed the petitioner\u2019s case, it reasoned that it would not be appropriate to have the case stay inactive on the docket while the petitioner brought his petition for DNA testing to the sentencing court and awaited the results of that testing, even though the petitioner had a statutory right to a hearing pursuant to P.A. 03-242, \u00a7 7. Although we recognize the importance of docket management, it is not in the interest of judicial economy to require the petitioner to file a separate petition with the sentencing court and then to refile a new petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Furthermore, the respondent commissioner of correction would not have suffered any prejudice by allowing the petitioner\u2019s case to remain on the docket until the petition for DNA testing had been decided by the sentencing court. The petitioner, on the other hand, was prejudiced by the denial because any new petition filed would be reached for hearing later than the one he already had filed. There is a substantial due process right in the petitioner\u2019s efforts to prove his actual innocence, particularly because he is incarcerated. The peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>tioner was prejudiced by the denial of his motion for a continuance and the dismissal of his habeas petition. Accordingly, we conclude that the court abused its discretion by denying the petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The court further abused its discretion when it dismissed the petitioner\u2019s case without a hearing. The petitioner made five claims in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, including the actual innocence claim. Even if the court properly had dismissed the actual innocence claim as premature due to the lack of the DNA test results, the petitioner was entitled to a hearing on his newly raised ineffective assistance of counsel claims before the court dismissed the habeas petition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">In <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>230 Conn. 88, 93, 644 A.2d 340 (1994), our Supreme Court stated: \u201cBoth statute and case law evince a strong presumption that a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus is entitled to present evidence in support of his claims. General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (a) provides that [t]he court or judge hearing any habeas corpus shall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts and issues of the case, by hearing the testimony and arguments therein, and inquire fully into the cause of imprisonment, and shall thereupon dispose of the case as law and justice require. In <em>Negron </em>v. <em>Warden, 180 </em>Conn. 153, 158 n.2, 429 A.2d 841 (1980), we noted that whenever a court is legally required to hear a habeas petition, \u00a7 52-470 (a) delineate [s] the proper scope of [the] hearing .... The statute explicitly directs the habeas court to dispose of the case only after hearing the testimony and arguments therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">\u201cIn our case law, we have recognized only one situation in which a court is not legally required to hear a habeas petition. In <em>Negron </em>... we observed that, pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>suant to Practice Book \u00a7 531 [now \u00a7 23-29], [i]f a previous application brought on the same grounds was denied, the pending application may be dismissed without hearing, unless it states new facts or proffers new evidence not reasonably available at the previous hearing. We emphasized the narrowness of our construction of Practice Book \u00a7 531 [now \u00a7 23-29] by holding that dismissal of a second habeas petition without an eviden-tiary hearing is improper if the petitioner either raises new claims or offers new facts or evidence..... <em>Negron </em>therefore strengthens the presumption that, absent an explicit exception, an evidentiary hearing is always required before a habeas petition may be dismissed.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The petitioner raised claims in his amended habeas petition regarding counsel on his direct appeal and on his first habeas appeal. Those claims had not been raised before. Accordingly, at the very least, the petitioner was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on those claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that the court abused its discretion when it dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to reinstate the habeas petition, to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the motion for a continuance and to refer the petition for DNA testing to the sentencing court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-8\"> Although a sex crime kit was prepared after the sexual assault underlying 1 he petitioner's conviction and was submitted as evidence at the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial in 1995, it was never subjected to DNA testing. On October 27, 2003, the petitioner learned that the sex crime kit was still in existence and in the possession of the clerk of the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b746-6\"> \u201cTo prove an abuse of discretion, the petitioner must demonstrate that the [resolution of the underlying claim involves issues that] are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different maimer]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>63 Conn. App. 829, 831, 779 A.2d 165, cert. denied, 258 Conn. 905, 782 A.2d 138 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b746-7\"> Public Acts 2003, No. 03-242, \u00a7 7, codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-102kk, provides: \u201c(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing post-conviction relief, any person who was convicted of a crime and sentenced to incarceration may, at any time during the term of such incarceration, file a petition with the sentencing court requesting the DNA testing of any evidence that is in the possession or control of the Division of Criminal Justice, any law enforcement agency, any laboratory or the Superior Court.

Section 7 (a), codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-1021ck (a), provides in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law governing postconviction relief, any person who was convicted of a crime and sentenced to incarceration may, at any time during the term of such incarceration, file a petition with the sentencing court requesting the DNA testing of any evidence . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) That provision does not prohibit the petitioner from filing a petition with the court. Accordingly, the court, had the authority to entertain the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">We note that when the amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed, prior to the enactment of P.A. 03-242, \u00a7 7, the issue of DNA testing was within the discretion of the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> The respondent argues that the petitioner waived any right to challenge the court\u2019s dismissal of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims when the petitioner\u2019s counsel failed to argue the claims after the petition was dismissed. We disagree. On January 5, 2004, the petitioner was scheduled for a pretrial hearing on the petition requesting DNA testing and the motion for a continuance. It is unreasonable to expect the petitioner\u2019s counsel to have argued the ineffective assistance of counsel claims at that pretrial hearing, particularly after the court, sua sponte, dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Furthermore, it is also unreasonable to expect the petitioner\u2019s counsel to have gone forward with the ineffective assistance of counsel claims when his client was not present and when a hearing on those claims was not scheduled for that day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b751-16\"> In light of our remand, it is unnecessary to reach the petitioner\u2019s fifth issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
