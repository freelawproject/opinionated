J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2u\">This appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation of General Statutes \u00a7 45a-441, our testamentary antilapse statute. The appellant, Kathleen Smaldone,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court on appeal from the Probate Court, which found the statute inoperative in the present case. We disagree and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>The facts are undisputed. On March 1, 1990, John N. Swanson executed a will. The residuary clause contained therein bequeathed, inter alia, \u201cone-half ... of [the residue] property to Hazel Brennan of Guilford, Connecticut, if she survives me . . . .\u201d Brennan died on January 2,2001, seventeen days prior to the testator\u2019s death. Brennan was the testator\u2019s stepdaughter, a relation encompassed by \u00a7 45a-441. The appellant is the child of the deceased legatee, Brennan, and is a residuary legatee in the will, and, thus, was an object of affection of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">On February 9,2001, the will was admitted to probate. In a memorandum of decision dated April 26, 2002, the Probate Court concluded that, as \u00a7 45a-441 \u201cis not operative,\u201d the bequest to Brennan lapsed and passed to the intestate estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, Fred Ruotolo and Charlene Ruotolo, beneficiaries under the will, filed a motion for appeal to the Superior Court. The Probate Court issued a decree allowing the appeal. The appellant thereafter filed a cross appeal. Following a de novo hearing, the court issued a memorandum of decision affirming the judgment of the Probate Court, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the court properly concluded that the antilapse statute does not apply. Section 45a-441 has never been scrutinized by appellate eyes and, thus, presents a question of first impression. Accordingly, our review is plenary. See <em>Genesky </em>v. <em>East Lyme, </em>275 Conn. 246, 252, 881 A.2d 114 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we consider first the text of \u00a7 45a-441 to determine whether it is ambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>ous. The statute provides: \u201cWhen a devisee or legatee, being a child, stepchild, grandchild, brother or sister of the testator, dies before him, and no provision has been made in the will for such contingency, the issue of such devisee or legatee shall take the estate so devised or bequeathed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-441. The bequest in the present case specified \u201cone-half ... of [the residue] property to Hazel Brennan of Guilford, Connecticut, if she survives me . . . .\u201d Because the bequest contained the condition, \u201cif she survives me,\u201d both the Probate Court and the Superior Court concluded that a provision had been made in the will for such contingency. The appellant disagrees, arguing that because the will contained no provision as to the fate of Brennan\u2019s share in the event that she predeceased the testator, a provision had not been made in the will for such contingency. Both readings present plausible interpretations of the salient statutory language. In light of that ambiguity, we turn our attention to extratextual evidence to determine its proper meaning. See General Statutes \u00a7 l-2z.</p>\n<p id=\"A97\">\u201cAccording to our long-standing principles of statutory construction, our fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature. . . . In determining the intent of a statute, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter. ... In construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>omitted.) <em>Regency Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Westmark Partners, </em>70 Conn.

In addition, \u201c[w]here the meaning of a statute is in doubt, reference to legislation in other states and jurisdictions which pertains to the same subject matter, persons, things, or relations may be a helpful source of interpretative guidance.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>196 Conn. 309, 318-19, 493 A.2d 846 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1063, 106 S.

Ed. 2d 787 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">At common law, when a named beneficiary under a will predeceased the testator, the share of the deceased beneficiary passed not to his descendants, but rather \u201clapsed.\u201d See 4 W. Bowe &amp; D. Parker, Page on the Law of Wills (Rev. Ed. 2005) \u00a7 35.15, p. 645; see also <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>97 Conn. 434, 438, 117 A. 489 (1922). Thus, the rule of lapse automatically conditions all devises on the survival of the legatee. \u201cAt common law, all legacies, not affected by substitutionary disposition, became intestate estate whenever the legatee died before the testator.\u201d <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>11 Conn. Sup. 133, 135 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">As Judge O\u2019Sullivan explained in <em>Ackerman, </em>\u201c[s]ome pretty oppressive results were occasioned by these principles which frequently blocked the way for carrying out the testator\u2019s expressed intention. These injustices were most significant in those instances where the will provided legacies for close relatives.\u201d Id. To prevent such a harsh and presumably unintended result, legislatures of the United States in the late eighteenth century <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>began crafting statutes designed to protect certain devises from lapsing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">In 1783, the Massachusetts legislature enacted the first antilapse statute. It provided: \u201cWhen a devise of real or personal estate is made to any child or other relation of the testator, and the devisee shall die before the testator, leaving issue who survive the testator, such issue shall take the estate so devised, in the same manner as the devisee would have done, if he had survived the testator; unless a different disposition thereof shall be made or required by the will.\u201d 1783 Mass. Acts, ch. 24, \u00a7 8, quoted in S. French, \u201cAntilapse Statutes Are Blunt Instruments: A Blueprint for Reform,\u201d 37 Hastings L.J. 335, 339 n.16 (1985). \u201cIn 1810, Maryland went even further and adopted a statute that prevented lapse altogether. . . . These two statutes provided the basic models on which all subsequent antilapse statutes have been constructed.\u201d S. French, 37 Hastings L.J., supra, 339. In England, the Wills Act of 1837 took antilapse statutes across the Atlantic Ocean, providing that \u201cwhen there was a devise or bequest to a child or other issue of the testator, and the child or issue predeceased the testator, leaving issue who survived the testator, the devise or bequest should not lapse, \u2018but shall take effect as if the death of such person had happened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\u2019 \u201d 6 W. Bowe &amp;D. Parker, supra, \u00a7 50.10, p. 91. Today, antilapse statutes have been enacted in every state except Louisiana. \u201c[T]he antilapse statutes in effect across the United States vary significantly [and] so much . . . that no typical or \u2018majority\u2019 antilapse statute exists.\u201d E. Kim-brough, \u201cLapsing of Testamentary Gifts, Antilapse Statutes, and the Expansion of Uniform Probate Code Antilapse Protection,\u201d 36 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 269, 271 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Although varying in scope, all antilapse statutes provide that when a particular devisee predeceases the testator, the devise does not fall into the residue or pass to the testator\u2019s heirs by intestacy, but rather descends to the issue of the predeceased devisee. \u201cAlthough . . . commonly called \u2018antilapse\u2019 statutes, the label is somewhat misleading. Contrary to what the label implies, antilapse statutes do not reverse the common-law rule of lapse because they do not abrogate the law-imposed condition of survivorship. . . . What the statutes actually do is modify the devolution of lapsed devises by providing a statutory substitute gift in the case of specified relatives.\u201d E. Halbach, Jr. &amp; L. Waggoner, \u201cThe UPC\u2019s New Survivorship and Antilapse Provisions,\u201d 55 Alb. L. Rev. 1091,1101 (1992).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With that background in mind, we turn our attention to \u00a7 45a-441.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">OUR ANTILAPSE STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Connecticut\u2019s antilapse statute was enacted in 1821 as part of \u201cAn Act for the settlement of Estates, testate, intestate, and insolvent.\u201d It provided: \u201cWhenever a devi-see or legatee in any last will and testament, being a child or grand-child of the testator, shall die before the testator, and no provision shall be made for such contingency, the issue, if any there be, of such devisee or legatee, shall take the estate devised or bequeathed, as the devisee or legatee would have done, had he or she survived the testator; and if there be no such issue, at the time of the testator\u2019s death, the estate disposed of by such devise or legacy, shall be considered and treated as intestate estate.\u201d General Statutes (1821 Rev.) tit. 32, ch. 1, \u00a7 4. The antilapse statute today provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>that \u201c[w]hen a devisee or legatee, being a child, stepchild, grandchild, brother or sister of the testator, dies before him, and no provision has been made in the will for such contingency, the issue of such devisee or legatee shall take the estate so devised or bequeathed.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-441. Other than adding siblings and stepchildren to the class of applicable devisees and legatees; see Public Acts 1987, No. 87-355, \u00a7 2; no substantive change has been made to our antilapse statute since 1821. Moreover, the pertinent language at issue in the present dispute, namely, <em>\u201cand no provision shall be made for such contingency,\u2019\u2019 </em>was part of the original 1821 statute and remains unaltered today.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Plainly, the purpose underlying our antilapse statute is the prevention of unintended disinheritance. Its passage reflects a legislative determination that, as a matter of public policy, when a testator fails to provide for the possibility that a particular beneficiary might predecease him, the lineal descendants of that beneficiary take the applicable share.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In the years since its enactment, Connecticut courts have stated that the antilapse statute is remedial and should receive a liberal construction. See, e.g., <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>supra, 97 Conn. 438; <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>supra, 11 Conn. Sup. 135-36. When a dispute arises regarding application of that statute, therefore, the burden rests on the party seeking to deny the statutory protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Under Connecticut law, the antilapse statute applies unless a \u201cprovision has been made in the will for such contingency....\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 45a-441. A review of the antilapse statutes presently in effect in forty-eight other jurisdictions reveals that this language is unique to our statute. It is not disputed that the \u201ccontingency\u201d referenced in \u00a7 45a-441 is the death of a devisee or legatee prior to that of the testator. What is contested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>is the proper construction of the \u201cprovision has been made in the will\u201d language.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The appellees contend that inclusion of words of survivorship in a will constitutes a provision for such contingency, thereby rendering the antilapse statute inapplicable. Because the bequest in the present case contains the condition \u201cif she survives me,\u201d they claim \u00a7 45a-441 is inoperative. That simple and seemingly persuasive argument fails, however, on closer examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">First, it is significant that the language at issue dates back to 1821, the inception of our antilapse statute. The first antilapse statute, enacted in Massachusetts in 1783, provided that it would apply \u201cunless a different disposition thereof shall be made or required by the will.\u201d 1783 Mass. Acts, ch. 24, \u00a7 8, quoted in S. French, supra, 37 Hastings L.J. 339 n.16. The Maryland statute enacted in 1810 contained no such condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Like every other antilapse statute that followed, ours was modeled on those statutes. Today, amajority of jurisdictions contain some variation of the \u201cunless a different disposition thereof\u2019 condition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See Ark.

Thus, although the precise wording of the condition in our antilapse statute is unique, its existence is not. Like other states, Connecticut enacted its statute to counteract the harsh results of the common-law rule of lapse. Like other states, Connecticut conditioned operation of the antilapse statute on the intent of the testator as expressed in the will. Accordingly, the critical inquiry is whether an intent contrary to \u00a7 45a-441 is so manifested.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Our inquiry into whether words of survivorship evince a contrary intent sufficient to defeat the antilapse statute is guided by the following principles. Antilapse statutes \u201cwill apply unless testator\u2019s intention to exclude its operation is shown with reasonable certainty.\u201d 6 W. Bowe &amp; D. Parker, supra, \u00a7 50.11, p. 96. Section 5.5 of the Restatement (Third) of Property, Wills and Other Donative Transfers (1999), addresses anti-lapse statutes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Comment (f) to that section provides in relevant part: \u201cAntilapse statutes establish a strong rule of construction, designed to carry out presumed intention. They are based on the constructional preference against disinheriting a line of descent .... Consequently, these statutes should be given the widest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>possible sphere of operation and should be defeated only when the trier of fact determines that the testator wanted to disinherit the line of descent headed by the deceased devisee.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third), Property, Wills and Other Donative Transfers \u00a7 5.5, comment (f), p. 383 (1999). Hence, the burden is on those who seek to deny the statutory protection rather than on those who assert it.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Finally, we are mindful that our statute was enacted to <em>prevent </em>operation of the rule of lapse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our statute is remedial in nature and must be liberally construed. <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>supra, 97 Conn. 438; <em>Ackerman </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>supra, 11 Conn. Supp. 135-36. Accordingly, we resolve any doubt in favor of the operation of \u00a7 45a-441.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The bequest at issue states, \u201cone-half ... of [the residue] property to Hazel Brennan of Guilford, Connecticut, <em>if she survives me </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Our task is to determine the significance of those words of survivorship. While the present case is one of first impression in Connecticut, numerous other states have considered the question of whether words of survivor-ship, such as \u201cif she survives me,\u201d demonstrate a contrary intent on the part of the testator sufficient to negate operation of the antilapse statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">OTHER AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Whether words of survivorship alone constitute sufficient evidence of a contrary intent on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>testator so as to prevent application of the antilapse statute is a question on which sibling authority is split. Some courts have concluded that words of survivorship demonstrate sufficient contrary intent. Illustrative of that line of cases is <em>Bankers Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>257 Iowa 938, 135 N.W.2d 607 (1965). In that case, the Supreme Court of Iowa stated: \u201cThe bequest to Mary in Item III is conditioned on her surviving the testator. We have held many times . . . that our antilapse statute . . . does not apply to a bequest so conditioned. . . . This is on the theory that a bequest to one \u2018if she survives me\u2019 manifests an intent that the bequest would lapse if the named beneficiary dies before the testator.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 945; see also <em>In re Estate of Todd, </em>17 Cal. 2d 270, 109 P.2d 913 (1941); <em>In re Estate of Stroble, </em>6 Kan. App. 2d 955, 960, 636 P.2d 236 (1981) (\u201cwhen the testator uses words of survivorship in the will expressing an intent that the legatee shall take the gift only if he outlives the testator, the statute against lapses has no application and the expressed intention of the testator is controlling\u201d); <em>Slattery </em>v. <em>Kelsch, </em>734 S.W.2d 813 (Ky. App. 1987); <em>In re Holtforth\u2019s Estate, </em>298 Mich. 708, 299 N.W. 776 (1941); <em>In re Robinson\u2019s Will, </em>37 Misc. 2d 546, 236 N.Y.S.2d 293 (1963); <em>Hummell </em>v. <em>Hummell, </em>241 N.C. 254, 85 S.E.2d 144 (1954); <em>In re Estate of Burns, </em>78 S.D. 223, 228, 100 N.W.2d 399 (1960) (\u201cif the testator uses words indicating an intention that the named beneficiary shall take the gift only if he outlives the testator, there is nothing upon which the statute can operate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Underlying that view is the presumption that the testator knowingly and deliberately included the words of survivorship. As one New York court explained: \u201c [T]hese words were used by the testator in a will drawn by an experienced attorney. Some meaning must be attributed to them \u2014 and the meaning is clear \u2014 that sur-vivorship was a condition precedent to the receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the residuary estate. If words were held to be devoid of meaning, then this court would be rewriting the testator\u2019s will.\u201d <em>In re Robinson's Will, </em>supra, 37 Misc. 2d 548. That presumption has pitfalls of its own, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Inclusion of words of survivorship provides neither objective evidence that a conversation about \u00a7 45a-441 took place nor objective evidence that the testator considered seriously the possibility of nonsurvival or inquired about the meaning of expressions such as \u201clapsed bequest\u201d and the protections of the antilapse statute. \u201cBecause such a survival provision is often boiler-plate form-book language, the testator may not understand that such language could disinherit the line of descent headed by the deceased devisee. When the testator is older than the devisee and hence does not expect the devisee to die first ... it seems especially unlikely that a provision requiring the devisee to survive the testator was intended to disinherit the devisee\u2019s descendants.\u201d 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 5.5, comment (h), p. 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">At oral argument, counsel for the appellees alleged that inclusion of the words \u201cif she survives me\u201d indicates that the testator intended for the bequest to Brennan to lapse. While plausible, it remains conjecture nonetheless.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As one commentary aptly stated: \u201cThe argument can reasonably be extended to urge that the use of words of survivorship indicates that the testator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>considered the possibility of the devisee dying first and intentionally decided not to provide a substitute gift to the devisee\u2019s descendants. The negative inference in this argument, however, is speculative. It may or may not accurately reflect reality and actual intention. It is equally plausible that the words of survivorship are in the testator\u2019s will merely because, with no such intention, the testator\u2019s lawyer used a will form containing words of survivorship. The testator who went to lawyer X and ended up with a will containing devises with a survivorship requirement could by chance have gone to lawyer Y and ended up with a will containing devises with no survivorship requirement \u2014 with no different intention on the testator\u2019s part from one case to the other.\u201d E. Halbach, Jr. &amp; L. Waggoner, supra, 55 Alb. L. Rev. 1112-13. Furthermore, words of survivorship \u201cmight very well be no more than a casual duplication of the survivorship requirement imposed by the rule of lapse, with no independent purpose. Thus, they are not necessarily included in the will with the intention of contradicting the objectives of the antilapse statute.\u201d Id., 1109-10. As this court recently observed, \u201c[speculation and conjecture have no place in appellate review.\u201d <em>Narumanchi </em>v. <em>DeStefano, </em>89 Conn. App. 807, 815, 875 A.2d 71 (2005). Put simply, the intent of the testator cannot definitely be discerned on the basis of words of survivorship alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">If he intended the bequest to lapse, the testator could have explicitly so provided. The testator also could have made an alternative devise, which \u201cindicates a contrary intent, and hence overrides an antilapse statute . . . .\u201d 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 5.5, comment (g), p. 384; see also E. Halbach, Jr. &amp; L. Waggoner, supra, 55 Alb. L. Rev. 1110 (when actually intended to call for result contrary to antilapse statute, words of survivor-ship likely to be accompanied by additional language). That the testator did neither in the present case informs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>our consideration of whether he intended disinheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The argument is further weakened by the fact that, under the interpretation of \u00a7 45a-441 provided by the Probate Court and the Superior Court, the result is not merely that Brennan\u2019s share lapses; her share passes to the intestate estate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thus, at its crux, the contention of the appellees asks us to presume that, although not explicitly provided for, the testator <em>intended </em>intestacy as to Brennan\u2019s share. That argument confounds Connecticut law, which presumes that a testator designed by his will to dispose of his entire estate and to avoid intestacy as to any part of it. See, e.g., <em>Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. Stevens, 164 Conn. 31, 41, 316 A.2d 768 (1972); <em>Hartford-Connecticut Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Hartford </em>Hospital, 141 Conn. 163, 172, 104 A.2d 356 (1954); <em>Ansonia National Bank </em>v. <em>Kunkel, </em>105 Conn. 744, 750, 136 A. 588 (1927); <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>105 Conn. 98, 112, 134 A. 530 (1926). In addition, the bequest to Brennan was residuary in nature. \u201cResiduary language expresses an intention to . . . avoid intestacy.\u201d <em>Hechtman </em>v. <em>Savitsky, </em>62 Conn. App. 654, 663, 772 A.2d 673 (2001); see also <em>Hartford Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>85 Conn. 134, 139, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>81 A. 1057 (1912). Indulging in the presumption that the testator intended to avoid intestacy militates against a finding that he intended for Brennan\u2019s share to lapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Another presumption bears consideration. In <em>Clifford </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>supra, 97 Conn. 438, our Supreme Court, quoting 2 J. Alexander, Commentaries on Wills, \u00a7 874, stated that \u201cthe testator is presumed to know the law and that his will is drawn accordingly.\u201d As one court has noted, however, \u201c[w]ith respect to any individual, the argument of knowledge and approval of the state law is sheer fiction.\u201d <em>Trimble </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>430 U.S. 762, 775 n.16, 97 S. Ct. 1459, 52 L. Ed. 2d 31 (1977). Discounting that observation, the presumption is revealing nevertheless. If we must presume that the testator was aware of our antilapse statute, we must also equally presume that he was aware that it is remedial in nature and provided a liberal construction in Connecticut. In that event, the testator would have known that any ambiguity arising from the probate of his will, absent an express indication to the contrary, would be resolved in favor of operation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Alternatively, another line of cases from various jurisdictions concludes that words of survivorship alone are insufficient to defeat an antilapse statute. As the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia stated, \u201cIn order to prevent application of the [antilapse] statute ... a testator must clearly and unequivocally indicate his intent that the statute not apply.\u201d <em>Kubiczky </em>v. <em>Wesbanco Bank Wheeling, </em>208 W. Va. 456, 460, 541 S.E.2d 334 (2000); see also <em>In re Estate of Bulger, </em>224 Ill. App. 3d 456, 586 N.E.2d 673 (1991); <em>Galloupe </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>248 Mass. 196, 142 N.E. 818 (1924); <em>In re Estate of Ulrikson, </em>290 N.W.2d 757, 759 (Minn. 1980); <em>Royston </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>842 S.W.2d 876, 880 (Mo. App. 1992); <em>Estate of Kehler, </em>488 Pa. 165, 411 A.2d 748 (1980); <em>In re Estate of Allmond, </em>10 Wash. App. 869, 520 P.2d 1388, review denied, 84 Wash. 2d 1004 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>A similar case is <em>Detzel </em>v. <em>Nieberding, 7 </em>Ohio Misc. 262, 219 N.E.2d 327 (Prob. Ct. 1966). In <em>Detzel, </em>the will provided in relevant part, \u201cTo my beloved sister, Mary Detzel, provided she be living at the time of my death . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 263. Mary Detzel predeceased the testator. Id. In considering the operation of Ohio\u2019s antilapse statute, the court noted that \u201c[a]ntilapse statutes are remedial and should receive a liberal construction\u201d; id., 267; echoing a precept shared by Connecticut law. Accordingly, \u201c[a]ll doubts are to be resolved in favor of the operation of the antilapse statute . . . . [T]o render [the] statute inoperative contrary intent of testator must be plainly indicated.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 266-67. The court continued: \u201cTo prevent operation of the Ohio antilapse statute when a devise is made to a relative conditioned upon the survival of the testator by the relative, and the relative predeceases the testator leaving issue who survive the testator, it is necessaiy that the testator, in apt language, make an alternative provision in his will providing that in the event such relative predeceases or fails to survive the testator such devise shall be given to another specifically named or identifiable devisee or devisees.\u201d Id., 274. Although we do not agree that the only way to negate operation of an antilapse statute is by providing an alternate devise, <em>Detzel </em>is persuasive nevertheless. <em>Detzel </em>has never been reversed, although another Ohio court characterized it as \u201cclearly and completely erroneous.\u201d <em>Shalkhauser v. Beach, </em>14 Ohio Misc. 1, 6, 233 N.E.2d 527 (Prob. Ct. 1968). The Uniform Probate Code, however, seems to agree with the logic of <em>Detzel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">In 1990, a revised Uniform Probate Code was promulgated, which contained a substantially altered antilapse statute. Notably, \u00a7 2-603 (b) (3) provides that \u201cwords of survivorship, such as in a devise to an individual \u2018if he survives me,\u2019 or in a devise to \u2018my surviving children,\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>are not, in the absence of additional evidence, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section.\u201d Unif. Prob. Code \u00a7 2-603 (b) (3). The comment to that section explains that this expansion of antilapse protection was necessary because \u201can anti-lapse statute is remedial in nature .... [T]he remedial character of the statute means that it should be given the widest possible latitude to operate\u201d in considering whether in an individual case there is an indication of a contrary intent sufficiently convincing to defeat the statute. Id., comment. The Restatement Third of Property agrees; see 1 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 5.5, comment (f), p. 383; and that proposition is consonant with Connecticut law. In sum, we agree with those jurisdictions that have held that mere words of survivor-ship do not defeat antilapse statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Our antilapse statute was enacted to prevent operation of the rule of lapse and unintended disinheritance. The statute is remedial and receives a liberal construction. Any doubts are resolved in favor of its operation. We therefore conclude that words of survivorship, such as \u201cif she survives me,\u201d alone do not constitute a \u201cprovision\u201d in the will for the contingency of the death of a beneficiary, as the statute requires, and thus are insufficient to negate operation of \u00a7 45a-441. Our conclusion today effectuates the intent of the General Assembly in enacting this remedial statute. Should a testator desire to avoid application of the antilapse statute, the testator must either unequivocally express that intent or simply provide for an alternate bequest. Because the testator in the present case did neither, the protections of the antilapse statute apply. Accordingly, the bequest to Brennan does not lapse, but rather descends to her issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-12\"> Kathleen Smaldone is also known as Kathleen Ziegler.
