J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGd\">The defendant, William Loughlin, Jr., appeals from the judgment of the trial court dissolving his marriage to the plaintiff, Sharon Loughlin, and claims that certain of the court\u2019s financial orders were improper. He argues that the court improperly (1) relied on the length of the parties\u2019 entire relationship, rather than that of the marriage at issue,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82, (2) considered the needs of the parties\u2019 adult children and a grandchild when fashioning its award of alimony to the plaintiff, and (3) ordered that the defendant pay a portion of the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees. We agree that the court relied on improper considerations in crafting its financial orders and, accordingly, reverse the judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant. The parties initially were married from 1981 to 1992. Their three children were bom during that marriage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Within a year or so of the 1992 divorce, the parties resumed cohabiting. In 1998, they remarried. The judgment of dissolution that is the subject of this appeal was rendered in 2004. At that time, the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>children were twenty-two, twenty and sixteen years old. The middle child, who was unmarried, recently had become a mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">During the period of time that the parties were cohabiting but unmarried, the plaintiff attended nursing school, receiving an associate\u2019s degree in 1996. Thereafter, she worked in various nursing positions. The defendant also pursued his education at that time, completing a bachelor\u2019s degree primarily between 1993 and 1998 and, subsequently, a master\u2019s degree. He began working at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in 1986 and remained with that employer through the time of the second divorce. In 2000, the parties purchased a house for $315,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2001, the defendant accepted an assignment from his employer that required him to live in Turkey. After his departure, the parties grew apart and, in October, 2003, the plaintiff filed for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"pAT\">A hearing was held on June 9 and 10, 2004, at which each of the parties testified. At the time of the hearing, the plaintiff was forty years old and the defendant was forty-three. The plaintiffs annual full-time salary was determined to be $52,676 and the defendant\u2019s, $153,495.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The parties were in partial agreement as to the terms of a proposed property division and financial orders. They disagreed, however, as to the specifics of an alimony award, particularly as to its term, and to the distribution of the marital residence and the defendant\u2019s retirement accounts. The defendant was willing to pay alimony for two and one-half years, while the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>requested a permanent award. With respect to the residence, the defendant was willing to transfer his interest therein to the plaintiff in exchange for $60,500. As to his retirement accounts, he submitted that only the amounts accrued during the second marriage were at issue and requested that they be awarded to him in full. The plaintiff requested the residence outright and 50 percent of the entire value of the defendant\u2019s retirement accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The court rendered an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing and, thereafter, reduced its judgment to writing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to the court\u2019s judgment, the parties were awarded joint legal custody of their one minor child, the sixteen year old son. The son\u2019s primary residence was to be with the plaintiff, and the defendant was ordered to pay $272 weekly in child support and provide for the son\u2019s health insurance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">With respect to the distribution of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities, the defendant was ordered to transfer his interest in the marital home, and all of its contents, to the plaintiff,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the defendant was awarded the entirety of his 401 (k) retirement account.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court considered the equity in the home and the value of the defendant\u2019s 401 (k) to be roughly equal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant was to assume responsibility for payment of the elder daughter\u2019s student loan and to pay for the entirety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the son\u2019s college education.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The parties were to divide equally the expenses of the younger daughter\u2019s attendance at a community college.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant also was to repay the younger daughter\u2019s automobile loan.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant additionally was to convey to the plaintiff, by way of a qualified domestic relations order, 50 percent of the current value of his pension, which had accrued over the whole of his employment at Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Finally, the court ordered him to pay $7500 of the plaintiffs attorney\u2019s fees, which totaled $10,000. The plaintiff was to be responsible for her own car- loan<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and a credit card account.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">With respect to alimony, the court ordered the defendant to pay the plaintiff $600 weekly for twelve years. The court explained that it set the alimony rate at an amount that essentially would cover the mortgage payment on the marital home and set its term for the amount of time left on the mortgage.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It specified that the duration of the alimony would be nonmodifiable by either party. The court further ordered the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>to obtain life insurance, initially naming the children as beneficiaries and then, once the children reached the age of twenty-three, naming the plaintiff as beneficiary for the duration of the alimony obligation and in a declining amount equal to the remaining alimony payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The defendant thereafter filed motions to reargue and for articulation. In his motion to reargue, he took issue with the term of the alimony award, his failure to receive any interest in the marital residence, the awarding of one half of his pension to the plaintiff and the requirement that he pay a portion of her attorney\u2019s fees. A hearing on the motions was held on June 29, 2004, at which the court further articulated some of the reasoning underlying its orders. The court also issued a written articulation on September 30, 2004. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">At the outset, we note the standard of review governing the defendant\u2019s claims. \u201cWe review financial awards in dissolution actions under an abuse of discretion standard. ... In order to conclude that the trial court abused its discretion, we must find that the court either incorrectly applied the law or could not reasonably conclude as it did. ... In making those determinations, we allow every reasonable presumption ... in favor of the correctness of [the trial court\u2019s] action.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>82 Conn. App. 768, 772, 847 A.2d 1017 (2004), aff'd, 275 Conn. 348, 880 A.2d 872 (2005). To the extent that the defendant\u2019s claims require us to interpret the statutes governing dissolution of marriage, however, our review is plenary. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>86 Conn. App. 719, 724, 862 A.2d 326 (2004). We now turn to the issues on appeal. Additional facts will be provided where pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The defendant claims first that, in fashioning its financial orders, the court improperly relied on the total length of the parties\u2019 relationship rather than on the length of their second marriage only, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">A trial court in a dissolution action, when dividing the parties\u2019 property and determining whether, or how much of, an alimony award is warranted, is guided by factors enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82, respectively. Both statutes provide for the court\u2019s consideration of <em>\u201cthe length of the marriage, </em>the causes for the . . . dissolution of the marriage . . . the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate and needs of each of the parties . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a); see also General Statutes \u00a7 46b-81 (c). Section 46b-81 further directs the court, when effecting a property distribution, to consider the parties\u2019 liabilities, their opportunities for future acquisition of capital assets and income and their contributions toward their respective estates. General Statutes \u00a7 46-81 (c). Section 46b-82 provides additionally that the court, when considering alimony, should take into account the orders it made pursuant to \u00a7 46b-81, and, in the case of a parent to whom the custody of minor children has been awarded, the desirability of such parent\u2019s securing employment. General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82 (a). For both statutes, however, the specified criteria are not exhaustive, and the court properly may consider other equitable factors when crafting its property distribution and alimony orders. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>187 Conn. 70, 72, 444 A.2d 234 (1982); <em>Demartino </em>v. <em>Demartino, </em>79 Conn. App. 488, 500, 830 A.2d 394 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">The defendant claims that the court here, in fashioning its orders, improperly relied on the total length of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>the parties\u2019 relationship rather than on the \u201clength of the marriage\u201d as contemplated by the statutes. According to the defendant, the total length of the parties\u2019 relationship was \u201ca critical factor\u201d underlying the court\u2019s decision to award twelve years of alimony and that consideration was not one authorized by \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 or 46b-82.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He argues that the court\u2019s approach \u201ceffectively recognize[d] cohabitation as a marital status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The following additional facts and procedural history are pertinent to the claim. When testifying at the June 9, 2004 hearing, the plaintiff stated that during the time the parties lived together but were not married, she and the defendant lived like husband and wife. She testified that she thought the court should look at the marriage as longer than six years because she and the defendant had \u201cbeen together for almost twenty-three years.\u201d According to the plaintiff, during the six year period between the two marriages, \u201ceven though [she and the defendant] weren\u2019t remarried, [they] acted as if [they] were married.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The court apparently found this testimony persuasive, as evidenced by remarks it made at several junctures in the proceedings. To begin, it prefaced its oral pronouncement of the alimony award with the following comment: \u201cWell, first of all, obviously we go back to 1981 in some respects . . . it\u2019s a long-term relationship which maybe . . . should have been severed permanently but it wasn\u2019t, and here we are back again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Thereafter, at the June 29, 2004 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions to reargue and for articulation, the court explained that in fashioning its orders, it had \u201cconsidered the totality of their relationships.\u201d It elaborated further that it \u201csaw [the plaintiff] from sixteen years old [and that she and the defendant had] stayed together all those years.\u201d The court reiterated, \u201cIt goes back to sixteen years old, unfortunately. Right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Finally, in its September 30, 2004 written articulation, the court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiff helped support the family while the defendant earned a bachelor\u2019s [degree] and master\u2019s degree at night,\u201d events that occurred in substantial part during the parties\u2019 period of unmarried cohabitation. It again stated explicitly that it \u201cconsidered the totality of the relationship between the parties.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[t]he plaintiff had devoted almost twenty-four years to the relationship\u201d and stated in conclusion that it \u201cdid not feel constrained in its decision by the length of the second marriage, which lasted from [1998] to 2004. . . . The plaintiff was awarded alimony for twelve years nonmodifiable as to the term so that she would be able to live in the family home until the mortgage [loan] was paid in full.\u201d It is clear from the foregoing comments that the court, in fashioning its financial orders, considered not only the six year marriage, which was the subject of the current dissolution action, but also the parties\u2019 six years of unmarried cohabitation and, further, their initial eleven year marriage, the dissolution of which was adjudicated in a previous action.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">To begin, pursuant to the unambiguous language employed in \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 (c) and 46b-82 (a), the statutory factor of \u201clength of the marriage\u201d contemplates only the marriage presently being dissolved. \u201cMarriage\u201d repeatedly is referred to in the singular and, moreover, it is unlikely that the drafters of the statutes, when compiling lists of considerations for courts to weigh, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>had in mind the unusual circumstance of serial marriages between the same parties. As to cohabitation, it cannot reasonably be argued that that living arrangement is encompassed within the plain meaning of \u201cmarriage.\u201d Because \u201cprior marriages of the parties\u201d and \u201ccohabitation prior to marriage\u201d are not factors specifically enumerated in \u00a7 46b-82 (a), the question thus presented is whether the court here properly took into account the parties\u2019 entire relationship history as an additional equitable consideration. See <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 187 Conn. 72; <em>Demartino </em>v. <em>Demartino, </em>supra, 79 Conn. App. 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">When the parties first were divorced in 1992, they reassumed the legal status of two single people, regardless of their intentions. See General Statutes 46b-67 (b) (\u201cdecree of . . . dissolution shall give the parties the status of unmarried persons\u201d); see also <em>Hames </em>v. <em>Hames, </em>163 Conn. 588, 594, 316 A.2d 379 (1972) (\u201c[i]n the eyes of the law ... a divorced pair could be but two single persons desirous of acquiring marital status\u201d). The fact that they soon recommenced living together did nothing to alter that status.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">With respect to the effect of cohabitation by those who hold themselves out as husband and wife, the law of this jurisdiction is clear. \u201cAlthough other jurisdictions may recognize common-law marriage or accord legal consequences to informal marriage relationships, Connecticut definitely does not. ... It follows that although two persons cohabit and conduct themselves as a married couple, our law neither grants to nor imposes upon them marital status.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>McAnerney v. McAnerney, </em>165 Conn. 277, 285, 334 A.2d 437 (1973); see also <em>Hames </em>v. <em>Hames, </em>supra, 163 Conn. 592-93, 597; <em>State ex rel. Felson </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>129 Conn. 427, 432, 29 A.2d 306 (1942). \u201cThe rights and obligations that attend a valid marriage simply do not arise where the parties choose to cohabit outside the marital relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ship.\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Catalano, </em>202 Conn. 333, 339, 521 A.2d 142 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Consistent with those principles, property and support disputes between unmarried cohabitants must be resolved by means outside the statutory scheme for dissolution of marriages, typically, under general contract principles. See, e.g., id.; <em>Herring </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>70 Conn. App. 649, 805 A.2d 718 (2002); see also 6 A. Rutkin, Family Law &amp; Practice (2005) \u00a7 65.03 [1] [a] (\u201c[C]ohabitation in and of itself does not create any support obligation for either party. Any \u2018support\u2019 obligation must arise from the terms of a cohabitation agreement.\u201d). The property rights of cohabitants \u201care not based on the equitable distribution provisions of the marriage and divorce laws because the judicial recognition of mutual property rights between unmarried cohabitants would violate the policy of the state to strengthen and preserve the integrity of marriage, as demonstrated by its abolition of common-law marriage.\u201d 24 Am. Jur. 2d 644-45, Divorce &amp; Separation \u00a7 494 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">In <em>Gurliacci </em>v. <em>Mayer, </em>218 Conn. 531, 562-64, 590 A.2d 914 (1991), our Supreme Court, like courts in most other jurisdictions, refused to recognize a husband\u2019s lost consortium claim, which was based on an injury to his wife that occurred prior to the couple\u2019s marriage. The court explained the rationale for the marital relation requirement, noting that it \u201cform[ed] the necessary touchstone to determine the strength of commitment between the two individuals which gives rise to the existence of consortium between them in the first instance.\u201d Id., 564. The requisite level of commitment thus could not be presumed from cohabitation alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">In <em>Eisenbaum </em>v. <em>Eisenbaum, </em>44 Conn. App. 605, 691 A.2d 25 (1997), we had occasion to address indirectly the question of whether the statutory authorization for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>alimony was applicable to cohabitants with a history of marriage. In <em>Eisenbaum, </em>a previously married and divorced couple resumed cohabitating and, thereafter, had two children together. Id., 606. The parties then separated, and the plaintiff brought an action seeking child support and custody.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Id., 607. The defendant appealed from a pendente lite order requiring that he pay certain household expenses, arguing that the order was not for child support but, rather, disguised alimony. Id., 607-608. This court upheld the order, but only in part. Specifically, we sustained the order only to the extent that the trial court\u2019s characterization thereof, as \u201cin kind child support,\u201d was consistent with the evidence. With respect to a credit card bill, we concluded that the court had no authority to order its payment under the guise of child support, because there was no evidence that such payment was necessary for the maintenance of the children. Id., 609. Implicit in that holding was a rejection of the notion that cohabitants who were once married to each other and who later separate may be held responsible for, or entitled to, payments in the nature of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The foregoing cases evince a policy of Connecticut\u2019s courts to draw a clear distinction between marriage and mere cohabitation, even when that cohabitation was preceded by, or ultimately led to, a marital relationship. Pursuant to that policy, parties who have made the formal commitment of marriage are afforded greater rights and protections than those who choose to reside together informally. Given that policy, it would be incongruous to conclude that a court, when entering financial orders pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81 and 46b-82, may take into account a period of premarital cohabitation as an additional equitable consideration. Accordingly, the court\u2019s consideration here of the parties\u2019 six years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of cohabitation was improper. We note that courts of our sister states, in like contexts, have concluded similarly. See, e.g., <em>In re Marriage of Bukaty, </em>180 Cal. App. 3d 143, 149, 225 Cal. Rptr. 492 (1986) (concluding that court in making limited support award properly refused to consider parties\u2019 lengthy period of premarital cohabitation); <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>374 So. 2d 622, 623 (Fla. App. 1979) (noting that marriage was of short duration and that parties\u2019 cohabitation for several years prior did not provide proper basis for award of rehabilitative alimony); <em>In re Marriage of Goldstein, </em>97 Ill. App. 3d 1023, 1028, 423 N.E.2d 1201 (1981) (holding evidence of parties\u2019 premarital cohabitation, including showing wife\u2019s support of husband while he attained medical degree, properly excluded in dissolution proceedings); but see <em>In re Matter of Long, </em>159 Or. App. 471, 475, 978 P.2d 410 (1999) (courts in some cases may consider entire length of relationship, including period of cohabitation preceding marriage), review denied, 329 Or. 589, 994 P.2d 130 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The question of whether the court, in shaping its financial orders, properly considered the parties\u2019 first marriage is a closer one. We conclude, however, that consideration of the earlier marriage in the parties\u2019 second dissolution action also was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">First, as previously explained, the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 46b-81(c) and 46b-82 (a) directs a court in a dissolution action to consider the length of only the marriage presently being dissolved and does not contemplate the consideration of any previous marital relations between the parties. Second, the parties\u2019 first marriage already had been the subject of an earlier dissolution action, and allowing the matter litigated therein to be revisited twelve years later would run counter to our policy favoring \u201cfinality of litigation and stability of judgments . . . <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Billington, </em>220 Conn. 212, 222, 595 A.2d 1377 (1991); cf. 24 Am. Jur. 2d 572-73, supra, \u00a7 411</p>\n<p id=\"AC6M\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>(\u201cThe doctrine [of res judicata] is fully applicable to judgments and decrees entered in an action for a divorce .... Thus, a final decree of divorce is res judicata with respect to all issues which were, or could have been, litigated in the proceeding.\u201d). Finally, we find guidance in decisions of our sister courts declining, in dissolution matters involving serial marriages, to view those marriages in the aggregate. See <em>In re Marriage of Bukaty, </em>supra, 180 Cal. App. 3d 147-50 (deciding that court in parties\u2019 second divorce action properly refused to consider parties\u2019 first marriage in weighing statutory factor of duration of marriage); <em>Wooldridge </em>v. <em>Wooldridge, </em>791 A.2d 107, 108 (Me. 2002) (concluding that remarriage of parties did not reestablish as marital property what had been awarded to parties separately in first divorce); <em>Hildebrand </em>v. <em>Hildebrand, </em>239 Neb. 605, 613-14, 477 N.W.2d 1 (1991) (holding that upon parties\u2019 second divorce, wife entitled only to portion of husband\u2019s pension that accrued during second marriage); <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>764 P.2d 156, 159 (Okla. 1988) (concluding that court, in determining property distribution in parties\u2019 third divorce, properly refused to view their relationship as one continuous marriage from date of first marriage). On the basis of the foregoing analysis, we conclude that the court improperly considered the length of the parties\u2019 entire relationship, rather than the marriage at issue, in crafting its financial orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The defendant argues next that in fashioning the award of alimony, the court improperly relied on the presence of the parties\u2019 adult children and grandchild in the house, which the alimony was designed to secure to the plaintiff. According to the defendant, the court effectively ordered the payment of unauthorized, post-majority child support. Again, we agree.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The following additional facts are relevant to the claim. When the plaintiff testified on June 9, 2004, she explained why she thought it fair that she be awarded the marital residence. According to the plaintiff, \u201cI need a place for the kids and I to live. They miss \u2014 they look forward \u2014 [the elder daughter] looks forward to coming home. I give them a sense of security and a place of\u2014 a place to come to. They \u2014 that\u2019s what they\u2019ve expressed to me . . . .\u201d On cross-examination, she reiterated her belief that it was fair for her to get the house and, when the defendant\u2019s counsel then noted that two of the children were adults, she replied, \u201cYes, they\u2019re adults, but they\u2019re still my children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-4\">During their closing arguments, counsel for the parties addressed the matter of what would be a proper term for an alimony award. At one point, the court suggested to the plaintiffs counsel, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you argue [that] obviously the house is a help for the children. I guess I\u2019m telling you too many things. . . . But would \u2014 how\u2014would she be able to handle the house if she only got six years of alimony?\u201d When the defendant\u2019s counsel argued that alimony should be limited, noting that the defendant would have no house or furnishings when he returned from Turkey, the court responded that \u201cI also have to think about three children.\u201d When the defendant\u2019s counsel observed that the two older children were twenty and twenty-two, and that the only minor child would be graduating soon from high school, the court replied, \u201cThey still need a place, though,\u201d and remarked further that the younger daughter \u201chas special needs right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">When setting the amount of alimony, the court made it clear that its decision was based on the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>the mortgage payments and the time left on the mortgage loan. See footnote 17. In making some closing comments to the parties, the court stated that the plaintiff, as a result of the property distribution and financial orders, \u201chas a house for the kids to be at, and that\u2019s important. No matter how old they are, they have to have a house to come home to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">At the September 29, 2004 hearing on the defendant\u2019s motions to reargue and for articulation, the court explained further that the plaintiff \u201cstill has a family in need\u201d and that \u201cthe children are still being educated,\u201d and it indicated that it had taken those considerations into account when fashioning the award. In its September 30, 2004 written articulation, the court stated that \u201c[t]he mortgage on the family home had an additional twelve years, which the plaintiff could ill afford to pay on her own salary. Also, this family home was the residence of the minor child, two adult children and a grandchild.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">According to the defendant, the court\u2019s articulated rationale for the alimony order demonstrates that alimony was awarded for an improper purpose, namely, for postmajority child support in the form of housing. He argues that the court\u2019s reliance on the needs of his adult children and grandchild was an abuse of discretion. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">We start with general principles. \u201cAlimony is payment for support of a former spouse and child support is payment for support of a minor child.\u201d <em>Wolfburg </em>v. <em>Wolfburg, </em>27 Conn. App. 396, 402, 606 A.2d 48 (1992); see also 24A Am. Jur. 2d, Divorce &amp; Separation \u00a7 608 (1998) (\u201csole object of alimony is the provision of food, clothing, habitation, and other necessaries <em>for the support of a spouse\u201d </em>[emphasis added]). \u201c[T]he two must be kept separate when the court determines the appropriate awards as to each . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Wolfburg </em>v. <em>Wolfburg, </em>supra, 402. A reviewing court is not necessarily bound by the trial court\u2019s characterization of a financial order in a dissolution action when evaluating the order\u2019s propriety. See, e.g., <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>190 Conn. 345, 349, 460 A.2d 1287 (1983) (concluding that disproportionately high child support award was, in reality, disguised alimony for custodial parent, who was supporting her adult daughter in addition to minor child for whom support had been ordered).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">As a general matter, \u201c[t]he obligation of a parent to support a child terminates when the child attains the age of majority, which, in this state, is eighteen. General Statutes \u00a7 1-1d; <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>177 Conn. 47, 52, 411 A.2d 25 (1979); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, 358 A.2d 150 (1975). The statutory grant of jurisdiction to the Superior Court in matters relating to child support incident to the dissolution of a marriage<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> likewise expressly circumscribes the court\u2019s jurisdiction to orders involving only minor children.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cariseo </em>v. <em>Cariseo, </em>190 Conn. 141, 142-43, 459 A.2d 523 (1983).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Additional statutory provisions may apply, however, to modify this general rule. Pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>\u00a7 46b-66 (a), a court in a dissolution proceeding may enter an order providing for postmajority child support when the parties have agreed in writing to the terms of that order.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Under a more recently enacted provision, upon motion of a party and after making certain subsidiary findings, a court may issue an educational support order for college age children.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56c (b), (c), (e); see also <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 725. Such an order may require one or both parties to a dissolution action to provide support to a child, until the child reaches the age of twenty-three, for certain enumerated educational expenses.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In the absence of a statute or agreement providing for postmajority assistance, however, a parent ordinarily is under no legal obligation to support an adult child. We note here that because the court did not make its orders on the basis of a written agreement of the parties, nor did it adhere to the statutory procedure dictated for an educational support order; see footnotes 24 and 25; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-66 (a) and 46b-56c are not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Under certain circumstances, the economic impact on an alimony recipient of caring for a <em>minor </em>child may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>be a proper consideration for the court when setting the term of alimony. <em>Wolfburg </em>v. <em>Wolfburg, </em>supra, 27 Conn. App. 396.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In <em>Hopfer </em>v. <em>Hopfer, </em>59 Conn. App. 452, 757 A.2d 673 (2000), however, we held that the court, in calculating an alimony award, properly excluded any evidence regarding the postmajority expenses of the parties\u2019 two children. Id., 460-61. We rejected the recipient\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 46b-82 factor of \u201cstation\u201d \u201crefers to the lifestyle or standard of living of the parties during the marriage, <em>including their commensurate expectations for the education and advancement of their children.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 461; see also 24A Am. Jur. 2d 218, supra, \u00a7 837 (\u201ccourt may not order an increase in alimony based on the recipient spouse\u2019s need for funds to pay for a college education for the couple\u2019s postmajority-aged children . . . because to do so is an indirect method of compelling unwilling divorced parents to provide college costs for their capable adult children\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Relatedly, in <em>Cariseo </em>v. <em>Cariseo, </em>supra, 190 Conn. 141, an alimony recipient sought an upward modification based in part on her increased expenses, which she attributed partially to the circumstance that two of the parties\u2019 adult children were living with her and attending college. Id., 142. The trial court ordered the relief sought, reasoning that although the children \u201chad attained their majority, the mother was still feeding them and providing a roof over their heads and ... it was disproportionate to have her bear the burden of maintaining [them].\u201d Id. Our Supreme Court reversed the court\u2019s order, holding that \u201cfinancial obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>arising out of a parent\u2019s maintenance of adult children in the family home while they are attending college\u201d was not a substantial change in circumstances on which a modification of alimony properly could be predicated. Id., 143. Although the factors underlying an' initial alimony award differ from the standard for a modification, the court\u2019s holding lends support to the notion that adult children\u2019s needs are not a proper basis for alimony payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Our research of decisions in other jurisdictions has revealed several cases in which awards of spousal support were invalidated due to indications that they were intended to provide continuing assistance to adult children. In <em>Lesko </em>v. <em>Lesko, </em>184 Mich. App. 395, 405, 457 N.W.2d 695 (1990), the Michigan Court of Appeals held that a trial court, when awarding alimony, improperly considered the recipient\u2019s voluntary assumption of the payment of living expenses for adult children residing with her, explaining that it was \u201cdeclin[ing] to allow a court to order support for adult children through the back door by alimony where it cannot order it through the front door by child support.\u201d In <em>Laporte </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>452 So. 2d 420 (La. App. 1984), the Court of Appeal of Louisiana affirmed an order terminating alimony payments where the recipient admitted that her expenses included substantial contributions to the support of two adult children. The court stated that \u201c[t]he needs of major children should have no influence in determining a spouse\u2019s need for alimony.\u201d Id., 422. In <em>Wobser </em>v. <em>Wobser, </em>91 App. Div. 2d 826, 458 N.Y.S.2d 113 (1982), the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York held improper the award of exclusive possession of the marital home to the wife when the children residing there were grown. The court stated that the \u201chusband should not be compelled to subsidize his adult children by providing living quarters for them.\u201d Id., 827; see also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>427 So. 2d 259, 260 (Fla. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>App. 1983) (holding award of exclusive possession of marital home while children attended college improper postmajority child support); <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>288 S.C. 282, 286-87, 341 S.E.2d 819 (App. 1986) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">Similar considerations apply to grandchildren, for whom their grandparents have no legal duty of support, even where the parent of the grandchild is still a minor. See 3 A. Rutkin, Family Law &amp; Practice, supra, \u00a7 33.02 [3] [g]. In <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>14 S.W.3d 630 (Mo. App. 2000), the Missouri Court of Appeals held that the expenses and care of the parties\u2019 grandchildren could not properly be considered in a trial court\u2019s determination of whether the spouse with whom the grandchildren resided was in need of maintenance. Id., 637-38. The court allowed that the payor spouse might have a moral responsibility toward his grandchildren but concluded that he was not legally responsible for their support. Id., 637; see also <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>866 P.2d 540, 545-46 (Utah 1993) (holding similarly).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Guided by the foregoing, we conclude that the court\u2019s award of alimony was improper because it was ordered on the basis of illegal considerations, specifically, on the needs of the parties\u2019 adult children and grandchild. The court\u2019s comments on the record and in its articulation indicate that the alimony award was meant to ensure that the plaintiff retain the marital home. Although it generally is acceptable for a court to set the term of time limited alimony to expire with some future event, such as the maturation of a mortgage loan; see <em>Henin </em>v. <em>Henin, </em>26 Conn. App. 386, 392-93, 601 A.2d 550 (1992); the court here went much further by opining repeatedly that the reason the plaintiff ought to have the house, and whatever support was necessary to retain it, was the ongoing needs of her adult children, and grandchild, to have a place to live.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The plaintiff suggests that even if this court should find error in the court\u2019s rulings, its judgment should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>remain intact because, due to the wide discretion afforded to a court in a dissolution action, any improper considerations were harmless. We are not convinced. \u201cThe defendant is entitled to relief from the court\u2019s improper rulings only if one or more of those rulings were harmful.\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>88 Conn. App. 674, 678, 870 A.2d 1161 (2005). \u201cTo meet this burden in a civil case, the appellant must show that the ruling would likely affect the result.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tevolini </em>v. <em>Tevolini, </em>66 Conn. App. 16, 31, 783 A.2d 1157 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">We recognize that, as a general matter, a court may order alimony for whatever term it considers equitable and that the court enjoys broad leeway in this regard. Here, however, it is abundantly clear that the court, when weighing the statutory factors of the length of the marriage and the needs of the parties, relied heavily on considerations outside the statutory framework, namely, the length of the parties\u2019 entire relationship and the needs of their adult children and grandchild. Cf. id., 31 (court\u2019s improper exclusion of evidence pertaining to alimony recipient\u2019s health not harmless because health is material factor under \u00a7 46b-82). The court\u2019s repeated statements that those considerations underpinned its orders convinces us that, had it been clear to the court that its rationale was improper, the result likely would have differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">\u201cWe are acutely aware that trial courts have wide discretion to formulate remedies in domestic relations cases, and . . . [that] [t]he power to act equitably is the keystone to the court\u2019s ability to fashion relief in the infinite variety of circumstances which arise out of the dissolution of a marriage. Without this wide discretion and broad equitable power, the courts in some cases might be unable fairly to resolve the parties\u2019 dispute .... Nevertheless, when invoking principles of equity, a court must examine both the public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>implicated and the basic elements of fairness.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Greco, </em>275 Conn. 348, 362, 880 A.2d 872 (2005). Here, the court\u2019s orders were contrary to the policy of Connecticut to treat marriage and cohabitation differently, and were unfair to the extent that they required the defendant to support his adult children absent statutory authorization or written agreement of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">\u201c[W]hen a portion of the court\u2019s financial order is found to be flawed, we return the matter to the trial court for a new hearing on the ground that in marital dissolution jurisprudence, financial orders often are interwoven.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gervais </em>v. <em>Gervais, </em>91 Conn. App. 840, 848, 882 A.2d 731 (2005). \u201cThe rendering of judgment in a complicated dissolution case is a carefully crafted mosaic, each element of which may be dependent on the other.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed except for the granting of the dissolution of marriage and the awarding of custody of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The judgment is reversed as to the property and financial awards only and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\"> The parties previously were married to one another and divorced.

Because we conclude that remand of the case is necessary for a reconsideration of all financial orders, it is entirely possible that a different order as to attorney\u2019s fees will result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-11\"> The eldest child, a daughter, was bom on January 1, 1982, the middle child, a daughter, on August 29, 1983, and the youngest child, a son, on December 4, 1987.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b645-6\"> The parties financed the purchase, in part, with a fifteen year mortgage loan.
