Subsequent to the closing of the transaction, the buyers learned that the soil contained more contamination than they had expected. The buyers sought to recoup from the sellers the cost of removing the contaminated soil and consequential damages generally on the basis of breach of contract and the sellers\u2019 misrepresentation as to a portion of the premises. The buyers cannot prevail, however, because the \u201cas is\u201d and merger provisions of the contract bar recovery; see footnote 12; and the buyers did not justifiably rely on the sellers\u2019 representations, nor were the representations the proximate cause of their injury. We therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The underlying facts are not in dispute. On April 15, 1996, the plaintiffs, McCann Real Equities Series XXII, LLC (McCann), and Coral New Haven Associates, LLC (Coral New Haven),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a written agreement with the defendants, David McDermott Chevrolet, Inc., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>David M. McDermott doing business as McDermott Realty and David McDermott, Inc.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to purchase four acres of real property that had been used throughout the twentieth century for automobile sales and related services. In November, 1996, the plaintiffs received a report from their environmental experts informing them that there were 10,000 gallons of oil and water in the basement of one of the buildings on the property. Their further investigation revealed that the concrete forming the basement and the surrounding soil were contaminated by oil. The plaintiffs did not bring the results of their investigation to the defendants\u2019 attention at that time and purchased the premises on July 28, 1997. In March, 2000, the department of environmental protection (department) informed the plaintiffs that the soil surrounding the building was contaminated and ordered them to remediate the soil. In July, 2000, the plaintiffs commenced this action against the defendants for alleged breach of contract, misrepresentation and indemnification, among other claims, to recoup the cost of remediating the soil and for consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The case was tried in September, 2004. At the conclusion of the plaintiffs\u2019 presentation of evidence, the defendants moved for a directed verdict. The court reserved judgment on the motion for a directed verdict, but the following day, it instructed the jury to return a verdict in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion to set aside the directed verdict, which the court denied in a thirty-two page memorandum of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The plaintiffs have appealed from the judgment rendered by the court. In their statement of the issues, the plaintiffs have asserted twelve claims for us to consider.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are not persuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>because we conclude that the court properly determined (1) that the plaintiffs did not rely on the misrepresentation by McDermott, (2) that no reasonable person could conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed reliance was justifiable or that the misrepresentation was the proximate cause of their loss and (3) that, regardless of the defendants\u2019 alleged wrongdoing, the plaintiffs had bargained away their rights in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u201cThe standards for reviewing a challenge to a directed verdict are well known. Generally, litigants have a constitutional right to have factual issues resolved by the jury. . . . Directed verdicts [therefore] are historically not favored and can be upheld on appeal only when the jury could not have reasonably and legally reached any other conclusion. . . . We review a trial court\u2019s decision to direct a verdict for the defendant by considering all of the evidence, including reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>Rutkin, </em>79 Conn. App. 355, 363, 830 A.2d 340, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 920, 835 A.2d 60 (2003). \u201cAlthough it is the jury\u2019s right to draw logical deductions and make reasonable inferences from the facts proven ... it may not resort to mere conjecture and speculation. <em>... A directed verdict is justified if. . . the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside a verdict rendered for the other party.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Galino, </em>275 Conn. 290, 297, 880 A.2d 127 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of his complaint.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Wright </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number><em>Hutt, </em>50 Conn.

App. 541, 545, 840 A.2d 1209 (2004). \u201c[F]acts must be pleaded as a special defense when they are consistent with the allegations of the complaint but demonstrate, nonetheless, that the plaintiff has no cause of action.

Our review of the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the pleadings therefore is plenary. . . .

App. 773, 778-79, 887 A.2d 420 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">THE PLEADINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">In their amended complaint filed August 17, 2000, the plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, that they entered into a written agreement, dated April 15,1996, with the defendants to purchase approximately four acres of improved real property situated on Whalley Avenue in New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Haven. The plaintiffs further alleged that the agreement contained representations and warranties with regard to the sale of the premises, i.e., that the defendants had agreed to \u201c \u2018comply with all laws, ordinances, regulations, orders or notices of violations of or issued by any Governmental Authority\u2019 prior to closing which representation contractually obligated the defendants as sellers to abide by all state, federal and local laws and ordinances relating to the property and to fully comply with all notices of violation issued in regards to the real property.\u201d The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants represented and warranted that \u201cthere are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of [the defendants], threatened against [the defendants], at law or in equity, by or before any Federal, State, Municipal or other governmental court, department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality which in the event of a decision adverse to [the defendants] would prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants breached their contractual obligations in violation of the affirmative representations they made in the agreement. Specifically the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants \u201c(a) . . . failed to comply with certain notices of violation issued by the [department]; (b) . . . failed to comply with local, State and federal environmental laws affecting the . . . property prior to closing; (c) . . . failed to disclose the existence of notices of violation during that period of time after execution of the . . . agreement and in particular, following the environmental contingency period contained in the . agreement; (d) . . . failed to timely and truthfully disclose facts known to them concerning the environmental condition of the . . . property and the existence of current violations; [and] (e) . . . knowingly concealed from the Plaintiffs facts relevant to the Purchase of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>. . . property including, inter alia, the existence of a current environmental investigation relating to the . . . property, issuance of notices of violations and the existence of past violations which were unresolved prior to closing.\u201d The plaintiffs alleged that as a consequence of the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the law and to disclose certain correspondence from the department, the plaintiffs sustained significantly increased environmental cleanup costs to comply with the department\u2019s order to rid the property of environmental contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The plaintiffs also pleaded counts that sounded in negligent misrepresentation, reckless or indifferent misrepresentation, and intentional and fraudulent misrepresentation, and alleged that the defendants had violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. The plaintiffs sought common-law and statutoiy indemnification pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-452 in counts six and seven, respectively. Counts eight and nine of the amended complaint alleged fraudulent concealment and fraud, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In their answer and amended special defenses,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the defendants denied any wrong doing and alleged eight special defenses, four of which are relevant to the directed verdict. The first special defense as to all counts alleged: \u201cPursuant to the terms of [s]ection 7.3 of the Second Amendment to the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated May 21, 1996, the Plaintiffs . . . agreed that [the plaintiffs] shall after closing <em>hold [the defendants] free a,nd harmless </em>and shall indemnify [the defendants] from any and all claims, including costs and attorney\u2019s fees, based on the environmental condition of the Premises and <em>this release and indemnity shall </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>survive the closing </em>and shall not be limited by the liquidated damages provision in Section 20 . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) On the basis of \u00a7 7.3 of the agreement, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs cannot recover damages under the claims alleged in the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The defendants alleged in their fourth special defense as to all counts that pursuant to \u00a7 16 of the amended agreement, the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of a deed and bill of sale was deemed to be full performance by the defendants that discharged them from all obligations to be performed under the agreement, except those that survived the closing. Furthermore, the defendants alleged, because the sections of the agreement that the defendants were alleged to have violated did not survive the closing, the plaintiffs waived the right to assert the claims they alleged in their amended complaint and were estopped from recovering under them.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The defendants alleged in the first special defense as to count seven (indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452) that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations, General Statutes \u00a7 52-577,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because the acts or omissions complained of in count seven occurred more than three years prior to the date of the amended complaint. The defendants also alleged that the plaintiffs knew of the alleged misrepresentations or omissions concerning the alleged environmental violations as early as November, 1996, and as late as July, 1997, prior to the closing, because they were in receipt of an environmental site assessment conducted by their environmental experts. The defendants alleged that the plaintiffs also knew of the alleged misrepresentations and omissions in July, 1997, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>their counsel had made written demand on the defendants to perform environmental remediation. The defendants alleged that because the plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the environmental violations alleged to exist on the property more than three years prior to the date of the amended complaint, those claims alleged in count seven were time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The defendants\u2019 second special defense as to count seven alleged that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were time barred pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-577c (b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> because the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery of the defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations or omissions regarding the environmental contamination of the property occurred more than two years prior to August 17, 2000, when the amended complaint was filed. The plaintiffs denied all of the defendants\u2019 special defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">THE AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The purchase and sale agreement, dated April 15, 1996, as amended on May 21, 1996, is the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the defendants. The salient provisions of the agreement are \u00a7\u00a7 7.3 (inspection provision)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 7.6 (contingency provis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>ion)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the second amendment to the agreement, and \u00a7\u00a7 11 (e) (due diligence provision),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 12 (c) (pending litigation provision),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 13 (b) (compliance provis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ion),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 15 (\u201cas is\u201d provision),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 16 (full performance provision)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 21 (default provision)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the agreement. The plaintiffs placed the agreement and its amendments into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">The court viewed the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs and found that the following facts were established.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The plaintiffs presented testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>from individuals who had participated in the execution of the agreement, the environmental site assessments and the closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">On April 15, 1996, the parties entered into a written agreement whereby McCann agreed to purchase the subject property. Martin G. Berger negotiated the contract on behalf of the plaintiffs, and McDermott negotiated on behalf of the defendants. On May 21, 1996, the parties agreed to a second amendment to the agreement, altering the substantive terms of \u00a7\u00a7 7.3 and 7.6. The parties also agreed to further amendments to the agreement extending the duration of the plaintiffs\u2019 environmental due diligence period provided for under \u00a7 7.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The plaintiffs sought to purchase the property and to remove the existing improvements to construct a supermarket. For fifteen to eighteen years previously, Berger had been in the business of real estate development, primarily retail shopping centers.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The plaintiffs\u2019 principal place of business is in New York, and during the negotiations and closing, they were represented by the New York City law firm of Newman, Tannenbaum Helpem, Syracuse and Hirschtritt, LLP, a firm with environmental law expertise. McDermott is president of the defendant David McDermott, Inc., which is in the business of selling new and used automobiles. In 1985, McDermott purchased the subject property, which had been used for automobile related purposes, for his own automobile sales and service business, including oil change. The defendants also were represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">After entering into the agreement, the plaintiffs retained the firm of Heynen Teaie Engineers (engineers) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>to perform phase I and phase II environmental site assessments of the premises. The proposal that the plaintiffs accepted from the engineers stated in part that \u201c[s]oil samples will be screened for total volatile organic compounds . . . using a Thermo electronics 580A organic vapor meter .... Selected soil samples will be analyzed for specific aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbons . . . .\u201d The environmental assessments consisted of visually inspecting the property for physical evidence of hazardous materials, communicating with governmental agencies, reviewing agency files for information concerning the presence of hazardous materials on the property, reviewing ownership records concerning the current and prior uses of the property, assessing the general hydrogeological setting on the basis of field observations and topographical information and performing test borings.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">The premises were honeycombed with underground rooms or basements. Aboveground and belowground storage tanks on the premises were used to hold clean oil, used oil and heating fuel. In performing the site assessments, the engineers divided the property into sixteen areas, designated A through P. The defendants\u2019 employees put used oil into two aboveground storage tanks in a basement of area M, which resulted in a substantial oil spill in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Lawrence L. Bee, Jr., a vice president of the engineering firm, inspected the property in March and October, 1996. McDermott or one of his employees, escorted Bee around the property. Bee had unrestricted access to the premises, and he was permitted to take soil samples. On October 31,1996, Bee and two of his associates discovered that the basement of area M contained a large amount of liquid, as well as two aboveground storage tanks. Thereafter, Berger and McDermott had a telephone conversation during which Berger asked McDermott to identify the liquid in the basement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>area M. McDermott replied that it was \u201conly rainwater\u201d and that the two aboveground storage tanks had never been used.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> There was no evidence that McDermott told Berger not to test the tanks, the concrete forming the room or the surrounding soil. There also was no evidence that the defendants represented to anyone that the soil around area M was not contaminated.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Berger communicated the information that he had received from McDermott to the engineers. On November 12, 1996, the engineers issued to the plaintiffs a written environmental site assessment in which they reported, among other things, that the building in area M \u201cis a masonry structure containing hydraulic lifts. The northwest comer of the building contains [three aboveground storage tanks] used for possibly virgin oil. The <em>floor is heavily stained from apparent overfills and improper handling. </em>Adjacent to the [three aboveground storage tanks] is a basement access with wood steps. The steps appear unsafe and no lighting was observed in the basement. This northwest basement floor, as observed with flashlights, was under <em>[eight plus or minus] inches of oil and water. </em>The [oil] was apparently <em>due to overfills of two 275 gallon waste oil [aboveground storage tanks] in the basement </em>fed from the main level.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The environmental site assessment continued, stating that <em>\u201c[l]he northwest basement area below the virgin oil storage area contains an estimated 10,000 gallons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>of an oil/water mixture on the floor from poor waste oil management practices. The northwest basement walls are stainedfrom the ceiling to the floor.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) It also stated that \u201c[t]he following observations suggest the presence of on-site petroleum releases: a) an estimated 10,000 [plus or minus] gallons of oil and water on the northwest basement floor of Area M; b) overtopping of, and surface staining surrounding, the broken flush-mounted [underground storage tank] fill pipe in Area O; c) surface staining in Area N adjacent to the Area C gasoline [underground storage tank]; and d) staining beneath the Area G basement fuel oil [aboveground storage tank].\u201d And furthermore, the report stated that \u201c[t]he screening and analytical results suggest the <em>presence of petroleum-related hydrocarbons in soil near the groundwater surface at Area M, </em>and the presence of gasoline-and solvent-related hydrocarbons near the groundwater surface in the south end of Area K. [Organic vapor meter] screening data suggests the presence of [volatile organic compounds] near' the groundwater surface in Areas K, G, L, and M.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Apex Environmental, Inc. (Apex), performed additional environmental testing on the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf. Between March 31 and April 4, 1997, Apex observed the drilling of seventeen soil borings and cores of buildings on the property. On June 26, 1997, Apex reported to the plaintiffs that it found no sign of significant contamination at the borings. Also, Apex did not detect significant contamination pursuant to subslab investigations conducted at certain locations. The plaintiffs did not advise the defendants of the findings of either the engineers or Apex prior to the closing in July, 1997. Subsequently, Apex determined that the soil around the area M basement was more contaminated than either it or the engineers previously had determined. Due to the contamination, the soil required extensive remedia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>tion. The plaintiffs claimed that the remediation expenses and construction delay cost them more than $1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">CLAIMS ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly directed a verdict as to each of their causes of action, i.e., breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, reckless misrepresentation, fraudulent and intentional misrepresentation, CUTPA, common-law indemnification, statutory indemnification, fraudulent concealment and fraud. The plaintiffs have argued that they presented evidence as to each element of the causes of action alleged, and that the court improperly weighed the evidence and made findings of fact, thereby usurping their right to a jury trial. The plaintiffs also claim that the court misapplied the doctrine of merger to the misrepresentation claims and applied the incorrect statute of limitations to their indemnification claims. We do not agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly directed a verdict as to the breach of contract claim because it improperly concluded that (1) they failed to prove that the defendants had breached the compliance provision of the agreement, (2) the compliance and no litigation provisions of the agreement did not survive the closing, (3) there was no litigation or threat of litigation pending against the defendants, (4) the plaintiffs did not rely on McDermott\u2019s representation as to the nature of the liquid in the basement of area M and (5) McDermott\u2019s misrepresentations did not supersede the \u201cas is\u201d provision of the agreement. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">Before undertaking our analysis of the claim, we review the relevant rules of contract construction. \u201cWe construe a contract in accordance with what we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>elude to be the understanding and intention of the parties as determined from the language used by them interpreted in light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>N.E. Leasing, LLC </em>v. <em>Paoletta, </em>89 Conn. App. 766, 775, 877 A.2d 840, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 921, 883 A.2d 1245 (2005). The intention of the parties manifested by their words and acts is essential. \u201cAlthough ordinarily the question of contract interpretation, being a question of the parties\u2019 intent, is a question of fact . . . [w]here there is definitive contract language, the determination of what the parties intended by their contractual commitments is a question of law. . . . When only one interpretation of a contract is possible, the court need not look outside the four corners of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Vaszil, </em>89 Conn. App. 482, 498-99, 873 A.2d 1030, cert. granted on other grounds, 275 Conn. 911, 882 A.2d 673 (2005). \u201cA court will not torture words to import ambiguity when the ordinary meaning leaves no room for ambiguity, and words do not become ambiguous simply because lawyers or laymen contend for different meanings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 499. The plaintiffs do not contend that the agreement is ambiguous. Its construction, therefore, is a question of law that requires plenary review. <em>Issler </em>v. <em>Issler, </em>250 Conn. 226, 235-36, 737 A.2d 383 (1999). \u201cUnder plenary review, we must decide whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are legally and logically correct and find support in the record.\u201d <em>Montoya </em>v. <em>Montoya, </em>91 Conn. App. 407, 416, 881 A.2d 319, cert. granted on other grounds, 276 Conn. 916, 888 A.2d 85 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In their brief, the plaintiffs state the elements of a cause of action founded on breach of contract, i.e., (1) the formation of an agreement, (2) performance by one party, (3) breach of the agreement by the opposing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>party and (4) damages. See <em>Rosato </em>v. <em>Mascardo, </em>82 Conn. App. 396, 411, 844 A.2d 893 (2004). The plaintiffs omit, however, that the nonbreaching party \u201cmay recover only for damages that are direct[ly] and proximate [ly] caused by a defendant\u2019s breach of contract, causation is an element \u2014 and a crucial one \u2014 of the plaintiffs prima facie case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>National Market Share, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sterling National Bank, </em>392 F.3d 520, 526 (2d Cir. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In directing the verdict in the defendants\u2019 favor, the court explained to the jury that construction of the agreement was a question of law for the court to decide. The court informed the jury that the agreement did not require the defendants to disclose letters from the department concerning its annual inspection of the property or even facts known to them concerning the environmental condition of the property.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Athough the defendants had agreed to comply with the law, and the liquid in the basement of area M was a violation of the law, pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, that provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>of the agreement did not survive the closing because of the \u201cas is\u201d and full performance provisions of the agreement. In addition, pursuant to the merger provision of the agreement, when the plaintiffs accepted the deed and bill of sale, the defendants had fulfilled their obligations under the agreement. The court also explained the \u201cas is\u201d and hold harmless provisions of the agreement and that our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Holly Hill Holdings </em>v. <em>Lowman, </em>226 Conn. 748, 628 A.2d 1298 (1993), controlled the construction of the \u201cas is\u201d provision.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In their motion to set aside the directed verdict, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants had breached the agreement by failing to disclose letters related to environmental inspections that they had received from the department between 1994 and 1997 and that the condition of the basement of area M violated the compliance provision of the agreement. In its memorandum of deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>sion, the court reviewed the letters at issue,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> which the department had sent to the defendants following each of its inspections of the premises in 1994,1995 and 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The court found that the agreement did not require the defendants to disclose the contents of the department\u2019s letters and that the issues addressed in the letters had nothing to do with the condition of the basement in area M or the surrounding soil. Importantly, following a March, 1997 inspection, the department\u2019s letter stated, among other things, that \u201cmany of the problems found during previous inspections had finally been corrected.\u201d The department criticized, however, the defendants\u2019 failure to dispose of spent antifreeze and waste oil separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The court concluded that the no pending litigation provision of the agreement, \u00a7 12 (c), was the only provision that could give rise to a duty to disclose the contents of the letters. Pursuant to \u00a7 16 of the agreement; see footnote 13 (full performance provision); \u00a7 12 (c) was not one of the provisions of the agreement that survived the closing. See footnote 10. Furthermore, the letters were not evidence of litigation pending against the defendants or threats of future litigation, as they merely conveyed the results of annual inspections. Although the plaintiffs characterized the letters from the department as notices of violations, by statute, they were not of that character. At the times the letters were sent to the defendants, department notice of violations were controlled by General Statutes \u00a7 22a-6b.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>court found that there was no evidence that the letters or their contents fell within the parameters of \u00a7 22a-6b and, therefore, the defendants never received a notice of violation or the threat of enforcement from the department.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Construction of a statute is a question of law; <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>275 Conn. 464, 474, 881 A.2d 259 (2005); as is the construction of an unambiguous agreement; <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Vaszil, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 498; and the allegations of a complaint. <em>Bross </em>v. <em>Hillside Acres, Inc., </em>supra, 92 Conn. App. 778. On the basis of our review of the letters, \u00a7 22a-6b and the allegations of the amended complaint, we agree with the court that the letters did not constitute litigation or pending litigation and that the substance of the issues addressed by the department in the letters was unrelated to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In addition, with respect to the letters from the department, the court concluded that there was no evidence that any adverse decision by the department would have prevented the parties from closing the sale and purchase agreement. Section 12 (c) of the agreement defined an adverse decision by the department as one that would have \u201cprevent[ed] the consummation of the transactions contemplated by [the] Agreement . . . .\u201d The clause cannot be read out of the parties\u2019 agreement; see <em>Bird Peak Road Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Bird Peak Corp., </em>62 Conn. App. 551, 557, 771 A.2d 260, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 917, 773 A.2d 943 (2001); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>and proof of an adverse decision cannot be supplied by surmise or assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Finally, with respect to the letters, the court concluded that no reasonable person could have concluded that the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose the letters to the plaintiffs was the cause of their damages. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick's, Inc., </em>5 Conn. App. 469, 472, 499 A.2d 805 (1985) (plaintiff must establish causal relation between breach, damages). The damages the plaintiffs claimed concerned area M and were wholly unrelated to the matters raised in the department\u2019s letters between 1994 and 1997, e.g., disposal of sawdust, documentation of the removal of a fifty-five gallon drum of waste paint thinner, failure to perform a hazardous waste determination on antifreeze and waste masking paper contaminated with paint and the handling of spent antifreeze. None of the department\u2019s letters concerned area M. Consequently, the plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose letters from the department between 1994 and 1997 was the proximate cause of their alleged damages. We agree with the conclusions of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second principal claim that the defendants breached the agreement is that the condition of the basement in area M violated the compliance provision of the agreement, \u00a7 13 (b). See footnote 11. The court found that a reasonable jury could have concluded that the condition of the basement in area M was a violation of Connecticut law and department regulations. Section 13 (b) was another of the provisions of the agreement that did not survive the closing. See footnote 13 (full performance provision). What is more, even if the defendants had failed to fulfill their obligation under \u00a7 13 (b), the plaintiffs\u2019 sole remedy, under the default provision of the agreement, was specific performance. See footnote 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence demonstrated that there was no causal connection between the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged damages, and McDermott\u2019s representation that the liquid in the basement of area M was rainwater and that the aboveground storage tanks there had never been used. Most significantly, the court found no evidence that the plaintiffs, through Berger, relied on McDer-mott\u2019s representations. First, the court noted that the plaintiffs did not commence their environmental site assessment within thirty days of the second amendment to the agreement, as provided by \u00a7 7.3 of the agreement. See footnote 7. Also, the plaintiffs never exercised their right to cancel the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Berger testified that the plaintiffs let the environmental contingency lapse on July 3, 1996. The engineers found liquid in the basement of area M in October, 1996. In response to Berger\u2019s inquiry, McDermott represented that the liquid was just rainwater. Berger communicated that information to the engineers. In November, 1996, the engineers submitted a written report to the plaintiffs, telling them that the liquid was not just rainwater, but eight or more inches of oil and water and that the aboveground storage tanks in the basement of area M had been used. The plaintiffs presented no evidence that they sustained damages between the time of McDermott\u2019s October, 1996 representations and their receipt of the engineers\u2019 report in November, 1996. No prejudicial deadlines passed during that interval of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Berger knew that the oil had seeped into the concrete forming the basement in area M. He was not concerned about the oil in the concrete because the plaintiffs intended to remove the concrete. He was concerned that oil had been seeping into the soil. His complaint was not that the soil had to be remediated, because the reports from the engineers and Apex had disclosed that fact, but that the amount of remediation required was beyond what he had expected. The tests performed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 behalf, however, failed to disclose the amount of remediation required. The plaintiffs offered no evidence that McDermott or any of the defendants made any representations concerning the soil around the basement in area M. None of the engineers or Apex employees testified that they had relied on McDermott\u2019s representations to determine the amount of testing they had to do. The court concluded, therefore, on the basis of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Visconti </em>v. <em>Pepper Partners Ltd. Partnership, </em>77 Conn. App. 675, 683-85, 825 A.2d 210 (2003), that a plaintiffs bare assertion that it had relied on the defendant\u2019s representation was of no probative value in the face of other evidence to the contrary.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The court also concluded that the \u201cas is\u201d and merger provisions of the agreement barred the breach of contract claim. See footnote 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">After reviewing the record and the arguments of the parties, we agree with the court\u2019s view of the evidence, the applicable law and its reasoning. The plaintiffs argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>on appeal that <em>Holly Hill Holdings </em>v. <em>Lowman, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 748, does not apply because they alleged mistake and fraud. On the basis of our plenary review of the allegations of count one, we find no allegations of mistake or fraud. As we previously noted, material facts are those that will make a difference in the case, and they must be pleaded. Mistake and fraud were not pleaded in count one of the plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The plaintiffs also have argued that McDermott\u2019s representations made in October, 1996, and the defendants\u2019 failure to comply with the law pursuant to the compliance provision of the agreement induced them to enter into the agreement. There are no allegations to that effect in count one of the amended complaint. The plaintiffs have not brought to our attention any evidence of fraud or misrepresentation that induced them to enter into the agreement to purchase the premises. The evidence regarding misrepresentations referred to events that occurred after the plaintiffs had entered into the agreement to purchase the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Our Supreme Court has held \u201cthat even an innocent misrepresentation of fact may be actionable if the declarant has the means of knowing, ought to know, or has the duty of knowing the truth. . . . The governing principles are set forth in similar terms in \u00a7 552 of the Restatement Second of Torts (1977): One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment . . . supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their <em>justifiable reliance </em>upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information. . . . Accordingly, an action for negligent misrepresentation requires a plaintiff to prove that (1) the defendant made a misrepresentation and (2) the plaintiff reasonably relied upon that misrepresentation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>. . . Whether evidence supports a claim of . . . negligent misrepresentation is a question of fact.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Savings Bank of Manchester </em>v. <em>Ralion Financial Services, Inc., </em>91 Conn. App. 386, 389-90, 881 A.2d 1035 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">In support of their position that they relied on McDermott\u2019s misrepresentations, the plaintiffs rely on <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Huntington Co., </em>42 Conn. App. 712, 682 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 931, 683 A.2d 397 (1996), citing <em>Warman </em>v. <em>Delaney, </em>148 Conn. 469, 474, 172 A.2d 188 (1961),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for the proposition that \u201c [i]n a claim for misrepresentation, a tort claim, a plaintiff is not seeking to add to or change the terms of the written contract itself, but is claiming inducement to enter into the contract by material misrepresentation of material facts.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Huntington Co., </em>supra, 721. The facts at issue in this case are distinguishable from <em>Foley, </em>in which this court stated that \u201c[a] misrepresentation by a seller as to the boundaries of land to be sold, if made negligently or recklessly and relied upon by a buyer <em>without conducting an independent survey, </em>can support an award of damages even if the written contract constitutes the entire agreement of the parties and the contract specifically disclaims any representations of the seller as to the condition of the land and contains a contrary description of the land.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 721-22.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In this case, the plaintiffs retained two experts to conduct phase I and phase II environmental site assessments of the property, the factual equivalent of a survey. The plaintiffs here, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Warman, </em>knew prior to the closing, on the basis of their experts\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>reports, that there was oil in the basement of area M and that the aboveground storage tanks had been used. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have not referred to any evidence that McDermott or any of the other defendants made a representation as to the condition of the soil surrounding the basement of area M. Berger assumed that the soil was contaminated because the oil had permeated the concrete forming the basement. It was not the fact that the soil was contaminated that was a problem, but the <em>amount of contamination. </em>There is no evidence that the defendants were in a position to know the extent of contamination, had made any representation as to that fact or prevented the plaintiffs from conducting the appropriate tests. Although Berger testified that the plaintiffs relied on their experts; see footnote 23; the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is that they relied on McDermott\u2019s misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">The plaintiffs also argue that the defendants breached their contractual obligations by failing to inform them that they had permitted oil to collect in the basement of area M, which was in violation of the law.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Again, the plaintiffs, prior to closing, knew of the presence of the oil in the basement of area M on the basis of their experts\u2019 reports. For the foregoing reasons, the court properly directed a defendants\u2019 verdict on the breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>of contract claim and denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to set aside the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly directed a verdict as to their counts that alleged negligent and reckless misrepresentation. The court found that the plaintiffs had alleged five counts of misrepresentation, each asserting a different degree of culpability. The basis of all five counts of negligence was the same allegation of misrepresentation asserted in count one. The court concluded that there was no causal connection between McDermott\u2019s representations as to the nature of the liquid in the basement of area M and the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged loss.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court further concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 claimed reliance was not reasonably justifiable because the plaintiffs had contracted away their right to rely on any representation by the defendants. At the time the plaintiffs entered into the agreement, they agreed to the due diligence provision, that is, that they would rely on their own investigation of the premises and not on any representations made by the defendants, and that the plaintiffs had had an opportunity to examine all of the information necessary to complete an environmental site assessment and were satisfied with the results of that assessment. See footnote 9. In addition, in the second amendment to the agreement, the plaintiffs agreed pursuant to the inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tion provision that they had thirty days in which to complete their environmental site assessment after which they agreed to hold the defendants harmless and indemnify them for all claims made on the basis of the environmental condition of the property. See footnote 7. We agree with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, the court found that a reasonable person might believe that most of the oil in the basement of area M and the surrounding soil got there during the time that the defendants owned the property. A reasonable person also might believe that McDermott, when asked about the liquid in the basement, knew or should have known that it was not just rainwater, but also oil waste. Regardless, the plaintiffs could not prevail on their claims of misrepresentation and fraud because each claim required them to prove that they reasonably or justifiably relied on McDermott\u2019s statement concerning rainwater. The court reviewed the contents of and quoted from the engineers\u2019 written environmental assessment, in particular those portions concerning area M. The environmental assessment recommended to the plaintiffs that the waste generated at area M should be assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In directing the jury\u2019s verdict as to the claims of misrepresentation, the court relied on <em>Visconti </em>v. <em>Pepper Partners Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 675,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> an appeal from the rendering of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In <em>Visconti, </em>the plaintiff purchased real property that he knew had been used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>as a gasoline station and automobile repair shop, and where three underground gasoline storage tanks and one waste oil storage tank had been removed. Id., 678-79. According to the prior owner, contaminated soil near the tanks also had been removed, and the authorities were satisfied. Id. The contract for sale advised the plaintiff that the property might be a hazardous waste establishment and permitted him to conduct a phase I environmental site assessment. Id., 679. The plaintiff agreed to sign transfer act forms stating the environmental history of the property and to be responsible for the cost of environmental remediation. Id., 680. The plaintiff did not perform a preclosing environmental assessment. Id. The plaintiff testified at a deposition that \u201che assumed that the soil around the tank area was contaminated.\u201d Id., 679. The plaintiffs complaint alleged, in part, fraud, fraudulent nondisclosure and negligent misrepresentation. Id., 677.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The trial court in <em>Visconti </em>granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the fraud and misrepresentation claims, concluding that the plaintiff \u201chad not alleged material facts to sustain his claim of fraud because, even if [the prior owner] had been untruthful in representing that the . . . cleanup had satisfied the relevant authorities, the plaintiff had not relied on that representation to establish that the property was not contaminated. . . . [Alleging fraudulent nondisclosure, was untenable in light of the provisions in the contact of sale that assigned the risk of environmental hazards to the plaintiff.\u201d Id., 681. For the same reason, the count of negligent misrepresentation could not succeed. Id. This court affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment because the plaintiff had assumed the environmental risk when he entered into the contract for sale; id., 683, 685; and had had the opportunity to investigate the site before closing. Id., 686. Under the circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>defendants owed no further duty to make disclosures. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In addressing the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments in their motion to set aside the directed verdict, the court in this case quoted <em>Visconti-. </em>\u201cProving a false representation is . . . only one part of a claim of actionable misrepresentation. To prevail, the plaintiff also was required to show that he reasonably relied on that misrepresentation. One who, in the course of his business, profession or employment . . . supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused by their <em>justifiable reliance </em>upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The court concluded with respect to the misrepresentation counts, as it did with regard to the misrepresentation aspect of the breach of contract count, that no reasonable person could find that the plaintiffs had relied on any representations made by the defendants. Furthermore, no reasonable person could find that the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged reliance on the representations of the defendants was justified. Pursuant to the agreement, the plaintiffs assumed the risk that the property contained environmental waste when they took the deed and bill of sale. They knew for many months prior to the closing that there was a pool of oil in the basement of area M.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">In addition, the court concluded that the plaintiffs had contracted away their right to rely on any representation by the defendants as to the environmental condition of the property. The plaintiffs agreed to purchase the property \u201cas is.\u201d See footnote 12. At the time they entered into the agreement, the plaintiffs agreed that they were relying on their own investigation of the premises, not on McDermott\u2019s representations. Further<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>more, the plaintiffs had the opportunity to examine and to review any and all information necessary to complete the environmental site assessments. The plaintiffs were satisfied with the results of their investigation. Pursuant to the second amended agreement of May, 1996, the plaintiffs had thirty days in which to conduct an environmental site assessment after which they would hold the defendants harmless and indemnify them for all claims made on the basis of the environmental condition of the property. Finally, the plaintiffs\u2019 acceptance of the deed constituted full performance by the defendants of all of their obligations under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendants on their counts of fraudulent and intentional misrepresentation. There is no support for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u201cFraud consists [of] deception practiced in order to induce another to part with property or surrender some legal right, and which accomplishes the end designed. . . . The elements of a fraud action are: (1) a false representation was made as a statement of fact; (2) the statement was untrue and known to be so by its maker; (3) the statement was made with the intent of inducing reliance thereon; and (4) the other party relied on the statement to his detriment. . . . Additionally, [t]he party asserting such a cause of action must prove the existence of the first three of [the] elements by a standard higher than the usual fair preponderance of the evidence, which higher standard we have described as clear and satisfactory or clear, precise and unequivocal. . . .

He communicated McDermott\u2019s representation to the engineers and testified that he relied on his experts. Apex conducted soil borings and subslab tests subsequent to October, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">More importantly, McDermott\u2019s misrepresentation and the defendants\u2019 failure to disclose letters from the department were not material to the plaintiffs\u2019 loss. \u201cIn equity, as in law, misrepresentation, to constitute fraud, must be material. . . . That is to say, the representation must prejudice the party relying upon it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Morgera </em>v. <em>Chiappardi, </em>74 Conn. App. 442, 458, 813 A.2d 89 (2003). The plaintiffs\u2019 claim of damages concerns the expense and consequential damages that flowed from the remediation of the soil surrounding the basement of area M. McDermott made no representations as to the soil, and the letters to the defendants from the department did not concern area M or the soil surrounding it. For those reasons, the court properly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for a directed verdict as to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim of intentional and fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the court improperly directed a verdict in favor of the defendants with regard to the CUTPA claim, which was based on the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations and failure to disclose the letters from the department. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">The court addressed the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA count in more detail in its memorandum of decision on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>motion to set aside the directed verdict. The court based its decision on the \u201cas is\u201d provision of the agreement and that the defendants had not relied on McDermott\u2019s representations. The court concluded again that McDermott\u2019s misrepresentation was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss. \u201cWhere a plaintiff alleges that a defendant\u2019s <em>passive </em>conduct violates CUTPA . . . common sense dictates that a court should inquire whether the defendant was under any obligation to do what it refrained from doing.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Downes-Patterson Corp. </em>v. <em>First National Supermarkets, Inc., </em>64 Conn.

Furthermore, to prove a violation of CUTPA, the plaintiffs were required to show that the defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentation was the proximate cause of their injury. See <em>Abrahams </em>v. <em>Young &amp; Rubicam, Inc., </em>240 Conn. 300, 306, 692 A.2d 709 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u201cIt is well settled that whether a defendant\u2019s acts constitute . . . deceptive or unfair trade practices under CUTPA, is a question of fact for the trier, to which, on appellate review, we accord our customary deference. . . . [W]here the factual basis of the court\u2019s decision is challenged we must determine whether the facts set out in the memorandum of decision are supported by the evidence or whether, in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the whole record, those facts are clearly erroneous. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u201cTo establish a CUTPA violation, a claimant\u2019s evidence must establish that the conduct at issue falls within one of three criteria.

The plaintiffs do not challenge those facts or that the sale of the premises was not the defendants\u2019 primary trade or business. The question of whether a CUTPA claim may arise out of a transaction that is not the alleged offender\u2019s primary trade or business has not been addressed by Connecticut\u2019s appellate courts. The federal district courts in the district of Connecticut, however, have addressed the question. See <em>Cornerstone Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dresser Rand Co., </em>993 F. Sup. 107, 111-12 (D.

Conn. 1992) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">In both <em>Cornerstone Realty, Inc., </em>and <em>Arawana Mills Co., </em>the plaintiffs sought damages due to environmental contamination they discovered on the premises of real property they intended to purchase or had leased. The defendants in both cases sought, pursuant to rule 12 (b) (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>miss the CUTPA claims against them because their primary trade or commerce did not concern real estate. The defendants in <em>Cornerstone Realty, Inc., </em>were manufacturing and industrial companies. The defendant in <em>Arawana Mills Co. </em>was in the business of repairing and servicing aircraft engines. <em>Cornerstone Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dresser Rand Co., </em>supra, 993 F. Sup. 111-12. In both cases, the courts dismissed the CUPTA allegations because the sale or lease of real property was not the defendants\u2019 primary trade or commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">When ruling on the motion to dismiss in <em>Cornerstone Realty, Inc., </em>the court reasoned that it would have to predict how our Supreme Court would rule on the case. It looked to <em>Sealy Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>Litton Industries, Inc., </em>989 F. Sup. 120 (D. Conn. 1997), in which \u201cthe plaintiff claimed that the defendant violated CUTPA by allegedly contaminating certain property it had leased from the plaintiff and then concealing from the plaintiff the extent of environmental contamination. The court [in <em>Sealy Connecticut, Inc.) </em>noted that the claim encompassed the allegations of concealment, but reasoned that the key question is whether leasing property is defendant\u2019s trade or commence. . . . Following the holding of <em>Arawana Mills [Co.], </em>the court dismissed the CUTPA claim. . . . See also <em>Brandewiede </em>v. <em>Emery Worldwide, </em>890 F. [Sup.] 79, 81 (D. Conn. 1994) (no viable claim under CUTPA for conduct in leasing aircraft where leasing aircraft was incidental to defendant\u2019s primary business of providing overnight freight service) . . . [aff'd, 66 F.3d 308 (2d Cir. 1995)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cornerstone Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dresser Rand Co., </em>supra, 993 F. Sup. 112. The court also cited numerous Superior Court cases in which it was held that environmental contamination, even when concealed, was not actionable if it was incidental to the primary trade or business of the defendant. Id., 112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Our legislature is presumed to be aware of judgments that construe our statutes. In the absence of any legislation to reverse the courts\u2019 decisions, we may assume that the General Assembly is in agreement with them. See <em>Labadie </em>v. <em>Norwalk Rehabilitation Services, Inc., </em>274 Conn. 219, 235 n. 11, 875 A.2d 485 (2005). We accordingly conclude that a CUTPA violation may not be alleged for activities that are incidental to an entity\u2019s primary trade or commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Because the defendants in this case were not in the business of selling real property, and the purchase and sale agreement at issue was merely incidental to the defendants\u2019 sale and servicing of automobiles, we conclude that the court properly directed a verdict as to the plaintiffs\u2019 CUTPA count.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The plaintiffs next claim that the court improperly directed a verdict as to their counts of common-law indemnification and statutory indemnification. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants breached the agreement by failing to abide by the laws of the state of Connecticut and that their failure to do so obligated the plaintiffs to pay expenses, fines and legal fees. The court found both claims unavailing. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">In essence, the court based its decision as to common-law indemnification on the allegations of the amended complaint, the \u201cas is\u201d provision of the agreement and the doctrine of active-passive negligence. Common-law indemnification \u201cimposes an implied obligation of indemnity on a tortfeasor whose <em>active </em>negligence is primarily responsible for a plaintiffs injuries, thus superseding the indemnitee\u2019s passive negligence. ... To assert a claim for indemnification . . . an out-of-pocket defendant must show that: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the party against whom the indemnification is sought was negligent; (2) that party\u2019s active negligence, rather than the defendant\u2019s own passive negligence, was the direct, immediate cause of the . . . resulting injuries ... (3) the other party was in control of the situation to the exclusion of the defendant seeking reimbursement; and (4) the defendant did not know of the other party\u2019s negligence, had no reason to anticipate it, and reasonably could rely on the other party not to be negligent.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Smith </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>258 Conn. 56, 66, 779 A.2d 104 (2001).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The court concluded that because the plaintiffs purchased the property \u201cas is,\u201d they could not meet the second element of the cause of action, which was that the defendants\u2019 active negligence was the cause of their loss. See footnote 12 (\u201cbuyer acknowledges that it has examined the premises agreed to be sold and is buying them \u2018as is\u2019, without warranty or representation of any kind whatsoever, whether relating to the premises\u2019 condition or use, express or implied, by . . . sellers not expressly stated herein\u201d). In addition, the defendants were not in exclusive control of the situation, which is the third element, because the plaintiffs investigated the environmental condition of the property. And last, the plaintiffs knew of the condition in the basement of area M nine months before the closing because it was discovered and investigated by the engineers. We agree with the court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Count six of the amended complaint alleged, in part, that \u201cas a result of \u201c the defendants\u2019 various breaches of the agreement and failure to abide by Connecticut environmental law, the plaintiffs were obligated to pay certain expenses. The \u201cas a result of\u2019 language required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>that the plaintiffs\u2019 loss be proximately caused by the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct. <em>Haesche </em>v. <em>Kissner, </em>229 Conn. 213, 223-24, 640 A.2d 89 (1994). As has been discussed at length in this opinion, the court properly concluded that the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct was not the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss. The plaintiffs were aware of the contaminated soil, but they failed to discover the extent of the contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Count seven of the amended complaint sought indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 22a-452.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The court concluded that the count was barred by the parties\u2019 agreement pursuant to <em>Visconti </em>v. <em>Pepper Partners Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 675. When the plaintiffs closed on the agreement, they knew that the property had a history of being used for automobile related purposes and that the soil would reflect that use. Nine months before the closing, the plaintiffs were informed that the basement in area M contained 10,000 gallons of oil and water and that the liquid had stained the concrete. The tests that the plaintiffs\u2019 experts performed failed to detect the extent of oil contamination in the soil. In any event, pursuant to the \u00a7 7.3 of the agreement, the plaintiffs assumed the risk of such contamination and did so for more than three years after the closing, when the department discovered the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Although \u00a7 22a-452 may have provided a remedy for indemnification for the cost of remediating the soil, the plaintiffs negotiated away that statutory right. See <em>Holly Hill Holdings </em>v. <em>Lowman, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 755 (\u201cparties are free to contract for whatever terms on which they may agree\u201d). On the basis of the facts, the law and the agreement, the plaintiffs are unable to place liability for the remediation of the soil on the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The plaintiffs claim that the court usurped the authority of the jury in violation of their constitutional right to a jury trial,<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> misapplied the doctrine of merger as to their claims of misrepresentation and applied the incorrect statute of limitations regarding their claims of indemnification.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The plaintiffs failed to raise their constitutional and merger claims in their motion to set aside the directed verdict. \u201cIt is well settled that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>trial court can be expected to rule only on those matters that are put before it. . . . With only a few exceptions ... we will not decide an appeal on an issue that was not raised before the trial court. ...

In essence, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the jury should have been permitted to determine whether they relied on McDermott\u2019s representation as to the liquid in the basement. On the basis of our review of the amended complaint, the evidence, the law and the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, we conclude that there was insufficient evidence from which a reasonable person could have concluded that the defendants\u2019 misrepresentations were the proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries. Even if they had been the proximate cause, the plaintiffs got the benefit of their bargain by agreeing to purchase the property \u201cas is,\u201d inspect the premises and hold the defendants harmless, among other things that may not have been in their best interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> In their brief on appeal, the plaintiffs represented that in its \u201cmemorandum of decision dated February 17, 2005, the court does not discuss [its] rulings regarding the previously raised issue of the statute of limitations in environmental indemnification claims.\u201d The plaintiffs failed to file a motion for articulation. The record, therefore, is inadequate for our review.

Their arguments fail for the reasons stated in the analysis of their fraudulent misrepresentation claim. No useful purpose could be served by restating our analysis, which would accomplish no more than lengthening an already overly long opinion. The plaintiffs knew of the oil in the basement of area M and were aware that the soil was contaminated before they closed the transaction. More importantly, the plaintiffs bargained for the right to purchase the property \u201cas is.\u201d See <em>Gibson v.
