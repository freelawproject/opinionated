We conclude that the court\u2019s admission of the evidence was proper and that no prosecutorial misconduct occurred. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On March 4, 2000, at approximately 1 a.m., Officer Thomas Scanlon of the Stamford police department observed a gold Ford Taurus parked in front of a known drug location at 27 High Street in Stamford. Suspicious of the activity, Scanlon followed the car to the Fairfield Court housing project. As Scanlon drove his police cruiser behind the car, he observed the defendant exit the passenger door of the vehicle. Scanlon proceeded to question the driver and learned that the driver did not know the defendant. On the basis of his experience, Scanlon believed that a drug transaction was occurring. Consequently, Scanlon approached and questioned the defendant as he attempted to enter a building within the housing complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">During that conversation, the defendant explained that the driver of the Taurus was seeking to buy marijuana. Scanlon asked the defendant if he was carrying any drugs or weapons. The defendant responded in the negative and invited the officer to search him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the search, Scanlon discovered six bags and one loose rock of crack cocaine concealed in the fold of the defendant\u2019s winter cap. The defendant resisted arrest, and an altercation ensued, during which Scanlon used his police radio to request emergency assistance. Officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Brian Cronin and David Dogali of the Stamford police department were the first to respond to the request, and assisted Scanlon in subduing and arresting the defendant. During the scuffle, Cronin kicked at the defendant\u2019s leg in an effort to stop him from resisting. The defendant suffered a broken tibia during his arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, he filed a civil lawsuit against Scanlon, Cronin and the city of Stamford. The lawsuit alleged that the officers, acting in their official capacity, \u201cfalsely arrested\u201d the defendant and \u201cemployed unreasonable force . ...\u201d As part of the civil lawsuit, depositions of the arresting officers were taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">At the defendant\u2019s criminal trial, during cross-examination of Scanlon, defense counsel sought to impeach Scanlon\u2019s direct testimony with a deposition transcript from the defendant\u2019s civil lawsuit. Defense counsel inquired whether Scanlon had placed the defendant\u2019s hand \u201cbehind [the defendant\u2019s] head\u201d during the altercation. Scanlon responded that he had not, at which point defense counsel asked: \u201cYou testified in <em>another proceeding in this matter </em>regarding this. Do you recall giv[ing] a deposition?\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel proceeded to impeach Scanlon with his deposition testimony, referring specifically to the \u201cdeposition\u201d on five occasions during that initial cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked: \u201cCounsel had mentioned something about a deposition. Well, what\u2019s that all about?\u201d The court overruled an objection as to relevance by defense counsel and allowed the question, and Scanlon replied: \u201cThe defendant is suing myself as well as the other officers in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>city of Stamford for, I believe, $1 million or in excess of $1 million.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On recross examination, defense counsel referred to the civil lawsuit by asking: \u201cYou\u2019re being sued because you were one of the officers that broke [the defendant\u2019s] \u2014 that injured [the defendant], correct?\u201d In sustaining the state\u2019s objection that the question required the witness to give an opinion, the court explained that it believed that defense counsel had opened the door to questioning regarding the civil action. Specifically, the court stated: \u201cThe existence of a suit is fine <em>because that was raised by the deposition business.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">Throughout the remainder of the trial, both defense counsel and the state made repeated references to the defendant\u2019s civil lawsuit. Following his initial objection, defense counsel primarily used that evidence to suggest that the arresting officers had fabricated their version of the events and had falsified their police reports in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>light of the pending civil lawsuit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> During the cross-examination of Cronin, defense counsel asked, \u201cSo, you made every effort <em>to try </em>and take pictures of all of the injuries that [Scanlon] suffered on that night for evidence in the case and in the civil suit?\u201d Defense counsel next inquired of Cronin, \u201cIsn\u2019t it, in fact, true that knowing [the defendant] was injured, you discussed the case with the other officers in order to get your story straight?\u201d During the cross-examination of ' Sergeant James Van Allen, the police supervisor at the scene of the incident, defense counsel again suggested that the police officers had falsified their reports in light of the pending civil lawsuit. Specifically, defense counsel adduced from Van Allen that the police reports were completed sixteen days after the incident occurred and then asked, \u201cAt that point, you knew there was probably going to be a lawsuit [filed] against you; is that correct?\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The state\u2019s use of that evidence included impeaching the credibility of the defendant and suggesting that he had a significant financial incentive to testify falsely. The prosecutor referred to the defendant\u2019s \u201cmillion dollar lawsuit\u201d both while questioning witnesses and during the rebuttal portion of his closing argument.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found the defendant guilty of possession of narcotics and assault of public safety personnel. The court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of five years incarceration, followed by three years of special parole. The crux of the defendant\u2019s appeal centers on the admission of testimony about the civil lawsuit and the state\u2019s subsequent use of that evidence. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The defendant first claims that the court abused its discretion in permitting the state to elicit testimony that he had filed a civil lawsuit against the arresting officers and the city of Stamford. The state maintains that defense counsel \u201copened the door for the admission\u201d of that testimony by introducing Scanlon\u2019s civil deposition during his cross-examination of Scanlon. The state further contends that the defendant has not demonstrated that the admission of testimony about the civil lawsuit, even if improper, was harmful. We agree with the state\u2019s contention that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Before addressing the merits of that claim, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cUnless an evi-dentiary ruling involves a clear misconception of the law, [t]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling .... Moreover, evidentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Aaron L., </em>272 Conn. 798, 811, 865 A.2d 1135 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The state argues that by cross-examining Scanlon regarding his deposition testimony, the defendant opened the door to the state\u2019s line of questioning. We agree. \u201cGenerally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject. . . . The party who initiates discussion on the issue is said to have opened the door to rebuttal by the opposing party. Even though the rebuttal evidence would ordinarily be inadmissible on other-grounds, the court may, in its discretion, allow it where the party initiating inquiry has made unfair use of the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106,186-87, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S. Ct. 102, 163 L. Ed. 2d 116 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In determining whether otherwise inadmissible evidence should be admitted to rebut evidence offered by an opposing party, the \u201ccourt must carefully consider whether the circumstances of the case warrant further inquiry into the subject matter, and should permit it only to the extent necessary to remove any unfair prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>which might otherwise have ensued from the original evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">In essence, the defendant argues that the testimony concerning his civil lawsuit was irrelevant and that the prejudice to him that it caused outweighed any legitimate benefit to the state in placing the deposition transcript in its proper context. Specifically, the defendant contends that the admission of the testimony about his civil lawsuit was prejudicial in that it appealed to prejudices against persons who file personal injury and other similar lawsuits seeking damages. Our Supreme Court, however, has stated that \u201cthere is no reason to limit the right of a party to place in context testimony adduced by an opposing party and, consequently, appellate courts have not done so.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>272 Conn. 515, 544, 864 A.2d 847 (2005). Furthermore, the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine is expressly intended to \u201cprevent a defendant from successfully excluding inadmissible prosecution evidence and then selectively introducing pieces of this evidence for his own advantage, without allowing the prosecution to place the evidence in its proper context.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 187. Because the defendant successfully impeached Scanlon\u2019s trial testimony with his deposition testimony, the court reasonably determined that the question posed by the state was necessary to place the defendant\u2019s reference to a deposition from <em>\u201canother proceeding in this </em>matter\u201d in its proper context. Accordingly, because defense counsel introduced evidence concerning the deposition, the court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the state to question Scanlon regarding the context of that deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Even if we assume arguendo that the admission of the challenged testimony was improper, the defendant, nevertheless, has not demonstrated harmfulness. For the defendant to prevail on his claim, he must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>that the error was harmful. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 527. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of evidentiary rulings that if [the] error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. . . . Two lines of cases have developed setting forth the standard for reversing nonconstitutional, evidentiary improprieties. Under one line of cases, the defendant must establish, in order to obtain a reversal of his conviction, that it is more probable than not that the result of the trial would have been different if the error had not been committed. . . . According to a second line of cases, the defendant must show that the prejudice resulting from the impropriety was so substantial as to undermine confidence in the fairness of the verdict. . . . Under either formulation, [w]hether [the improper admission of a witness\u2019 testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 527-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">In the present case, the existence of substantial physical evidence that was indicative of the defendant\u2019s guilt, as well as consistent testimony by the state\u2019s witnesses supporting that physical evidence renders the admission of evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s civil law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>suit harmless. Notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, evidence was adduced at trial that the narcotics in question were found on the defendant\u2019s person. In addition, the state presented numerous photographs of the injuries sustained by Scanlon during his altercation with the defendant. That physical evidence was supported by consistent testimony by witnesses for the state, including two police officers who testified that they observed Scanlon struggling with the defendant. Because the jury properly could find that evidence credible, we cannot conclude that the defendant met his burden of establishing that the admission of the evidence concerning his civil action was harmful to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The defendant next claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct that denied the defendant his due process right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s closing argument constituted misconduct in that it (1) implored the jury to find him guilty on a basis other than the evidence of the offense committed, (2) imposed a penalty on him for exercising his first amendment rights and (3) shifted the burden of proof to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">At the outset, we note that the defendant concedes that the instances of alleged misconduct were not preserved for our review. \u201c[T]he touchstone for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>review of claims of prosecutorial misconduct is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial. . . . [That] determination must involve application of the specific prosecutorial misconduct factors articulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987), regardless of whether the defendant objected to the incidents of misconduct at trial. . . . Nevertheless, both our Supreme Court and this court have also emphasized that the responsibility of defense counsel, at the very least, [is] to object to perceived prosecutorial improprieties as they occur at trial, and we continue to adhere to the well established maxim that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument when it was made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that it was unfair in light of the record of the case at the time. . . . Accordingly, we emphasize that counsel\u2019s failure to object at trial, while not by itself <em>fatal </em>to a defendant\u2019s claim, frequently will indicate on appellate review that the challenged comments do not rise to the magnitude of constitutional error .... Put differently . . . prosecutorial misconduct claims [are] not intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts, but rather, to address gross prosecutorial improprieties that . . . have deprived a criminal defendant of his right to a fair trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>89 Conn. App. 1, 27-28, 872 A.2d 477, cert. denied, 275 Conn. 921, 883 A.2d 1247 (2005); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 573-77, 849 A.2d 626 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth certain relevant legal principles that guide our resolution of this issue. \u201c[T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . In analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>are separate and distinct: (1) whether misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial. Put differently, misconduct is misconduct, regardless of its ultimate effect on the fairness of the trial; whether that misconduct caused or contributed to a due process violation is a separate and distinct question that may only be resolved in the context of the entire trial .... We also note that in order to prove prosecutorial misconduct, the defendant must demonstrate substantial prejudice by establishing that the trial as a whole was fundamentally unfair and that the misconduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Boyd, supra, 28-29; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 571-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In the present case, because the claimed prosecu-torial misconduct occurred primarily during closing argument, we set forth the legal principles applicable to such claims. \u201c[P]rosecutorial misconduct of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments. ... In determining whether such misconduct has occurred, the reviewing court must give due deference to the fact that [c]ounsel must be allowed a generous latitude in argument, as the limits of legitimate argument and fair comment cannot be determined precisely by rule and line, and something must be allowed for the zeal of counsel in the heat of argument. . . . Thus, as the state\u2019s advocate, a prosecutor may argue the state\u2019s case forcefully, [provided the argument is] fair and based upon the facts in evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. . . . Nevertheless, the prosecutor has a heightened duty to avoid argument that strays from the evidence or diverts the jury\u2019s attention from the facts of the case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cOr to put it another way while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one. ... A prosecutor must draw a careful line. On the one hand, he should be fair; he should not seek to arouse passion or engender prejudice. On the other hand, earnestness or even a stirring eloquence cannot convict him of hitting foul blows. ... In examining the prosecutor\u2019s argument we must distinguish between those comments whose effects may be removed by appropriate instructions . . . and those which are flagrant and therefore deny the accused a fair trial. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">\u201cLast, we note that [w]e do not scrutinize each individual comment in a vacuum, but rather we must review the comments complained of in the context of the entire trial. ... It is in that context that the burden [falls] on the defendant to demonstrate that the remarks were so prejudicial that he was deprived of a fair trial and the entire proceedings were tainted.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 29-30. With the foregoing in mind, we turn to the defendant\u2019s specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We begin our analysis by first determining whether the prosecutor\u2019s actions constituted misconduct. Only if we determine that misconduct occurred will we proceed to the second question of whether the defendant was denied his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The defendant first argues that the state\u2019s rebuttal argument urged the jury to find him guilty, not on the basis of the evidence of the offenses charged, but rather as a means of sanctioning him for bringing a civil lawsuit. The defendant also argues that by inviting the jury to find him guilty as a means of sanctioning him, the state imposed a penalty on him for bringing his civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>lawsuit, specifically, a penalty that violated his first amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances. Finally, the defendant argues that the state\u2019s rebuttal argument shifted the burden of proof to him to prove that his civil lawsuit had merit. Because each of those arguments depends on whether the prosecutor improperly implored the jury to find the defendant guilty on any basis other than the evidence of the offenses charged, we examine them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claims. During the state\u2019s initial closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor made no reference to the defendant\u2019s civil lawsuit. Nevertheless, in closing argument, defense counsel stated: \u201c[The defendant] testified [that] he\u2019s suing the city. He doesn\u2019t know anything about $1 million. He personally thinks it\u2019s worth $5 million. He\u2019s about as much a lawyer as [the prosecutor] is a mathematician or Officer Cronin is an English major.\u201d He also stated: \u201cThe police break your leg and crack your head open, you get the book thrown at you. Of course, [the defendant] is suing the city, as if we could keep that a secret. That\u2019s what happens when things like this happen. . . . This case is about a broken leg. It\u2019s not about [the defendant] suing the police department. I\u2019m not coming ... up here and showing you the pictures. I know you seen all the pictures. You know his leg was broken. You\u2019re sick of it. We all are. But what\u2019s right is right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">In its rebuttal, the state directly responded to the defendant\u2019s closing argument by beginning: \u201cYou\u2019re right, [the defendant] wants what\u2019s right. He wants what\u2019s right. You\u2019re right, there\u2019s no question about that. No question about that he wants $5 million. That\u2019s what\u2019s right for him. This is about money for this gentleman. Self-serving, it\u2019s about money. That\u2019s what this is about. You heard testimony about this civil lawsuit, and there was a question asked. You want one? He said five. Five is more than one. It\u2019s about money. It\u2019s about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>money. That\u2019s what\u2019s right for him. Because remember, everything else is a conspiracy, according to this defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">The state completed the remainder of its closing argument without further comment on the defendant\u2019s civil lawsuit, but concluded: \u201cAt this particular time, ladies and gentlemen, say \u2018no more\u2019 to [the defendant]. Just say \u2018no more\u2019 to him. No more of his inconsistencies, his self-serving statements, his misstatements, [and] the contradictions within his own defense. Say \u2018no more\u2019 to [the defendant]. Say \u2018no more.\u2019 It\u2019s about money for this man. It\u2019s all about money. He told you about his lawsuit. Say \u2018no more.\u2019 Say \u2018no more\u2019 to his larceny. Say \u2018no more\u2019 to his child support issue that he brought up. Say \u2018no more\u2019 to [the] unjust violation probation hearing. Say \u2018no more\u2019 to his million dollar lawsuit. Say \u2018no more\u2019 to the unlawful hearing. Say \u2018no more\u2019 to conspiracy theories. Just say \u2018no more\u2019 to [the defendant] . And the way you say \u2018no more\u2019 to [the defendant], based on all the evidence that was elicited in this case, is to take the piece of paper, the long form information that the state filed [and] the judge will give you, [and] you find him guilty of those counts. And you say \u2018no more\u2019 to [the defendant]. And you let him know what he knows [to] be true since March 4, 2000, that he is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">In support of his position that the state urged the jury to find him guilty as a means of sanctioning him for initiating a civil lawsuit, the defendant refers to the portion of the state\u2019s rebuttal argument in which the prosecutor instructed the jury to \u201c[s]ay \u2018no more\u2019 to [the defendant\u2019s] million dollar lawsuit\u201d and then explained that \u201cthe way you say \u2018no more\u2019 . . . based on all the evidence that was elicited in this case . . . is to . . . find him guilty of those counts.\u201d Although the state made repeated references to the defendant\u2019s \u201cmillion dollar lawsuit\u201d during its rebuttal argument, those comments made up only a small portion of the state\u2019s closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>argument and were not objected to by defense counsel. Indeed, rather than imploring the jury to find the defendant guilty on an improper basis, the state, on two occasions, expressly instructed the jury to base its verdict on \u201call the evidence that was elicited in this case . . . .\u201d Because the existence of the defendant\u2019s civil lawsuit was properly admitted into evidence, it was permissible for the jury to consider such evidence and any inferences that could be drawn therefrom. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mulero, </em>91 Conn. App. 509, 520, 881 A.2d 1039 (2005) (\u201c[i]t is not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences the jurors might draw therefrom\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Consequently, the jury was free to question the veracity of the defendant in light of the pending civil lawsuit. Finally, the defendant raised his civil lawsuit in closing argument, and \u201c[t]he state may . . . properly respond to inferences raised by the defendant\u2019s closing argument.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>supra, 89 Conn. App. 37. The prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument, therefore, responded to the defendant\u2019s closing argument and suggested inferences for the jury to draw about the defendant\u2019s veracity on the basis of the evidence. We conclude, therefore, that when viewed in light of the trial as a whole, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper and did not constitute misconduct.

See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 572-76.

Furthermore, defense counsel evidently did not perceive the state\u2019s closing comments or the admission of that evidence to be particularly harmful.

At the opening of the redirect examination of Scanlon by the state, the following testimony was permitted by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Counsel had mentioned something about a deposition.

Although \u201c[generally, a party who delves into a particular subject during the examination of a witness cannot object if the opposing party later questions the witness on the same subject\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>272 Conn. 106, 186, 864 A.2d 666 (2004), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 848, 126 S.

App. 305, 312, 696 A.2d 363 (1997). \u201cThe doctrine of opening the door cannot . . . be subverted into a rule for injection of prejudice. . . . The trial court must carefully consider whether the circumstances of the case warrant further inquiry into the subject matter, and should permit it <em>only to the extent necessary </em>to remove any unfair prejudice which might otherwise have ensued from the original evidence. . . . Thus, in making its determination, the trial court should balance the harm to the state in restricting the inquiry with the prejudice suffered by the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>in allowing the rebuttal.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\u201cIt is a fundamental rule of appellate review of eviden-tiary rulings that if [the] error is not of constitutional dimensions, an appellant has the burden of establishing that there has been an erroneous ruling which was probably harmful to him. . . . [W]hether [the improper admission of a witness\u2019 testimony] is harmless in a particular case depends upon a number of factors, such as the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. . . . Most importantly, we must examine the impact of the [improperly admitted] evidence on the trier of fact and the result of the trial. ... If the evidence may have had a tendency to influence the judgment of the jury, it cannot be considered harmless.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>272 Conn. 515, 527-28, 864 A.2d 847 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">I respectfully disagree that the line of questioning by defense counsel concerning Scanlon\u2019s deposition testimony invited or \u201copened the door\u201d to questioning regarding the nature of the lawsuit. Defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the deposition testimony was extremely limited. The questioning was designed only to impeach Scanlon through the use of a prior inconsistent statement he had made regarding the manner in which he had restrained the defendant during his arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>deposition itself was never the focus of the cross-examination of Scanlon, and defense counsel's reference to the deposition simply identified the venue where the prior inconsistent statement was made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel never inquired into or even mentioned the civil lawsuit during the cross-examination, nor would it be necessary to do so to impeach Scanlon on the basis of the prior inconsistent statement. In this case, defense counsel\u2019s limited questioning into Scanlon\u2019s deposition testimony did not open the door to the state\u2019s sweeping and generic inquiry: \u201cCounsel had mentioned something about a deposition. Well, what\u2019s that all about?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Although in the criminal context, the purpose of the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine is to \u201cprevent a defendant from successfully excluding inadmissible prosecution evidence and then selectively introducing pieces of this evidence for his own advantage, without allowing the prosecution to place the evidence in its proper context\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Colon, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 187; this is not a case in which the state would have been at an unfair advantage had the court precluded the rebuttal testimony. The present case is not one in which defense counsel sought to introduce select portions of the deposition testimony and to exclude others not to his advantage. Although a court may, in its discretion, allow otherwise inadmissible evidence on rebuttal when the party initiating inquiry has made <em>unfair </em>use of the evidence, defense counsel did not make unfair use of the evidence by mischaracterizing Scanlon\u2019s deposition testimony in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Although, undisputedly, the cross-examination into Scanlon\u2019s deposition testimony opened the door to certain inquiries by the state that would otherwise be inadmissible, the question that the state asked extended beyond the limits of the opening the door doctrine. The majority refers to the state\u2019s right \u201cto place in context testimony adduced by an opposing party . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 544. The right to place testimony in its context is not an unqualified one, however, and a party does not have free rein to inquire into any matter that would place the testimony in a more favorable light. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>200 Conn. 9, 14, 509 A.2d 493 (1986) (introduction of rebuttal evidence \u201cwas not essential to cure the unfairness, if any, that the state may have suffered by the defense counsel\u2019s limited inquiry\u201d). The court always must determine that the value of establishing a particular \u201ccontext\u201d for the testimony outweighs its prejudicial effect on the juiy. In my opinion, the question posed by the state was only marginally probative, with its effect being highly prejudicial to the defendant. As such, I believe that the court\u2019s decision to permit the questioning constituted an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The question presented by the state on redirect examination was not especially probative of any legitimate issue related to Scanlon\u2019s impeachment. Although the state was free to rehabilitate Scanlon, in no way did the elicited testimony demonstrate Scanlon\u2019s character for veracity or cast light on the reason for his prior inconsistent testimony. If anything, the state\u2019s elicitation of the existence of the defendant\u2019s civil action against Scanlon damaged Scanlon\u2019s credibility and suggested that he was biased.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state did not attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>to draw any connection between the matter on which Scanlon was impeached and the inquiry into the nature of the civil action. See 2 C. Fishman, Jones on Evidence (7th Ed. 1994) \u00a7 11:34, p. 354 (\u201cto be admissible, the evidence [proffered on the basis that a party has opened the door to its admissibility] must truly answer or rebut what has already been offered\u201d). Because the state\u2019s inquiry was not designed to rehabilitate its witness in any way, it was not at all probative on any <em>legitimate </em>issue in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">More importantly, the testimony permitted to be elicited on redirect examination was highly prejudicial to the defendant. \u201c[T]he court has inherent authority to <em>prevent </em>the jury from being influenced by matters that might prejudice its deliberations.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>77 Conn. App. 818, 829, 827 A.2d 1 (2003). \u201cEvidence is prejudicial when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 830. In the present case, the jury was permitted to hear testimony that the defendant was suing certain police officers and the city of Stamford for millions of dollars. There is often a stigma attached to those who bring lawsuits against their local governments for millions of dollars; the connotation sometimes is that such individuals are motivated solely by money.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That evidence unfairly took the jury\u2019s attention away from the facts of the criminal case and emphasized a controversial lawsuit that carried negative connotations about the criminal defendant. The degree of prejudice suffered by the defendant was exacerbated by the repeated reference by the state throughout the remainder of the trial to his \u201cmillion dollar lawsuit.\u201d The court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>permit that testimony and, thus, to open the floodgates to further inquiry into that irrelevant matter was clearly an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We will not disturb a court\u2019s improper evidentiary ruling, however, unless the defendant can demonstrate that he suffered substantial harm as a result of that ruling. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 272 Conn. 527-28. I respectfully disagree with the majority that the ruling in this case was not harmful. As stated previously, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s civil lawsuit prejudiced the defendant by distracting the juiy from the criminal case and appealing to the common prejudice against individuals who sue the government for large sums of money. Our law is clear that \u201c[a]ny improper evidence that may have a tendency to excite the passions, awaken the sympathy, or influence the judgment, of the jury, cannot be considered as harmless.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>270 Conn. 337, 367-68, 852 A.2d 676 (2004). A review of the record reveals that after Scanlon\u2019s testimony regarding the civil lawsuit was. admitted, references to the defendant\u2019s \u201cmillion dollar lawsuit\u201d permeated the entire trial from that point onward. Had the court not permitted the initial reference to the nature of the deposition proceedings, it is likely that the repeated references to the \u201cmillion dollar lawsuit\u201d would not have occurred.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The most damaging reference to the civil action was made by the state during its rebuttal argument when the prosecutor urged the jury to \u201c[s]ay no more to his million dollar lawsuit. . . . And the way you say no more to [the defendant], based on all the evidence that was elicited in this case, is to . . . find him guilty of those counts.\u201d The pervasive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>reference to the civil action, particularly as part of the state\u2019s last words to the jury, raises in my mind the great possibility that the jury was prejudiced by the court\u2019s initial evidentiary ruling. The harmfulness of the court\u2019s decision was further enhanced by its failure to give any limiting instruction regarding the civil action. The trial became contaminated, and the focus of the jury was distracted from the relevant issues in the case. Because the civil action permeated the entire trial, there is a distinct possibility that the jury was improperly influenced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Although there is no dispute that our law permits an inquiry on redirect examination concerning the subject matter to which reference was made in cross-examination, here, the door was never opened so as to permit any inquiry into the nature of the defendant\u2019s civil action. If anything was opened, it was Pandora\u2019s box that was opened by the court. The result was that the defendant was substantially prejudiced and the propriety of his trial jeopardized. The evidence should have been confined to that which would have determined the guilt or innocence of the defendant. That was not done. For the reasons stated, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\"> \u201cIt is fundamental that lor the purpose of impeaching the credibility of his testimony, a witness may be cross-examined as to statements made out of court or in other proceedings which contradict those made upon direct examination. . . . This is based on the notion that talking one way on the stand, and another way previously, raises a doubt as to the truthfulness of both statements. . . . The impeaching statement may be oral ... or writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>ten.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Falls </em>v. <em>Loew\u2019s Theatres, Inc., </em>46 Conn. App. 610, 612, 700 A.2d 76 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-8\"> Although the majority states that defense counsel used the word \u201cdeposition\u201d five times during that line of questioning, that was only because he was required to rephrase his questions following objections by the state. In fact, that portion of the cross-examination testimony that raises the deposition testimony was brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> Although if the defendant sought to impeach Scanlon on the ground of potential bias, that would necessarily require an inquiry into the civil lawsuit and, as stated previously, the defendant did <em>not </em>seek to impeach Scanlon on that ground and never mentioned the civil action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\"> In fact, the prosecutor in his rebuttal argument referenced the civil action and stated numerous times that the defendant was motivated solely by money. See part II of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> Although the majority correctly points out that defense counsel also raised the issue of the civil action in subsequent witness examinations, I do not see that as determinative of the issue on appeal. I cannot fault defense counsel for attempting to use evidence of the civil action to his client\u2019s advantage after the court improperly permitted the initial testimony on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
