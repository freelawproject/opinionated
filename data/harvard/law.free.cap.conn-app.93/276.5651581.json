If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 612, 646 A.2d 126 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Here, the court did not abuse its discretion. Our review of the record reveals that the petitioner raised an identical claim of ineffective assistance of counsel before our Supreme Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>267 Conn. 414, 838 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 809, 125 S. Ct. 36, 160 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2004),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that it was rejected. We are not persuaded by the petitioner\u2019s argument that <em>Turner </em>was overruled by <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>541 U.S. 652, 124 S. Ct. 2140, 158 L. Ed. 2d 938 (2004). On the basis of our reading of Yarborough,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we conclude that our Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Turner </em>is in harmony with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s ruling and, accordingly, hold that the court properly denied the petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\"> In Ms underlying criminal case, the petitioner pleaded guilty to and was convicted of sexual assault in the second degree and risk of injury to a child. <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>267 Conn. 414, 416, 838 A.2d 947, cert. denied, 543 U.S. 809, 125 S. Ct. 36, 160 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2004). He was sentenced to a total term of incarceration of ten years, execution suspended after nine months, and ten years conditional probation. In this habeas appeal, the petitioner raises two claims. He claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and (2) improperly dismissed his petition for habeas <em>corpus </em>relief. Because our resolution of the first claim is dispositive of the second claim, we do not reach the merits of the second claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\"> In this habeas appeal, the petitioner claims that his counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to preserve the claim that the petitioner\u2019s confession was obtained by the police in violation of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), and because counsel failed to inform him of his right to enter a plea of nolo contendere. The petitioner previously raised an identical claim in <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 439. Our Supreme Court held in <em>Turner </em>that because the defendant was not in \u201ccustody\u201d for <em>Miranda </em>purposes, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s claim on appeal [was] frivolous, [and] counsel was not required to consult with the defendant regarding a conditional plea of nolo contendere .... Thus, the defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel [failed].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> Our Supreme Court held in <em>State </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>supra, 267 Conn. 439, that the defendant\u2019s age could not be considered as a factor when determining whether he believed he was in custody because \u201cwhen determining whether a reasonable person would have felt that he or she was free to leave [an encounter with the police], courts are to apply an objective, rather than a subjective, standard. . . . [I]t is irrelevant that the defendant may have been a novice to police questioning. His subjective beliefs about whether he was in fact free to leave have no bearing on whether he was in custody\u201d; (citations omitted); for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">Similarly, the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Yarborough </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 541 U.S. 663, that \u201cthe initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation, not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned. . . . Courts must examine all of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and determine how a reasonable person in the position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of the individual being questioned would gauge the breadth of his or her freedom of action.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)
