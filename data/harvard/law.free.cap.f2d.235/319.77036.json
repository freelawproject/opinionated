The Woolworth Company refused and refuses to supply the requested information other than names of employees and initial classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-14\">The Labor Board has found an unfair labor practice and petitions here for the usual enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-15\">Before setting forth the details of the controversy, we think it advisable to set forth hereafter as an appendix the entire wage agreement which is at the root of the succeeding events in <em>the </em>labor-management dispute. The agi\u2019eemerit appears as appendix \u201cA\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-16\">It will be noted in Section 21 that the two year agreement provided for a cost-of-living adjustment on March 7, 1953, or the basic minimum wage rate as contained in Section 5. Also in Section 21 one observes a provision for further adjustment by \u201cmutual agreement between the parties.\u201d The management prerogative clause, Section 17, should be carefully read.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-17\">. There appears to be no contention that management will not furnish the local the names of all employees on the payroll. Such information seems to have been made available to the satisfaction of the local.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-18\">But shortly after, execution of the contract, the local wrote for the number of hours worked per week for each employee, also each employee\u2019s total pay and rate of pay for the week ending prior to the effective date of the agreement, which was March 5, 1952. The request was ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-19\">Early in 1953, negotiations began for revision of the basic rates. One and 4%ooths cents per hour was required automatically on the standard of living index. The local asked for five cents. The company was offering two and one-half cents. During the negotiations the request was revived for the same wage information previously requested. It was urged that the information was needed \u201cfor the intelligent and equitable administration of the agreement.\u201d Later, during the negotiations the demand was repeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-20\">On April 30, 1953, the local accepted the company\u2019s offer of two and one-half cents or one dollar per week increase on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the basic wage rates. On May 5, the local again wrote the company for the information. The request was refused by ignoring it. On June 18, the local filed a complaint with the board alleging the refusal was an unfair labor practice. After a hearing, the board agreed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We believe that the company really makes three defenses: 1. An employer never has to give such information as was demanded here. 2. If in some cases such information must be furnished, it was not obligated to do so here. 3. The matter should have been submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In connection with contention (2), the company relies heavily on the management prerogative clause, Section 17 of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">In view of our conclusion on the second contention, we do not reach squarely the first contention, but of course the arguments on either contention do overlap. In ruling on contention (2), we think much depends on how we read the recent case of N. L. R. B. v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., 351 U.S. 149, 76 S.Ct. 753, 100 L.Ed.-.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">The facts of Woolworth are different. In Truitt the information sought was the company\u2019s financial condition. Bargaining was deadlocked. The company said it couldn\u2019t afford the union\u2019s wage demands. The union said, \u201cProve it.\u201d The Supreme Court held, under the circumstances, information of the company ordinarily private, had to be supplied. The majority opinion makes clear that the right is not a universal one and depends on each case\u2019s peculiar circumstances. What the \u201ccircumstances\u201d are will have to be hammered out in successive cases before the Labor Board and the Courts of Appeal with further delineation eventually by the Supreme Court when the cases are \u201cripe\u201d or conflicts in circuits become serious.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">There are a number of cogent arguments that the employee should have a right of privacy on payroll information, absent his consent to disclosure. With his consent, it probably would always be the employer\u2019s duty to furnish the union information, unless the totality of the information was so voluminous as to be unduly burdensome to prepare and would serve no possible useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>But here we have the question of the employee\u2019s representative, the local, by virtue of being the representative, and not because of any contract provision or any express authorization from those whom it represents, demanding the information. Woolworth contends that the board has here enunciated a \u201cper se\u201d right. We do not think the board intended to go that far, but its holding approaches it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">For the purposes of this opinion, we shall assume that in the posture of some negotiations with the employer concerning contracts and wages, the bargaining representative by virtue of his office may be entitled to the information requested and to receive it from the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Here we reject the board\u2019s findings and conclusions on the ground we do not find a rational basis for them. During the 1953 negotiations, the sole subject of negotiation was wholly under Section 21 of the contract and concerned an adjustment of Section 5 basic rates. That was the only thing to negotiate about at the time. There seems to have been no contention that Woolworth could not pay the basic rate demanded by the union and still survive. The relevancy of the demand with reference to the wage increase negotiations was at no time demonstrated. It is agreed that at the time an employee began work the local was notified of the employment and of the employee\u2019s classification according to experience under Section 5. The contract, Section 17, gave management exclusive and absolute control over any incentive or bonus pay schedules. The amount of overtime work, if any, was obviously reserved to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">But what of the demand made by the employee representative after the wage increase was satisfactorily concluded? The only ground ever expressly asserted was: \u201cIt is imperative that we have this information for the intelligent and equitable administration of the Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We do not hold that a request must painfully, laboriously or absolutely demonstrate in detail a relevancy, but we do believe that at sometime or someplace some specific relevancy should be asserted or facts should be shown whereby one could say that the employer ought to know anyway without demonstration the relevancy of the information to the relationship of the parties. It must be something more than Micawber\u2019s \u201csomething may turn up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">Later, the secretary of the local testified generally before the board as to a number of complaints that the local had had to adjust with management during the term of the contract from its execution forward. We find the nature of these complaints most elusive. The representative never suggests a type of grievance requiring the information. Further, it is interesting to note that this representative demanding the information had no idea whether his local office was keeping the classified detailed information supplied by the company upon the occasion of each new addition to the payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Assuming the right to complete payroll information under some circumstances for purposes of \u201cintelligent administration\u201d of the agreement, it perhaps could be that a bona fide assertion that a substantial number of employees were not getting their minimum rates would justify a request for payroll information on all of the employees. Moreover, poor observance in general by management of the terms of an agreement might justify a request for payroll information to see if wage contract provisions were being flouted. But the board was told nothing of the employee grievances which the representative said he had for his attention. Further, the representative had no idea whether the serious grievances (character unknown) had been adjusted. Objectively the local request does not seem to meet a test of reasonable usefulness, and there is no showing of anything in the subjective minds of the parties indicating need.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">We cannot believe that if any serious violations of an agreement are going on that they will customarily remain wholly unknown. There will ordinarily be the necessary inkling and evidence to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the request for specific information as to a specific individual and the grounds suggesting an immediate need for information for all also will rear themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Our appraisal of this record is that the claim of unfair practice, when closely analyzed, condenses to no more than, \u201cWell, we might find something.\u201d If we are correct in that analysis of the nature of the claim, then we are confident of our conclusion that there was no unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">If the complainant is entitled to information highly personal to employees, we think the lesson is in N. L. R. B. v. Truitt Manufacturing Co., supra, and in N. L. R. B. v. American National Insurance Co., 343 U.S. 395, 72 S.Ct. 824, 96 L.Ed. 1027, that there must under all of the circumstances be a showing of reasonable need of the information to meet a condition. If the reason is not obvious, then he who asserts the claim should demonstrate to him against whom it is asserted some relevant particularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">We do held that the information does not have to be produced on a \u201cWell, we want it\u201d or \u201cIt is a handy thing to have around\u201d basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The contention of Woolworth that here was a dispute subject to arbitration, we find to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">The petition for enforcement will be denied. The board\u2019s order must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Appendix \u201cA\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">\u201cAgreement\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">\u201cThis Agreement, made and entered into this 11th day of March, 1952, by and between the F.
