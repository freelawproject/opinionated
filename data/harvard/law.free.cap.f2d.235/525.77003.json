The accident occurred in Maryland. An action for wrongful deaths was brought against the Transit Company in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant on the claim for the wife\u2019s death and for the plaintiff on the claim for the husband\u2019s death. The defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-15\">We think the evidence relating to negligence of the defendant justified the trial court in submitting that issue to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-16\">The automobile in which the husband and wife were riding was registered in his name, though there was some evidence it was bought with their joint funds. <em>The </em>defendant asked the court to rule as a matter of law that the wife\u2019s negligence must be imputed to the husband. The court ruled as a matter of law that her negligence must not be imputed to him. In our opinion neither proposition is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-17\"> Since the accident occurred in Maryland, Maryland law must be applied. \u201cIf the car is negligently operated, it is presumed that the owner consented to the negligence. Therefore, <em>in the absence of proof that he abandoned the right of control, </em>he is liable for any damage resulting from the negligence of the driver.\u201d Powers v. State, 178 Md. 23, 28, 11 A.2d 909, 911. (Emphasis added.) We have no reason to think a different rule applies in respect to imputing the driver\u2019s negligence when the owner-passenger is not being sued but is suing a third person. See Wallace v. Fowler, 183 Md. 97, 104, 36 A.2d 691, 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-18\">The defendant says in its reply brief that the question of the husband\u2019s responsibility for his wife\u2019s negligence should \u201cat the very least\u201d have been submitted to the jury \u201cunder proper instructions\u201d. It should have been submitted to the jury if that course had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>requested. But the defendant not only failed to ask the trial court to submit the question to the jury, but went further and induced the court to exclude evidence offered by the plaintiff which bore directly on the question whether the husband had expressly or impliedly transferred all right of control to his wife. Cf. Myles v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 3 Cir., 189 F.2d 1014, 1017-1018. Since \u201cthe only ruling requested was properly denied, the judgment must stand.\u201d Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. v. Parker, 242 U.S. 13, 15, 37 S.Ct. 4, 5, 61 L.Ed. 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
