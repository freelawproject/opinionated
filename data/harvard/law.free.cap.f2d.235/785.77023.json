After identifying himself to defendant\u2019s driver, that inspector asked for, and examined, the bill of lading, now government exhibit 1, covering the cargo then being hauled by Chicago Express, Inc., the defendant-common carrier. Exhibit 1, bearing defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s signature, is plainly and clearly stamped: \u201cClass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>'B' Poison Label Applied\u201d. While making his roadside inspection of the tractor, but not its contents, the inspector observed that it did not carry two red rear reflectors required by I. C. C. regulations, nor was it placarded pursuant to 49 C.F.R. 77.823 showing transportation of a dangerous commodity. This visual examination resulted in the filing of a four-count<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> criminal information against 'Chicago Express, Inc., on which a jury returned a verdict of guilty under the first two counts and not guilty on the others. Defendant, fined $500 on the first count, and $100 on the second, has appealed its conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"AHt\">The critical counts are bottomed on regulations promulgated by the Interstate Commerce Commission, which has undisputed authority for such purpose, flowing from 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 835, containing <em>inter alia, </em>this salient sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahx-dedup-1\">\u201cWhoever <em>knowingly </em>violates any such regulation shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both * * * \u201d (italicization added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_F\">By using the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in \u00a7 835, we think Congress, while describing a state of mind essential for responsibility, removed violations of the relevant regulations from the classifi\u25a0cation familiarly known as offenses ma-lum prohibitum, public welfare, and civil offenses. Indeed, Mr. Justice Clark ds-livering the majority opinion in Boyce Motor Lines v. United States, 1952, 342 U.S. 337, 342, 72 S.Ct. 329, 331, 96 L. Ed. 367, involving 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 197.1(b) explained the impact of \u00a7 835 in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU2\">\u201cThe statute punishes only those who knowingly violate the Regulation. This requirement of the presence of culpable intent as a necessary element of the offense does much to destroy any force in the argument that application of the Regulation would be so unfair that it must be held invalid. That is evident from a consideration of the requirement in this case. To sustain a conviction, the Government not only must prove that petitioner could have taken another route which was both commercially practicable and appreciably safer * * * than the one it did follow. It must also be shown that petitioner knew that there was such a practicable, safer route and yet deliberately took the more dan*f'ous J\u00b0ute through the tunnel or that Petitioner wilfully neglected to exercisers duty under the Regulatian ^ inqui11'e mt\u00b0 the availability of such an alternative route.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"agg-dedup-0\">Relying on virtually the same aspect of the Boyce opinion the First Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>cuit reversed a conviction for violating the identical regulation, now before us, in St. Johnsbury Trucking Company v. United States, 1 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 393. A reversal of the judgment appealed is inevitable here in light of both cases just mentioned because of the failure to correctly instruct the jury on the mental element required by, and for accountability under, \u00a7 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">We think, therefore, it was reversible error for the trial court to refuse to give the following instruction requested by defendant: \u201cThe Court instructs the jury that before the defendant can be found guilty, the jury must believe from the evidence that defendant had a specific wrongful intent to violate the regulations of the Interstate Commerce [Commission].\u201d Our disposition of this appeal removes any need for treating other points raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ARm\">. Only the first two counts, relevant here, need be reprinted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVLP\">\u201cThe United States Attorney charged:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amf\">\u201cCount 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"amq-dedup-1\">\u201cOn or about the 1st day of October, 1952, in the Eastern District of Illinois, Chicago Express, Inc., defendant, a corporation, a common carrier by motor ve-hide and, as such carrier, subject to the regulations prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission applying to ship-nnents of explosives and other dangerous .articles made by way of common, contract and private carriers by public highway (49 C.F.R. 71 to 78) did knowingly transport by motor vehicle more than 2500 pounds of a dangerous poison, to wit, para nitroaniline solid, a Class B poisonous solid, from Monsanto, Illinois, without there being marked or placarded on each side and rear of said motor vehicle while enroute to Bound Brook, New Jersey, with a placard or lettering, in letters not less than three inches high, on a contrasting background, showing that said motor vehicle was transporting a dangerous commodity.
