Boudin, on the ground that issuance was precluded under Section 51.135 of the Passport Regulations \u201con the basis of all the evidence, including that contained in confidential reports of investigation.\u201d Bou-din then sued in the District Court for a judgment that he, as an American citizen, is entitled to a passport, and that the Passport Regulations are invalid. He also sought an order directing the Secretary of State to issue a passport to him forthwith. The District Court held that the applicant had a right to be confronted with the evidence against him in order to permit him to rebut or explain it, and to enable the courts to review the decision. It sent the case back to the Passport Office, ordering that a hearing be held within 20 days thereafter and that the decision of the Passport Office be \u201csubstantiated by evidence contained in the record\u201d made at such hearing. Both the Secretary of State and Boudin have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-25\">Section 51.135 of the Passport Regulations, 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.135 (Supp.1956), provides for denial of passports to three classes of persons, who are enumerated and described in subsections (a), (b), and (c) thereof.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>tary relied solely on this section in his letter notifying Boudin of his decision not to grant him a passport, he did not there specify which subsection barred issuance of a passport to Boudin nor did he set out any findings indicating that Boudin fell into any of the three classes of persons described in the regulation. The Secretary later filed an affidavit in the District Court in which he stated: \u201cThe basis for my decision to deny the Plaintiff further passport facilities rests on a pattern of associations and activities on the part of the Plaintiff over an extended period of time leading to the conclusion that <em>the Plaintiff has been and continues to be a supporter of the Communist movement</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">For present purposes, we accept the Secretary\u2019s affidavit as a statement that he has found that Boudin is a supporter of the Communist movement, even though such finding was not communicated in his letter notifying Boudin that issuance of a passport was precluded by Section 51.135 of the Passport Regulations. Subsection (b) of the regulation cited is the only part thereof which refers in terms to those who support the Communist movement. But that subsection is not phrased to deny passports to every supporter of the <em>movement, </em>without more. It states that passports shall be denied to persons \u201cwho engage in activities which support the Communist movement under such circumstances as to warrant the conclusion \u2014 not otherwise rebutted by the evidence \u2014 that they have engaged in such activities as a result of direction, domination, or control exercised over them by the Communist movement.\u201d In his letter to Boudin and even in his affidavit the Secretary has set out no finding or conclusion that Bou-din\u2019s alleged pro-Communist activities were the result of direction, domination, or control exercised over him by the Communist movement. He has thus failed to make the finding contemplated by subsection (b). Nor has he set out findings which would render subsections (a) or (c) applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">On the record before us here, which of course contains none of the confidential information on which the Secretary says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>he in part relied, we cannot assume that findings sufficient to bring Boudin within any subdivision of the regulation were secretly made or that they will be made. In an affidavit executed June 3, 1954, Boudin swore that he was not then a member of the Communist Party nor \u201cotherwise a person described in Regulation 51.135 subsection (a),\u201d and that I \u201cam not going abroad to engage in activities which will advance the Communist movement in violation of subsection (c), but for the purpose indicated in my correspondence with the Passport Office.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the Review Board hearing he testified under oath that he had not been a member of the Communist Party at any time since June 3, 1954, and that the facts stated in the affidavit continued to be true. His testimony bearing on the applicability of subsection (b) cannot be described as particularly frank or helpful, but he did to some extent outline\u2014 and seek to explain as non-subversive\u2014 his activities in connection with several organizations and publications, alleged to be Communist, and he did state that he was never \u201cordered\u201d or \u201cdirected\u201d (as distinguished from \u201cretained\u201d) by the Communist Party to defend any individual or association in a legal capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We think that factual findings sufficient to bring the applicant within one of the classes described in Section 51.135 are required before the Secretary may deny a passport under the authority of that regulation. Cf. Burrell v. Martin, 1955, 98 U.S.App.D.C. -, 232 F.2d 33. Since none were made here, the regulation, which the Secretary relied on exclusively in denying the passport, does not support his action. Cf. Perkins v. Elg, 1939, 307 U.S. 325, 349-350, 59 S.Ct. 884, 83 L.Ed. 1320; Shacht-man v. Dulles, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 287, 225 F.2d 938. An administrative order \u201ccannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., 1943, 318 U.S. 80, 95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-13\">The Government urges that Bou-din is barred from any relief because he declined to answer when asked whether or not he was a member of the Communist Party prior to June 3, 1954, the date of his affidavit swearing that he was not then a member of the Party. But the Secretary did not give this as a ground for his action in denying a passport, and we do not now consider whether it would have been a valid ground. Administrative action \u201ccannot be upheld merely because findings might have been made and considerations disclosed which would justify * * * [the] order * * *. There must be * * * a responsible finding.\u201d Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp., supra, 318 U.S. at page 94, 63 S.Ct. at page 462. This is not to say, of course, that Boudin\u2019s failure to answer questions about his past \u2014 when relevant to the present and future \u2014 cannot be considered by the Secretary in making his findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">The matter must therefore be returned to the Secretary for reconsideration. He may conclude that a passport should be issued or that a further hearing is needed. But if he decides \u2014 with or without an additional hearing \u2014 that issuance of a passport would not be warranted under the regulations, he should advise Boudin in writing of the findings made, relating them to the sections relied on. We do not reach in the present posture of the case the contention made by Boudin that the Secretary cannot rely on confidential information in reaching his decision. But since that question may arise at a subsequent stage, we think the Secretary should \u2014 if he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>fuses a passport to Boudin after the further consideration we have ordered\u2014 state whether his findings are based on the evidence openly prpduced, or (in whole or in material part) on secret information not disclosed to the. applicant. If the latter, the Secretary should explain with such particularity as in his judgment the. circumstances permit, the nature of the reasons why such information may not be disclosed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. Dulles v. Nathan, 1955, 96 U.S.App.D.C. 190, 225 F.2d 29. This will facilitate the task of the courts in dealing with the question of the propriety of the Secretary\u2019s use of confidential information \u2014a question which, we repeat, we do not now reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">When the Secretary has made his decision upon reconsideration, Boudin may then proceed as he may be advised. The District Court should retain jurisdiction for that purpose. If the passport is still refused by the Secretary, and further judicial review is sought by Boudin, the District Court may consider whether the findings made are justified by the evidence of record, or, if they are not so justified, whether the Secretary has given reasons valid in law for keeping confidential any information \u2014 not disclosed to the applicant \u2014 upon which he states he has relied. The District Court may also consider, if the question becomes material, whether the Passport Regulations are valid in their application to Boudin, as then determined by the Secretary \u2014 a question which we do not now reach and express no view upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Por the reasons given, the litigation must be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-17\">.
