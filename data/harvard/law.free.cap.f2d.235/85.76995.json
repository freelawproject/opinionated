We affirmed denial of relief upon the first motion. Hodge v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>States, 4 Cir., 217 F.2d 716. The second motion was based upon the contention that the imposition of consecutive sentences on the substantive and conspiracy counts constituted double punishment in violation of the 5th Amendment. The contention is entirely without merit. It is well settled that conspiracy is a crime separate and distinct from the crime which is the object of the conspiracy and that it is separately punishable. United States v. Bayer, 331 U.S. 532, 542, 67 S.Ct. 1394, 91 L.Ed. 1654; Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640, 66 S.Ct. 1180, 90 L.Ed. 1489. Furthermore, the conspiracy charged was not confined to the crimes charged in the substantive counts. The motion was properly denied for reasons adequately stated in the order of the District Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
