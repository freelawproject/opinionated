The trial court concluded that since the recent decision in Quinn v. United States, 1955, 349 U.S. 155, 75 S.Ct. 668, 99 L.Ed. 964, the word \u201cwillfully\u201d was required in the indictment to make out a charge under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">2 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 192,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under which the indictment was drawn, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-9\">\u201cEvery person who having been summoned as a witness by the authority of either House of Congress to give testimony or to produce papers upon any matter under inquiry before either House, * * * <em>willfully makes default, </em>or who, having appeared, <em>refuses to answer </em>any question pertinent to the question under inquiry, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, * * [Italics supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">The question, narrowly, is whether the intent, essential to <em>proof </em>of this offense, must be spelled out by a recital in the indictment that the refusal was <em>ivillful. </em>After reviewing the Quinn case carefully, we think this is not required. Quinn holds that \u201ca deliberate, intentional refusal to answer\u201d is an element of the offense which, \u201clike any other, must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 349 U.S. at page 165, 75 S.Ct. at page 674. In that case the Court was not dealing with the sufficiency of the indictment but of the proof. We agree with the trial judge that the indictment must charge an intentional act, but we think that it does so by use of the word \u201crefused.\u201d The indictment charged that Deutch \u201cunlawfully refused to answer\u201d and we think that language charged Deutch with an intentional, deliberate or knowing refusal to answer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-19\">The statute uses the word \u201cwillfully\u201d as a word of art to define the offense of failing to appear, but it does not use the word \u201cwillfully\u201d with respect to a person \u201cwho, having appeared, refuses to answer * * The act of refusing-(as distinguished from failing) to answer is a positive, affirmative act; the result is conscious and intended. Congress recognized that a failure to appear in response to a summons could well be due to other causes than willfulness or a deliberate purpose to disobey the summons or the statute; a witness might be confused as to the time or place of the hearing, or inadvertently overlook it or become ill. To decline or refuse to answer a question, however, is by its very nature a deliberate and willful act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b908-21\">Any doubt on this is resolved by the presence of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d preceding \u201crefused\u201d in this indictment;, that would satisfy the statute since a refusal would be unlawful only if it were willful. In other words, if \u201crefused\u201d standing alone were held not sufficient, because it does not connote a refusal which violates the statute, the presence of the word \u201cunlawfully\u201d would remedy that defect. For either reason, the decision of dismissal must, therefore, be</p>\n<p id=\"ACYL\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">. 52 Stat. 942 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b908-13\">. In United States v. Lamont, D.C.S.D. N.Y.1955, 18 F.R.D. 27, the District Court reached a contrary conclusion but did not suggest any reason why the word \u201cwillful\u201d is required to make the word \u201crefused\u201d charge the commission of a deliberate, intentional act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b908-23\">.
