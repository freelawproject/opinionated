The indictment charged them, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, with conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 by the transportation of stolen automobiles in interstate and foreign commerce. The indictment alleged the commission of overt acts, in furtherance of the conspiracy, by named defendants other than Russo. The defendants were convicted. On Russo\u2019s appeal from the judgment of conviction, we affirmed. Then Russo, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, moved the district court to vacate the judgment, on the. ground that the indictment was defective. The district court entered an order denying this motion, without a hearing because \u201cthe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the petition is entitled to no relief.\u201d Russo has appealed from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-21\">We think the motion wholly without merit: It was not necessary, on a conspiracy charge, to allege an actual violation of the substantive provisions of the statute. Nor was it essential to allege that Russo, as distinguished from other alleged conspirators, committed an overt act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or to describe the vehicles transported. Accordingly, the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-23\">. United States v.
