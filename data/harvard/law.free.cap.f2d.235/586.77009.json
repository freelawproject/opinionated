On consideration of the evidence in the record, the contentions of petitioner\u2019s brief, and the argument made before us, we can find no basis to declare any part of the Tax Court\u2019s decision to be clearly erroneous. This includes the addition made, under \u00a7 293(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 26 U.S.C.A., \u201cas if it were a deficiency\u201d, of 5 per cent, for negligence. With whatever good faith petitioner may have acted, she nevertheless allowed such looseness and carelessness to exist in relation to the making of her tax returns as the Tax Court on the record before it properly could regard, if it saw fit, as amounting to negligence in tax duty, within the object of the statute. It would serve no useful purpose in the situation for us to repeat what the Tax Court has warrantedly and adequately said.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
