Appendix, \u00a7 462,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and appeals, claiming the status of conscientious objector.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">Appellant first registered under the Selective Service Act on November 6, 1946, but made no claim relative to conscientious objection to war. His local board classified him 1-A and gave notice thereof to him. He took no appeal. In 1947 he notified his board that he had moved to Canada. Subsequently he returned to the United States and, on January 5, 1949, again registered with the same local board, this time under the Universal Military Training and Service Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-16\">The standard classification questionnaire form, Series XIV, page 7, relating to conscientious objector claims, was not filled out. In fact, nothing in either registration questionnaire, as filled out by appellant, gave the slightest hint that the registrant held conscientious objector views. Again,. appellant was classified 1-A, was so notified, and again no appeal was taken. Subsequent to such classification the board notified appellant to report for physical examination and, on September 6, 1950, he took and passed the examination. Apparently,, while being examined, he made some reference to the subject of conscientious objection, and was informed that he could get the special form, as to that subject, from his board. Acting upon such information, he received and filled out and returned the form to the board with reasonable promptness, setting up facts upon which he claimed the status of conscientious objector. We quote the applicable statute in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The facts set forth refer to his religious bringing up in a Christian family and his reading of the Bible. They are vague as to facts bearing upon a conscientious objection to war, and all of them relate to his religious habits from childhood to the present. There is nothing, as to any change of belief since either registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>On September 26, 1950, there was placed in appellant\u2019s file a statement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">\u201cBoard decided that inasmuch as Albert Stain, on the basis of his Questionnaire, was given a physical examination and found acceptable without protest, his record cannot be reopened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">No notice of this decision was sent to appellant. On October 3, 1950, appellant was ordered to report for induction, and on October 18, 1950, he appeared at the induction station and was found physically acceptable, but he declined to be inducted. This prosecution and conviction followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Appellant here seeks a reversal of the judgment of conviction, claiming that the action of his local board denied him procedural due process. His main contention is that the local board arbitrarily refused to consider his conscientious objector form upon its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">At the trial, counsel for appellant argued that appellant did not originally claim conscientious objector status because of mistaken advice from a cousin who helped him fill out his questionnaire, and because of appellant\u2019s lack of understanding of Selective Service regulations, owing to his low mentality. There was evidence presented at the trial which showed that appellant was given a neuro-psychiatric evaluation at the request of the Selective Service after his refusal to be inducted and was found by the examining doctor \u201cto fall into the category of the mildly, inadequate, somewhat emotionally unstable group of individuals who might possibly break down under severe enough stress and strain.\u201d From the documents in appellant\u2019s file, it was argued that it might have been found, had the board considered the merits of his claim, that appellant did not previously apply for such status due to lack of knowledge as to such a classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">Government argues that appellant should not be allowed to contest the validity of his 1-A classification since he did not appeal from being so classified and thus did not exhaust his administrative remedies. If we were merely called upon to determine whether or not there was a basis-in-fact for such 1-A classification, we might agree with appellee. But we are here dealing with a different phase of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-12\">As heretofore said, no previous objection to the 1-A classification had been made and no claim as to conscientious objection to war had been voiced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-13\">The Selective Service System regulations provide as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b395-14\">Title 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.1(a):<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cClassification Not Permanent, (a) No classification is permanent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-15\">Title 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2 :<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhen Registrant\u2019s Classification May Be Reopened And Considered Anew. The local board may reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant (1) upon the written request of the registrant * * * if such request is accompanied by written information presenting facts not considered when the registrant was classified, which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification; * \u2022\u00bb * provided, in either event, the classification of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an Order to Report for Induction * *</p>\n<p id=\"b395-16\"> Title 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.4 :<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cRefusal To Reopen And Consider Anew Registrant\u2019s Classification. When a registrant * * * files with the local board a written request to reopen and consider anew the registrant\u2019s classification and the local board is of the opinion that the information accompanying such request fails to present any facts in addition to those considered when the regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>trant was classified or, even if new facts are presented, the local board is of the opinion that such facts, if true, would not justify a change in such registrant\u2019s classification, it shall not reopen the registrant\u2019s classification. In such a case, the local board, by letter, shall advise the person filing the request that the information submitted does not warrant the reopening of the registrant\u2019s classification and shall place a copy of the letter in the registrant\u2019s file. * * <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">At the time appellant filed SSS Form 150 (Special Form for Conscientious Objectors), he had not been ordered inducted but had only been physically examined. Therefore, under the regulations (see \u00a7 1625.4, supra), <em>if, </em>in the board\u2019s opinion, his filled-in form 150 contained information in addition to that considered when appellant was classified 1-A and/or \u201cnew facts\u201d, which presented a prima facie case for a conscientious objector classification, the local board should have reopened the record for the determination of whether appellant was entitled to the change requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">It does not appear that the board followed the regulations set out above. Instead, with the conscientious objector form for reclassification before it, the board decided that the petition came too late. The board\u2019s statement, which we have heretofore quoted is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">\u201cBoard decided that inasmuch as Albert Stain, on the basis of his Questionnaire, was given a physical examination and found acceptable without protest, his record cannot be reopened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We transpose the board\u2019s statement in order more readily to understand it, to-wit:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">\u201cInasmuch as appellant was given a physical examination in accordance with his classification as shown by his questionnaire and he was found acceptable and he made no protest then about it, his record cannot be reopened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">It is certain that this board order, denying appellant\u2019s petition for reclassification, was not based at all upon the information in the integrated questionnaire as it stood immediately after the SSS Form 150 had been filed. (It is plainly printed upon SSS Form 150 that when it is filed, it becomes a part of the registrant\u2019s questionnaire.) Here, the conscientious objector SSS Form 150 was filed after the event which the board seemingly found to constitute a cut-off date precluding reopening. As we have seen (regulation \u00a7 1625.2, supra), the real cut-off event (with an exception not here pertinent) is the <em>mailing of the order for induction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>It therefore appears that the denial of the petition to reopen and reclassify was made independently of, and without consideration of, the petition\u2019s contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The board did not even obey the directive contained in Regulation \u00a7 1625.4,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> supra, as to notice to appellant of its ruling, though we are not clear that prejudice resulted from this oversight, since there is no administrative appeal from a denial of reopening.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, with prompt notice, appellant could have protested the ruling with at least a chance that the board would have seen and corrected its procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We hold that the procedure followed by the board, in arriving at its ruling denying the petition to reopen and reclassify, was illegal and deprived appellant of due process of law, and that he was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We are not holding that the board could, or could not, have determined from the evidence that there was a basis-in-fact for the denial. See United States v. Ransom, 7 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 15. That question was one the board should have answered but it did not. Had it considered the question, it would have had to apply Regulations \u00a7\u00a7 1625.1(b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 1641.-I,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 1641.2(b).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Since due process of law has not been accorded to appellant by the board, to his substantial prejudice, the board\u2019s order is void and appellant\u2019s refusal to be inducted under it was not a criminal or illegal act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"atd-dedup-1\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-10\">.

La Charity v. Commanding Officer, 1944, 2 Cir., 142 F.2d 381, <em>882, </em>dealing <em>with </em>a similar situation under World War II regulations and pointing out that if a denial of reopening was subject to an administrative appeal a registrant could postpone his induction indefinitely. Olvera v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 880, contains erroneous dicta that there is an administrative appeal from a denial of reopening. The regulations do not support that holding. There is an appeal only if there has been a reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">In our case, the fact that there is no appeal affects the case in another manner. The Government cites this court\u2019s opinion in Williams v.
