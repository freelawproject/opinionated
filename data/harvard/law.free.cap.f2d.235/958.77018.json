It is conceded by Ackerman that the issue of such pervasive and unfavorable publicity was not submitted to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, Commonwealth v. Ackerman, 176 Pa.Super. 80,106 A.2d 886. See Rule 28. It is further conceded that that issue was not even referred to in the petition for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Careful consideration has been given to the arguments raised by appellant under II and IV of his brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-25\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
