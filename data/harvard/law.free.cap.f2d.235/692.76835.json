DeParcq, petitioner herein, was a lawyer duly admitted to practice by the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota, maintaining offices for the practice of his profession in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, and respondent United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa is the federal court having jurisdiction in the Southern District of Iowa as provided by United States statute. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-23\">On or about the 22nd day of November, 1952, one Clifford J. Dean suffered injuries which he asserted were due to negligence on the part of the Chicago Great Western Railway Company and he desired to bring suit against that company on account of the personal injuries suffered by him. He made inquiries, especially among railway employees, with reference to employing a competent lawyer to represent him in the matter of his claim for damages. The employees of whom he made inquiry recommended William H. DeParcq as a successful lawyer in personal injury actions. A companion of Dean offered to secure an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>appointment with Mr. DeParcq. Dean was not solicited by or on behalf of De-Parcq but at the telephone request of one of Dean\u2019s fellow workmen Mr. De-Parcq conferred with Dean at his office at Minneapolis and entered into a written contract to represent Dean in the matter of his claim against the Chicago Great Western Railway Company for a contingent fee of one-third of the recovery. The contract was in writing but does not appear in the record and the testimony with reference to it is lacking in detail, Mr. DeParcq caused an investigation to be made concerning the facts. He did not bring action on Dean\u2019s claim but forwarded the claim and cause of action to J. Riley McManus, a lawyer duly admitted to practice in the state and federal courts of the State of Iowa, maintaining offices in the City of Des Moines, Iowa, who conducted some legal research and prepared a brief or memorandum of law with respect to the authorities and on the basis of his legal research decided that Dean has a good and meritorious cause of action, and thereafter McManus prepared, without any participation on the part of DeParcq, a complaint and caused same to be filed and suit to be instituted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. DeParcq did not sign the complaint and it was not submitted to him but as a matter of professional courtesy McManus placed the name of DeParcq upon the complaint in typewriting as \u201cOf Counsel . DeParcq neither requested his name to appear as \u201cOf Counsel\u201d nor had he any knowledge thereof until long after the complaint had been prepared and filed and suit had been instituted; he was never served with any responsive pleadings or other papers in the cause and had no further connection with the litigation which was conducted solely and exclusively by McManus; he never appeared in the action or conferred with Dean except on the 24th day of September, 1953, and never conducted any settlement negotiations nor took any depositions nor any steps whatsoever with reference to the prosecution of the claim, but he entrusted the handling of the action to McManus and at no time ever intended to try the cause or otherwise appear and participate in the trial or proceedings and never made any request, either written or oral or otherwise, for comity or for leave and permission to participate in the action,</p>\n<p id=\"ay8-dedup-0\">Mr. DeParcq was not a member of the bar 0f the United States District Court f0r the Southern District of Iowa, nor was pe a member of the bar of the State 0f Iowa and, in fact, was ineligible to become a member of the bar of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa because by Rule 1 of that court it is provided that \u201cAttorneys who are regularly admitted and licensed to practice before \u25a0 the Supreme Court of j0wa may be admitted to practice in the District upon motion, in open court, of arty admitted attorney of the court, after satisfactory showing of good moral character 0f the applicant, and upon taking the oath, signing the roll of attorneys in the clerk\u2019s office, and paying the clerk a fee 0f two dollars. * * * \u201d There js no provision in the rules of the United states District Court for the Southern District of Iowa by which a lawyer not duly admitted to practice by the Supreme Court of Iowa may be admitted to the bar 0f the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Rule 3 of the rules of that court, however, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqk-dedup-1\">\u201cAdmission to Try Particular Case,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2I\">\u201cAll attorneys residing outside of the gtate of Iowa and having civil matters in the court shall associate with them a resident attorney on whom notice may be served and who shall have the authority to act for and on behalf of the client in all matters, including pretrial conferences and the trial of the case. Such resident attorney shall be a member of the bar of the District, shall sign the first pleading filed and continue in the matter unless other qualified resident counsel be substituted. Nonresident attorneys who have so associated with them a resident attorney shall be permitted to participate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>in a particular case upon satisfactory showing of good moral character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-5\">\u201cProvided further that where the action is one to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in Iowa by one who at the time was a resident of Iowa or the action is one to recover damages for the death of a resident of Iowa resulting from personal injuries sustained in Iowa, the court may on its own motion, or on motion of a member of the bar of either District, before permitting a nonresident attorney to participate in the case, require a satisfactory showing that the connection of the said attorney, or the firm or attorney with which he is associated, was not occasioned or brought about in violation of the standards of conduct specified in Rule 8 hereof. The court as a part of said showing may require the plaintiff and the said attorney to appear and be examined under oath.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Purporting to act pursuant to the authority vested in respondent court by this Rule 3 the court issued an order reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-7\">\u201cClifford J. Dean, Plaintiff, v. Chicago, Great Western Railway Company, Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-12\">\u201cOrder for Hearing on Application Under Rule 3 of the Rules of the United States District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-13\">\u201cIt is hereby ordered that the 13th day of January, 1956, at 2:00 o\u2019clock p. m. is hereby fixed as the time, and the Federal Court House at Des Moines, Iowa, is fixed as the place for the making of showings of non-resident attorneys under Rule 3, as amended, of the Local Rules for the United States District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa in cases pending in the Central Division of the Southern District of Iowa.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-14\">\u201cIt is further ordered that resident and non-resident attorneys now appearing as attorneys for and of counsel for the plaintiff in the above entitled case and the plaintiff shall appear at the time and place fixed above for the purpose of being examined under oath in regard to matters within the scope of said Rule 3, as amended, and that mailing to plaintiff\u2019s counsel now of record for plaintiff shall constitute notice to appear at the time and place stated above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-15\">\u201cIt is further ordered that any examinations shall be conducted either by the United States Attorney for this District, or by one of his Assistants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-16\">In response to this court order plaintiff Clifford J. Dean and his attorney, J. Riley McManus, appeared and were subjected to examination by the Assistant United States District Attorney, particularly with reference to the employment of DeParcq as plaintiff\u2019s attorney and his possible participation in the trial of the action. DeParcq was not served personally or otherwise within the Southern District of Iowa and did not personally appear in response to the foregoing order. The court expressed the view that: \u201cHe participates by being of counsel and signing the complaint, and I consider him, accordingly, a participant in the case, and I consider that his wilful failure and his refusal \u2014 in anticipation of what you say \u2014 not to appear here makes him in contempt of this Court.\u201d Mr. Mc-Manus then testified that: \u201cHis name was put on the complaint of counsel by me. He never signed the complaint. He never intended to come down here and take part in the trial of the case if the case was tried. I put his name there as a matter of courtesy to him as he had referred and sent the case down here to me. He sent the case down here to me because he said that he felt if he brought it up there it would be transferred down here anyhow, so he sent the case down <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>here for me to bring it arid for me to try it. He has never been down here on it; has nev\u00e9r had anything to do with the preparation of briefs or the complaint or any of the pleadings. He has had nothing to do with the case since he forwarded it to me on October 10th, 1953.\u201d The court, over the protest of Mr. McManus, announced that it would inquire into the relations between counsel appearing, plaintiff Dean and Mr. DeParcq, and requested the Assistant United States District Attorney to conduct the investigation. Subsequent to this hearing and under date of January 24,1956, the court on its own motion entered its findings and order to show cause as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201cClifford J. Dean, Plaintiff, v. Chicago, Great Western Railway Company, Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">\u201cOrder to Show Cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-10\">\u201cThe order of this court entered January 6, 1956, served upon plaintiff herein and his counsel of record, required them to appear before this court at Des Moines, Iowa, on January 13, 1956, at 2:00 o\u2019clock p, m., to submit to examination under oath as to matters. within the scope of Rule 3, as amended, of the Local Rules of the United States District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa, which provides as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-11\">(In the interest of brevity Rule 3 is not here reprinted.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-12\">\u201cAt the time and place stated, plaintiff appeared in person, as did James R. McManus and Alexis M. Hawkins, both of Des Moines, Iowa, who are counsel of record for plaintiff, but William H. DeParcq of Minneapolis, Minnesota, also counsel of record, failed to appear although duly notified. Mr. McManus stated to the court that it was the intention of said Mr. DeParcq riot to appear for the hearing'.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-13\">\u201cThe court finds from, the-testimony of plaintiff and James R. Mc-Manus, who appears of record as one of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, that William H. DeParcq is-, the only counsel in this action directly employed by plaintiff, and said William H. De-Parcq in turn has employed James R. McManus to be associated with him as local counsel as permitted and required by Rule 3, above, and that William H. DeParcq occupies the position of forwarding attorney in respect of James R. McManus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-14\">\u201cThe court, further finds that the said James R. McManus was and is employed by William H. DeParcq in his capacity as forwarding attorney and that there is no contract, express- or implied, between the plaintiff and James R. McManus or Alexis M. Hawkins, but that such employment, of said James R. McManus and Alexis M. Hawkins as exists in this cause is not by plaintiff but by William H. DeParcq.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-15\"><em>\u201cThe </em>court further finds that said William H. DeParcq has wilfully failed to appear before this court on the 13th day of January, 1956, pursuant to the order of this court entered January 6, 1956, and has disobeyed and shown disrespect for the order of this court and should show cause, if any he has, why he, William H. DeParcq, should not be held in contempt, and be denied the right to continue to appear in this-action as counsel for plaintiff, or otherwise to appear as attorney or counsel in any action or proceeding in the Southern District of Iowa, until he will have been purged of such contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-16\">\u201cIt is therefore ordered and adjudged that William H. DeParcq is hereby directed to show cause, if any he has, why he, William H. DeParcq, should not be held in contempt of this court, and be denied the- right further to appear or continue as attorney or counsel'in this action, and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>further denied the right or privilege to appear as counsel in any action or proceeding in the Southern District of Iowa now pending, or hereafter, until he will have been purged of contempt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">\u201cIt is further ordered that hearing herein is fixed at 10:00 o\u2019clock a. m., on the 2nd day of March, 1956. Said William H. DeParcq is granted until the 18th day of February, 1956, to tile answer hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">\u201cIt is further ordered that a copy of this order shall be sent by registered mail to William H. DeParcq at his address of record and by regular mail to plaintiff and to all other counsel of record as presently disclosed on the records of this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"arj-dedup-0\">In this state of the record petitioner initiated the present original proceeding in this court in the nature of an application for writ of prohibition. In response to his petition for permission to file petition for writ of prohibition this court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\u201cThe above entitled matter came before the undersigned Judges of the above named Court on the petition of William H. DeParcq for leave to file a petition for a Writ of Prohibition herein. The Court, and the undersigned judges thereof, having duly considered the matter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-7\">\u201cIt is ordered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">\u201c(1) That the petitioner be and he hereby is granted permission to file the petition for Writ of Prohibition attached hereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-9\">\u201c(2) That said petition be heard before the United States Court of Appeals at the United States Court House and Custom House Building in the City of St. Louis, State of Missouri, on the 2nd day of May, 1956, at ten o\u2019clock a. m., or as soon thereafter as the matter may be heard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-10\">\u201c(3) That all proceedings in the matters referred to in the said petition for Writ of Prohibition, and particularly the proceedings designated in the respondents\u2019 Order to Show Cause scheduled to be heard on March 2nd, 1956, and any and all other proceedings therein, are hereby stayed until the further order of this court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-13\">\u201c(4) Petitioner herein shall have 40 days within which to file a brief in support of the petition. The respondents shall have 40 days thereafter in which to file an answering brief. The petitioner shall then have 10 days in which to file a reply brief. Briefs may be in either typewritten or printed form, and three additional copies shall be furnished for the use of the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-14\">\u201c(5) Service of this order shall be made upon the respondents by registered or certified mail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">The matter was placed upon the regular calendar of this court and counsel for the respective parties filed briefs and presented oral arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-16\">The order entered by this court has not been assailed by motion or otherwise and there is no dispute as to the facts. The petition, which seems to embody a complete transcript of all the proceedings had and taken in the trial court, has not been controverted nor challenged by return, motion or otherwise, and all well-pleaded facts, as distinguished from conclusions of law, must be accepted by us as true. Matter of Indiana Transportation Co., 242 U.S. 281, 37 S.Ct. 126, 61 L.Ed. 301; State ex rel. Hall v. Burney, Mo.App., 84 S.W.2d 659; 73 C.J.S., Prohibition, \u00a7 29 (2), p. 108; 42 Am.Jur., Prohibition, Section 44, p. 179. The facts will be further developed in the course of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">The purported power of the trial court to discipline petitioner stems from Rule 3 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa. The trend of modern controlling authority is to limit the contempt power of federal courts. 28 U.S.C.A. Section 2072; Cammer v. U. S., 350 U.S. 399, 76 S.Ct. 456; In re Michael, 326 U.S. 224, 66 S.Ct. 78, 90 L.Ed. 30; Nye v. U. S., 313 U.S. 33, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>61 S.Ct. 810, 85 L.Ed. 1172. The case of Cammer v. U. S., supra, was decided by the Supreme Court after the orders were issued and hearings held in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">It is contended that because petitioner\u2019s name was typewritten upon the complaint as being of counsel in the case of Clifford J. Dean v. Chicago Great Western Railway Company he \u201cparticipated\u201d in the case and having so done, for contempt purposes, he was an officer of the court and subject to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. In Cammer v. U. S., supra [350 U. S. 399, 76 S.Ct. 459], in the course of the opinion it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cThere are strong reasons why attorneys should not be considered \u2018officers\u2019under \u00a7 401(2). As we pointed out in the Nye case, the 1831 Act was promptly passed by the Congress after the impeachment proceedings against Judge Peck failed by a senatorial vote of 22 to 21. Judge Peck had sent a lawyer to jail and had taken away his right to practice as punishment for an alleged contempt. The contempt consisted of published criticism of Judge Peek\u2019s opinion in a case in which the convicted lawyer had appeared as counsel; he was also counsel in other pending cases involving similar issues. Those directing the impeachment proceedings, who later brought about the passage of the 1831 Act, expressed deep concern lest lawyers continue to be subjected to summary trials by judges without the safeguards of juries and regular court procedure. Congressman James Buchanan who made the last argument against Judge Peck stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201c \u2018But what is the process in the case of contempts? Without either an information or an indictment, but merely on a simple rule to show cause, drawn up in any form the judge may think proper, a man is put upon his trial for an infamous offence, involving in its punishment the loss both of liberty and property. He is deprived both of petit jury and grand jury, and is tried by an angry adversary prepared to sacrifice him and his rights on the altar of his own vengeance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201c T may be wrong, but I hold it to be the imperative duty of an attorney to protect the interests of his client out of court as well as in court.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-11\">Again Mr. Buchanan said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">\u201c T believe that I have as good a right to the exercise of my profession, as the mechanic has to follow his trade, or the merchant to engage in the pursuits of commerce. * * The public have almost as deep an interest in the independence of the bar as of the bench.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">\u201cSuch statements by the same man who reported the 1831 Act to the House of Representatives almost immediately after Judge Peck\u2019s acquittal are completely inconsistent with a purpose to treat lawyers as \u2018 \u201cofficers\u201d of the court\u2019 subject to summary punishment. We cannot hold that lawyers are subject to the precise kind of summary contempt power that the Act was designedly drawn to bar judges from exercising. Section 2 of that Act made ample provision for punishing corrupt efforts to influence, intimidate or impede juries. And Congress expressly provided that prosecution therefor be by indictment. Substantially the same provision has been a part of our law ever since. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1503, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503. See also Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 7(a). Of course it does not cover this case because there is no charge that petitioner attempted improperly to influence the jury or violate \u00a7 1503 in any other way. Had there been such a charge petitioner would have been entitled to a trial by jury after indictment by grand jury. We hold that a lawyer is not the kind of \u2018of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>fleer\u2019 who can be summarily tried for contempt under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(2), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In the case of In re Michael, supra [326 U.S. 224, 66 S.Ct. 79], the court specifically pointed out that the 1831 Act \u201crepresented a deliberate Congressional purpose drastically to curtail the range of conduct which Courts could punish as contempt.\u201d And again, it is said the Act embodied a Congressional plan to limit the contempt power to \u201c \u2018the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u2019 \u201d With these admonitions in mind we turn to a consideration of the contentions urged by the respective parties in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Rule 3 is vigorously assailed as being arbitrary, discriminatory, unreasonable, destructive of the rule of comity and ex post facto. We, however, deem it unnecessary to pass upon the validity of this rule because it is not applicable to every non-resident attorney but only such as seek to participate in the trial of a particular case. If petitioner did not seek to participate in the trial of this case then the rule could not be invoked. We are of the view that petitioner did not seek to participate in the trial of this case. This view is compelled, we think, by the admitted facts, and in this connection it is to be observed that this rule is described in its title as \u201cAdmission to <em>Try </em>Particular Case.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) \u201cParticipate\u201d, as the word is used in this rule, obviously means to take part in the actual trial. Based on the conclusion that petitioner participated in the case within the meaning of this rule, the court held that he thereby became an \u201cofficer\u201d of the court. However, we are of the view that Mr. DeParcq was not, for disciplinary purposes, an officer of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Cammer v. U. S., supra. Indeed, he was not admitted to practice in that court and was ineligible for admission to practice because he had not been admitted to practice by the Supreme Court of Iowa. Again, as Mr. DeParcq was not an officer of the court and was not served with any process within the territorial jurisdiction of the court and had not voluntarily appeared, the court was without jurisdiction of his person. Rule 4(f), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.; In re Graves, D.C.N. D.Iowa, 29 F. 60; Mitchell v. Dexter, 1 Cir., 244 F. 926; Graber v. Graber, D. C., 93 F.Supp. 281; Andrews v. Andrews &amp; Andrews, E.D.N.Y., 42 F.Supp. 5. This is on the assumption that the alleged contempt was a civil contempt. It embodies the elements which seem to characterize it as civil contempt rather than criminal contempt. Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., 221 U.S. 418, 31 S. Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797. The teaching of the Gompers case is to the effect that: (1) Refusal to do an act commanded is civil contempt, while doing a forbidden act is criminal contempt; (2) Punishment for criminal contempt is unconditional, while the judgment for civil contempt is conditional in nature and can be terminated if the contemnor purges himself of the contempt; (3) Civil contempt proceedings are entitled as a part of the main cause, while criminal contempt actions are brought in the name of the United States; and (4) The notice in a criminal contempt proceeding must state that the proceeding is criminal in nature. But if it be contended that the proceeding is for criminal contempt it need only be suggested that in such a proceeding there can be no summary punishment and the contemnor is entitled to all the normal safeguards surrounding criminal prosecutions, including trial by jury, so that the court was without authority to proceed regardless of whether the proceeding be considered civil or criminal. In re Michael, supra; Cammer v. U. S., supra; Nilva v. United States, 8 Cir., 227 F.2d 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Although the order of this court permitting the filing of petitioner\u2019s application for writ of prohibition was never challenged by motion or otherwise, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the allegations of the petition stand admitted, it is now urged by the government that petitioner is not entitled to the remedy sought. We find it unnecessary to consider this contention in view of the present condition of the record. At the opening of the argument of this case counsel for petitioner announced that the case of Clifford J. Dean v. Chicago Great Western Railway Company had been duly settled by the parties thereto without the knowledge of petitioner or his counsel, and counsel for petitioner in substantiation of his statement produced a certified copy of the judgment of the District Court dismissing that action on its merits. Based on these facts it is argued that the present proceeding has become moot. If so, there would seem no longer to be any necessity for issuing writ of prohibition, and this drastic and extraordinary remedy should be. granted sparingly and only where there is necessity therefor. Johnson v. Manhattan Ry. Co., 289 U.S. 479, 53 S.Ct. 721, 77 L.Ed. 1331; Gladstein v. McLaughlin, 9 Cir., 230 F.2d 762. The contempt proceeding was a part of the action between Dean and the Chicago Great Western Railway Company and the termination of that action automatically renders the contempt proceeding moot. Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., supra; Leman v. Krentler-Arnold Co., 284 U.S. 448, 52 S.Ct. 238, 76 L.Ed. 389; United States v. United Mine Workers of America, 330 U.S. 258, 67 S.Ct. 677, 91 L.Ed. 884; People ex rel. Hess v. Finn, 176 Misc. 407, 27 N.Y.S.2d 80. In Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., supra [221 U.S. 418, 31 S.Ct. 502], it is said, \u201cThe present proceeding necessarily ended with the settlement of the main cause of which it is a part.\u201d It follows that the petition for writ of prohibition should be denied because not necessary as the contempt proceeding ended with the settlement of the case of Clifford J. Dean v. Chicago Great Western Railway Company.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
