Thereafter, on March 17, 1953, her body was found, an investigation was made, and appellant, Arthur Thomas, was arrested in Cochise County by Jack Howard, sheriff of that county. On March 18, 1953, the sheriff took appellant before a magistrate \u2014 L. T. Frazier, a justice of the peace in Cochise County\u2014 for preliminary examination; appellant waived such examination; the magistrate held appellant to answer to the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and for Cochise County and fixed his bail at $25,-000; and, appellant having failed to furnish bail, the magistrate committed him to the custody of the sheriff.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-24\">Thereafter, in the Superior Court, an information was filed charging appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>with the murder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant was arraigned, pleaded not guilty and had a jury trial. The trial began on June 1, 1953, and ended on June 19, 1953, when the jury returned a verdict finding appellant guilty of first-degree murder and fixing his punishment at death.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant moved for a new trial. The motion was denied on June 26,1952. Thereupon, on June 26,1953, the Superior Court rendered judgment on the verdict, sentenced appellant to death and issued a warrant directing the sheriff to deliver appellant to the superintendent of the State prison of Arizona for execution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sheriff did so deliver appellant on or before July 6, 1953. At all times thereafter, appellant was a prisoner in the superintendent\u2019s custody pursuant to the Superior Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">Appellant appealed from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment to the Supreme Court of the State of Arizona, hereafter called the Arizona Supreme Court. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s judgment on October 18, 1954.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant moved the Arizona Supreme Court for a rehearing. The Arizona Supreme Court denied that motion on November 16, 1954. On December 2, 1954, appellant filed in the Superior Court a\u2019second motion for a new trial,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Superior Court made an order denying that motion on December 18, 1954. Appellant appealed from that order to the Arizona Supreme Court. The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed that order on June 28, 1955.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant petitioned for certiorari to review both decisions of the Arizona Supreme Court \u2014 the decision affirming the Superior Court\u2019s judgment <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the decision affirming the Superior Court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s second motion for a new trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Certio-rari was denied on January 16, 1956.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-18\">Thereafter, in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, W. Edward Morgan, acting in behalf of appellant,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> filed two applications<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2014 one on March 1, 1956, and one on March 9, 1956 \u2014 each praying for a writ of habeas corpus directed to appellee, Frank Ey-man, who, on March 1, 1956, and at all times thereafter, was superintendent of the State prison of Arizona.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-19\">The District Court did not at any time grant appellant a writ of habeas corpus or issue an order directing appellee to show cause why such a writ should not be granted,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> nor did it hold a plenary hearing on the applications. However appellee\u2019s counsel appeared before the District Court and, on March 9, 1956, filed with the District Court a transcript<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> of all proceedings had and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>testimony taken in the Superior Court<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and copies of all briefs filed in the Arizona Supreme Court on appellant\u2019s appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment. Having considered the applications, the transcript, the briefs and the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming the Superior Court\u2019s judgment,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the District Court on March 13, 1956, entered an order denying the applications. From that order appellant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">Appellant contends that the District Court erred in denying the applications without granting a writ of habeas corpus or issuing an order to show cause and without a plenary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Appellant being a State prisoner, the District Court could not properly grant him a writ of habeas corpus unless it appeared that he was in custody in violation of the Constitution of the United States.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In determining whether appellant was entitled to a writ of habeas corpus, it was proper for the District Court to consider \u2014 as it did \u2014 the transcript of proceedings had and testimony taken at appellant\u2019s trial, the briefs filed on appellant\u2019s appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment and the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s decision affirming that judgment, as well as the applications.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">The first application \u2014 the one filed on March 1, 1956 \u2014 stated that \u201con the date of apprehension,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> [appellant] was roped and putitively [sic] lynched in the presence of Jack Howard, the then sheriff of [Cochise County]that \u201csubsequent to said roping, and while under fear and coercion, [appellant] made * * * confessions of commission of the crime<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and that \u201cone of said confessions, over the objection of counsel,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> was admitted! into evidence,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> * * * in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-20\">Liberally construed, these statements-may be taken to mean that an involuntary confession of appellant was admitted into evidence at his trial in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus the first application may be deemed to have raised a Federal constitutional issue, namely, whether the Fourteenth Amendment was so violated. No other Federal constitutional issue was raised in or by either of the applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-21\">The transcript showed the following facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-22\">The only \u201cconfession\u201d admitted into evidence at appellant\u2019s trial was an oral statement made by him on March 18, 1953, when he was taken before the magistrate (L. T. Frazier) for preliminary examination. That statement, hereafter called the confession, was admitted into evidence by the admission of the magistrate\u2019s testimony concerning it. That testimony was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b831-23\">\u201cHe [appellant] was there on the charge of murder. I read the complaint to him and told him that he had a right to a preliminary hearing in the justice-court,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> or he might waive that right and have his hearing in the Superior Court.. I told him he had the right to employ an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>attorney to assist him in preparing his case, and that he would be allowed a reasonable length of time for the preliminary hearing, and he said, \u2018I don\u2019t need any lawyer. I am guilty. I killed the woman.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Prior to the admission of the above quoted testimony, evidence was presented in the absence of the jury on the issue of the voluntariness of the confession, and, as a preliminary matter, the Superior Court held that it was voluntary.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thereafter evidence on the issue of voluntariness was presented to the jury, the above quoted testimony was admitted, and the issue of voluntariness was submitted to the jury with appropriate instructions.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">On his appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s judgment, appellant assigned as error the admission of the above quoted testimony, his contention <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> being that its admission violated the Fourteenth Amendment, (1) in that the confession shown by the testimony was a plea of guilty which he had entered when taken before the magistrate for preliminary examination and had withdrawn by pleading not guilty in the Superior Court; and (2) in that the confession was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">Rejecting appellant\u2019s contention, the Arizona Supreme Court held that the confession was not a plea of guilty, there being in Arizona no such thing as an arraignment or a plea of guilty or not guilty in a preliminary examination; that the above quoted testimony was properly admitted; and that the issue of the voluntariness of the confession was properly submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Thus the Arizona Supreme Court determined adversely to appellant the only Federal constitutional issue raised in the habeas corpus proceeding. The District Court accepted that determination as correct. Hence the District Court was not required to grant a writ of habeas corpus or to issue a show cause order or to hold a plenary hearing.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>POPE, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">I concur. What convinces me that the court below did not err in exercising its discretion to accept the State court\u2019s resolution of the fact issues involved is the admirable manner in which the State trial judge dealt with what the Arizona Supreme Court called the \u201cunsavory incidents\u201d which attended petitioner\u2019s apprehension and arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"Abg3\">It is apparent that the trial judge believed the testimony of a State Highway patrolman that the county sheriff not only stood by while petitioner and another prisoner in his custody were roped about the neck and dragged by mounted members of a mob, but that he even said to petitioner \u201cWill you tell the truth, or I will let them go ahead and do this,\u201d or \u201cI will go ahead and let them use this.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">By a ruling which, it must be conceded, was in accordance with the highest traditions of the bench, the trial judge held that the effects of this misconduct on the part of the sheriff were such that a confession taken from Thomas the following day by the county attorney, and a confession taken two days later at the county attorney\u2019s office, must both be rejected and excluded as coerced and involuntary. It was prior to the taking of either of these rejected confessions that Thomas was taken before the magistrate where he admitted his guilt. The argument is, that if Thomas were so terrorized by the officially condoned threats of lynching that his later confession in the county attorney\u2019s office could not be voluntary, then his statement to the magistrate, which followed even more closely the lynching threats, must likewise be taken to have been received when he was under the same psychological coercion, particularly in view of the fact that he was then without counsel, and only the same sheriff, and one of his deputies was present aside from the court officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">More precisely, the contention is that the federal court should have taken testimony and itself examined into this fact question, and in connection therewith have permitted the petitioner to give his testimony. For reasons which satisfied them counsel for petitioner did not put him on the stand at the preliminary inquiry, in the absence of the jury, into the circumstances of the confession. This failure to use his testimony is something of which petitioner cannot complain here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is complained that at the time of this preliminary ruling defense counsel did not know that the highway patrolman\u2019s chief had forbidden him to talk to them, and did not know that his testimony would show these \u201cunsavory incidents\u201d, and hence the trial judge was not informed of this when he admitted the magistrate\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ***But after the preliminary admission of this confession, the whole question as to whether it was voluntary was submitted to the jury by instructions as to which no fault is found, and the jury of course heard the patrolman\u2019s testimony, and its verdict resolved the question. Also, the trial judge later denied a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">I am not only unable to perceive any respect in which the State trial judge failed to afford petitioner due process in respect to a determination of the question of whether this confession was coerced. Those best able to judge of this question of fact, the judge and the jury, dealt with it in a manner which shows no vital flaw. With the demonstrated strict regard which the trial judge obviously had for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the protection of petitioner\u2019s constitutional rights, I see no reason why the court below should not accept his and the jury\u2019s determination.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-15\">.
