The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>trial commenced November 21,1955. Insanity was asserted as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Dr. Epstein of St. Elizabeths Hospital, who had examined and treated the defendant both before and after the crime, .testified regarding his mental condition. The District of Columbia Code, 1951, \u00a7 14-308, 29 Stat. 138, forbids physicians to disclose confidential information acquired in attending a patient in a professional capacity. But an amendment, effective August 9, 1955, makes this prohibition inapplicable in criminal trials when the accused raises the defense of insanity. 69 Stat. 612. We think the District Court was right in applying this amendment. Cf. Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 587-590, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262. We find no error affecting substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
