United States, 85 U.S. App.D.C. 395, 179 F.2d 456, 465, and Gatewood v. United States, 93 U.S.App. D.C. 226, 209 F.2d 789, such service was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The ground of the second claim is that there was no evidence connecting her with possession of the narcotics, and that there was evidence: that she was not at home at the time when, according to her husband\u2019s testimony, the package of narcotics was brought to the house; that she was not told that it was hidden in, and she did not know that it was in, the washing machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Of the first ground, it suffices, we think, to say that: the section invoked by defendant does not provide, the cases cited by defendant do not hold, and we have found none holding, that the use of excessive force in serving a search warrant, such as is claimed was used in this case, will invalidate a search and seizure made under it; and that, while the use of excessive, that is unnecessary, force is in any case to be deprecated, evidence obtained under a valid warrant is not thereby made inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The second point is no better taken. The evidence shows without contradiction that when the officers pulled out of the washing machine, where the defendant was standing, the sack containing the narcotics, she told the officers, \u201cThat isn\u2019t his, that\u2019s mine\u201d. It is significant, too, that it was she and not her husband who was the first to go to the washing machine, and that, as the officer walked over to the old washing machine, took the lid up, and started to reach in it, she started pulling the clothes out, and the officer said to her, \u201cJust hold it, I will reach into the washing machine and pull the clothes out.\u201d Upon this evidence and the other evidence in the case, including her own testimony that she claimed the narcotics to protect her husband, and that she was at the washing machine because her soiled clothes were in it and she didn\u2019t want the officer to see them, the question of her guilt was certainly a question for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b170-15\">. \u201cThe officer may break open any outer or inner door or window of a house, or any part of a house, or anything therein, to execute a search warrant, if, after notice of his authority and purpose, he is refused admittance or when necessary to liberate himself or a person aiding him in the execution of the warrant.\u201d Section 3109, Title 18 U.S.C.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b171-14\">RIVES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">(concurring specially).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">It seems to me that we do not reach the question of whether the use of excessive force in serving a search warrant will invalidate the search and seizure, because the testimony of the federal narcotic agent, which the district court had a right to believe, showed that there was no such excessive force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">I, therefore, concur specially.</p>\n<p id=\"Ap_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>'BROWN, Circuit J.udg\u00e9,,</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\">I'concur\u2018fully iir the result and all that is said under Ground Two. I join Judge RIVES as to the First Ground. '</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-7\">. \u201cA. That afternoon, or rather that morning, I and Agent Bromley had obtained a federal search warrant and about 2:15 p. m. the same day we went to 1322 San Carlos Street accompanied by Agents Hooper and Hazur, Hobson and Detective Lieutenant of the City Police Department Hutton, and Detective Sergeant Saenz went along to serve the federal search warrant. Detective Saenz and Agent Hooper and myself went to the rear door and made entry there where we served the search warrant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">\u201cQ. Who was present when you entered the room? A. Sergeant Saenz\u2014 oh, you mean the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">\u201cQ. In the home. A. In the home, in the kitchen the defendant Barrientes was sitting at the table; his wife I believe came into the room just as we came in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\u201cQ. Did you advise them who you were? A. Yes, that we were narcotic agents serving a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\u201cQ. Did you tell them what you wanted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-17\">\u201cMr. Tijerina: At this time, Your Honor, may I have the witness on voir dire, may it please the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-19\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-20\">\n<em>\u201cQuestions by Mr. Tijerina on Voir Dire:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-21\">\u201cQ. Agent Dean, who had the search warrant \u2014 did you have the search warrant? A. I had the search warrant in my pocket, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-22\">\u201cQ. And you went through the back door? A. Yes, sir, Sergeant Saenz went in first. I went in second.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-23\">\u201cQ. Sergeant Saenz broke the door or did you break the door? A. Sergeant Saenz knocked on the door and it fell open and he fell, I think, almost into the kitchen, and I came in right behind him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-24\">\u201cQ. And you say that broke the door down and it fell in? A. It didn\u2019t break the door down, sir; it just swung open. It was a very flimsy door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-26\">\u201cQ. And you did not ask; you just went into the house then? A. Yes, sir, went right into the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aj-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u201cQ. And that, is when you presented your search warrant? A. Yes, I think Sergeant Saenz told everybody to remain standing, that we had a search warrant, and Sergeant Saenz remained in the kitchen and I ran into- the bathroom into the toilet to make sure there was nobody in the toilet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-12\">\u201cQ. Before you knocked on the door did you call to anybody in the inside and identify yourself as a federal agent? A. Not before knocking, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-13\">\u201cQ. Did you call toward- the inside and tell. anybody or give notice to \u2022 anybody \u25a0that you were there with a federal search warrant? A. Nqt standing outside of the houses, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-14\">\u201cQ. Not until. y.ou were inside the house? A. It was inside of the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-28\">\u201cMr. Tijerina: May it please the Court, at this time the defendant is going to object to any testimony by this witness on -the ground that he was there illegally; he was there by virtue of a search warrant and I think that he is bound by the search warrant, and under the law it states that the door may be broken when admission is refused. The federal agent must first notify that he is there by virtue of the search warrant and if he is refused, the door then may be opened by the federal agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-30\">\u201cThe Court: That will be- overruled, counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-32\">\u201cMr. Tijerina: Note our exception to the. Court\u2019s ruling.\u201d . .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
