Lester, 9 Cir., 227 F.2d 708, 717, the district court, on motion of the plaintiffs, entered its decree for the purpose of carrying out our judgment as directed. Claiming that the decree thus entered is not in accordance with the opinion and mandate of this court, and also that it is beyond the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, the defendants have brought this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">We are of the opinion that the decree is in conformity with our decision and it is not subject to the objections now presented by Government counsel on behalf of the appellants. What our decision vindicated was the right of the plaintiffs to seek and obtain private employment in one of the common walks of life; that this was a right \u201centitled to constitutional protection\u201d, and to \u201cprotection at the hands of a court of equity.\u201d Holding that these plaintiffs \u201chave no adequate or any remedy at law\u201d; that the damages of which they complain through being deprived of employment as seamen upon merchant-vessels, are irreparable; that the \u201cPlaintiffs were able to show and did show that the defendants through the application of the alleged void and unconstitutional regulations had deprived them of employment and were threatening further to deprive them of future work as merchant seamen\u201d,' we found plaintiffs entitled to a declaration of those rights and directed that the court enter an injunction accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">The decree now entered is precisely to that effect. It enjoins the defendants from interfering with the employment of these plaintiffs, and from declining or refusing to take steps to advise shipping companies and unions that these seamen are entitled to employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">After plaintiffs had moved for the entry of a decree following the mandate, the Commandant promulgated some amended regulations, dated 'April 26 and effective\u2019May 1/ 1956,- and -defendants argued-, in \u00a1the court* below, as they\u2019do here, that these plaintiffs cannot be al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>lowed to work until they have been screened and found acceptable under the new regulations. The only difference between the plaintiffs and those they represent on the one hand, and all the seamen who are currently employed and working on the other, is that the former have been screened off, and denied employment, under the procedures which our decision found to be void and of no effect. For the defendants now to insist that plaintiffs remain in this status, thus improperly fastened upon them, emphasizes the need for the injunction now issued. Defendants are but trying to give effect to the old regulations by which they denied these men employment by thus undertaking to keep them suspended until defendants get around to hearings under the new regulations. The decree properly prohibits that. The court correctly held that wanting a hearing which measures up to due process, the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutionally protected right to work remains wholly unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The decree does not fail to give due place to the new regulations. It contains the proviso:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-6\">\u201cProvided, however, that the provisions of this decree shall be without prejudice to, and shall not effect or enjoin the taking of any action by respondents pursuant to regulations of the Coast Guard promulgated on April 25, 1956, and now in effect; provided further, however, that pending any valid hearing held pursuant to the said regulations or other regulations no merchant seaman shall be suspended from employment or have his employment or prospective employment interfered with, nor shall any Merchant Mariner\u2019s Document issued pursuant to the provisions of this decree be suspended or revoked prior to such hearing.\u201d This gives adequate deference to the new regulations. The question of their sufficiency to meet the requirements of due process does not arise upon this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">In addition to enjoining interferences with the employment of the plaintiffs, the decree directs the defendants to issue to these seamen documents showing they may be employed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This, say appellants, grants relief in the nature, of mandamus which is beyond the jurisdiction of the district court. Furthermore, they say, this calls for a validation of documents for emergency service which only the Commandant may grant, and that such relief cannot be ordered in the absence of the Commandant as an indispensable party defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">The court here has done no more than to follow the recognized power of courts of equity in issuing injunctions, to make those injunctions effective by ancillary provisions, in aid of the injunction, which may require the defendant to do something.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus in American School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110, 23 S.Ct. 33, 39, 47 L.Ed. 90, the injunction ordered was one \u201cto prohibit the further withholding of the mail from complainants\u201d. Here the court has issued its injunction to prohibit the further withholding of completed documents from the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The case, after all, was one instituted and still pending in the court below, which in issuing the injunction, had the inherent power possessed by any court of equity to make that injunction effective, and to prevent the frustration thereof. Observing, as it did, that an endorsement on the seaman\u2019s documents would be essential to protection of their right to work, and knowing, as is conceded, that the stamping of the documents for emergency service is done at San Francisco, and by these defendants, the court properly added this safeguard.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Williams v. Fanning, 332 U.S. 490, 494, 68 S.Ct. 188, 92 L.Ed. 95, the court upheld the right of the plaintiffs to a decree that the local postmaster desist from refusing to pay money orders and to desist from refusing to deliver their mail to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was a recognition of the power of the court to require payment of the money orders and the forwarding of the mail.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">The rationale supporting the power of a court of equity to frame its injunctive decrees in such manner as to prevent their frustration is also the foundation for the rule that in cases of the kind now before us the courts have power to protect individual rights against unlawful and unauthorized administrative power. The power and duty to protect such rights is fundamental; it springs from the very \u201cexistence of courts\u201d, Stark v. Wickard, 321 U.S. 288, 308, 64 S. Ct. 559, 570, 88 L.Ed. 733,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that is particularly true, where the right, as here, is a constitutional one.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It is unthinkable that the court below was without power fully and effectively to protect the rights which our decision said belonged to these plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-15\">HEALY, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. \u201cIt Is Further Ordered, Adjudged And Decreed that the respondents, or their successors, and all persons acting for and on their behalf, are hereby directed forthwith to issue to each petitioner and to all merchant seamen who are members of the class represented herein by petitioners, a Merchant Mariner\u2019s Document bearing a special validation endorsement for emergency service, or its equivalent, by whatever name or title it may be called, indicating, showing and establishing that such merchant seaman may be employed on, any merchant vessel of the United States; the said document may, in the discretion of the respondents, contain in addition to the words \u2018validated\u2019 or \u2018validated for emergency service\u2019, the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">\u201c \u2018issued pursuant to decree of United States District Court for the Northern District of California, July 12, 1956, and to be given the same effect as all similar documents issued without such order.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b843-13\">. This traditional power of equity, in an injunction action, to issue an ancillary order requiring affirmative action, is discussed at some length in Vaughan v. John C. Winston Co., 10 Cir., 83 F.2d 370, 374, and in Bowles v. Skaggs, 6 Cir., 151 F.2d 817, 829. The Supreme. Court has impliedly approved the latter case by reversing a decision in conflict with it. This was in Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, at page 399, 66 S.Ct. 1086, at page 1090, 90 L.Ed. 1332, where the court said: \u201cBut where, as here, the equitable jurisdiction of the court has properly been invoked for injunctive purposes, the court has the power to decide all relevant matters in dispute and to award complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>relief even though the decree includes that which might be conferred by a court of law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. Appellants misconstrue the decree\u2019s direction for endorsement on the Mariner\u2019s Document. It requires no certification that the seaman has been cleared after hearing. It means no more than that it shall be stated that the seaman may work pursuant to decree of the court. The stamping of such documents has always been done by the local Coast Guard officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. 332 U.S. at page 494, 68 S.Ot. at page 189: \u201cIt is he who refuses to pay money orders, who places the stamp \u2018fraudulent\u2019 on the mail, who returns the mail to the senders. If he desists in those acts, the matter is at an end. That is all the relief which petitioners seek.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">. As pointed out in Vaughan v. John C. Winston Co., supra, there is no difference in substance between a double negative and a positive. \u201cDesist from refusing to pay money orders\u201d in substance means \u201cpay money orders\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b844-16\">. \u201cBut under Article III [Constitution] Congress established courts to adjudicate eases and controversies as to claims of infringement of individual rights whether by unlawful action of private persons or by the exertion of unauthorized administrative power.\u201d 321 U.S. at page 310, 64 S.Ot. at page 571.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b844-18\">. \u201cThere is a constitutional right to a judicial hearing on some issues, whetlier by <em>habeas corpus </em>or by some other method of review. If there were not, then the liberties of a citizen could be made dependent on the whim or caprice of the executive branch.\u201d William O. Douglas, \u201cWe, The Judges\u201d, (1956), p. 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-20\">\u201cIt is familiar doctrine that the extent to which a court of equity may grant or withhold its aid, and the manner of mould-ing its remedies, may be affected by the public interest involved.\u201d United States v. Morgan, 307 U.S. 183, 194, 59 S.Ct. 795, 801, 83 L.Ed. 1211. Cf. Bell v.
