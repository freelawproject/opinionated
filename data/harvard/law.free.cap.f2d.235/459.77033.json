We do agree with it, however; that, in the circumstances of this case, the mandate having already gone down, it was not necessary that either the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals notify the district court of the denial of certiorari; that, within sixty days after notice of denial of the writ had been given to those provided for in the rule, petitioner had the right to apply and that it was incumbent upon him to make his application for the reduction within that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">The slightest reflection upon the purpose and intent of the rule<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to extend the time within which a sentence may be reduced by providing three sixty day periods after the judgment has become final in the trial court: (1) after the sentence is imposed; (2) after receipt by the district court of the mandate of the Court of Appeals; and (3) within sixty days after an order denying an application for writ of certiorari; shows, we think, that appellant\u2019s claim is without substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">In a case where the applicant for cer-tiorari obtains a stay of the mandate, the mandate will, of course, go down after receipt from the Supreme Court of the order denying the writ and the two sixty day periods provided for, one after receipt of mandate, the other after the denial of a writ of certiorari, while not precisely, will be substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">In this case, however, because the mandate was not stayed, the two sixty day periods will be separate and distinct, one beginning upon receipt of the mandate, the other upon receipt of notice to the defendant of the order denying the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-13\">Petitioner\u2019s claim is without merit. The order was right, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-9\">. \u201cThe above - named defendant on Feb. 5, 1956, applied \u25a0 to me, under Rule 35, - Rules of Oritninal Procedure [18 U.S. O.A.], for an order to reduce his sentence and contends that his application for reduction of his sentence comes \u2018within 60 days after receipt of an order of \u25a0 the Supreme Court denying an application for a writ of certiorari\u2019.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">\u201cIt appears from the evidence presented by the defendant that the petition for., writ of certiorari was docketed as No. 247, Misc., Oct. Term, 1953; ' that a certified, copy of the order denying cer-tiorari in this case [347 U.S. 938, 74 S. Ct. 632, 98 L.Ed. 1087], was issued to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on April 7, 1954, and was received by the Clerk of the Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit on April 9, 1954; a copy of the order of the Supreme Court denying certiorari was never .filed nor received by the Clerk of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida at Miami, Florida; I did not know that the defendant had applied for a writ of certiorari, or that the Supreme Court had denied the petition for a writ of certiorari until Feb. 15,' 1956. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-d\">\u201cThe defendant contends that I have 60 days\u2019 after the filing of the order denying the petition for certiorari with the Clerk of the United States-Distriet Court. for the Southern District of Florida, or within sixty days after the date I received notice of the order denying the petition for writ of certiorari within which\u2019 to reduce his sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-23\">\u201cI do not believe such to have been the intention of Rule 35 and for this reason I hereby deny defendant\u2019s motion to reduce his sentence, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-24\">\u201cIt Is So Ordered.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-25\">. The court erred in holding that the time for reducing sentence as a matter of grace under the provisions of Rule 35, Federal Rules of-Criminal Procedure, had expired as of Feb. 5, 1956.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b515-14\">. \u201cBuie 35.

The court may reduce a sentence within 60 days after the sentence is imposed, or within 60 days after receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within 60 days after receipt of an order of the Supremo Court denying an application for a writ of certiorari.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
