Date when Tax Court decision becomes final \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Arn\">\u201cThe Decision of the Tax Court shall become final \u2014 (a) Petition for review not filed on time. Upon the expiration of' the time allowed f\u00b0r filing a. petition for review, if no such petition has .been duly filed within such time\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZq\"> Clearly here the conditions precedent to the Court of Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to review Tax Court action is the filing of the petition within three months of the Tax .Court\u2019s first decision which was entered on April 8, 1954. No such petition, was .filed. Some four months after the decision, on August 23, 1954, the petitioners moved the Tax Court to vacate the decision of April 8, 1954, on the ground of'excusable neglect,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a power formerly in the federal' courts\u2019 equity jurisdiction, cf. Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 1937, 300 U.S. 131, 57 S.Ct. 382, 81 L.Ed. 557, and now contained in Rule 60(b),, F.R.C.P., 28 U.S.C., which \u2019by Rule 1 is confined to the United States District Courts and not applicable to executive agencies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9p\">Though not a court at all but merely an administrative agency it assumed power of a district court ^ and in December, 1954, it granted^ petitioners motions to vacate its decision of April 1954, and for the taking of additional evidence. After additional evidence was taken, the Tax Court rendered a second decision reaching the same result as \u201c *he first\\ The petition for review of the second decision was filed ^el wlthf free months of the date ^ was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"aur-dedup-0\">In Swall v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 9 Cir., 122 F.2d 324 certiorari denied 1941, 314 U.S. 697, 62 S.Ct. 414, 86 L.Ed. 557 this Court held that a de- \u201d adm\u201clsfatlveA age1^ becomes finaI tbree montbs after it was entered and that thereafter the Tax Court has no power to modify it or reconsider it. The decision was based on the precedent statutes applicable to the agency when it was called the Board of Tax Appeals identical with those cited supra by the Commissioner as the basis 0f motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"A79\">Our decision in the Swall case was preceded by similar decisions of the First Circuit, Sweet v. Commissioner, 120 F.2d 77, succeeded by a second decision, Denholm &amp; McKay Co. v. Commissioner, 132 F.2d 243; the Second Circuit in Monjar v. Commissioner, 140 F.2d 263, and the Third Circuit in White\u2019s Will v. Commissioner, 142 F.2d 746.</p>\n<p id=\"A_L\">. Our' Swall case and these cases are based on our construction of the word \u201cfinal\u201d iii the \u00a7 1140 .cited supra as the Supreme Court in Helvering v. Northern Coal Co., 1934, 293 U.S. 191, 55 S.Ct. 3, 79 L.Ed. 281, construed the word \u201cfinal\u201d as used with reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>that court\u2019s decisions in the Revenue Act of 1926. There the Supreme Court had rendered its judgment affirming several judgments of the Board of Tax Appeals and issued its mandates. During the term of the court motions for petitions for rehearing were filed which in ordinary efses the court had the jurisdiction to entertain. It held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoL\">\u201cSection 1005(a)- (4) of the Revenue Act of 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 110, 111, U.S.C., tit. 26, \u00a7 1228(a) (4) (26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1228(a) (4), with respect to decisions of the Board of Tax Appeals, provides: \u201c \u2018Sec. 1005. (a) The decision of the board shall become final\u2014 * * <em>\u00bb</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u2018(4) Upon the expiration of thirty days from the date of issuance of the mandate of the Supreme Court, if such court directs that the decision of the board be affirmed or the petition for review dismissed.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201cIn view of the authoritative and explicit requirement of the statute and of its application to these cases, the petitions for rehearing are severally denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Some nine years later the Supreme Court again held that the finality provided in the legislation gave it no jurisdiction to afford relief thereafter. R. Simpson &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, 321 U.S. 225, 228 et seq., 64 S.Ct. 496, 88 L.Ed. 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Obviously if the Supreme Court lacks the power to reconsider because the decision of the Board has become \u201cfinal\u201d, a fortiori such an agency as the Tax Court likewise lacks the power by the words of Section 1140 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201cThe decision of the Tax Court shall become final * * * upon the expiration of the time allowed for filing a petition for review, if no such petition has been duly filed within such time\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">Counsel for the Laskys, ignoring the Congressional definition of it as an executive agency, contend that the Tax Court is \u201clike other <em>courts\u201d </em>and hence as a <em>court </em>has the <em>\u201cinherent </em>power to control, amend, open and vacate its decisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">Extraordinary as it is that counsel, without mention of the statutory definition, seeks to have us act as if it did not exist, we find that the Sixth Circuit, in Reo Motors v. Commissioner, 219 F.2d 610, 612, similarly ignores the statut\u00e9 and, without mentioning it, treats the Tax Court not as a mere executive agency but as having the inherent power of a United States Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">In that case the Tax Court, more than three months after its final decision, ordered it set aside on the ground of mutual mistake of fact of both the parties in presenting the case to the agency. The Sixth Circuit holds of this executive agency that it has the jurisdiction so to act since \u201cas a practical matter, it is a court exercising <em>inherently </em>judicial functions and having the necessary judicial powers to carry out such functions.\u201d It treats the agency as having the powers of a court to grant a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-16\">That court relies on the case of Goldsmith v. United States Board of Tax Appeals, 1925, 270 U.S. 117, 46 S.Ct. 215, 217, 70 L.Ed. 494. There the sole question was whether the Board of Tax Appeals had the power to make rules governing the right to practice before it. The Supreme Court held the agency had this power because of its \u201cquasi judicial\u201d character, quoting the words of the statute that \u201c \u2018The board shall be an independent agency in the executive branch of the government.\u2019 \u201d Nothing in that opinion remotely suggests that the agency is a court having the inherent power to issue writs coram nobis. Its quasi judicial powers of making rules, summoning witnesses, etc., are no more than are given other executive agencies such as the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-17\">Further, the Sixth Circuit opinion fails to mention the Supreme Court de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>cisi\u00f3n in Helvering v. Northern Coal Co., supra, nine years after the Goldsmith decision was rendered. <em>Nor </em>does it consider our decision in the Swall case or the four other Circuit Court decisions cited above. That is to say, it ignores both the governing statute and the precedent opinions on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Both the Sixth Circuit and counsel here cite the case of La Floridienne J. Buttgenbach &amp; Co. v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 1933, 63 F.2d 630, where the court held <em>solely </em>that <em>on the stipulation of the parties </em>the Board of Tax Appeals could set aside its final order more than three months after its rendition. Here there is no such stipulation. More important still, the Buttgenbach case was decided in 1933, the year before the Supreme Court rendered its Northern Coal Co. decision in 1934, determining that where the statutes make final the action of the taxing agency, no jurisdiction exists after such finality to set the decision aside. The Buttgenbach case was specifically criticized in our opinion in the Swall case, supra. Though parties may stipulate to the jurisdiction of the <em>person, </em>they may not do so as to the <em>subject matter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Finally the Laskys stress the decision of the Supreme Court in Wayne United Gas Co. v. Owens-Illinois Glass Co., 1937, 300 U.S. 131, 57 S.Ct. 382, 81 L. Ed. 557. In effect, they claim this case overrules the Northern Coal decision of 1934, though it does not mention it. In that case the matter in question was the power not of a mere executive agency but of the bankruptcy court to vacate its own order dismissing a petition for reorganization under 77B of the bankruptcy act, after the time for appeal had expired and after the term of the court had ended. The district court held it had such power. The Court of Appeals held it had not and reversed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding the District Court sitting in bankruptcy, had no term and that it could exercise its equitable powers as a bankruptcy <em>court </em>to set aside its decision after the time for appeal had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Here was no overruling of the Northern Coal case for the bankruptcy laws made no such provision for finality of the court\u2019s decisions considered in that case, nor is there any such Congressional intent regarding the bankruptcy court as was expressed concerning the Tax Court agency by the Senate Committee Report on the identical predecessor section 1005 of the Revenue Act of 1926 now section 1140, which report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201cDate on which decision becomes final. \u2014 Section 1005 prescribes the date on which a decision of the Board (whether or not review thereof is had) is to become final. Inasmuch as the statute of limitations upon assessments and suits for collection, both of which are suspended during review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination, commences to run upon the day upon which the Board\u2019s decision becomes final, it is of utmost importance that this time be specified as accurately as possible. In some instances in order to achieve this result the usual rules of law applicable in court procedure must be changed. For example, the power of the court of review to recall its mandate is made to expire 30 days from the date of issuance of the mandate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">And as a final answer to the contention that the Wayne United Gas Co. case overruled the Northern Coal case, is the decision affirming the Northern Coal case in Simpson Co. case, decided seven years after the Wayne United Gas case.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">We hold the Tax Court was without jurisdiction to set aside its first decision and that this court has no jurisdiction to consider a petition for review of its second decision. The petition for review is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b151-15\">. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1100 [now 26 U.S.O. \u00a7 7441], reading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">\u201c\u00a7 7441.
