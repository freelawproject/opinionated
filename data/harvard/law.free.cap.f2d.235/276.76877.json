The Polaroid Highlander Camera was invented by the president of Polaroid, Dr. Edwin H. Land. Polaroid owns product patents on the camera and certain of the component parts, but has no patent covering any process or operation involved in making the camera.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Greist fabricates the camera pursuant to a contract purporting to be a sales agreement under which Greist agreed to sell and deliver to Polaroid, at a fixed price per delivered camera, 100,000 cameras to be produced by Greist in accordance with approved specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Greist worked out all production techniques and independently of Polaroid established the unit price of the cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">All manufacturing operations involved in the production of the cameras are performed by Greist or its subcontractors. All materials and parts are purchased or produced by Greist. All labor and supervisory personnel are supplied by Greist. Polaroid advances no money or credit. The cameras are delivered by Greist in a finished and packaged condition. Polaroid furnishes only printed matter to be inserted in the package.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">Greist has complete control of all manufacturing methods and production, subject only to Polaroid\u2019s right to make tests to determine whether the cameras meet specified standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">All standard production tools are owned by Greist. Specialized tools are designed by Greist and purchased or fabricated at its own expense, but the contract provides that Polaroid shall purchase these tools over a period of time from Greist at cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-19\">Greist maintains a supply of finished cameras from which shipments are made pursuant to Polaroid\u2019s instructions either to Polaroid in Cambridge or directly to Polaroid\u2019s consignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-20\">The Polaroid trademark is affixed to the camera by Greist. Title to all cameras remains in Greist until they are segregated following Polaroid\u2019s approval of the six sample cameras taken from each day\u2019s production. Greist guarantees the camera and component parts against defects.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">The contract contains an escalator clause providing for changes in the unit price of the camera to reflect changes of <em>10$ </em>or more in Greist\u2019s manufacturing costs resulting from general changes in base wage rates or the competitive market price of materials.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-22\">In his opinion the trial judge said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-23\">\u201c * * * Polaroid not only agrees to buy Greist\u2019s entire output, but it dictates the amount of that output. If Polaroid\u2019s orders do not use up Greist\u2019s capacity, Greist is not free to sell elsewhere. If various costs go up, the risk is Polaroid\u2019s. If Greist manages to cut them, the gain is Polaroid\u2019s. The specialized tools are Polaroid\u2019s. The product patents, without which Greist could not operate, are retained by Polaroid, except for an implied license, for Polaroid\u2019s own benefit. Polaroid may terminate without cause, and Greist can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>never make another camera. In many important ways, therefore, Polaroid retains the dominant hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFvp\">\u201cThe patents seem to me of particular significance. If Greist were the ordinary uncontrolled manufacturer it would have to pay royalties to Polaroid, which, in turn, would be re-fleeted in the sales price upon which the tax would be computed. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel made it plain in his opening that it was his contention, and would be Greist\u2019s, for whose tax, if any, the contract made Polaroid responsible, that the tax- should be Greist\u2019s on the basis of Greist\u2019s cash price to Polaroid. This disregards the fact that Polaroid was supplying a necessary and valuable component of any sale, a license under the patents. This absence of royalties is an abnormal situation. I think Polaroid is trying to eat its cake and have it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">The trial judge went on to say:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c* * * Obviously there is bound to be a difficult border line as to when, in the concept of this act, one is a manufacturer or only a buyer. The case at bar may be close. It is my opinion, however, that the balance favors the government. * \u00ab\u25a0 *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We agree that Polaroid is the manufacturer of the camera within the meaning of the statute for the reasons just quoted; \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">We believe further that, the sale, so-called, of the cameras by Greist to Polaroid does not represent a \u201cfirst sale\u201d of the product under the rule of Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 1931, 283 U.S. 570, 574, 51 S.Ct. 601, 602, 75 L.Ed. 1277 where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">\u201c * * * It is not laid on all \u2022sales, but only on first or initial sales \u2014those by the manufacturer, producer or- importer. Subsequent sales, as where purchasers at first sales resell, are not taxed. Counsel for the government base their contention on the requirement that the tax be paid by \u2018the manufacturer, producer or importer\u2019; but we think this requirement is intended to be no \u25a0more than a comprehensive and convenient mode of reaching all first or initial sales * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Even assuming that the relationship between the parties was that of buyer and seller rather than principal and agent, the \u201csale\u201d of these cameras transferred to Polaroid only the bare right to possession of the physical materials. Greist did not transfer to Polaroid the right to use these cameras or the right to resell them, since it could convey no more than it had of the various incidents of ownership. It is true, of course, that Polaroid could use or resell the cameras but this was made possible only by rights previously vested in Polaroid and <em>not by virtue of any property rights conveyed to it by Greist.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">We believe that a \u201csale\u201d which conveys no right to use or resell the product, but only a bare right to possession, is not a sale within the meaning of \u00a7 3406 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b332-16\">WOODBURY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXL\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-17\">This is indeed a close case. Nevertheless the fact remains that Polaroid fabricated no part of the completed cameras, nor is there any basis for saying that the cameras were made by Greist either as Polaroid\u2019s agent, or as Polaroid\u2019s alter ego. Greist did not manufacture only Polaroid\u2019s cameras but in addition manufactured a variety of mechanical \u201cprecision assemblies,\u201d principally for sewing machines, for other purchasers. Neither were the cameras fabricated by Greist from any parts or materials furnished by Polaroid to which it retained title which would bring this case within the provisions of subsection (b) of Treasury Regulations 46 (1940) \u00a7 316.4 which in its \u25a0entirety reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-18\">\u201cWho is a manufacturer \u2014 (a) The term \u2018manufacturer\u2019 includes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>person who produces a taxable- article from scrap, salvage, or junk material, as well as from new or raw material, (1) by processing, manipulating, or changing the form of an article, or (2) by combining or assembling two or more articles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201c(b) Under certain circumstances, as where a person manufactures or produces a taxable article for a person who furnishes materials and retains title thereto, the person for whom the taxable article is manufactured or produced, and not the person who actually manufactures or produces it, will be considered the manufacturer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Polaroid and Greist are wholly separate and distinct entities who struck an arm\u2019s length bargain whereby Greist as an independent contractor \u201cmanufactured\u201d the cameras in the sense of making them, fabricating them, putting them together, with its own employees out of its own materials, and parts it purchased from third parties, and then sold them for an agreed price to Polaroid. The fact that because of Polaroid\u2019s patents Greist had and legally could have only one customer for the cameras and the fact that the cameras were made according to Polaroid\u2019s specifications and subject to its inspection seem to me beside the point. Certainly if Greist in violation of the patent law and its contract with Polaroid sold a camera or cameras to some one other than Polaroid it Would be liable for the tax on those cameras.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">It seems to me that in ordinary language Greist was the manufacturer and Polaroid a purchaser who sold the cameras at wholesale. Thus to impose the tax on Polaroid is to base the tax not on the manufacturer\u2019s sale price in accordance with the statute but on the wholesaler\u2019s sale price, which naturally is greater since it includes, presumably, in addition to the cost of the goods to the wholesaler (the price for which the manufacturer sold them) the wholesaler\u2019s mark-up for handling costs, selling, overhead and profit. I would reverse.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
