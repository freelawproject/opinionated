His principal contention is that the trial court erred in refusing to grant an instruction prayed by him. We do not reach the question whether the requested instruction was sound as a matter of law, because we think the facts shown by the evidence did not require or justify such an instruction. Other alleged errors in the instructions were not noted in the trial court. We find no error affecting substantial rights of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
