Tramaglino, the decision in which, adverse to Tramaglino, was affirmed by us, 2 Cir., 234 F.2d 489. At the hearing Tramaglino offered Infanzon\u2019s testimony as alleged evidence of government agent Olivera\u2019s bad character and lack of credibility and of his persecution of Tramaglino. Infanzon\u2019s testimony was therefore quite material to the inquiry; and the jury, on the basis of ample evidence, found it false.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-17\"> Judge Bicks did not abuse his discretion in the circumstances of this case in allowing the government to keep one witness-assistant, Olivera, at counsel\u2019s table during the trial. Nor did he err in admitting into evidence copies of photographs of defendant taken with certain other persons which had been seized by police in Puerto Rico. The judge in effect found on the basis of sufficient evidence that the photographs were not the property of defendant, but rather of Norma Infanz\u00f3n, who did not become his wife until after the time of the seizure, and that the premises from which they were seized did not belong to defendant. Hence we need not consider the several other grounds urged by the government for admitting this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-18\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
