S. Roberts, deceased, under whom appellant claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">These leases covered three buildings, T-208, T-209, and T-243, and ran for five years, one for a nominal money rental and two for $25.00 per month, and each contained clauses providing for forfeiture and cessation thereof in case of violation of covenants and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">The sole question for decision here is whether, under the undisputed evidence, the finding and order of the district judge that, on April 30, 1951, the time of the taking, Roberts had lost the leases, was correct, and appellant\u2019s claim should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-23\">As appellant sees the trial of the issue below and its outcome, the evidence, relied on by the district judge, and his conclusion from it, was that since Roberts, in order to make the buildings available to the government, voluntarily moved off the land without being forcibly evicted, in response to an offer of the corporation to pay six months\u2019 rental for him in the new quarters to which he moved, he abandoned his leases and his right to compensation for their value.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-24\">As appellee sees it, there was undisputed evidence that the leases were validly terminated in accordance with their provisions by letter of April 11, 1950, notifying Roberts of the company\u2019s election to end them, because of violation of their terms, and giving him notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>vacate immediately, which not only supported, but required the findings and judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In addition, appellees insist that there is ample evidence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in support of the view of the trial court that Roberts, accepting the arrangements made with him by Camp Wolters as a complete settlement of his affairs with it, and recognizing that he had no title or claim to the leases, elected to abandon them. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Though, because of Roberts\u2019 death, the evidence is somewhat skimpy and sketchy, we think it clear that, taken as a whole, it supports the conclusion of the district judge and his judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-5\">. Dennis testified without contradiction: that, after the giving of the notice in Dec., 1950, Roberts remained on the. property; that in 1951 his company secured for Roberts a lease on property in Mineral Wells and paid for the moving of all of Roberts\u2019 equipment, machinery, etc., and also paid the first six months\u2019 rental; that he did this because he left \u201cRoberts had no lease out there and that he was having to move, and it actually was just an act of kindness\u201d ; and that, apparently, Roberts was without funds to acquire another place to move.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
