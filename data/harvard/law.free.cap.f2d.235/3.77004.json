By its counterclaim, accompanying the answer to that complaint, Eskimo Pie Corporation asserted its house mark and trademark \u201cEskimo,\u201d and sought a permanent injunction against Eskimo Kooler Corporation. After taking parol and documentary evidence, the district court found the use of the name \u201cEskimo\u201d by Eskimo Kooler Corporation constituted \u201ctrademark infringement or, in any event, unfair competition and should be enjoined\u201d further concluding, as a matter of law: \u201cThe counter-defendant\u2019s (Eskimo Kooler Corporation) use of the business name Eskimo Kooler Corporation in the business of manufacturing and/or selling said cabinets is also wrongful, particularly in view of the circumstances of the selection and adoption of such name, and should be enjoined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">From the judgment order granting a permanent injunction against it, Eskimo Kooler Corporation has appealed. It should be noticed that the initial complaint filed by Eskimo Kooler Corporation was dismissed below for non-prosecution and the ease proceeded solely upon the counterclaim and answer thereto, hence Eskimo Pie Corporation was put in the position of plaintiff and Eskimo Kooler Corporation became a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Our application of Rule 52(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C. (1952 ed.) leaves undisturbed the findings of fact and conclusions of law made by the district judge. Esquire, Inc., v. Varga Enterprises, 7 Cir., 1950, 185 F.2d 14, 20. According to these findings of fact, Eskimo Pie Corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling \u201cEskimo Pie\u201d and other \u201cEskimo\u201d frozen food products, including an \u201cEskimo Kooler.\u201d That Eskimo Pie Corporation owns numerous and various U. S. Trade Mark Registrations using the word \u201cEskimo,\u201d is uncontested. Long before Eskimo Kooler Corporation began its business, Eskimo Pie Corporation\u2019s products were sold from refrigerated cabinets bearing the name \u201cEskimo\u201d or \u201cEskimo Pie\u201d and these names had been widely used on trucks, billboards, and other advertising media owned or supplied by Eskimo Pie Corporation or its franchisees. Nicholas C. Geovan, one organizer of Eskimo Kooler Corporation had been president of the Drexel Ice Cream Company of Chicago, Illinois, and during the period 1928 to 1945 that Company held a franchise from Eskimo Pie Corporation. Consequently the trial judge found that Geovan knew all about Eskimo Pie Corporation\u2019s method of doing business and was well aware of its Eskimo name and trademarks. We notice that the district court particularly found that Eskimo Kooler Corporation \u201c * * * offered no explanation of its deliberate adoption of this name, which incorporated not only the word Eskimo which was * * * [Eskimo Pie Corporation\u2019s] primary trade-mark and the dominant part of its business name, but also the word Kooler spelled with a K, the same as in * * * [Eskimo Pie Corporation\u2019s] specific mark Eskimo Kooler.\u201d The facts found culminated in holding that the practices and acts of Eskimo Kooler Corporation involved likelihood of confusion and misleading of the public. We would add this statement [from the record] made by counsel for Eskimo Kooler Corporation during the trial below : \u201c * * * for the sake of the record, and to shorten this matter, I, our side, will admit that \u2018Eskimo Pie\u2019 has enormous advertising and they are known throughout the United States. In fact, it is common knowledge * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Despite Eskimo Kooler Corporation\u2019s contrary assertion, this case involving Federal trade-mark registrations and unfair competition, is controlled by Federal Law. Bulova Watch Co. v. Stolzberg, D.C.Mass.1947, 69 F.Supp. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Under Judge Lindley\u2019s opinion, r\u00e9ported as California Fruit Growers Exchange v. Windsor Beverages, Ltd., 7 Cir., 1941, 118 F.2d 149, Eskimo Pie Corporation has the right to protect its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>business name and trade-mark \u201cEskimo and for this reason Eskimo Kooler Corporation\u2019s argument about the non-exclusiveness of the word \u201cEskimo\u201d receives a cool reception.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-3\">After canvassing this record, we are fully satisfied that the findings concerning confusion are amply supported. Independent Nail &amp; Packing Co., Inc., v. Stronghold Screw Products, Inc., 7 Cir., 1953, 205 F.2d 921. Eskimo Kooler Corporation having started an action, was caught in the inevitable and unenviable dilemma of a counterclaim for the very claims they had first levied against Eskimo Pie Corporation. Unable to retreat, Eskimo Kooler Corporation unsuccessfully sought to resist the action against them. Upon exposure to the facts found below, we find Eskimo Kooler Corporation\u2019s multiple points melt away even in the climate of judicial opinions it relies upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
