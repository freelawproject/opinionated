The civil remedy provided by the False Claims Act must be liberally construed\u201d, is here stressing \u201cthe need for a functional interpretation of the statute\u201d and citing in support United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 63 S.Ct. 379, 87 L.Ed. 443. While not making its meaning completely clear, it seems to be urging upon us: that Section 231 must be viewed, not as ordinary penalty statutes are viewed, as confined in scope and operation to and by the language used, but as a sort of catch all statute announcing and containing a general declaration of principle against fraud and overreaching; that proof that the person proceeded against under it had done any specific thing denounced as an offense is not required, but only proof that the defendant has acted badly toward the United States; and that, under such proof, he must, and may be, subjected, to the penalties the statute provides, not for having violated its terms but for transgressing its spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Chafing at the uniform construction of the statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the United States in effect insists that the statute in fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>in law applies here where neither money nor property was claimed from or against the United States. It does this on the theory that the defendant, in applying to the banks for credit on an F. H. A. loan form, <em>made a, claim upon the government for the extension of its credit in support of the loans applied for, the government was cheated, and this was in effect a false claim upon which the United States was fraudulently induced to part with money or property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">It goes without saying that the acts of the defendant were criminal and that he was correctly prosecuted and convicted under the applicable statute, Section 1010, Title 18 U.S.C. for making false statements in connection with procuring the loan from the bank. It is quite another thing, however, to say that, because he was so guilty, he was subject to the penalties provided in Section 231. Section 1010 does not so provide. It specifically denounces as an offense the making \u201cfor the purpose of obtaining any loan or advance of credit from any * * * or corporation with the intent that such loan or advance of credit shall, be offered to or accepted by the Federal Housing Administration for insurance * * * any statement, knowing the same to be false,\u201d and under this statute, which plainly dealt with and plainly denounced his actions as an offense, defendant was correctly prosecuted and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">What the government is in effect doing here is reading into Section 231, the language of Section 1010, or, putting it differently, reading Section 231 as though it contained the same or similar language to Section 1010, whereas, as plainly appears in note 1, supra, nowhere in it is there any language having such purport or effect. Every word and line of this statute breathes the purpose to deal, it has the effect of dealing, only with the acts of persons falsely claiming money or property in the circumstances and with the effect dealt with in the statute. The statute does not deal with or denounce fraud in general. It cannot be read as doing so. In the Marcus case, on which the government so strongly relies, the court thus correctly states the rule controlling here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">\u201cSound rules of statutory interpretation exist to discover and not to direct the Congressional will. True, \u00a7 5438 is criminal and for that reason in interpreting so much of its language as it shares in common with Sec. 3490 <em>we must give it careful scrutiny lest those be brought within its reach who are not clearly included; </em>but after such scrutiny we must give it the fair meaning of its intendment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Since writing the foregoing, our attention has been called by the United States to an opinion of the Third Circuit, Judge Biggs dissenting, in U. S. v. Tieger, 234 F.2d 589, 592. In it, Judge Hastie, speaking for the court, in an opinion dealing concisely, clearly, and correctly, we think, with the precise question here involved, reached the same conclusion that we have reached, that \u201cThe district court correctly concluded that the statute deals only with false claims upon the government for money or property and that no such claim is revealed % # S</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">The judgment appealed from was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\">.

Tieger, 234 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>F.2d 589, both seem to me to construe too narrowly the False Claims Act. That Act, I think, should be given \u201cthe fair meaning of its intendment\u201d, which is \u201cto provide protection against those who would \u2018cheat the United States.\u2019 \u201d United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U.S. 537, 542, 544, 63 S.Ct. 379, 383, 87 L.Ed. 443. It provides a civil remedial action for liquidated damages instead of a penalty. United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, supra, 317 U.S. at pages 548 et seq., 63 S.Ct. at page 386 et seq. Cf. Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U.S. 148, 152, et seq., 76 S.Ct. 219; United States v.

When, as here, however, the fraud is discovered after the Government has approved the loan for insurance, but before default, the Government should not be forced to wait until the borrower defaults on the loan and causes the lender to make a further claim on the Government. Two separate claims may be involved, the first for the approval of the loan for insurance, the second for the payment of the insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Chief Judge Biggs dissenting in United States v.
