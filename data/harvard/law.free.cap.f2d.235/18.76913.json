The complaint sought a judgment that the term \u201ccapital necessarily employed in the business,\u201d contained in General Order 31 issued under \u00a7 607(d) of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, as amended, must be used by appellees rather than the definition of that term contained in General Order 71, as amended, in computing the net amount of the subsidy inuring to appellant under its operating-differential subsidy contract with the United States for the period January 1, 1947 to September 30, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-21\">The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed for lack of jurisdiction upon the ground, among others, that Congress had given appellant \u201ca clear remedy\u201d in the Court of Claims which \u201cunquestionably has the right to consider and determine the validity of the action of the Board, * * *<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since we agree, it is un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>necessary for us to consider the other grounds relied upon by the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-13\">. D.C.1955, 133 F.Supp. 100, 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-14\">. Appellant contends that its Court of Claims remedy is inadequate because that court cannot relieve it of the obligation to maintain an unnecessarily high special reserve fund under \u00a7 607(c) of the Act, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1177(c). Diminution of the fund is required by the statute to have the approval of the Board. In the face of a judgment by the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Claims determining that the definition in General Order 71 is invalid, the Board would be arbitrary in the extreme to withhold approval of a withdrawal from the fund solely on the basis of the definition. Wo agree with Judge Morris that, if tbe Court of Claims should uphold appellant\u2019s view of the definition, appellant \u201cwould receive the complete relief it seeks, even as to those funds which it is required to deposit in the special reserve fund.\u201d Id. at page 103.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
