A federal estate tax of $129,-386.99 was paid. On April 13, 1953, a District of Columbia estate tax of $11,-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>514.58 was paid, being 80% of the gross basic federal estate tax, that is to say, $11,841 less an inheritance tax of $326.-42 theretofore paid to the District.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">On August 15, 1953, the Technical Changes Act of 1953, 67 Stat. 615, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts became effective. It provided, so far as pertinent here, that an irrevocable trust created by a decedent prior to 1931 under which the grantor retained the life income was not in-cludable in decedent\u2019s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. This resulted in there being no federal estate tax due; consequently, there would be no District of Columbia estate tax due as the District estate tax was dependent on the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">On September 3, 1953, shortly after the effective date of the Technical Changes Act, petitioner filed a claim for refund of the entire amount of the federal estate tax paid on February 9, 1953; but it was not until August 5, 1955, that petitioner filed a claim with the Assessor of the District of Columbia for refund of the District estate tax paid April 13, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">The Assessor, on August 17,1955, notified petitioner that the claim for refund was denied; whereupon, petitioner appealed to the Tax Court from such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The respondent, District of Columbia, filed in the Tax Court a motion to dismiss the petition on the ground that that court was without jurisdiction because it was not shown that the claim for refund was seasonably filed. On this motion the Tax Court entered an order dismissing the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction. The Tax Court held that the language of \u00a7 47-2413, D.C.Code, 1951 Edition, Supplement III (quoted in the margin) :<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c* * * is plain. As far as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">pertinent here it provides (a) that no refund shall be allowed unless a claim is filed within two years from the date of payment of the tax; (b) that the amount of refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim; and (c) that this Court has jurisdiction only in the event that the claim for refund is seasonably filed. Here it will be seen that the claim for. refund was not filed within two years of payment of the tax. The Court, therefore, has no jurisdiction to decide anything. If it had jurisdiction, it would not hesitate to hold that the Assessor was correct in denying the claim, since he had no authority to do otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">With this we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-12\">Petitioner cites in this court, as it did before the Tax Court, Forsberg\u2019s Estate v. District of Columbia, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 90, 220 F.2d 197. But there the claim was filed within the time specified in \u00a7 47-2413.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">It follows that the decision of the Tax Court must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"Aio\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">. \u201c\u00a7 47-2413.
