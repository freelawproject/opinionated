Melendez first contends that the district court\u2019s 16-level enhancement of his offense level based on his prior drug trafficking conviction violated his constitutional rights in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). As the enhancement was based on a prior conviction, there is no Sixth Amendment error; rather, any error was in the application of the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, which we have termed <em>\u201cFanfan\u201d </em>error. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005) (discussing the distinction between the two types of error addressed in <em>Booker). </em>When <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error is preserved in the district court, this court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error was harmless.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). As there is no indication in the record that the district court would have imposed the same sentence under an advisory rather than mandatory Guidelines scheme, the Government cannot carry its burden of demonstrating harmless error, a point that the Government effectively concedes. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376-77 (5th Cir.2005),</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">Cortez next argues that the felony and aggravated felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional because they treat prior convictions as sentencing factors rather than offense elements. Cortez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Cortez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Cortez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Cortez\u2019s conviction, but we VACATE his sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-17\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
