We deny the petition in part and dismiss in part for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 as amended by the REAL ID Act, which applies retroactively to this case. REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (2005); <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>410 F.3d 585, 587 (9th Cir.2005). We have no jurisdiction to review \u201cany final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense,\u201d including an aggravated felony and conviction relating to a controlled substance. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B). Nor do we have jurisdiction over any \u201cdecision or action of the Attorney General ... the authority for which is specified ... to be in [his] discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). However, we are not barred from hearing constitutional claims or questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We review constitutional and legal claims de novo. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 523 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-19\">Whether a criminal drug conviction is an aggravated felony or a conviction relating to a controlled substance is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>question of law that we have jurisdiction to review. <em>See Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905, 909 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">A crime punishable as a federal drug trafficking crime is an aggravated felony. <em>See id. </em>at 918. Where a state conviction is at issue, we must decide whether the full range of conduct prohibited by the state statute is also punishable under the federal law. <em>See United States v. Baron-Medina, </em>187 F.3d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1999). Under the federal Controlled Substances Act it is a felony \u201cto ... possess <em>with intent to </em>... <em>distribute[] or dispense[] </em>a controlled substance.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (emphasis added). Petitioner was convicted twice of violating California Health and Safety Code Section 11378, which provides that \u201cevery person who possesses for sale any controlled substance ... shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.\u201d Cal. Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11378. A conviction for \u201cunlawful possession of a controlled substance for sale requires proof the defendant possessed the contraband <em>with the intent </em>of selling it....\u201d <em>People v. Harris, </em>83 Cal.App.4th 371, 374, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 618 (Ct. App.2000) (emphasis added). Since intent to sell is an element of the state crime, all convictions under Section 11378 would be punishable under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and are aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Whether an alien is barred from withholding of removal for having committed a \u201cparticularly serious crime,\u201d and whether an aggravated felony where a sentence of less than five years was imposed is \u201cparticularly serious\u201d are decisions placed in the Attorney General\u2019s discretion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B); <em>see Matsuk v. INS, </em>247 F.3d 999, 1002 (9th Cir.2001). Consequently, we have no jurisdiction to review these conclusions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">However, we may review Petitioner\u2019s claim that the IJ impermissibly applied a new legal standard retroactively in making discretionary decisions. There was no error. Although the Attorney General established the precedent that drug trafficking crimes are presumptively \u201cparticularly serious crimes\u201d after Santos Militante had entered her guilty pleas, see <em>In re Y-L-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 270, 274, 2002 WL 358818 (2002), the particularly serious crime bar to withholding of removal, and the Attorney General\u2019s discretion to designate crimes as \u201cparticularly serious,\u201d existed when Petitioner plead guilty. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B) (1998). In addition, a presumption that her aggravated felony was a particularly serious crime would have attached at that time. <em>See In re QT-M-T-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 639, 639, 654, 1996 WL 784581 (1996). The Attorney General\u2019s opinion was not an abrupt departure from existing law and has not attached a new consequence to her guilty plea. In addition, the Attorney General\u2019s explicit statutory discretion to designate crimes as \u201cparticularly serious\u201d weighs in favor of applying those designations retroactively.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., Inc. v. FTC, </em>691 F.2d 1322, 1333 (9th Cir.1982) (identifying factors that must be considered when deciding whether an agency adjudication applies retroactively); <em>Ruangswang v. INS, </em>591 F.2d 39, 44 (9th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number> We have jurisdiction to hear Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel and international law claims, since they are legal and constitutional. Even though Petitioner\u2019s counsel did not contest her aggravated felony grounds of removability, nothing in the record indicates that the \u201cproceeding was so fundamentally unfair that [she] was prevented from reasonably presenting [her] case.\u201d <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, 282 </em>F.3d 1218, 1226 (9th Cir.2002). Further, Petitioner did not suffer any prejudice since her crimes were, in fact, aggravated felonies. <em>See Ortiz v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). Petitioner fails to point to any international law provision that has been transgressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision that she committed a particularly serious crime is DISMISSED; otherwise, her petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-6\">. Petitioner also claims that the Attorney General exceeded his statutory authority in issuing the <em>In re Y-L- </em>decision. We reject the argument. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(B) gives the Attorney General the discretion to decide whether a crime is a particularly serious crime. <em>See Spencer Entr., Inc. v. United </em>States, 345 F.3d 683, 689-90 (9th Cir.2003). The Attorney General had the authority to issue the opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(h)(1)(i) (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
