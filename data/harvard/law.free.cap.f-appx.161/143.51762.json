Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 (1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a decision substantially affirming the decision of the IJ, the decision of the IJ is a proper subject of review. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(A)(7)(iii) (2002) (recodified at 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(iii) (2004)); <em>see also Yu Sheng Zhang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 57 (2d Cir.2004) (upholding the summary affirmance procedure employed by the BIA). This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">After reviewing the record, we are persuaded that the inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony constitute substantial evidence supporting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 77. The petitioners\u2019 inconsistent statements related to matters that were central to his claim, and, accordingly, the IJ properly rested her decision on this ground. <em>Id. </em>at 74. Because the petitioner identifies no \u201creliable, specific objective supporting evidence\u201d that he has faced past persecution, of will face persecution upon his return to China, there is no basis for disturbing the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner failed to meet his burden for establishing eligibility for asylum. <em>Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 178. Chen\u2019s claim for withholding of removal\u2014which involves a heavier burden of proof <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 71\u2014must fail for the same reasons. <em>Id. </em>Finally, the IJ correctly concluded that the petitioner was ineligible for CAT relief because he offered no evidence that he would more likely than not be tortured if he were to return to China. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143 (2d Cir.2003) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16). Therefore, we deny petitioner\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of deportation is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
