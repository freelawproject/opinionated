Of the many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>causes of action brought by Baum, the only ones relevant to this appeal are (1) retaliation, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621-634, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101-12213, for filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), (2) retaliation, in violation of the First Amendment, for engaging in protected speech on July 22, 2002, and (3) an equal protection \u201cclass of one\u201d violation. These claims center around Rockland\u2019s insistence that Baum submit to a medical examination, pursuant to New York Civil Service Law \u00a7 72, to assess fitness for duty (\u201cthe \u00a7 72 exam\u201d). The parties cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in Rockland\u2019s favor on all these claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court also denied Baum\u2019s motion to amend her complaint to add a due process claim. Baum appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">To establish a prima facie case of retaliation under the ADEA or the ADA, a plaintiff must show (1) that she engaged in protected activity, (2) that the employer was aware of the activity, (3) that she was subject to an adverse employment action, and (4) that a causal connection existed between the protected activity and the adverse action. <em>Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons &amp; Ives, Inc., </em>183 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.1999). It is not disputed that the first two of these conditions are satisfied. And with respect to the causal connection, the record contains ample evidence on the basis of which a reasonable jury could con-elude that Rockland forced Baum to submit to the \u00a7 72 exam in retaliation for her bringing an EEOC charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">But Baum\u2019s retaliation claim fails, because the \u00a7 72 exam did not constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of the ADEA and ADA. In the context of ADEA and ADA retaliation claims, we have described an adverse employment action as \u201ca materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Richardson v. N.Y. State Dep\u2019t of Correctional Serv., </em>180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir. 1999)) (internal quotation mark omitted). On the facts of this case, the district court was correct to hold, as a matter of law, that the \u00a7 72 exam did not constitute an adverse employment action, as we have defined that phrase in the context of ADEA and ADA retaliation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">To survive summary judgment on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must be able to show (1) that her speech addressed a matter of public concern, (2) that she suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that a causal connection existed between the speech and the adverse employment action, in that the speech was a motivating factor for the action. <em>Mandell v. County of Suffolk, </em>316 F.3d 368, 382 (2d Cir.2003). In the First Amendment context \u2014 unlike the ADEA and ADA retaliation context \u2014 \u2019\u201cretaliatory conduct that would deter a similarly situated individual of ordinary firmness from exercising his or her constitutional rights\u201d can qualify as adverse employment action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Washington v. County of Rockland, </em>373 F.3d 310, 320 (2d Cir.2004). But assuming <em>arguendo </em>(a) that the \u00a7 72 exam constitutes an adverse employment action for First Amendment purposes, and (b) that the speech at issue\u2014Baum\u2019s July 22, 2002 remarks in President Voss\u2019s office\u2014addressed a matter of public concern, Baum\u2019s First Amendment retaliation claim must, nevertheless, fail. This is because she presents no evidence whatsoever to support her allegation that the exam was imposed to retaliate for this isolated incident of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Baum\u2019s equal protection \u201cclass of one\u201d claim also fails. For such a claim to meet with success, \u201cthe level of similarity between plaintiffs and the persons with whom they compare themselves must be extremely high\u201d: in fact, the plaintiff and her comparators must be \u201cprima facie identical.\u201d <em>Neilson v. D\u2019Angelis, </em>409 F.3d 100, 104, 105 (2d Cir.2005). Because Baum has not identified any similarly situated persons, her claim cannot proceed. We also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Baum leave to add, out of time, a due process claim to her complaint. Parties must show good cause to amend a pleading after the court\u2019s deadline has passed, <em>Parker v. Columbia Pictures Indus., </em>204 F.3d 326, 340 (2d Cir.2000), and Baum has given no good reason why this additional claim could not have been brought earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">We have considered all of Baum\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Each party will bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b92-6\">. The district court ruled in favor of Baum on related breach of contract claims that she brought against Rockland. Rockland has not appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-11\">. In affirming the district court, we need not consider whether there might be other circumstances in other cases in which a \u00a7 72 exam could constitute an adverse employment action for purposes of ADEA and ADA retaliation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
