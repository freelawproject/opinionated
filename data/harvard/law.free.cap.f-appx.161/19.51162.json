R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34\u00ae. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b47-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s dismissal order, filed June 29, 2004, be affirmed. The Federal Tort Claims Act expressly bars appellants\u2019 claims, to the extent that they arise from the \u201closs, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matters.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680(b); <em>see Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). To the extent appellants claim they were the victims of intentional discrimination, the district court properly adjudged that, pursuant to the screening provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b), they have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Cf. Baker v. U.S. Parole Commission, </em>916 F.2d 725, 726 (D.C.Cir.1990) <em>(per </em>curiam). Appellants have not stated a claim for discrimination in violation of Title VII or the Fourteenth Amendment. They failed to allege facts indicating that they were members of a protected class, <em>see McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), or that the alleged actions were undertaken on a discriminatory basis or were motivated by discriminatory intent or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>purpose. <em>Cf. Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose required to show violation of Equal Protection Clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
