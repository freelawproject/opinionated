We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-17\">Bradshaw argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence in the 2004 matter was invalid in light of <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We review for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To show plain error, Bradshaw must show that his substantial rights were affected by demonstrating that there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had it sentenced under an advisory Guidelines regime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Bradshaw has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>made that showing here. The district court did not impose the lowest sentence it could have within the Guidelines range, and there is no evidence that the court thought the sentence imposed was too severe.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Alternatively, Bradshaw argues that the error affected his substantial rights because it was structural or because prejudice should otherwise be presumed. This argument is foreclosed by our prior precedent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Accordingly, Bradshaw\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Bradshaw also argues that the district court violated his due process rights, codified in Fed.R.Crim.P. 31.1, when it revoked his supervised release without, <em>inter alia, </em>proper notice, a hearing, or written findings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the district court may have erred in not following the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 31.1, any such error was harmless.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Bradshaw stipulated to and plead guilty to the offense underlying the 2004 conviction. The offense was punishable by up to 10 years of imprisonment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, the court had no choice but to revoke his supervised release.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court\u2019s order revoking supervised release is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">We AFFIRM the sentence in No. 04-41035 and AFFIRM the order revoking supervised release in No. 04-41110.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
