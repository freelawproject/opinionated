We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of appellate issues and hold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">This court reviews an IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and, as such, \u201ca finding will stand if it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)). Credibility determinations are also typically reviewed under the substantial evidence standard of review, and this court\u2019s review of an adverse credibility determination is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Xu Duan Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110, 111 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). Precisely because a reviewing court cannot glean from a hearing record the insights necessary to duplicate the fact-finder\u2019s assessment of credibility, this court\u2019s inquiry is exceedingly narrow and the IJ\u2019s \u201c \u2018administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Although the IJ\u2019s determination that Dong and Cheng were not credible was based in part on the IJ\u2019s observation that Dong and Cheng had testified inconsistently with respect to why Cheng had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>been fired from his position as a cook, a minor discrepancy that did not \u201cgo to the heart\u201d of their asylum claims, <em>see Diallo, </em>282 F.3d at 288, the IJ\u2019s remaining reasons for the adverse credibility finding are supported in the record and are directly related to Dong\u2019s and Cheng\u2019s claims regarding their alleged past persecution. Specifically, the IJ correctly observed that (1) Cheng had not mentioned Dong\u2019s alleged abortion in his initial application for asylum or his first removal hearing; (2) the letter from Cheng\u2019s father did not mention the abortion and stated that Cheng had fled China in October 1992, approximately one month before the alleged abortion and detention of Cheng by the birth control officials in November 1992; (3) Dong\u2019s testimony was inconsistent as to whether Cheng knew she had an IUD inserted and when she disclosed such information to him; and (4) Dong\u2019s testimony that she did not want to have an IUD, be sterilized, or have an abortion because she was Catholic and that she had become pregnant again after the birth of their son was inconsistent with Cheng\u2019s testimony that Dong used oral contraceptives during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Accordingly, because the IJ provided specific reasons in support of her determination that Dong and Cheng had not testified credibly and cited to numerous examples in the record of contradictory evidence and testimony, the IJ\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence. Thus, the IJ properly denied Cheng\u2019s and Dong\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal. Additionally, because Cheng and Dong did not present any credible evidence that they will be tortured if returned to China, and any term of imprisonment or fine imposed on Dong as a result of her illegal departure appears will apparently ' arise from a lawfully imposed sanction, the IJ properly denied their claims for CAT relief as well. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(3) (noting that torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions). Finally, the petitioners\u2019 claim that the BIA\u2019s use of its expedited procedure, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), denied them due process is devoid of merit. <em>See Yu Sheng Zhang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.2004) (upholding the streamlining regulations). Moreover, these cases were appropriate for expedited consideration. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">For these reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, and the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
