REENA RAGGI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b199-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In the case filed under Docket Number 04-4332-ag, Mamica Belli petitions for review of the BIA decision affirming an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u2019s\u201d) denial of her husband Luan\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. In the case filed under Docket Number 04-4333-ag, Mamica\u2019s husband, Lu\u00e1n, and their daughter, Irla, petition for review of the same BIA decision. Because Mamica Belli\u2019s claims for relief are entirely derivative of her husband\u2019s, and because both petitions challenge the same BIA decision with the same administrative record, we hereby CONSOLIDATE the two petitions for review and designate Docket Number 04-4332-ag as the lead petition. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Although the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court will review the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA merely restated the IJ\u2019s reasoning. <em>See Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 306-13; <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">In denying Belli\u2019s request for asylum, the IJ expressed skepticism as to Belli\u2019s claim of past persecution, but added that, even if Belli had been the victim of past persecution, changed conditions in Albania meant that he was nonetheless ineligible for asylum. If an asylum applicant does demonstrate past persecution, the government bears the burden of showing, by a preponderance of evidence, a change in circumstances in the applicant\u2019s home country, such that he does not have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140,148 (2d Cir.2003); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1)(i). But the IJ\u2019s decision does not acknowledge that this burden is the government\u2019s, or state that this burden has been met. We may not uphold an IJ\u2019s decision that relies on an incorrect application of law. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 149. Still, if the IJ had conclusively found, as an alternative and independent ground for the decision, that Belli had not met his burden of showing past persecution, and if we determined that such finding was supported by substantial evidence, the decision of the IJ could stand. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005). But because it is not clear what the basis for the IJ\u2019s decision is \u2014 the lack of past persecution, or changed circumstances in Albania \u2014 we must remand to the agency for further consideration and clarification. <em>See SEC v. Chenery, </em>318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Accordingly, the petitions are GRANTED. The BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in these petitions is VACATED, and any pending motions for a stay of removal in these petitions are DENIED as moot. Any pending requests for oral argument in these petitions are DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
