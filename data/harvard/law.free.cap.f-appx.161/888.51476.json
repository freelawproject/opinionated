After review, we affirm Rose\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">Prior to this case, Rose, a Jamaican national, had a federal drug conviction. Specifically, in January 1999, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Rose pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Rose was sentenced to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment, and upon his release from prison, he was immediately deported to Jamaica.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-10\">On or about November 9, 2004, Rose illegally attempted to reenter the United States. In late November 2004, a one-count indictment charged Rose with illegal reentry into the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On January 20, 2005, Rose pleaded guilty to the charge without a written plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">The probation office prepared a PreSentence Investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) for Rose\u2019s sentencing under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The PSI set Rose\u2019s base offense level at eight. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. However, the PSI recommended that Rose\u2019s offense level be enhanced by sixteen levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), due to his reentry into the United States after \u201ca conviction for a felony that is ... a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A). The PSI noted that Rose was arrested in 1998 for possession with intent to distribute cocaine; that he was convicted on that charge upon his guilty plea; and that he was sentenced in January 1999 to thirty months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-15\">Finally, the PSI recommended that Rose\u2019s offense level be reduced by three, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b), for his acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total adjusted offense level of twenty-one. With a criminal history category of III, Rose\u2019s guidelines range was forty-six to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-16\">At his sentencing hearing, Rose never disputed the existence or the nature of his prior conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Similarly, during his plea colloquy, Rose conceded the accuracy of the prosecutor\u2019s factual proffer, including the fact of his prior conviction in the Middle District of Florida for possession with intent to distribute cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, Rose did object to the use of that 1999 conviction to enhance his sentence. Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>eifically, Rose\u2019s counsel objected because the \u201caggravated felony nature of the [1999] offense wasn\u2019t charged in the Indictment.\u201d Counsel repeated that his objection was \u201cbased on [the conviction] not being charged in the Indictment.\u201d Rose\u2019s counsel argued that although the Supreme Court held in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) that the fact of a prior conviction does <em>not </em>need to be\u00aballeged in an indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the Supreme Court arguably overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">The district court overruled Rose\u2019s objection and sentenced Rose to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. Rose timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">On appeal, Rose argues that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his prior drug conviction was not charged in the 2004 indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">The parties dispute the applicable standard of review. Rose\u2019s brief states that plain-error review applies to both his Fifth and Sixth Amendment claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant Br. at 5. Interestingly, the government states that <em>de novo </em>review applies to Rose\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim regarding the prior conviction\u2019s inclusion in the indictment, but that plain-error review applies to Rose\u2019s' Sixth Amendment claim regarding the district court\u2019s authority to make findings of fact.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee Br. at 8. We need not resolve the dispute, because Rose\u2019s claims fail under either standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">While Rose asserts that his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated, he candidly admits that \u201cthis Court\u2019s recent decisions effectively decide the issues raised in this appeal.\u201d Appellant Br. at 6. Rose further acknowledges that he only \u201craises the issue[s] and preserves [them] for further attacks on his conviction and sentence should the state of the law change.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">Our recent decisions do govern, and this Court has already held several times that \u201c <em>\u2018Almendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court [expressly] determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 963 (11th Cir.) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1316 n. 3 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). This Court has also concluded that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number><em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1188 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 551,\u2014L.Ed.2d\u2014(2005); Orduno-<em>Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">In addition, the district court did not resolve any disputed facts related to Rose\u2019s prior conviction, and thus the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard </em>does not change the result here. <em>See Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962 n. 3 (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that sixteen-level enhancement for prior conviction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) violated his Sixth Amendment rights, and holding that because the district court did not resolve any \u201cdisputed facts related to the prior conviction which were not adjudicated in the prior proceeding,\u201d the \u201cSupreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Shepard ... </em>does not change our analysis in this case\u201d); <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1315-16 &amp; n. 3 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Rose has never disputed that he has a prior conviction in the Middle District of Florida for possession with intent to distribute cocaine. As a matter of law, Rose\u2019s prior drug conviction is an aggravated felony for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See supra </em>note 1. Additionally, Rose\u2019s prior conviction was undisputedly for a \u201cfelony that is ... a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A); <em>see supra </em>note 1. Accordingly, we affirm Rose\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-12\">. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) provides that \"[s]ubject to subsection (b),\u201d any alien who is caught illegally reentering the United States subsequent to a previous deportation is subject to a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Further, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) provides that if the alien\u2019s previous removal was \"subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,\u201d the alien is subject to a maximum of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2). Rose's 1999 drag conviction is a drag trafficking crime and an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-18\">.

We review a constitutional objection presented for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). For this Court to reverse for plain error, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v.
