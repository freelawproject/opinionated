We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-16\">This Court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s opinion. <em>Xue Hong Yang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). However, when the BIA rejects part of the basis of an IJ\u2019s decision, but otherwise affirms the holding, this Court reviews the judgement of the IJ as modified by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>Here, because the BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s ultimate determination that Gjoka failed to meet his burden of proof \u201cthrough credible testimony or otherwise,\u201d but rejected some of the IJ\u2019s subsidiary credibility findings, and rejected the frivolous finding, the Court reviews the decision of the IJ as modified by the BIA. <em>Id. </em>However, the BIA\u2019s decision prevents our adequate review because it did not specify which of the IJ\u2019s reasons it found to be based impermissibly on speculation and conjecture, thus we are unable to discern what the BIA did and did not adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-17\">This Court will affirm the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination, and/or the findings underlying it, if they are supported by substantial evidence, but will not speculate about what those findings were. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 149-50 (2d Cir.2003). Because we are unable to discern the basis for the BIA\u2019s affirmance, the case must be remanded, to allow the BIA to clarify its reasoning regarding Gjoka\u2019s credibility, and to specify which of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>IJ\u2019s reasons provide a legitimate basis to deny asylum. <em>Jin Shui Qiu, </em>329 F.3d at 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">We note, however, that Gjoka has failed to raise either his withholding of removal or CAT claim before this Court, and therefore both are deemed waived. <em>Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The decision of the BIA is accordingly VACATED, in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
