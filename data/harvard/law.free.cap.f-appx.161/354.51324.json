On the second day of her detention, the INS served a Notice to Appear on her to begin removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-21\">Gomez-Arevalo conceded she was deportable, but requested asylum and withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture, and voluntary departure. These requests were based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>her allegations that: she was a pharmaceutical representative in rural communities in Columbia; on 27 April 2001, she was kidnaped by members of the FARC guerilla warfare group, which demanded medicine and for her to become a part of their group; the group threatened to kill her if she did not comply; the day after her release, she was captured by another guerilla warfare group that made similar threats; and upon being released, she sought, and received, a visa from the Honduras Consulate to travel to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">On 8 April 2002, Gomez-Arevalo failed to appear at her hearing before the Immigration Judge (IJ); following an in absentia hearing, the IJ found her removable. On 9 October 2002, she filed her first untimely motion to reopen based on alleged exceptional circumstances that could excuse her absence. The IJ denied the motion on 30 October 2002, and the BIA affirmed without opinion on 29 January 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">On 25 January 2005, Gomez-Arevalo filed a second untimely motion to reopen, alleging changed country circumstances. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2005) (requiring a motion to reopen to be filed within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s final order). The BIA denied the motion on 3 March 2005 because it was filed out of time and because Gomez-Arevalo failed to demonstrate a changed country circumstance. On 1 April 2005, less than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen, Gomez-Arevalo timely filed her petition with this court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000). Because her motion to reopen was based on changed country circumstances, we have jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s denial of the untimely motion to reopen. <em>See Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e have appellate jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to reopen deportation proceedings in instances where the petitioner files such a motion ... for \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)\u201d.). Gomez-Arevalo seeks review only of the denial of her second motion to reopen based on alleged new evidence of changed country circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen proceedings under a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Manzano-Garda v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). \u201cThe standard is whether the Board has acted within the bounds of an abundant discretion granted it by Congress.\u201d <em>Lara v. Tivminski, 216 </em>F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Gomez-Arevalo\u2019s motion to reopen because of changed circumstances was based on alleged new evidence that: in September 2004, her sister, who lives in Colombia, received a telephone call from someone asking to speak with Gomez-Arevalo; a few days later, two men from the FARC group arrived at her sister\u2019s house and asked for Gomez-Arevalo\u2019s location; and the next evening, the group made a threatening telephone call to her sister\u2019s residence, again asking for information regarding Gomez-Arevalo.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">The BIA properly denied GomezArevalo\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely filed. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) requires such a motion to be filed within 90 days of the BIA\u2019s final decision. Although the BIA entered its final order in these proceedings on 29 January 2004, Gomez-Arevalo did not file her motion to reopen until 25 January 2005, 272 days after the due date. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that her failure to timely file the motion should result in its denial. <em>See Panjwani, </em>401 F.3d at 632-33 (affirming the BIA\u2019s denial of the petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the petitioner presented evidence insufficient to qualify for changed country exception to deadline).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Gomez-Arevalo asserts that her motion to reopen could be filed at any time, pursuant to the exception provided in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C)(ii) (Supp.2005) (allowing exception to the 90-day deadline for motions to reopen when an alien seeking asylum submits evidence of changed country conditions that is \u201cmaterial and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding\u201d). Because, as discussed <em>infra, </em>Gomez-Arevalo\u2019s motion to reopen did <em>not </em>reflect changed country conditions, her motion does not fit under the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Gomez-Arevalo failed to establish changed country circumstances. As discussed, she alleged that two members of the FARC group went to her sister\u2019s house to look for her and later made a threatening telephone call to her sister\u2019s family. The BIA determined correctly that such an isolated report of general threats does <em>not </em>establish the requisite change in circumstance. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 188 (5th Cir. 2004) (stating that \u201cmere denigration, harassment, and threats\u201d are not sufficient evidence because \u201c[n]either discrimination nor harassment ordinarily amounts to persecution under the INA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b383-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
