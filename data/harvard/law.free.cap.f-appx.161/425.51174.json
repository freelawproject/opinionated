The district court <em>sua sponte </em>dismissed Wilson\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Wilson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Wilson proceeds <em>pro se; </em>therefore, we construe his pleadings liberally.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, \u201c[fjederal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, as always, the plaintiff must show that a statutory basis for federal jurisdiction exists before his case can be heard in federal court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have carefully considered Wilson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint and given respectful attention to his arguments on appeal; however, we find no basis for federal court jurisdiction in this case. There is no assertion that this cause of action is between citizens of different states, as required for diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382, because Wilson asserts that both he and Rayford are citizens of Mississippi.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Moreover, Wilson has not asserted any claims in his complaint arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States, as required for federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. In determining whether a case \u201carises under federal law\u201d we look to whether the \u201cplaintiffs well-pleaded complaint\u201d raises issues of federal law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Even when read liberally, Wilson\u2019s complaint fails to meet this burden. Accordingly, we are without jurisdiction to hear this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b453-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
