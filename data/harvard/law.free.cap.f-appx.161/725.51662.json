The Honorable Larry R. Hicks, District Court Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b753-16\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">Appellant Phu Van Huynh appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus. Two issues have been certified for appeal: (1) Whether the prosecutor engaged in impermissible vouching during closing arguments; and (2) whether Appellant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the alleged impermissible vouching at closing argument. Appellant has also briefed several uncertified issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-22\">We have reviewed the district court\u2019s decision to deny the habeas petition <em>de novo, </em>seeking to determine whether the state court\u2019s adjudication on the merits resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. <em>Arnold, v. Runnels, </em>421 F.3d 859, 862 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Delgado v. Lewis, </em>223 F.3d 976, 981-82 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-23\">We find that none of the statements placed \u201cthe prestige of the government behind a witness,\u201d <em>United States v. Leon-Reyes, </em>177 F.3d 816, 821 (9th Cir.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Necoechea, </em>986 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993)), in a manner that \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quoting <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). Even if an error was found to exist, it would undoubtedly be harmless. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 </em>U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (under harmless error standard reversal is warranted only when the error has a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d). Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim must also fail as no injury to Appellant can be shown. See <em>Ewing v. Williams, </em>596 F.2d 391, 395 (9th Cir.1979) (providing that \u201cthe law in this Circuit is clear that where an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel is premised on specific acts or omis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>sions of counsel, the allegation must be buttressed by a showing of injury or prejudice to the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We have reviewed the uncertified issues briefed by Appellant, construing them as a motion to expand the certificate of appeal-ability as required by Circuit Rule 22-l(e). We conclude that Appellant has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>Pham v. Terhune, </em>400 F.3d 740, 742 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted), and therefore determine it is not appropriate to address Appellant\u2019s uncertified issues. Ninth Circuit Rule 22-1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b753-24\">.
