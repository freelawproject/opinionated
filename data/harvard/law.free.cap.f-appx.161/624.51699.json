His counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), arguing that Lara-Valenzuela\u2019s sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-26\">The sentence is not unreasonable. The district court gave Lara-Valenzuela a sentence within the applicable advisory Guidelines range, stated that it had considered the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and heard argument from counsel regarding Lara-Valenzuela\u2019s criminal history and drug addiction. <em>See United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>(8th Cir.2005) (Guidelines sentence based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors is presumptively reasonable), cert. <em>denied,\u2014</em>U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 840, 163 L.Ed.2d 715 (2005) (No. 05-7506).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v.
