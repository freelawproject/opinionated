Spence appeals the denial of his motion to compel specific performance of that portion of his plea agreement requiring the government to make a motion for a downward departure if Spence offered full, voluntary, and truthful testimony, if he abided by any reasonable requests of the case agents or the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, and if his efforts resulted in the prosecution of another person. Having carefully considered the parties\u2019 submissions, we affirm for the reasons stated in the opinion of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
