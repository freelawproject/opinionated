For the reasons set forth below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">ORDERED that the notice of appeal in No. 04-1056 and the petition for review in No. 04-1057 are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Preston W. Small seeks review of several orders by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) related to its decision to permit WNNX Lico, Inc. (WNNX) to substitute its Anniston, Alabama FM license for a radio channel based in College Park, Georgia and to deny Small\u2019s similar proposals to substitute his Milledgeville, Georgia FM channel license for one located in Covington, Georgia.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> College Park and Covington are both suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Small\u2019s and WNNX\u2019s proposals were mutually exclusive because of the proximity of College Park and Covington. <em>See </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 73.207(b) (requiring minimum distance of 99 kilometers between adjacent Class C3 channels). In evaluating competing, mutually exclusive petitions, the FCC follows the allotment priorities established in <em>Revision of FM Assignment Policies and Procedures, </em>90 F.C.C.2d 88 (1982) <em>(FM Priorities). </em>Under <em>FM Priorities, </em>the FCC accords first priority to a proposal that provides a community with \u201cfirst full-time aural service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. Unable to grant both petitions, the FCC evaluated the proposals and deemed WNNX\u2019s superior to Small\u2019s because it seived a larger community than Small\u2019s and provided first local service to College Park. <em>See Amendment of Section 73.202(b), Table of Allotments, FM Broadcast Stations (Anniston and Ashland, Alabama and College Park, Covington, Milledgeville and Social Circle, Georgia), </em>15 F.C.C.R. 9971, 9973 \u00b6 12 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">We uphold a final order of the FCC unless its decision is \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). This is a \u201cdeferential\u201d standard of review. <em>Consumer Elecs. Ass\u2019n v. FCC, </em>347 F.3d 291, 300 (D.C.Cir.2003). Small contends that the FCC acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it ruled that WNNX\u2019s proposal provided first local service to College Park. Small\u2019s claim fails. A suburban community\u2019s independence from a nearby Urbanized Area for the purpose of the first local service priority is evaluated based on eight factors outlined by the FCC in <em>Fave and Richard Tuck, </em>3 F.C.C.R. 5374 (1988) <em>(Tuck). </em>The record more than adequately supports the Commission\u2019s decision. The FCC considered evidence regarding each <em>Tuck </em>factor and acted within its discretion in finding that College Park was sufficiently independent of Atlanta to merit first local service priority.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Small\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit. In view of our holding in No. 04-1056, we need not decide Small\u2019s outstanding motion regarding the filing of documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b40-7\"> In response to WNNX\u2019s College Park proposal, Small amended his petition by requesting a station in Covington, Georgia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
