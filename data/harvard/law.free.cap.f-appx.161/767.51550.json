Beeman, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, requests a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to appeal the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. For substantially the same reasons set forth by the district court, we DENY Beeman\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-29\">In 1989, Beeman entered a plea in state court pursuant to <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), to one count of attempted first degree sexual assault. During the plea colloquy, the court advised Beeman that his plea constituted a felony conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>that the conviction could be used to charge him as a habitual criminal if he committed another crime, and if convicted of another crime, the conviction of attempted first degree sexual assault could be used to enhance his sentence. Beeman acknowledged his understanding of the court\u2019s advisement. The court sentenced Beeman to four years\u2019 imprisonment, with credit for time served. Because Beeman had already served more than four years in prison, the court ordered his immediate release.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">In 2000, Beeman was convicted of a new felony and was convicted of habitual criminal charges, which included the conviction stemming from his <em>Alford </em>plea. The state trial court sentenced Beeman to twelve years\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Two years later, Beeman filed an application for post-conviction relief in state court, arguing that his trial counsel in 1989 rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by incorrectly informing Beeman that his <em>Alford </em>plea could not serve as the basis of future habitual criminal charges. The trial court denied relief because the application was untimely. Under Colorado law, a three year statute of limitations applies to applications for post-conviction relief for felonies other than Class 1 felonies. Colo. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 16-5-402(1). Thus, the trial court found that Beeman should have filed the application within three years of the 1989 conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the date the sentence was imposed in 1989 commenced the limitations period and that Beeman failed to allege facts that, if true, would establish justifiable excuse or neglect. Specifically, the court rejected Beeman\u2019s argument that his 2000 conviction was the first notice he received that his <em>Alford </em>plea could form the basis of a habitual criminal charge. The court determined that the 1989 plea colloquy afforded Beeman adequate notice. In the alternative, the court ruled that Beeman\u2019s allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel lacked merit, relying on longstanding Colorado precedent holding that where \u201cthe trial court explained and the defendant understood ... the possible sentences to which he was subject as a result of pleading guilty to the offenses, the assistance of his trial counsel [is], ipso facto, sufficient to meet the constitutional standard, irrespective of whether counsel independently explained these rights to defendant.\u201d <em>People v. Hall, </em>697 P.2d 746, 748 (Colo.Ct.App.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Having exhausted his state court remedies, Beeman filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in the court below. The district court rejected Beeman\u2019s claim that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance in connection with the 1989 <em>Alford </em>plea, finding that Beeman cannot attack an expired conviction, notwithstanding its use as a present sentence enhancement. <em>Lackawanna County Disk Atty. v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 403-04, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001) (\u201conce a state conviction is no longer open to direct or collateral attack in its own right ... the conviction may be regarded as conclusively valid. If that conviction is later used to enhance a criminal sentence, the defendant generally may not challenge the enhanced sentence through a petition under \u00a7 2254 on the ground that the prior conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d). Additionally, the court rejected Beeman\u2019s challenge to the state\u2019s denial of a post-conviction evidentiary hearing, finding that a claim of constitutional error directed at state post-conviction proceedings is not cognizable on federal habeas review. <em>Sellers v. Ward, </em>135 F.3d 1333, 1339 (10th Cir.1998) (claim that \u201cfocuses only on the State\u2019s post-conviction remedy ... states no cognizable federal habeas claim\u201d). Accordingly, the court denied Beeman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>\u00a7 2254 petition and dismissed the action. Having been denied a COA below, Beeman now seeks a COA from this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Upon thorough review of the record, the briefs, and the relevant authority, we discern no error in the district court\u2019s disposition of Beeman\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. Neither Beeman\u2019s attack on his expired 1989 conviction nor his challenge to state post-conviction procedures are cognizable under \u00a7 2254. Moreover, we will not address Beeman\u2019s assertion of actual innocence as he failed to raise the issue below. <em>See, e.g., In re Walker, </em>959 F.2d 894, 896 (10th Cir.1992) (\u201ca federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\u201d); <em>Barnes v. Scott, </em>201 F.3d 1292, 1294 n. 2 (10th Cir.2000) (applying <em>Walker </em>in \u00a7 2254 case). Beeman\u2019s motion to appoint counsel and motion to supplement the record are DENIED. We GRANT Beeman\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. Beeman\u2019s application for a COA is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-7\">. Beeman\u2019s petition was filed after April 24, 1996, the effective date of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d); as a result, AEDPA's provisions apply to this case. <em>See Rogers v. Gibson, </em>173 F.3d 1278, 1282 n. 1 (10th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997)). AEDPA conditions a petitioner\u2019s right to appeal a denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2254 upon a grant of a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). A COA may be issued \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This requires Beeman to show \"that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Because the district court denied Beeman a COA, he may not appeal the district court\u2019s decision absent a grant of COA by this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
