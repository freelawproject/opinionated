We dismiss Abdille\u2019s petition as to his asylum claim and remand as to his remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">Abdille cannot be granted asylum \u201cunless [he] demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that [his] application has been filed within 1 year after the date of [his] arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). In addition, we have previously held that pursuant to the jurisdiction-stripping provision of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that [Abdille] failed to file his asylum application within one year.\u201d <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">In this case, the IJ found that Abdille \u201c[o]bviously ... has not carried his burden of proof\u2019 with regard to the one-year time bar for asylum applications. The IJ made this determination on the basis of factual findings with regard to Abdille\u2019s testimony explaining how he traveled to the United States from Somalia. The IJ found incredible, among other things: 1) that Abdille did not know the identity of the individual smuggling him into the country; 2) that Abdille could not recall any of the personal identity information on his fake passport; 3) that Abdille could not recall whether he had obtained any visas for the countries he traveled through; 4) that Abdille could not remember any of the names of the towns he passed as he traveled by bus through Mexico; 5) that Abdille made it past the United States border guards easily; 6) that Abdille claimed not to have prepared his application for asylum himself; and 7) that Abdille seemed generally unprepared for his travels, despite his purported intense fear and nervousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">We do not have jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), because it is factual in nature. Even following the passage of the REAL ID Act, which sought to restore our jurisdiction somewhat, the circumstances under which we can review an IJ\u2019s application of the one-year bar are very limited. <em>See Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>427 F.3d 1218, 1221-22 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that even a determination of \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D) is a predominantly factual question over which we have no jurisdiction). In the context of the timeliness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>an asylum application, we may review only \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (as amended). No such claim or question is raised here, and so this court may not review the IJ\u2019s determination that Abdille\u2019s application for asylum is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Regardless of the timeliness of Abdille\u2019s asylum application, however, \u201cthis court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) to review the final order denying withholding of removal,\u201d <em>Hakeem, </em>273 F.3d at 816, and to review his claim under the Convention Against Torture. The IJ, on the basis of the factual findings noted above, held that Abdille\u2019s testimony regarding his travel to the United States was incredible. The IJ used this adverse credibility determination as the basis for denying all of Abdille\u2019s requested relief, including his requests for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Because the BIA affirmed the decision of the IJ without opinion, we \u201creview the decision of the IJ as the final agency determination under the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir. 2005) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4); <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 849 (9th Cir.2003)). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence for two reasons: first, it is based on speculation and conjecture; and second, it lacks the proper nexus to the \u201cheart\u201d of Abdille\u2019s asylum claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Under the substantial evidence standard, findings of fact \u201care conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude the contrary.\u201d <em>Jibril v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 1129, 1136 (9th Cir.2005) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)) (internal quotations omitted). Speculation and conjecture cannot justify an adverse credibility determination. <em>Smolniakova, </em>422 F.3d at 1044-45 (citing <em>Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2004)). Thus, we \u201cmust evaluate the IJ\u2019s implausibility findings to determine whether or not they are speculative or conjectural.\u201d <em>Jibril, </em>423 F.3d at 1136.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">In <em>Jibril </em>we held that an IJ generally cannot determine that an alien\u2019s testimony is implausible \u201cwithout pointing to any evidence in the record that contradicted him.\u201d 423 F.3d at 1136. In <em>Jibril, </em>the IJ found implausible that an individual could adequately feign death while being kicked repeatedly, but this court overturned that determination as speculative. <em>Id. </em>Likewise, when the IJ here determined that aspects of Abdille\u2019s flight were implausible, that reasoning was not grounded in the record, and amounted to little more than guesswork. Abdille\u2019s story was inconsistent with the IJ\u2019s commonsense notions of how international travel should work, but it was not inconsistent with itself or with the record. True, Immigration Judges \u201cmust be allowed to exercise common sense,\u201d because \u201c[wjithout such latitude, IJs would be bound to credit even the most outlandish testimony as long as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>was internally consistent.\u201d <em>Jibril, </em>423 F.3d at 1135. But the explanation Abdille gives here is not so much outlandish as it is simply surprising. Though there is no \u201cconsistent line that has been drawn between an IJ\u2019s legitimate application of common sense ... and an IJ\u2019s reliance on \u2018speculation or conjecture,\u2019 \u201d <em>id., </em>in this case the IJ\u2019s discrediting of Abdille\u2019s story seems to weigh almost wholly on the speculation side of the ledger.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Furthermore, speculation is not the only infirmity in the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. Adverse credibility determinations must be \u201cbased on specific, cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.\u201d <em>Zahedi v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1157, 1165 (9th Cir.2000). Any inconsistencies used by the IJ to determine a lack of credibility \u201cmust go to the heart of [the] asylum claim.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002) (citations and internal quotations omitted). Plainly, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based in large measure on Abdille\u2019s testimony and declarations with regard to his travels, <em>not </em>with regard to his past and future persecution. Virtually none of the facts that the IJ discredits as implausible go to the heart of Abdille\u2019s claim that he was and will be persecuted in Somalia for his clan membership status. As we noted in <em>Jibril: </em>\u201c[w]hy a person who provides inconsistent testimony on any <em>one </em>matter should still be presumed credible as to <em>all </em>other matters is far from obvious, but such is the rule we are bound to apply.\u201d 423 F.3d at 1134. Likewise, even if Abdille should be held incredible with regard to his story of flight from Somalia, he should still be presumed credible with regard to the heart of his claim for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. Accordingly, we remand to the IJ \u201cto apply the law to the facts in the first instance ... accepting [Abdille\u2019s] testimony as credible and paying particular attention to the [country information in the record regarding Somalia].\u201d <em>Jibril, </em>423 F.3d at 1138-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS in part and REMAND in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
