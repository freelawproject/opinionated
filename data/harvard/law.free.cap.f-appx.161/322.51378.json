The district court concluded that Lewis\u2019s false declaration in bankruptcy was more similar to perjury than to fraud, followed the sentencing guideline for perjury, and sentenced Lewis to a 21-month prison term. Lewis appeals, contending that the district court should have followed the guideline for fraud, which would have given him a shorter sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">A lender planned in August 2002 to foreclose on Lewis\u2019s house because he had failed to pay his mortgage installments. The day before the scheduled foreclosure, Lewis filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. This petition was Lewis\u2019s eighth personal petition since 1992. Lewis\u2019s filing triggered the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), preventing the lender from foreclosing. The bankruptcy court dismissed Lewis\u2019s case in two separate orders issued in March and May 2003. These orders enjoined Lewis from filing any new bankruptcy case \u201cfor one year from March 14, 2003.\u201d J.A. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">In December 2003 the lender again planned to foreclose on Lewis\u2019s home because of missed mortgage installments. The day before the scheduled sale, Lewis filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy in the Eastern District of Virginia. The forms accompanying the petition required Lewis to list any \u201cPrior Bankruptcy Case Filed Within [the] Last 6 Years,\u201d identifying such filings by court, case number, and date. J.A. 8. In response to this question, Lewis answered \u201cNone,\u201d nowhere disclosing his previous filings. He went on to sign the petition and declare under penalty of perjury that its contents were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">The petition immediately stayed the foreclosure. But it also led a grand jury to indict Lewis in December 2004 on two counts: (1) false declaration in a bankruptcy case, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(3) &amp; 2, and (2) contempt of court, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 401(3) &amp; 2. In March 2005 Lewis pleaded guilty to the two counts before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-13\">Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines, the length of the sentence on the false declaration count determined Lewis\u2019s total sentence. The probation officer\u2019s presentence investigation report initially applied USSG \u00a7 2B1.1, pertaining to fraud, to the false declaration count and recommended a guideline sentence of 10 to 16 months. At the behest of the government, the officer amended the report to instead apply USSG \u00a7 2J1.3, pertaining to perjury, yielding a corrected recommendation of 21 to 27 months. The district court agreed with the government that USSG \u00a7 2J1.3 applied and went on to sentence Lewis to 21 months on the false declaration count. This appeal challenging the district court\u2019s guideline selection followed. We review this legal question de novo. <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>994 F.2d 1088, 1091 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-15\">The Guidelines and our precedent require the sentencing court to \u201c[djetermine the offense guideline section ... applicable to the offense of conviction (i.e., the offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted).\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.2; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Lambert, </em>994 F.2d at 1091. When the charged offense \u201cappear[s] to fall under the express terms of more than one guideline,\u201d the sentencing court must select the \u201cmost applicable\u201d guideline by \u201ccomparing] the guideline texts with the charged misconduct, rather than the statute (which may outlaw a variety of conduct impheating several guidelines) or the actual conduct (which may include factors not elements of the indicted offense).\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>994 F.2d at 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">The applicable guideline is usually found in the Statutory Index to the Guidelines. Convictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 may be governed by one of three guidelines listed in the Index: USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 (covering, inter aha, fraud and deceit), \u00a7 2B4.1 (commercial bribery), or \u00a7 2J1.3 (perjury). The parties agree that \u00a7 2B4.1 is not pertinent to this case. Thus, the district court\u2019s task was to determine whether the \u201coffense conduct charged in ... the indictment\u201d more closely matched fraud under USSG \u00a7 2B1.1 (one of the Chapter 2, Part B \u201cbasic economic offenses\u201d), or perjury under \u00a7 2J1.3 (one- of the Chapter 2, Part J \u201coffenses involving the administration of justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Lewis contends that his conduct was more similar to fraud than to perjury. He argues that he lied to the bankruptcy court about his prior bankruptcy history with the aim of depriving the lender of its legal right to foreclose on Lewis\u2019s house. Lewis argues this was a \u201cdishonest method or scheme\u201d that perpetrated a fraud on the lender. Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">This argument is unpersuasive because it does not focus on the \u201cconduct charged in the count of the indictment ... of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.2. The indictment did not characterize the false declaration Lewis made as part of a scheme aimed at a specific creditor. Indeed, the indictment did not even mention the lender by name. Rather, the indictment concentrated on the gravity of Lewis\u2019s misrepresentation to the bankruptcy court. The indictment stressed, for example, the fact that all of the documents a debtor must file with a bankruptcy petition \u201care attested to <em>under penalty of perjury. </em>\u201d J.A. 6 (emphasis added). The gravamen of the indictment was that Lewis\u2019s false declaration interfered with the bankruptcy court\u2019s administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Thus, our conclusion is the same as that reached by the district court: a comparison of the charged misconduct as described on the face of the indictment with the guidelines shows that Lewis was indicted for activity that is more similar to perjury than to fraud. Sentencing him by applying the fraud guideline was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
