Schultz appeals three separate orders that the district court issued in favor of Creditor-Appellee John F. Dunne, Jr.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In appeal No. 04-55346, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of Dunne\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the validity and priority of his lien against Schultz. In appeal No. 04-55452, the district court dismissed Schultz\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary judgment order regarding Schultz\u2019s state law claims. In appeal No. 04-55705, the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to overrule Schultz\u2019s objections to Dunne\u2019s proofs of claim and allow the claims. We affirm the district court\u2019s rulings in No. 04-55346 (summary judgment on validity of lien), No. 04-55452 (denial of interlocutory appeal), and No. 04-55705 (order overruling objections to proofs of claim). The facts and procedural history of these appeals are known to the parties, and are restated herein only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-17\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court judgment. <em>In re Mantz, </em>343 F.3d 1207, 1211 (9th Cir.2003). We also review <em>de novo </em>the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Thrifty Oil Co. v. Bank of Am. Nat\u2019l Trust and Sav. Ass\u2019n, </em>322 F.3d 1039, 1046 (9th Cir.2003). We also review <em>de novo </em>whether the bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>ruptcy court possessed subject matter jurisdiction to enter a judgment. <em>In re G.I. Industries, Inc., </em>204 F.3d 1276, 1279 (9th Cir.2000). Finally, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s ruling that the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary judgment order is not an appealable, final order. <em>In re Bonham, </em>229 F.3d 750, 761 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\n<em>Appeal No. 01-5534.6</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Schultz argues that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Dunne\u2019s claim regarding the validity and priority of his lien, and to order declaratory relief because no actual controversy existed between Dunne and Schultz. We disagree. Dunne and Schultz entered into a court-approved Fee Agreement whereby Dunne represented Schultz in a state court action, which resulted in a $10 million settlement award to Schultz. Schultz, however, failed to pay Dunne his contingency fee. The fee dispute satisfied the actual controversy requirement because it was a \u201c \u2018substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Principal Life Ins. Co. v. Robinson, </em>394 F.3d 665, 671 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Maryland Cas. Co. v. Pacific Coal &amp; Oil Co., </em>312 U.S. 270, 273, 61 S.Ct. 510, 512, 85 L.Ed. 826 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(1), \u201c[b]ankruptcy judges may hear and determine all cases under title 11 and all core proceedings arising under title 11 ... and may enter appropriate orders and judgments, subject to review under section 158 of this title.\u201d Core proceedings include \u201cdeterminations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(E). Because Dunne sought to establish the validity and priority of his claim and lien rights, his claim falls squarely within the meaning of a core proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157(b)(2)(E). In these circumstances, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to hear and determine Dunne\u2019s cross-claim and cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AVr\">\n<em>Appeal No. 04-55452</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Schultz next argues that the bankruptcy court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on his state law claims was final and therefore appealable. The summary judgment order, however, addressed only one of the two issues presented in the adversary proceeding under Fed.R.Bankr.P. 3007 because it did not address Schultz\u2019s objections to Dunne\u2019s proofs of claim. Therefore, \u201c[a]ppellate jurisdiction is lacking because the bankruptcy court\u2019s order did not dispose of all of the issues in the adversary proceeding.\u201d <em>In the Matter of King City Transit Mix, Inc., </em>738 F.2d 1065, 1066 (9th Cir.1984). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">\n<em>Appeal No. 04-55705</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">Finally, Schultz argues that the bankruptcy court was divested of jurisdiction over Dunne\u2019s proofs of claim and therefore erred when it overruled Schultz\u2019s objections and allowed the proofs of claim. This argument is foreclosed by our determination that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment regarding Dunne\u2019s hen rights and by the bankruptcy court\u2019s failure to address Schultz\u2019s objections to Dunne\u2019s proofs of claim in its summary judgment ruling. Because the bankruptcy court did not alter the \u201cstatus quo\u201d of the two summary judgment orders that were pending on appeal, it retained jurisdiction over Dunne\u2019s proofs of claims. <em>In Re Mirzai, </em>236 B.R. 8, 10 (9th Cir.BAP1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment in No. 04-55346, No. 04-55452, and No. 04-55705.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.

On its own motion, this court consolidated 04-55452 and 04-55705, and calendared them with the companion case 04-55346.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
