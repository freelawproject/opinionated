Campbell was sentenced to five months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by two years\u2019 and two months\u2019 supervised release (the first five months of which Campbell was required to be in home confinement). She began serving her sentence on August 26, 2005. Familiarity is assumed as to the facts, the procedural context, and the specification of appellate issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Campbell claims that the court (1) committed procedural errors at sentencing (a) by failing to consider \u201cthe concept of aberrant behavior in a non-guidelines framework,\u201d and (b) by denying a minor role adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2; and (2) imposed a sentence of unreasonable length.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">This Court reviews sentences imposed after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for \u201creasonableness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 765; reviews a district judge\u2019s interpretation of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo, United States v. Adler, </em>52 F.3d 20, 21 (2d Cir.1995) <em>(per </em>curiam); reviews findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard, <em>United States v. Selioutsky, </em>409 F.3d 114, 119 (2d Cir.2005); and gives due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">(1) Campbell contends that the district court committed a procedural error under <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), by failing to appreciate that it could consider the concept of aberrant behavior in imposing a non-Guidelines sentence, even if a downward departure pursuant to the Guidelines was not available. The district court, did, however, understand that it could impose a non-Guidelines sentence, and it declined to do so. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the district court failed to consider each and every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. The district court stated at least three times that it had considered all of these factors; no more is required. <em>See United States v. Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[W]e continue to believe that no specific verbal formulations should be prescribed to demonstrate the adequate discharge of the duty to \u2018consider\u2019 matters relevant to sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">(2) Nothing in the record suggests that the district court erred in denying a down<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ward departure under \u00a7 3B1.2. Section 3B1.2 only applies where a defendant is \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d; the district court found, however, that Campbell lied on purchase forms when she bought six guns on three different occasions from three different dealers. Moreover, the district court did take into account her role in the criminal activity by sentencing her below the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">(3) The government and the Probation Department calculated that Campbell\u2019s adjusted offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines was 12 and that her criminal history category was I, resulting in a Guidelines range of ten to sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment. The sentence imposed is <em>below </em>the calculated Guidelines range, which, though no longer binding on the district court <em>post-Booker, </em>still provides a useful \u201cbenchmark or a point of reference\u201d to the sentencing court \u201cin fashioning a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Rubenstein, </em>403 F.3d 93, 98-99 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The Court has considered Campbell\u2019s remaining arguments and finds them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
