KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b828-21\">Defendant-Appellant Kenneth Eugene Wright appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to modify his sentence. Mr. Wright was convicted of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and was sentenced to 292 months imprisonment and four years supervised release. He appealed his sentence and it was affirmed. <em>United States v. Wright, </em>No. 91-6349, 1993 WL 204158 (10th Cir. June 7, 1993) (unpublished). His certiorari petition to the Supreme Court was denied. <em>Wright v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 927, 114 S.Ct. 333, 126 L.Ed.2d 278 (1993). A 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion was dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">Mr. Wright contends that Amendment 591 of the Sentencing Guidelines applies to his sentence. The district court rejected this contention. We review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) allows the district court to reduce a term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range that \u201csubsequently has been lowered by the Sentene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>ing Commission.\u201d <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 540 (internal quotations and citations omitted). While \u00a7 1B1.10 gives Amendment 591 retroactive effect, the Amendment does not apply to Mr. Wright\u2019s sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). Mr. Wright\u2019s interpretation of the scope of that amendment is in error. Amendment 591 amends \u00a7 1B1.1(a), \u00a7 1B1.2(a), the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.2 and \u00a7 2D1.2, and Appendix A (Statutory Index). <em>See id. </em>Mr. Wright was sentenced under \u00a7 2D1.1, not under \u00a7 2D1.2. As such, Amendment 591\u2019s changes to \u00a7 2D1.2 do not affect Mr. Wright\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">AFFIRMED. Mr. Wright\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b828-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
