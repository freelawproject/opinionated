The IJ determined that Topllari lacked credibility due to inconsistencies in his testimony, that he failed to prove claimed past persecution, and that his application for asylum was frivolous. The BIA reversed the IJ\u2019s finding that Topllari filed a frivolous application for asylum, but affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding and resulting denial of relief. We find that there is substantial evidence supporting the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and DENY Topllari\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">Topllari is a 34-year-old single male from Albania. He and his family joined the Albanian democratic party in 1991, and Topllari was an active member. Topllari entered the United States on August 27, 2001, at Eagle Pass, Texas, and shortly thereafter was apprehended by U.S. border patrol agents. He filed an application for asylum, and the IJ held a removal hearing on February 5, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">At the hearing, Topllari testified that, on June 17, 2001, Albanian police broke into a Democratic Party meeting, beat him and threatened to harm him further if he continued his involvement with the Democratic Party. Topllari also testified that, on June 24, 2001, police officers forcibly removed him from a polling place after he tried to report ballot box stuffing to the chairman of the Socialist Party. When he resisted being removed, the officers kicked him and threatened his life. Topllari was able to escape custody and hide with friends and family until he could flee Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">Topllari also testified that he told the U.S. border patrol agents the truth when they questioned him, with the assistance of an interpreter, after apprehending him in Eagle Pass, Texas. Topllari told the border patrol agents that he left Albania during the first week in June 2001 and entered Athens, Greece, with a valid passport about five days later on June 11, 2001. He then entered Paris, France, with a valid passport on June 16, 2001, and spent 10 days there before flying to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on June 27, 2001. Topllari then entered Mexico illegally on July 17, 2001, and crossed the border into the United States on August 27, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">The IJ found that there was significant inconsistency between Topllari\u2019s hearing testimony and what he told the border patrol agents upon his arrival in the United States. For example, Topllari told the border patrol agents that he was in Paris, France, at the time he testified he was being persecuted in Albania. The only explanation Topllari offered for this major <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>discrepancy was interpreter error. Topllari blamed other inconsistencies and the absence of key events from his asylum application on interpreter error as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">The IJ determined that Topllari was not credible and denied his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. The IJ also found that Topllari submitted a frivolous application for asylum. On April 19, 2004, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, but reversed the IJ\u2019s finding that Topllari submitted a frivolous application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">When the BIA adopts the reasoning of an IJ, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency decision. <em>Denko v. INS, </em>351 F.3d 717, 726 (6th Cir.2003). \u201cWe review the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and the IJ\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Tapucu v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 736, 738 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">An IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is a finding of fact, and we review it for \u201c \u2018substantial evidence\u2019, reversing only if \u2018any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Yu v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 700, 703 (6th Cir.2004) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum to a \u201crefugee.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (2005). An applicant for asylum bears the burden of establishing that he qualifies as a refugee by \u201cproducing evidence that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Yu, </em>364 F.3d at 703 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">When an IJ determines, on the basis of an adverse credibility determination, that an applicant has failed to establish that he qualifies as a refugee, \u201cthe finding must be supported by specific reasons\u201d and \u201cbased on issues that go to the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Sylla v. INS, </em>388 F.3d 924, 926 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-11\">Topllari argues that the discrepancies upon which the IJ based her adverse credibility determination involved only \u201cnonessential details\u201d and that \u201csubstantial portions\u201d of his testimony were corroborated by the submission of unspecified written documents. We disagree. In a 24-page opinion, the IJ discussed the major inconsistencies in Topllari\u2019s testimony and explained why they went to the heart of his asylum claim. The IJ also noted a number of minor inconsistencies and Topllari\u2019s unresponsiveness when questioned, which lend further support to the conclusion that Topllari lacked credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Topllari testified that he was persecuted in Albania for his activities associated with the Democratic Party on June 17, 2001, and June 24, 2001, and that these two events forced him to flee Albania. However, he also testified that he told U.S. border patrol agents the truth when they questioned him upon his arrival in the United States, and that he told those agents that he was in Paris, France, for about 10 days beginning June 16, 2001. As this major inconsistency creates doubt as to whether the persecution that allegedly caused Topllari to flee Albania actually occurred, it clearly goes to the heart of his asylum claim. The only explanation Topllari offers for this, and all other inconsistencies in his testimony, is interpreter error.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">Since the IJ provided specific reasons for her adverse credibility determination, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>and those reasons went to the heart of Topllari\u2019s claims, we conclude that there was substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility determination and the denial of Topllari\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See Sylla, </em>388 F.3d at 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">For these reasons set forth above, we DENY Topllari\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
