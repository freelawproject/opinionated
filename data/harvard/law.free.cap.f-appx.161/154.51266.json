We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-23\">The BIA denied the motion to reopen because it exceeded the one-motion limit Chaudhary was allowed under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA also held that the submitted evidence did not establish changed circumstances under 8 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(iii) because the documents were unauthenticated. It was error to deny Chaudhary\u2019s petition for review based solely on his failure to file authenticated documents without an explanation of why it would be reasonable that he could obtain authenticated documents. <em>See Cao He Lin v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 404 (2d Cir. Nov.4, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, the stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this matter is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
