Nghiem appeals pro se two orders of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) awarding appellees GMAC Mortgage Corporation and Executive Trustee Services, Inc. attorney\u2019s fees and costs for litigation before the bankruptcy court and the BAP. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) and \u201cwill not disturb a bankruptcy court\u2019s attorney fee determination unless the bankruptcy court abused its discretion or erroneously applied the law.\u201d <em>Ford v. Baroff (In re Baroff), </em>105 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">To the extent that Nghiem advances contentions concerning the underlying litigation, they are foreclosed by our prior decision in <em>Nghiem v. Ghazvini (In re Nghiem), </em>53 Fed.Appx. 489 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-14\">The BAP did not abuse its discretion or commit legal error in concluding that Nghiem\u2019s first amended complaint did not allege a violation of California\u2019s Business and Professions Code \u00a7 17200 <em>et seq., </em>an unfair competition law invoked by Nghiem at the attorney\u2019s fees hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-19\">Nor do we find fault with the BAP\u2019s conclusion that, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1021, the attorney\u2019s fees provisions in the trust deed \u201care broad enough to encompass fees incurred in an action involving non-contract claims.\u201d The relevant clauses of the trust deed, paragraphs 7 and 21, provide for the recovery of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d for actions that encompass Nghiem\u2019s claims in his complaint. <em>See 8250 Wilshire Blvd. Bldg. v. W.R. Grace &amp; Co., </em>990 F.2d 487, 489 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201cThe language of this provision includes not only contract enforcement actions, but actions relating to the \u2018subject matter\u2019 of the agreement.\u201d); <em>Johnson v. Siegel, </em>84 Cal.App.4th 1087, 101 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 422 (2000) (holding that a broad attorney\u2019s fees provision applies to both contract and tort causes of action); <em>Lerner v. Ward, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 155, 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 486, 489 (1993) (holding that a clause applying \u201cto any action or proceeding arising out of the agreement ... included any action for fraud arising out of that agreement\u201d). We reject Nghiem\u2019s contention that if the trust deed was extinguished its attorney\u2019s fees provisions became inoperative, as his complaint sought to reinstate the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-20\">In light of our conclusion, we need not reach Nghiem\u2019s contentions concerning California Civil Code \u00a7 1717.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b752-23\">This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
