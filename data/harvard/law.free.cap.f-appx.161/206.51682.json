For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">Singh is a native and citizen of India. In removal proceedings, he admitted removability, but filed applications for asylum, withholding of removal and voluntary departure. Singh claimed that he was persecuted in India due to his participation as a member of the AISSF.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An Immigration Judge (IJ) denied all relief, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion on July 26, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">On December 3, 2004, Singh filed a motion to reopen, accompanied by his affidavit and two affidavits from two relatives in India. Singh\u2019s motion was purportedly based on changes in country conditions. The BIA denied the motion. Singh filed a timely petition for review and a motion for a stay of removal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This Court denied a stay of removal on June 29, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-15\">The decision to deny a motion to reopen is within the Board\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a); <em>Lu v. Ashcroft, </em>259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001). Under the regulations, the Board \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). As the Supreme Court has stated, the regulations \u201cplainly disfavor\u201d such motions. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Accordingly, the Court reviews the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion with \u201cbroad deference\u201d to its decision. <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>325 F.3d 396, 409 (3d Cir.2003). Thus, in order to succeed on the petition for review, Singh must ultimately show that the Board\u2019s discretionary decision was somehow arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. <em>See Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-16\">A motion to reopen proceedings based on changed country conditions \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Singh\u2019s motion to reopen was purportedly based on changed country conditions; i.e., that the Congress Party, which was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>power when Operation Blue Star<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> took place, is now back in power. Singh also alleged that the police raided his home, asking for him, on March 15, 2004. Singh provided two affidavits from relatives reporting the raid, but, as the BIA noted, the affidavits did not state how the relatives knew about the raid, nor did they give any details about the raid, such as whether the police stated why they were looking for Singh. Given the lack of support for his motion, we find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. For the foregoing reasons, the petition will be denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\">.
