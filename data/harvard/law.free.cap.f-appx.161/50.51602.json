INS, </em>13 F.3d 610, 613 (2d Cir.1994). The IJ\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard and may be overturned only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). Nevertheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). Inconsistent testimony often bears a legitimate nexus to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>an adverse credibility finding, but it need not be fatal if it is minor and isolated, and the testimony is otherwise generally consistent, rational, and believable. <em>See Dial-lo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). Lack of corroborating evidence may also bear on credibility, but it cannot form the sole basis for an adverse credibility determination. <em>Id. </em>at 287. Finally, while an adverse credibility finding may be based on the inherent implausibility of particular allegations, <em>see, e.g., Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005), it may not be based on speculation and conjecture, <em>see Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307, 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In this case, contrary to petitioner\u2019s contentions, the IJ\u2019s credibility determinations were substantially supported by the record as a whole. The IJ\u2019s determinations were based on Liang\u2019s lack of supporting evidence, general testimony, and implausible statements. Liang did not submit any witness statements, or evidence that he had ever been arrested, and he presented no plausible reason why the police had a continuing desire to persecute him. Accordingly, this Court concludes that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings were based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that bear a \u201clegitimate nexus\u201d to the findings. <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In regard to Liang\u2019s Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) claim, it is well-settled that, before a petitioner can seek judicial review of a claim, the petitioner must \u201cexhaust all administrative remedies available.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). A party may not seek judicial review of an adverse administrative decision until that party has first sought all possible relief within the agency itself. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). Here, Liang failed to raise his CAT claim before the BIA and, therefore, it cannot be reviewed by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
