For reversal Rivera argues that his sentence is excessive and not reasonable under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, because the \u201cdramatic\u201d reduction in drug quantity from that recommended by the presentence report to that found by the district court at sentencing did not result in a corresponding reduction in Rivera\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines offense level. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">We note that the 292-month prison term for the drug conspiracy does not involve a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court considered only the drug quantities and role adjustment found by the jury; and that the consecutive 60-month prison term for the firearm offense was the minimum mandated by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A sentence within the applicable Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable and the burden is on the appellant to rebut that presumption. <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d 716, 717-18 (8th Cir.2005). We conclude that Rivera\u2019s sentence is not unreasonable: the district court correctly determined the Guidelines imprisonment range for the conspiracy count based on the jury\u2019s findings; chose a sentence at the bottom of that range; and indicated the sentence was based on the court\u2019s consideration of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) and (a)(2)(B). <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66 (standard of review; \u00a7 3553(a) will guide appellate courts in determining whether sentence is unreasonable); <em>Lincoln, </em>413 F.3d at 717-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-26\">.
