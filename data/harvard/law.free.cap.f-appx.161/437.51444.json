Perry contends that the defendants violated his Eighth Amendment rights by delaying treatment of his hand, which he broke in a fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Unsuccessful medical treatment, acts of negligence, medical malpractice, or a prisoner\u2019s disagreement with prison officials regarding medical treatment are insufficient to establish an unconstitutional denial of medical care. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 292 (5th Cir.1997). The uncontested summary judgment evidence shows that Perry received extensive care for his injury. Perry\u2019s allegations, arguments, and summary-judgment evidence point only to a difference of opinion as to the proper course of treatment. Perry has failed to show there is any genuine issue of fact material to whether any person acted with deliberate indifference to his health problem. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b466-8\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
