The Immigration Judge (IJ) ordered Salazar removed from the United States, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed without opinion. Salazar seeks review of the removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On 12 July 2003, Salazar\u2019s vehicle, with her driving, was stopped at a Border Patrol checkpoint; the vehicle contained two other individuals, a woman and child, who presented false documents and were determined to be Mexican citizens illegally smuggled into the United States. Salazar falsely told Border Patrol Agents that the child was her grandson. Instead, the child was not related to her but was the smuggled woman\u2019s child; Salazar knew both aliens were in the United States illegally; Salazar was driving the mother and child to the woman\u2019s husband and the child\u2019s father in Colorado; and Salazar was to receive $3000 for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Arresting Agent Justice completed a Form G-166 report, characterizing this as an alien-smuggling incident. Agent Ed-berg completed a Form 1-213 Record of Deportable Alien. This report outlined Salazar\u2019s conduct and recommended removal. The Agents testified at Salazar\u2019s hearing in support of removal and elaborated on the information provided in Forms G-166 and 1-213.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Agent Edberg testified that Salazar was charged and convicted under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 for making false statements (that the child was her grandson) to a federal officer. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offered the IJ a facsimile copy of this criminal conviction; the IJ refused the facsimile copy and continued the hearing, informing DHS that it needed to provide a certified copy. At the later hearing on 15 December 2003, after DHS explained it could not locate a certified copy of Salazar\u2019s conviction, the IJ proceeded but said he would not consider this conviction in making his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">At the 15 December hearing, the IJ found Salazar subject to removal based on her conduct of smuggling two aliens on 12 July 2003. Salazar appealed this decision to the BIA, which affirmed without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Salazar raises two issues: (1) whether substantial evidence supports her removal under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(E)(i); and (2) whether the IJ violated Salazar\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">We normally review only the BIA\u2019s decision, not that of the IJ. <em>Renteria-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>322 F.3d 804, 816 (5th Cir.2002). Where the BIA summarily affirms the IJ, however, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Moin v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 415, 418 (5th Cir.2003). We deny a petition for review \u201cif there is no error of law and if reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record, considered as a whole, supports the decision\u2019s factual findings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Salazar faces a difficult challenge, because \u201c[t]his court will not reverse a BIA decision unless the petitioner provides evidence \u2018so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could conclude against it\u2019 \u201d. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996)). Further, the IJ\u2019s witness credibility determinations are accorded \u201cgreat deference\u201d. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe factfinder has the duty to judge the credibility of the witnesses and to make findings accordingly.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">First, Salazar challenges the evidence used by the IJ to support his decision that Salazar was removable. Salazar asserts that inaccuracies in her Form I-213 constitute a violation of the DHS\u2019 own regulations to her detriment. According to Salazar, these inaccuracies make it unclear who arrested and interviewed her on 12 July 2003, and therefore this informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>tion should not be used in support of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">At Salazar\u2019s removal hearing, where Agents Justice and Edberg testified and were subject to cross-examination, Salazar received an opportunity to challenge their testimony and the forms they created under \u201c[njormal circumstances\u201d. The Agents explained how small inaccuracies may result because the forms are filled out from templates.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s decision; both Agents Justice and Edberg testified to Salazar\u2019s conduct on 12 July 2003 and the information contained in forms they created, and the IJ concluded that \u201cthe credible testimony presented by the agents here, as well as the reports created at the [time] of the incident ... are sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that [Salazar] was knowingly assisting two illegal aliens to enter or to try to enter the United States in violation of law\u201d. Salazar does not overcome this finding, see <em>Mom, </em>335 F.3d at 418, including the conclusion that the Agents provided credible testimony. <em>See Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Next, Salazar maintains that the IJ violated her Fifth Amendment due process rights. \u201cDue process challenges to deportation proceedings require an initial showing of substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Anwar v. INS, </em>116 F.3d 140, 144 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Salazar appears to challenge the IJ\u2019s decision to admit the Form 1-213 because it prejudiced her. Salazar fails to show <em>how </em>the admission of this form prejudiced her; absent such a showing, this claim fails. <em>Id.; see also Renteria-Gonzalez, </em>322 F.3d at 817 n. 16 (\u201cobserving] that [Form 1-213] come[s] within the public records exception to the hearsay rule\u201d, and also that \u201cthe hearsay rules [do not] apply to deportation proceedings in the first place\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">Salazar then challenges the IJ\u2019s use of a facsimile copy of her conviction for making false statements under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. She contends that this prejudiced her, because the IJ cannot disregard it after seeing a facsimile copy of the document. The IJ stated he was not using this document in making his decision, twice stating \u201cI\u2019m not going to consider the judgment\u201d. After announcing his decision, the IJ again stated that this conviction was \u201cnot ... considered in entering the decision by this Court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Without this judgment, the IJ had sufficient evidence of Salazar\u2019s unlawful conduct through the testimony and documents from the Agents. Further, a conviction of alien smuggling, and certainly a false-statement conviction, is <em>not </em>necessary for removal; \u201cthe INA requires only a <em>showing </em>of, not a <em>conviction </em>of ... alien smuggling activities\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 817 n. 15 (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(E)(i); <em>see id. </em>at 810 n. 4 (stating that \u201cSection 1227(a)(1)(E)(i)... does not requires [sic] a criminal conviction before an alien may be deported for alien smuggling\u201d). Salazar has not shown substantial prejudice leading to the IJ\u2019s decision, so she fails to assert a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">\n<em>DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
