Martinez contends that the district court\u2019s upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 was erroneous because his prior offenses were all used to determine his Criminal History Category, the risk of recidivism was not unusually high, and the district court failed to explain adequately the reasons for departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-19\">Martinez had an offense level of 13, a criminal history category of VI, and a guideline range of 33 to 41 months. The district court departed upward to an offense level of 17 and imposed a sentence of 63 months. The court explained that it was moving up four levels because of Martinez\u2019s long criminal history, because Martinez had been deported on three prior occasions, and because of the likelihood that he would recidivate. Guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude that there is no reversible error and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See United States v. Simkanin, </em>420 F.3d 397, 414-19 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 489-93 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 713,\u2014L.Ed.2d\u2014, 2005 WL 3027879 (Nov. 14, 2005) (No. 05-7063).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Martinez also contends that he is entitled to be resentenced because the district court sentenced him under a mandatory application of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, which is prohibited by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The parties agree that plain error is the proper standard of review in this case. Martinez does not attempt, however, to make the showing of plain error that is required by our precedent in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Moreover, this court has rejected his arguments that a <em>Booker </em>error is a structural error and that such errors are presumed to be prejudicial. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520-22; <em>see also United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Martinez also asserts that the felony and aggravated-felony provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Martinez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
