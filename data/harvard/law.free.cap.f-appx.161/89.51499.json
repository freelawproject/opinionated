We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The Government argues in its motion to dismiss that this Court cannot reach the merits of Aleksander and Elisabeta Poro\u2019s asylum claims, because the Court lacks jurisdiction to reassess the agency\u2019s findings as to the timeliness of Aleksander\u2019s application. The INA states, in pertinent part, that: \u201c[n]o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), concerning the timeliness of an alien\u2019s application for asylum, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). However, the REAL ID Act states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-9\">nothing in subparagraph (B) or (C), or in any other provision of this chapter (other than this section) which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The plain language of this provision allows this Court to review a determination by the agency concerning the timeliness of an alien\u2019s application for asylum if constitutional claims or questions of law are raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-12\">The IJ ruled that Aleksander had failed to provide credible testimony as to the reasons why his asylum application was late, and, as such, the IJ concluded that he had failed to establish that there were extraordinary or changed circumstances sufficient to excuse his failure to file within one year of arrival. Because these factual determinations did not involve a constitutional claim, nor a question of law, this Court lacks jurisdiction to reassess them, and the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition for review as to Aleksander and Elisabeta Poro\u2019s asylum claims is thus granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">The Government also argues that the Poros have not exhausted their withholding of removal or CAT claims, as they did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of these claims before the BIA. The Poros did not challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of their CAT claims, and they are thus barred from raising the issue on appeal to this Court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (discussing exhaustion requirement); <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam) (explaining that exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional). In their filings with the BIA, however, the Poros, have adequately preserved their withholding of removal claims. As such, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is not granted on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>terminations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">This Court has jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s credibility determination inasmuch as it was the basis upon which Enkela Poro\u2019s derivative asylum claim was denied. This Court also has jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s credibility determination as it was the basis for the denial of the Poros\u2019 withholding of removal claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The IJ\u2019s finding that the medical report dated October 5, 2000 was contrary to Aleksander Poro\u2019s testimony as to the events was a \u201cspecific, cogent reason\u201d weighing against his credibility. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307. Aleksander testified that he did not go to the hospital until October 7, 2000, and the medical report is dated October 5, 2000. Additionally, the reasons Aleksander offered for this discrepancy do not explain it. This discrepancy thus \u201cbear[s] a legitimate nexus\u201d to the IJ\u2019s finding, as it concerns details surrounding one of the major events upon which Aleksander premised his claim, the October 2000 detention and beating that he allegedly suffered because of his political affiliation. <em>See id. </em>As such, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination on this basis is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The IJ\u2019s decision that Aleksander\u2019s testimony had \u201cgeneralities and vagueness regarding some specific aspects of the claim\u201d is also supported by substantial evidence. This Court has noted that an applicant\u2019s testimony at a hearing is \u201ctoo vague\u201d if it does not identify facts corresponding to each of the elements of one of the \u201crefugee\u201d categories of the immigration statutes, as interpreted by the BIA and the federal courts. <em>See Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 151 (2d Cir.2003) (discussing <em>Guan Shan Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61 (2d Cir.2002)). Three instances of vagueness that the IJ noted were that Aleksander: (1) did not know who the individuals were who had attacked him in August 1999; (2) gave only a generalized recount, without offering evidence of political animus, as to his October 2000 detention; and (3) gave no information regarding who was behind the alleged shooting at his shop. As such, by not offering concrete facts to demonstrate that any of these events were motivated by his political affiliation, Aleksander was vague as to how he had suffered past persecution on account of political opinion, or how it is more likely than not that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d because of his political opinion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The additional reasons the IJ noted for his adverse credibility decision were that: (1) others who were politically active in the Democratic Party could \u201clive and work and operate freely without harm,\u201d and (2) Elisabeta testified that neither she nor Aleksander were members of the Youth Orthodox Alliance, in contradiction to documentary evidence and her husband\u2019s testimony. Aleksander was questioned and confirmed that, to his knowledge, the leader of a local chapter of the Democratic Party was not subject to attacks based on his role, and, as such, the IJ\u2019s conclusion was not mere \u201cspeculation.\u201d <em>See SecaidaRosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307, 312. In addition, since this apparent disparity in treatment of the two men could call into question whether Mr. Poro had actually suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>from attacks on the basis of his political opinion, it cannot be said that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 73 n. 7 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">As the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was based on substantial evidence, the IJ properly denied Enkela Poro\u2019s asylum claim. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was also a proper ground upon which to deny the Poros\u2019 withholding of removal claims, as that relief requires a higher burden of proof. The petition for review is DENIED. The Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted as to Aleksander and Elisabeta\u2019s asylum claims, and as to all of the Poros\u2019 CAT claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
