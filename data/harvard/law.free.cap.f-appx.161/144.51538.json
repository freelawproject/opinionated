(\u201cPitney\u201d) as to Bayonne\u2019s claims for relief under ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) and 502(a)(8). The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Pitney as to the first claim after determining that Pitney did not abuse its discretion in denying Bayonne long term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) benefits. Because the court found that denial was not wrongful, it also rejected plaintiffs second claim that Pitney breached its fiduciary duty by denying benefits and thus violated \u00a7 502(a)(3). Bayonne appeals this decision. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Trans Sport, Inc. v. Starter Sportswear, Inc., </em>964 F.2d 186, 188 (2d Cir.1992). In determining whether to grant summary judgment under Fed R. Civ. P. 56, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we draw all reasonable inferences in her favor. <em>Id.; Del. &amp; Hudson Ry. Co. v. Consol. Rail Corp., </em>902 F.2d 174, 177 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-18\">ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), enables a plan participant to bring suit for the recovery of benefits due her under the terms of the plan. ERISA does not set out standards of review for actions challenging eligibility determinations, so courts have created standards. <em>Zuckerbrod v. Phoenix Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>78 F.3d 46, 49 (2d Cir.1996). \"Where a plan gives its administrator broad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>discretion to determine whether a plan holder is entitled to payment of benefits, as is clearly the situation with the instant case, a court may reverse the <em>administrator\u2019s </em>decision only if it is arbitrary or capricious. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo, </em>however, a <em>district court\u2019s </em>decision that a plan administrator has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously in denying benefits. <em>Id. </em>A denial of a claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), is arbitrary and capricious if the decision is unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence such that it constitutes a clear error of judgment. <em>Zuckerbrod, </em>78 F.3d at 49. Substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">This evidence may include medical documentation. <em>See Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, </em>538 U.S. 822, 833, 123 S.Ct. 1965, 155 L.Ed.2d 1034 (2003). In evaluating this evidence, plan administrators need not accord special weight to the plan participant\u2019s treating physicians. <em>Id. </em>at 834, 123 S.Ct. 1965. Of course, they may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant\u2019s reliable evidence, which may include opinions from treating physicians, but this need not carry any special weight relative to the opinions of other doctors. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, courts may not impose on plan administrators the burden of explaining their reasons for crediting reliable evidence that happens to conflict with evidence that the claimant has submitted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">On <em>de novo </em>review, we conclude that the plan administrator did not act arbitrarily or capriciously. The administrative record contains sufficient evidence to support the administrator\u2019s conclusion that Bayonne is not \u201ctotally disabled\u201d within the Plan\u2019s definition of the term because she was capable of performing her tasks as a cashier. This is true even assuming that she had actually experienced all of the symptoms that she reported. Therefore, the decision to deny benefits is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In her brief, Bayonne also challenges the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of Pitney for her ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) claim. <em>See </em>Bayonne\u2019s br. at 43. Although Bayonne seemingly conceded this claim during oral argument, we will address it in the interest of completeness. ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3), empowers a plan participant to bring suit <em>to enjoin </em>any act or practice that violates provisions of this sub-chapter or the terms of the plan. Alternatively, a participant may obtain other appropriate equitable relief to redress such violations or to enforce any provisions of this sub-chapter. <em>Id. </em>Section 502(a)(3) acts as a safety net. <em>See Devlin v. Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>274 F.3d 76, 89 (2d Cir.2001). It is possible, however, that a claimant could seek relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3) even though she could also seek relief under a different ERISA provision. <em>Id. </em>Although this is not normally appropriate, a court may determine, in its discretion, that other appropriate equitable remedy is necessary despite that a claimant has already received some remedy under a different ERISA section. <em>Id. </em>In this instance \u2014 or if a plan participant has no remedy under another ERISA section\u2014 equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3) is a viable possibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Bayonne alleges a claim under this section for breach of fiduciary duties stemming from Pitney\u2019s alleged procedural violations. Specifically, Bayonne first contends that Pitney failed to afford her a full and fair review of her LTD claim by failing to give her notice of the grounds for denying her claim. Bayonne correctly notes that the purpose behind this notice requirement is to ensure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>claimant\u2019s have enough information so that they may adequately prepare for their appeal. <em>Juliano v. Health Maint. Org., 221 </em>F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000). Secondly, Bayonne claims that in committing procedural violations, Pitney violated its fiduciary duties by failing to discharge its duties with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence that ERISA requires. Bayonne is again correct that ERISA fiduciaries possess these duties. <em>Donovan v. Bierwirth, </em>680 F.2d 263, 271 (2d Cir.1982). Fiduciaries also have a duty not to make misrepresentations or omissions. <em>See Pocchia v. NYNEX Corp., </em>81 F.3d 275, 279 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Bayonne\u2019s claim for equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3) must fail. First, it is unlikely that Pitney committed any procedural notice violations that would properly support this claim. Upon review of Bayonne\u2019s remaining contentions, we find no violation of Pitney\u2019s obligations under the Plan sufficient to support Bayonne\u2019s claim for equitable relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
