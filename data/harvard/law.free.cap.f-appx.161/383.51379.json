We affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it vacated Bowens\u2019s sentence and remanded to this Court for further consideration in light of that decision. We requested and received supplemental letter briefs addressing the impact of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">As Bowens preserved his <em>Booker </em>issue at the district court, we review for harmless error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under harmless error review, the burden is on the government to point to evidence that would prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the district court would not have sentenced the defendant differently.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> *We have noted that this is an \u201carduous burden\u201d and that this Court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate and remand\u201d when <em>Booker </em>error has been preserved.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Here, the government cannot meet that burden. The government cannot point to anything in the record suggesting that the judge would have imposed the same sentence upon Bowen absent the mandatory guidelines.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">Accordingly, we REMAND to the district court to allow the district court to resentence Bowens if, in its discretion under the now-advisory Guidelines, it chooses to do so.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
