The indictment did not allege that Rodriguez-Gonzalez\u2019s deportation was subsequent to a felony or aggravated-felony conviction, and it did not specifically cite to any subsection of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. In pertinent part, the sentencing guideline base offense level was increased twelve levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) because Rodriguez-Gonzalez was previously deported after a conviction for a felony drug-trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was 13 months or less. Rodriguez-Gonzalez objected to this increase on the basis of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531,159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">Rodriguez-Gonzalez argues that because the indictment did not allege a prior conviction, it charged only a violation of \u00a7 1326(a) and under <em>Apprendi </em>his sentence violated due process because it exceeded the two-year maximum punishment for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense charged. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 239-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodriguez-Gonzalez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Rodriguez-Gonzalez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Rodriguez-Gonzalez also argues that the district court committed reversible error when it sentenced him pursuant to the mandatory sentencing guidelines system held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. </em>220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because the district court sentenced Rodriguez-Gonzalez under a mandatory guidelines regime, it committed Fanfan error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 267,163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005)(discussing the difference between Sixth Amendment <em>Booker </em>error and Fanfan error). \u201c[I]f either the Sixth Amendment issue presented in <em>Booker </em>or the issue presented in Fanfan is preserved in the district court by an objection, we will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 284-85 (5th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The Government concedes that Rodriguez-Gonzalez\u2019s objection on the basis of <em>Blakely, </em>was sufficient to preserve his Fanfan claim and that it cannot show that the error was harmless. The sentencing transcript supports the Government\u2019s concession. Accordingly, we VACATE Rodriguez-Gonzalez\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for re-sentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
