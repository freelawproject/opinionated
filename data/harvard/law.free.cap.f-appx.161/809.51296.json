We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">A. <em>Motions for Default Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Abele asserts the district court erred in denying his motions for default judgment against Hernando County, contending Hernando County failed to timely file an answer to the complaint. <em>\u201cWe </em>review the denial of a motion for default judgment for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., </em>294 F.3d 1309, 1316 (11th Cir.2002). \u2018When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party\u2019s default.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(a). \u201cEntry of judgment by default is a drastic remedy which should be used only in extreme situations\u201d or \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>294 F.3d at 1316-17. We have held \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justifying entry of default judgment were not present where (1) the appellant failed to show the delay for failure to prosecute prejudiced him in any way, (2) the defendants answered the complaint within a short time after it was due, and (3) the claims against most of the defendants were facially invalid. <em>Wahl v. McIver, </em>773 F.2d 1169, 1174 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">Hernando County concedes it did not timely file an answer to Abele\u2019s complaint. However, exceptional circumstances justifying entry of a default judgment are not present. First, Abele failed to show the delay for failure to prosecute prejudiced him in any way. Next, Hernando County answered the complaint within a short time after it was due.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Last, as discussed below, Abele\u2019s federal claims against Hernando County are without merit. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>exceptional circumstances justifying entry of a default judgment are not present, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Abele\u2019s motions for default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">B. <em>Dismissal of Complaint as to Aliff and Tolbert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Next, Abele contends the district court erred in dismissing without prejudice Abele\u2019s complaint as to Aliff and Tolbert based on Abele\u2019s failure to timely serve process on those defendants. Abele contends the clerk of the court wasted 10 days issuing the summonses, leaving only 24 hours to effect service. Abele also contends Aliff and Tolbert purposely made themselves unavailable for service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to timely serve the summons and complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Brown v. Nichols, </em>8 F.3d 770, 775 (11th Cir.1993) (holding such in the context of former Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j), which was replaced by current Rule 4(m)). Rule 4(m) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\u201c[Cjourts have found \u2018good cause\u2019 under Rule 4[m] only when some outside factor such as reliance on faulty advice, rather than inadvertence or negligence, prevented service.\u201d <em>Prisco v. Frank, </em>929 F.2d 603, 604 (11th Cir.1991) (discussing \u201cgood cause\u201d under former Rule 4(j)), <em>superseded in part by rule as stated in Horenkamp v. Van Winkle and Company, Inc., </em>402 F.3d 1129, 1132 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Recently, we held current Rule 4(m), as amended in 1993, grants discretion to the district court to extend the time for service of process even in the absence of a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Horenkamp, </em>402 F.3d at 1132 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Horenkamp, </em>we identified as examples of when relief may be justified in the absence of good cause as \u201cif the applicable statute of limitations would bar the refiled action, or if the defendant is evading service or conceals a defect in attempted service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m), Advisory Committee Note, 1993 Amendments).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Abele\u2019s complaint without prejudice as to Aliff and Tolbert for failure to comply with Rule 4(m). On July 9, 2004, the district court granted an oral motion by Abele to have additional time to serve these defendants. Pursuant to the order, Abele had until July 22, 2004 to perfect service on Aliff and Tolbert (a total of 148 days from the date Abele filed the original complaint). On July 23, 2004, Abele moved for another extension of time to perfect service, conceding he had not perfected service by July 22, 2004. Therefore, Abele failed to comply with the time requirements set forth in Rule 4(m), as extended by the district court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(m).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">Abele failed to show good cause for the delay. Abele advanced as a reason for the delay the fact the clerk of the court failed to stamp the summonses until Abele called her 10 days after he mailed the summonses to the clerk, and the sheriffs office was unable to effect personal service on Aliff and Tolbert between July 21, 2004 (the date the office received the summonses from Abele) and July 22, 2004 (the date by which Abele was to have served process on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Aliff and Tolbert). However, Abele also concedes he did not mail the original summonses for Aliff and Tolbert to the clerk of the court until July 9, 2004, nearly seven months after the complaint was filed. The delay in service of process, then, is not the fault of some outside factor, such as rebanee of faulty advice; rather, as Abele was provided 148 days to perfect service, the reason sounds more in negligence. Furthermore, although the district court had discretion to grant Abele a second extension of time to complete service, even in the absence of \u201cgood cause,\u201d Abele failed to cite to evidence to support his argument that Aliff or Tolbert were evading service. <em>See Horenkamp, </em>402 F.3d at 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">C. <em>Mediation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Next, Abele asserts the district court erred in compelling mediation and denying Abele\u2019s request for a non-lawyer mediator. Abele contends he knew the mediation would be an \u201cact of futility\u201d and the mediation resulted in an additional $750 in expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We review a district court\u2019s order overruling a party\u2019s objections to mediation for abuse of discretion. <em>See Bouchard Transp. Co. v. Fla. Dept. of Envtl. Prot., </em>91 F.3d 1445, 1448 (11th Cir.1996) (holding an order of mediation involves the district court\u2019s supervision of litigation). A federal district court may take appropriate action with respect to settlement and the use of special procedures to assist in resolving a dispute when authorized by statute or local rule. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(c)(9). The local rules for the Middle District of Florida provide that, upon order by the presiding judge, any civil action may be referred by the court to a mediation conference, with certain exceptions that do not apply here. M.D. Fla. R. 9.03(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Because the district court was authorized by local rule to refer this civil action to mediation, the court did not abuse its discretion in compelling mediation. Moreover, the record reflects the costs of the court-appointed mediator, to be shared equally by the parties, were not shown by Abele to be unreasonable. Therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Abele\u2019s request for a non-lawyer mediator.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">D. <em>Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Last, Abele contends the district court erred in granting Hernando County\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Abele\u2019s federal claims, contending without support there are material issues of fact with respect to each of his claims. As an initial matter, we conclude Abele is appealing only the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment as to Abele\u2019s federal claims. The district court construed the complaint as alleging federal claims under RICO, the Contracts Clause, and the Due Process Clause. The district court further construed the due process claims as (1) a substantive due process challenge to the county building codes, (2) a substantive due process claim of interference with Abele\u2019s property rights, and (3) a procedural due process claim of interference with Abele\u2019s property rights. As Abele does not challenge these characterizations of his claims on appeal, any other federal claims are deemed abandoned. <em>See Lambrix v. Singletary, </em>72 F.3d 1500, 1506 n. 11 (11th Cir.1996). Moreover, Abele\u2019s appellate briefs do not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that Abele\u2019s sole claim against Michael Anzalone, a named defendant, consisted of a state law breach of contract claim or the court\u2019s decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over any state law claims. Therefore, any claim against Anzalone and any challenge to the court\u2019s decision with respect to the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>law claims are also deemed abandoned. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.\u201d <em>Perrino v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>209 F.3d 1309, 1314-15 (11th Cir.2000). Summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">1. <em>RICO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">\u201cThe four elements of civil RICO liability are (1) conduct (2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>Langford v. Rite Aid of Ala., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 1308, 1311 (11th Cir.2000). Congress has defined \u201cracketeering activity\u201d as including any act which is indictable under a lengthy list of criminal offenses. 18 U.S.C.1961(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">Abele has failed to identify any conduct constituting racketeering activity. Nor has Abele otherwise adduced any evidence showing Hernando County engaged in a pattern of racketeering. Therefore, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hernando County as to Abele\u2019s RICO claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">2. <em>Contracts Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Article I, \u00a7 10 of the Constitution provides: \u201cNo State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.\u201d When analyzing a claim under the Contracts Clause, courts \u201cfirst ask whether the change in state law has operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Romein, </em>503 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 1109, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1992) (quotations and citation omitted). \u201cThis inquiry has three components: whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the contract at issue must be in existence prior to the passing of the challenged law.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-14\">Abele has not adduced any evidence showing Hernando County, or the state, passed any law interfering with a contract Abele had in existence before the law passed. As such, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hernando County as to Abele\u2019s Contracts Clause claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-15\">3. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides \u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1. We have explained the Supreme Court has interpreted this clause to provide for two different kinds of constitutional protection: substantive due process and procedural due process. <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1555 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">a. <em>Substantive Due </em>Process\u2014 <em>Legislative Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">Because the building code ordinances challenged by Abele neither target a protected class nor implicate fundamental rights, we apply the highly deferential rational basis test to this substantive due process challenge to a legislative act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>Schwarz v. Kogan, </em>132 F.3d 1387, 1390 (11th Cir.1998) (holding substantive due process challenges not impheating fundamental rights are reviewed under the highly deferential rational basis standard). \u201cIn order to survive this minimal scrutiny, the challenged provision need only be rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1390-91. Under rational basis review, we first identify \u201ca legitimate government purpose ... which the enacting government body <em>could </em>have been pursuing.\u201d <em>Bannum, Inc. v. City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, </em>157 F.3d 819, 822 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis in original). Second, we determine \u201cwhether a rational basis exists for the enacting government body to believe the legislation would further the hypothesized purpose.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hernando County as to Abele\u2019s substantive due process challenge to the budding code ordinances enacted by Hernando County. In enacting the building code ordinances, Hernando County could have been pursuing the legitimate government purpose advanced by Hernando County, providing for the safety and health of the residents of Hernando County. <em>See id. </em>at 823 (holding public safety is a legitimate goal for the purpose of rational basis review). As the building code ordinances provide standards to ensure the structural, electrical, and plumbing integrity of residential structures, a rational basis exists for Hernando County to believe the ordinances further this legitimate government purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">b. <em>Substantive Due </em>Process\u2014 <em>Non-legislative Acts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">In addressing a substantive due process challenge to a non-legislative act, such as the alleged interference by Hernando County with Abele\u2019s property rights, a plaintiff must identify a right that is \u201cfundamental,\u201d that is, a right that is \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556 (quotations omitted). \u201c[Ajreas in which substantive rights are created only by state law ... are not subject to substantive due process protection under the Due Process Clause [as applied to non-legislative acts,] because substantive due process rights are created only by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citation omitted). Property rights are state common law rights and are not equivalent to fundamental rights. <em>DeKalb Stone, Inc. v. County of DeKalb, Georgia, </em>106 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir.1997). Non-legislative deprivations of state-created property rights, including land-use rights, \u201ccannot support a substantive due process claim, not even if the plaintiff alleges that the government acted arbitrar[il]y and irrationally.\u201d <em>Greenbriar Village, L.L.C. v. Mountain Brook, City, </em>345 F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Abele fails to state a substantive due process claim with respect to Hernando County\u2019s alleged interference with his property rights, including removing electrical meters, destroying a boat, fading to issue an occupancy permit, and razing a structure. The property rights at issue are state-created rights. Non-legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>deprivations of such rights cannot support a substantive due process claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hernando County as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">c. <em>Procedural Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires a private citizen be given notice and opportunity to be heard before a governmental official seizes his property. <em>Quik Cash Pawn &amp; Jewelry, Inc. v. Sheriff of Broward County, </em>279 F.3d 1316, 1322 (11th Cir.2002). In analyzing such a claim, we examine whether (1) the plaintiff had a property interest of which he was deprived by state action, and (2) the plaintiff received sufficient process regarding that deprivation. <em>Ross v. Clayton County, Ga., </em>173 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.1999). With respect to the second prong of this examination, we must examine the adequacy of all remedies available to the plaintiff in order to ascertain whether these remedies are so inadequate as to violate clearly established law. <em>Bussinger v. City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida, </em>50 F.3d 922, 926 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">There were adequate state remedies available to Abele with respect to each of the alleged property deprivations. First, Hernando County provided evidence showing each of the alleged property deprivations were effected (1) after field inspectors found violations of the building code ordinance and provided notice of the violations to the respective owners of the property or (2) pursuant to a court order. Next, Abele could have challenged the findings of the Hernando County field inspectors, acting under the auspices of the building code ordinances, by filing an appeal with the Hernando County Board of Adjustments and Appeals. <em>See </em>Chapter 4 of Hernando County Standard Building Abatement Code; Hernando County Ordinance No. 2001-22, \u00a7 108. The decision of the Hernando County Board of Adjustment and Appeals could have been appealed to the state\u2019s circuit court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26.012(1), Fla. Stat. Last, regarding Hernando County\u2019s destruction of Abele\u2019s boat, a state circuit court issued an order allowing Hernando County to destroy the boat. Abele could have appealed that decision to a higher state court. Because there were adequate state remedies available to Abele with respect to each of the alleged property deprivations, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Hernando County as to Abele\u2019s procedural due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in (1) denying Abele\u2019s motions for default judgment against Hernando County, (2) dismissing Abele\u2019s complaint without prejudice as to Aliff and Tolbert, and (3) compelling mediation or denying Abele\u2019s request for a non-lawyer mediator. Additionally, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Hernando County.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\">. Abele filed his complaint on February 25, 2004. Service of process was executed as to Hernando County on February 27, 2004, and Hernando County\u2019s answer was due on March 18, 2004. Hernando County filed an answer on April 2, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-10\">. When addressing a substantive due process claim, it is crucial to note the distinction between \"legislative\u201d acts and \u201cnon-legislative\u201d or \u201cexecutive\u201d acts. <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1557 n. 9. \"Executive acts\u201d characteristically apply to a limited number of persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>(and often to only one person) and typically arise from the ministerial or administrative activities of members of the executive branch. <em>Id. </em>Legislative acts, on the other hand, generally apply to a larger segment of society; laws and broad-ranging executive regulations are the most common examples. <em>Id. </em>The substantive due process analysis differs depending on which type of act is involved. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Abele\u2019s challenge to the building code ordinances themselves constitutes a challenge to a legislative act, while Abele\u2019s challenge to the administrative application of the building code ordinances <em>(e.g., </em>razing the house, removing electrical meters, etc.) constitutes a challenge to executive or non-legislative acts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. To the extent Abele\u2019s complaint could be construed as alleging a substantive due process claim concerning a violation of the Takings Clause, the district court failed to construe the complaint as alleging such, and Abele fails to appeal this characterization. Therefore, any such claim is deemed abandoned. <em>See Lambrix, </em>72 F.3d at 1506 n. 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
