Torres argues that the district court failed to articulate whether it considered the policy statement\u2019s advisory range of imprisonment before it sentenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>him to the 24-month statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Torres concedes that our review is for plain error because he did not raise this claim in the district court. <em>See United States v. Montez, </em>952 F.2d 854, 860 (5th Cir.1992). The district court was advised of the advisory range through the probation officer\u2019s Violation Conduct Computation form. Even if the district court failed to consider this information, which the record does not suggest, Torres has nevertheless failed to show that the purported error affected his substantial rights inasmuch as the district court retained discretion and detailed his rationale for imposing the 24-month sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3); <em>Ayers, </em>946 F.2d at 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
