Valiente-Gallardo asserts the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by (1) finding him to be an aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>vated felon pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), and increasing his statutory maximum sentence from 2 years to 20 years; (2) applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), based on his prior conviction for a crime of violence; and (3) sentencing him based upon a criminal history category of IV. Specifically, Valiente-Gallardo contends his Fifth Amendment rights were violated because his prior convictions were not included in the indictment, and his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his prior convictions were not proven beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by him. The district court did not err, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We review a defendant\u2019s preserved constitutional challenges to his sentence de novo but will reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Sentences imposed after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), are reviewed for reasonableness.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">\u201cIn <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>[523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) ] the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). We have recently clarified the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>we held a district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) based on prior convictions did not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. 410 F.3d 1307, 1316 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,\u2014 </em>U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). Recently, we reaffirmed <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law after <em>Booker, </em>holding \u201cbecause the prior-conviction exception remains undisturbed after <em>Booker, </em>a district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United State v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 223, 163 L.Ed.2d 191 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-14\">As for Valiente-Gallardo\u2019s Fifth Amendment claims, based upon the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the indictment need not include prior convictions in order for the district court to use those convictions for sentencing purposes. <em>See Marseille, </em>377 F.3d at 1257. Accordingly, Valiente-Gallardo\u2019s Fifth Amendment claims fail. As for Valiente-Gallardo\u2019s Sixth Amendment claims, the district court did not violate his Sixth Amendment rights in light of <em>Booker </em>because the court applied the Guidelines as advisory. 125 S.Ct. at 749-56. Furthermore, even if the district court had applied the Guidelines as mandatory, prior convictions need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to be used for sentencing purposes, and Valiente-Gallardo\u2019s criminal history category and the imposition of a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) did not implicate <em>Booker </em>because they merely involved a determination that Valiente-Gallardo had prior convictions. <em>See Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1315-16; <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962. Thus, Val<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>iente-Gallardo\u2019s Sixth Amendment claims also fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">. Valiente-Gallardo does not challenge the reasonableness of his sentence. Thus, we will only consider his Fifth and Sixth Amendment challenges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
