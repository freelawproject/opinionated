Irwina contends that the Board and Immigration Judge erred in finding her ineligible for withholding of removal and relief pursuant to CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-21\">\u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). To qualify for protection under the Convention Against Torture, a petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2005). Having conducted our review, we conclude that substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>evidence supports the finding that Irwina failed to meet these standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
