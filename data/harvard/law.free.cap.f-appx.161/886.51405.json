Bullard appeal <em>pro se </em>an order awarding attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $4000 as a sanction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees in that amount, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">On September 13, 2004, the Bullards filed <em>pro se </em>a suit against several <em>Georgia </em>state court judges. The complaint alleged the judges violated the Bullards\u2019 civil rights when adjudicating a civil suit successfully brought by the Bullards against their neighbors for trespass. The judges moved to dismiss based on absolute immunity and to impose sanctions against the Bullards under Rule 11(c). The Bullards acknowledged that \u201c[t]he doctrine of judicial immunity is clear and well-entrenched,\u201d but they baldly asserted they made a good-faith argument for the modification of the law. The district court granted the motion to dismiss and ordered the Bullards to pay the defendants\u2019 attorney\u2019s fees, because the Bullards \u201cknew or should have known at the time of filing the Complaint that there existed no grounds for relief based on their claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">The defendants submitted affidavits that requested attorney\u2019s fees and expenses in the amount of $10,428. In response, the Bullards submitted affidavits that evidenced Mr. Bullard had a monthly income of $6,358.69 and monthly expenses exceeding that amount by approximately $600. Mr. Bullard also provided evidence that his income was only guaranteed during the 9-month academic year, but that he received additional income from speaking engagements. Mr. Bullard disclosed assets including two residences, a checking account and a retirement account with unspecified balances, and a savings account with a $1000 balance. The district court found that the Bullards \u201chave the capacity to pay $4,000 of the fees and expenses incurred by [the defendants]\u201d and concluded that \u201csanctions in that amount are appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">The Bullards challenge the order imposing sanctions and the amount of attorney\u2019s fees awarded by the district court. This Court reviews an award of attorney\u2019s fees for abuse of discretion. <em>ACLU v. Barnes, </em>168 F.3d 423, 427 (11th Cir.1999). Rule 11 requires \u201can attorney or unrepresented party\u201d who files \u201ca pleading, written motion, or other paper\u201d to certify that the filing is \u201cnot being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation\u201d and \u201cthe claims, defenses, and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(b). When a court determines that Rule 11(b) has been violated, the court has discretion to \u201cimpose an appropriate sanction upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties\u201d and may \u201caward to the party prevailing on the motion the reasonable expenses and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in presenting or opposing the motion.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 11(c). In determining the amount of attorney\u2019s fees to award to the opposing party as part of Rule 11 sanctions, the district court must consider the ability to pay of the party subject to sanctions. <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1099 n. 53 (11th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Baker v. Alderman, </em>158 F.3d 516, 528 (11th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>The district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing sanctions against the Bullards. The Bullards concede that their complaint was barred by the \u201cclear and well-entrenched\u201d doctrine of judicial immunity. Mrs. Bullard practiced law for fifteen years and taught law for three years as an assistant law professor, and Mr. Bullard is a well-educated sociologist who has published at least fourteen books in his field. Their complaint was patently frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The Bullards argue that the district court failed to consider their \u201cinability to pay any amount towards [the defendants\u2019] attorney[\u2019s] fees.\u201d We disagree. The district court considered Mr. Bullard\u2019s affidavit, which described his assets, including several bank accounts and two houses, and the court reasonably found that the Bullards had the ability to pay $4000. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
