Anderson was convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000) for conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>No drug quantity was charged in the indictment and the jury made no specific findings as to drug quantity. Based upon the evidence presented at trial, at sentencing the district court found that Anderson was responsible for 1176.525 grams of crack cocaine and 1056.7 grams of cocaine powder, yielding a base offense level of 36. Combined with Anderson\u2019s criminal history category of IV, his sentencing range under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines was 262 to 327 months in prison. Initially, however, the district court sentenced Anderson to life in prison pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000), based on Anderson\u2019s 1984 and 1996 felony drug convictions. In Anderson\u2019s first appeal, this court affirmed his conviction, but vacated Anderson\u2019s sentence and remanded for re-sentencing because we concluded that Anderson\u2019s 1996 felony drug conviction violated the prohibition against double jeopardy and therefore could not be used to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Upon resentencing, the parties conceded that because drug quantity had not been alleged in Anderson\u2019s indictment or presented to the jury, his sentence could not be enhanced based on drug quantity. Consequently, Anderson\u2019s statutory penalty was governed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (2000). The government sought to enhance Anderson\u2019s sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000), based on the 1984 felony drug conviction. However, the district court concluded that under the newly decided <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Anderson\u2019s sentence could not be enhanced based on the prior conviction. Therefore, the court sentenced him below the guideline range to twenty years in prison, the statutory maximum without enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The government appealed and Anderson filed a cross-appeal. We agreed with the government that <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), that prior felony convictions that trigger enhanced sentences are sentencing enhancements rather than elements of the offense. Therefore, we concluded that Anderson\u2019s maximum statutory penalty was thirty years under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C)\u2014not twenty years as the district court concluded. Rejecting the claims raised in Anderson\u2019s cross-appeal, we vacated Anderson\u2019s sentence and remanded the case for a second time for resentencing within the thirty-year statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Based on the previously calculated guideline range, upon remand the district court sentenced Anderson to 262 months in prison, the bottom of the guideline range. Anderson once again appealed. Initially, counsel filed an Anders<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> brief, stating that, in his opinion there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but arguing that this court\u2019s second remand was a general remand, thereby enabling Anderson to challenge his sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 and to revisit the issue of drug quantity. However, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequently issued decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), counsel filed a supplemental brief asserting that Anderson\u2019s sentence violated the Sixth Amendment. Anderson filed a pro se supplemental brief asserting a <em>Booker </em>claim and other sentencing issues. The government also filed a brief conceding that, in light of <em>Booker, </em>Anderson\u2019s sentence must be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Anderson preserved his Sixth Amendment objection by asserting it in the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>trict court. Accordingly, we review this claim de novo and \u201cmust reverse unless we find this constitutional error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt with the Government bearing the burden of proving harmlessness.\u201d Uni<em>ted States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the federal Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 mandatory scheme, which provides for sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court, violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court remedied the constitutional violation by making the guidelines advisory through the removal of two statutory provisions that had rendered them mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 746 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court); <em>id. </em>at 756-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Anderson argues that the district court erred by attributing to him for sentencing purposes 1176.525 grams of cocaine base and 1056.7 grams of powder cocaine. The government concedes <em>Booker </em>error and we find that, in the absence of jury findings on specific drug quantities, the government cannot demonstrate that any error in calculating Anderson\u2019s sentence was harmless.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">For these reasons, we vacate Anderson\u2019s sentence and remand for proceedings consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for the determination. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the non-guidelines sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">We deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-5\">. <em>Anders v.

As stated earlier, Anderson seeks to assert other claims on appeal. However, consideration of these claims is foreclosed by the mandate rule. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66 (4th Cir. 1993) (stating doctrine compels compliance on remand with dictates of a superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or implicitly decided by appellate court). In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no other meritorious issues for appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
