He contends that the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) wrongfully found him statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Reviewing the record <em>de novo </em>and giving deference to the BIA\u2019s permissible interpretations, <em>see INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999), we affirm for the following reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-24\">1. Former \u00a7 212(c) limits eligibility for discretionary relief to \u201caliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c). Where permanent residency status is obtained by false pretenses the \u201clegally admitted for permanent resident\u201d requirement of former \u00a7 212(c) is not met. See, <em>e.g., Matter of Longstaff, </em>716 F.2d 1439, 1441 (5th Cir.1983) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>that \u201c[a]dmission is not lawful if it is regular only in form. The term \u2018lawfully\u2019 denotes compliance with substantive legal requirements, not mere procedural regularity.\u201d); <em>Rodriguez v. Ashcroft, </em>58 Fed.Appx. 596, 2003 WL 261829 (5th Cir. Jan.20, 2003); <em>see also Monet v. INS, </em>791 F.2d 752, 753-54 (9th Cir.1986) (citing <em>Longstaff </em>and finding that Monett was never \u201clawfully admitted for permanent residence\u201d and thus failed to meet the requirement of \u00a7 212(c) because he concealed his drug trafficking conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">2. The undisputed facts are that Osilaja was admitted in 1988 for <em>temporary </em>residence, not permanent residence as he asserts. In 1992 Osilaja applied for and obtained permanent residency status. However, Osilija obtained this status by concealing his 1990 narcotics convictions. Thus, because the 1992 grant of permanent residency was based on fraud, it fails to satisfy the \u201clawfully admitted for permanent resident\u201d requirement of former \u00a7 212(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">3. Because Osilaja fails to meet the eligibility requirements for relief under the former \u00a7 212(c), the BIA was not in error in denying Osilaja the relief he requested and, consequently, the petition for review is</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-17\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b387-18\">. We note that Osilaja originally sought review of the BIA order in the district court in a habeas action. However, during the pendency of the appeal from the district court Congress passed the REAL ID Act, effective March 11, 2005, which abolished habeas jurisdiction in certain circumstances (including those presented here)and provided jurisdiction for review in the Circuit Courts. Consequently, under <em>Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>\"habeas petitions on appeal as of May 11, 2005, such as [Osilaja's], are properly converted into petitions for review.\u201d 426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005). Thus we treat Osilaja\u2019s appeal as a timely petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
