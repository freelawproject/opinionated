He contends that his offense is not one of the offenses qualifying an offender for DNA collection under the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000(Act). He further contends that a 2004 amendment to the Act broadening the qualifying offenses to \u201cany felony\u201d does not apply to him because he committed the offense before the amendment was enacted, and, therefore, application of the amendment either would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause or would improperly cause the amendment to operate retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-22\">Quevedo contends that a waiver-of appeal provision included in his plea agreement does not bar this claim. Because the district court erroneously advised Quevedo that he retained the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>appeal \u201can illegal sentence,\u201d without defining what constituted \u201can illegal sentence,\u201d the waiver was not made knowingly and voluntarily, and thus it does not bar this claim. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517 (5th Cir.1999). However, this claim is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction because it is not ripe for review. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1102 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Quevedo\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Quevedo contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Quevedo properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
