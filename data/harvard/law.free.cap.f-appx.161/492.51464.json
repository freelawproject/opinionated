BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Appellant John Spirko, a convicted murderer, appeals the district court\u2019s orders denying him relief from that court\u2019s judgment dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Spirko v. Anderson, </em>No. S:95CV7209, 2000 WL 1278383 (N.D.Ohio July 11, 2000), <em>aff'd sub nom. Spirko v. Mitchell, </em>368 F.3d 603 (6th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Spirko v. Bradshaw,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 1699, 161 L.Ed.2d 525 (2005). Spirko\u2019s basic contention is that, for various reasons, the judgment dismissing his habeas petition should be vacated due to fraud on the federal habeas court. The district court rejected Spirko\u2019s claims of fraud in an Order denying his motion for relief from judgment, <em>Spirko v. Bradshaw, </em>404 F.Supp.2d 984 (N.D.Ohio 2005), and in a subsequent Order denying his motion for vacatur of the prior Order. <em>Spirko v. Bradshaw, </em>404 F.Supp.2d 993 (N.D.Ohio 2005). Because the district court thoroughly addressed Spirko\u2019s arguments and persuasively demonstrated that there was no fraud on the federal habeas court, we will affirm that court\u2019s judgment on the basis of its two well-reasoned opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">But for purposes of clarity and completeness, we will add a few comments regarding certain of Spirko\u2019s contentions. First, as a general matter, we note that many of Spirko\u2019s arguments are more accurately characterized as attacks on his conviction or sentence, or on the resolution of his habeas claims on the merits, rather than genuine claims of fraud on the federal habeas court. Although attacks on Spirko\u2019s conviction or sentence, or the resolution of his habeas claims on the merits, would constitute a second or successive habeas petition that is generally barred from federal court adjudication, <em>see Gonzalez v. Crosby,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2646-48, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>Post v. Bradshaw, </em>422 F.3d 419, 424-25 (6th Cir.2005), we conclude that the district court was correct in addressing Spirko\u2019s fraud claims on their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">We also note that Spirko argues on appeal, <em>inter alia, </em>that the district court improperly applied the provisions of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), to his case even though his federal habeas petition was filed before that law\u2019s enactment, and that the district court erroneously held that a state prosecuting attorney was not an officer of the federal habeas court for purposes of a fraud-on-the-court claim. It is not necessary for us to resolve these issues because their resolution would not affect our determination of the claims on appeal. AED-PA\u2019s application to this case has no effect upon the district court\u2019s persuasive analysis demonstrating that, at bottom, no fraud was committed on the federal habeas court warranting the re-opening of Spirko\u2019s habeas action. And the district court also correctly explained that, even if the Van Wert County prosecuting attorney (first, Stephen Keister, and then his successor, Charles Kennedy) were an officer of the federal habeas court, and even assuming that he made the misrepresentation or concealment of information in this case that Spirko claims, it does not constitute fraud, and that in any event the information at issue did not bear upon the outcome of the federal habeas proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Furthermore, Spirko\u2019s argument that the district court reversibly erred by not treating his claim as \u201can independent action for relief from judgment on the basis of fraudulent misconduct\u201d is unavailing. The district court recognized its authority to treat Spirko\u2019s Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion as one for such equitable relief \u201cin cases of unusual and exceptional circumstances,\u201d and although it did not mechanistically apply the relevant test, the district court\u2019s convincing explanation that it was not defrauded at all-much less in a way that would have altered its adjudication of Spirko\u2019s habeas petition-demonstrates that it could not have abused its discretion by denying equitable relief on the basis of fraud, a claim whose standard is in most respects more difficult to meet than that under Rule 60(b)(3). <em>See Barrett v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>840 F.2d 1259, 1263 (6th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">In short, the district court\u2019s two orders denying Spirko relief from judgment clearly demonstrated that no fraud occurred in the procurement of the habeas court\u2019s judgment, much less fraud that would have affected that court\u2019s adjudication so as to justify its exercising its discretion to reopen Spirko\u2019s habeas case. Finding no abuse of discretion, we therefore AFFIRM on the basis of its two orders the district court\u2019s judgment denying Spirko\u2019s motion for relief from judgment. <em>See Spirko v. Bradshaw, </em>404 F.Supp.2d 984 (N.D.Ohio 2005); <em>Spirko v. Bradshaw, </em>404 F.Supp.2d 993 (N.D.Ohio 2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b522-5\">RONALD LEE GILMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A88\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"ARn\">Although I adhere to the position expressed in my opinion dissenting from the denial of Spirko\u2019s original habeas corpus petition, <em>Spirko v. Mitchell, </em>368 F.3d 603, 614-18 (6th Cir.2004) (Gilman, J., dissenting), I agree with my colleagues and with the district court that Spirko has not met the high burden of proving fraud on the habeas court either under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or via an independent action for relief from judgment. I therefore agree that the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
