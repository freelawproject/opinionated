He argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly commented on his post-arrest, <em>post-Miranda </em>silence, in violation of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), and that the error requires automatic reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-27\">A prosecutor violates a defendant\u2019s due process rights by commenting on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>defendant\u2019s post-arrest, post-Mmroda warning silence in an attempt to impeach the defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony offered at trial. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619-20, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). Contrary to Berg\u2019s assertion, the prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding his silently \u201clooking straight ahead\u201d reference his silence during secondary inspection, which silence occurred prior to any arrest and thus do not violate <em>Doyle. See United States v. Musquiz, </em>45 F.3d 927, 930 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Berg also objects to the prosecutor\u2019s comment on his failure to say anything after he was arrested and placed in a holding cell. Although the remark referenced Berg\u2019s post-arrest silence, there is no evidence in the record that Berg\u2019s silence at that point was induced by <em>Miranda </em>warnings, a prerequisite for a <em>Doyle </em>violation. <em>See Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619-20, 96 S.Ct. 2240. Even if a <em>Doyle </em>violation is assumed, however, the error was harmless given that the statement was not linked to the exculpatory statement Berg offered at trial, that the trial court sustained Berg\u2019s objection and gave a curative instruction, and that the evidence of Berg\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>43 F.3d 117, 123 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>953 F.2d 1449, 1466 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>547 F.2d 1240, 1247-48 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
