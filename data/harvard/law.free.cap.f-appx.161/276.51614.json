Jacobs and Nancy Heckerman (\u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s judgment granting the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and entering a judgment in the Appellees\u2019 favor on their breach of contract claim and granting the Appellees\u2019 motion for sanctions. We have reviewed the record and affirm. Insofar as the Appellants challenge the order denying their motion for a continuance and the order compelling discovery, the orders are not reviewable. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a); <em>Sunview Condominium Ass\u2019n v. Flexel Intern., Ltd., </em>116 F.3d 962, 964-65 (1st Cir.1997). With respect to the Appellants\u2019 claim they were denied their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial, we find any error is harmless as their complaint was dismissed on the Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss, obviating the need for a trial. Finally, there was no error in the district court\u2019s order referring the motion for a change of magistrate judge to the magistrate judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
