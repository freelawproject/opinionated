The district court sentenced him to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment, the low-end of the range recommended by the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines, and five years of supervised release. Acosta appealed, contending his sentence was improper under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reviewed his contention using the plain error standard of review. In accordance with the procedure we announced in <em>United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471 (7th Cir.2005), we ordered a limited remand on July 29, 2005 to ask the district court whether it would have imposed the same sentence knowing the Guidelines were advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">The district court judge responded, \u201cIf I had known the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory rather than mandatory, I cannot conclude that I would have imposed the same sentence I imposed in this case.\u201d As the government acknowledges, the district court\u2019s response to our limited remand demonstrates that plain error has been shown. As a result, we VACATE Acosta\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
