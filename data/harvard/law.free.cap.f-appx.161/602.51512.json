Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him under the formerly mandatory sentencing guidelines. The government conceded the error, so we ordered a limited remand to ask the district court whether it would have imposed the same sentence had it known that the guidelines were advisory, <em>see United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 484 (7th Cir.2005). The court has assured us that it would have, so the only remaining question is the reasonableness of Stokes\u2019 sentence. Since Stokes\u2019 sentence was in the middle of a properly calculated guideline range, it was presumptively reasonable, <em>see United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005). And because Stokes has not responded to the district court\u2019s statement, he has not rebutted that presumption. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
