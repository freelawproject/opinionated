California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), representing that there are no non-frivolous appealable issues. Counsel has also moved to withdraw from the case. Brown was given a copy of the motion and corresponding brief with notice that he could file a <em>pro se </em>brief. He has done so, challenging the failure of the District Court to grant a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 and asserting that the award of restitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>was improper and that he was improperly sentenced under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The government concedes that the $1500 restitution order should be vacated because it is not related to the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">Brown pled guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The District Court denied the government\u2019s motion for upward departure, denied the government\u2019s request to impose a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), and denied Brown a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Brown\u2019s sentence included a forty-six month prison term and restitution of $1,500. Brown has not appealed his conviction, only his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Jurisdiction was conferred on the District Court by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. A timely notice of appeal was filed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Turning to the sentence of imprisonment, a defendant\u2019s claim, pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), asserted for the first time on appeal, is subject to plain error review. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 164-65 (3d Cir.2005). Although Brown has not expressly raised a <em>Booker </em>challenge in his appeal, we will nonetheless proceed as though that challenge was made. <em>United States v. Urban, </em>404 F.3d 754, 783 n. 12 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cWe will vacate the sentences of Appellants ... even though they have not expressly indicated that they wish to challenge their sentences under <em>Booker.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">Where, as here, the District Court imposed sentence and treated the \u201cGuidelines as mandatory rather than advisory,\u201d the defendant\u2019s claim survives scrutiny under plain error review. <em>Davis, </em>407 F.3d at 164. In these circumstances, \u201cwe will decide claims of error related to the conviction, vacate the sentence, and remand for consideration of the appropriate sentence by the District Court in the first instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">On resentencing, the District Court shall not reimpose the order of restitution. Furthermore, because this case is being remanded for resentencing, we will deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">For the reasons stated above, we will affirm Brown\u2019s conviction, vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
