The IJ determined that Quinones had abandoned his request for discretionary relief for adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident, pursuant to the Cuban Adjustment Act, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (1966) (reproduced as historical note to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255), when he failed to timely file his application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-26\">Quinones argues that his due process rights were violated when the IJ ordered him removed after he missed the filing date for his adjustment-of-status applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>tion. Quinones avers that he had been proceeding <em>pro se </em>and did not understand the date he had to file his application. Thus, Quinones argues that his due process right to a full and fair hearing on his claims was violated, and that he was substantially prejudiced because he has no other way to adjust his status.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">\u201cDue process requires that aliens be given notice and an opportunity to be heard in their removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1310 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also Ibrahim v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1547, 1550 (11th Cir.1987) (\u201cDue process is satisfied only by a full and fair hearing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">We have previously ruled that the failure to file a complete asylum application may result in a finding of abandonment and an order of removal. <em>Rageevan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>151 Fed.Appx. 751, 755-56 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see Kuschchak v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 597, 604-06 (7th Cir.2004) (holding that IJ did not violate due process in finding that petitioner abandoned his withholding-of-removal application when petitioner missed deadline to file). Here, Quinones received due process. The IJ advised Quinones that he had to file an adjustment of status application by June 4, 2003, and Quinones replied, \u201cOkay.\u201d The IJ notified Quinones of his deadline to file his application approximately eight months before the application was due, and set a hearing for September 9, 2003. While the \u201cpresence of a competent interpreter is important to the fundamental fairness of a hearing,\u201d <em>Rageevan, </em>151 Fed.Appx. at 755(citations omitted), \u201c[a]n alien must raise objections to the insufficiency of the translation or hearing accommodations during the proceedings ... to demonstrate a due process violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Soares v. INS, </em>449 F.2d 621, 623 (5th Cir.1971); <em>Valladares v. United States, </em>871 F.2d 1564, 1566 (11th Cir.1989)). Although Quinones states that he misunderstood the date he was to file the application, the record does not reflect that he made any mention or objection regarding any miscommunications during the proceedings. Moreover, the one particular miscommunication Quinones cites \u2014 which was really a misquote by the IJ in stating the year 2002, instead of 2003 \u2014 fails to state a due process violation because the IJ repeated the proper date shortly thereafter. In addition the IJ stated quite clearly \u201cif [the application is] not filed on or before June 4th of 2003 then I\u2019m going to deem the application abandoned.\u201d Because Quinones was given notice and an opportunity to be heard and because he failed to demonstrate prejudice, there was no due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">Upon a review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
