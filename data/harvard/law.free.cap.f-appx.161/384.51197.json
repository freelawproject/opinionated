(\u201cGamebreaker\u201d), appeals from the district court\u2019s granting of the defendants-appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss his pro se civil lawsuit for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, pursuant to FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-19\">It is not disputed that, in 2003, defendant Geneva Capital, through some of the defendant attorneys, had obtained a default judgment in Minnesota state court against Gamebreaker and Burditt in its lawsuit alleging that Gamebreaker had failed to make payments on a lease contract. In 2004, other defendant attorneys for Geneva Capital obtained a Texas state-court judgment enforcing the Minnesota judgment in Texas. Burditt then filed the instant civil lawsuit in federal district court, asserting that the defendants had violated his rights during these state-court proceedings. He cited 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330, 1331, and 1339 as bases for jurisdiction. Under the federal-question statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, he cited 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1986 as grounds for jurisdiction. In dismissing Burditt\u2019s complaint, the district court concluded that Burditt had not established subject-matter jurisdiction under any of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-20\">We review the dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction de novo. <em>Musslewhite v. State Bar of Texas, </em>32 F.3d 942, 945 (5th Cir.1994). Burditt had the burden of proving that such jurisdiction exists. <em>Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank v. Office of the Comptroller of Currency of the United States, </em>362 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir.2004). As Burditt has not suggested that diversity of citizenship exists in this case, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, he was required to establish federal-question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Burditt has failed to establish federal-question jurisdiction. Burditt\u2019s citation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330 was inapposite, because that section concerns actions against \u201cforeign states.\u201d Section 1339, 28 U.S.C., provides for jurisdiction \u201cof any civil action arising under any act of Congress relating to the postal service.\u201d Although Burditt has vaguely suggested that the defendants engaged in mail fraud, he has not cited a separate statute, \u201crelating to the postal service,\u201d which establishes a cause of action. <em>See Snapp v. United States Postal Serv.-Texarkana Mgmt. Sectional Center, </em>664 F.2d 1329, 1332 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The primary basis under which Burditt asserted jurisdiction was the \u201cgeneral federal question jurisdiction statute,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>See BP Oil, Ltd. v. Empresa Estatal Petroleos de Ecuador, </em>332 F.3d 333, 336 (5th Cir.2003). Section 1331 itself does not create an independent basis for jurisdiction. <em>See Bauhaus USA, Inc. v. Copeland, </em>292 F.3d 439, 442 n. 6 (5th Cir.2002). Because Burditt has not alleged racial discrimination, he has not stated a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Insofar as Burditt has asserted a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, he has shown neither that the private defendants were acting \u201cunder color of state law\u201d nor that they violated any specific constitutional or federal right. <em>See Victoria W. v. Larpenter, </em>369 F.3d 475, 481 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Richard v. Hoechst Celanese Chem. Group, Inc., </em>355 F.3d 345, 352 (5th Cir.2003). He has effectively abandoned any claim of jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985 and 1986. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Burditt has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for leave to amend his complaint for a second time. <em>See Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 268 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Burditt\u2019s contention that he was denied his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial is meritless, because that right does not exist with regard to \u201cfactual determinations decisive of a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Tucker, </em>645 F.2d 404, 414 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Burditt\u2019s various complaints about the district court\u2019s handling of his case \u2014 including claims that the district court failed to construe his pro se pleadings liberally, raised issues sua sponte, and ignored some of his arguments \u2014 do not call into doubt the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the threshold issue of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Ceres Gulf v. Cooper, </em>957 F.2d 1199, 1202 n. 7 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-17\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
