We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-24\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court found Dunning was a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, based on his prior convictions for burglary of a residence and possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, and enhanced Dunning\u2019s total offense level by six levels. Dunning had twenty-two criminal history points establishing a criminal history category of VI. Dunning did not object to the Presentence Report or its calculations. The district court granted a three-level reduction in offense level in response to the government\u2019s downward departure motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-25\">Because sentencing occurred after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court stated it was not bound by the Guidelines and considered them advisory. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>court then sentenced Dunning to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, twenty months below the low end of the Guidelines\u2019 140- to 175-month range.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Dunning appeals, arguing the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right under <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>Booker, </em>by finding facts supporting application of the career offender Guideline rather than submitting those facts to a jury for determination. We review a challenged sentence for unreasonableness, judging the sentence in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 767; <em>United States v. Yahnke, </em>395 F.3d 823, 824 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Dunning claims the district court improperly found facts regarding Dunning\u2019s \u201cpropensity for violence and the perceived lack of prison time served.\u201d On the contrary, the district court merely found Dunning had two prior convictions supporting application of the career offender Guideline. Dunning does not dispute the existence of these prior convictions. <em>Booker </em>instructs that a district court need not submit the fact of a prior conviction to a jury to support a sentence. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756; <em>see also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Accordingly, there was no Sixth Amendment violation in applying the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The district court reduced Dunning\u2019s sentence twenty months below the advisory Guideline range based on its belief the career offender enhancement unfairly over-penalized Dunning. The district court referenced (1) the \u201cborderline on the drug amount\u201d and (2) the difference between a Guidelines career offender and an offender of the statutory Armed Career Criminal Act. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Reviewing the record in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), we conclude the district court did not commit error and Dunning\u2019s sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hadash, </em>408 F.3d 1080, 1082 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Dunning\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-16\">.
