We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-20\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision rather than that of the BIA. <em>See1 Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004);</p>\n<p id=\"b196-21\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings, relating principally to inconsistencies in Ucaj\u2019s testimony and the evidence that he had submitted in support of his application, were supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, those material inconsistencies related, <em>inter alia, </em>to Ucaj\u2019s participation in political demonstra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tions and the punishments that he had received as a result of his and his father\u2019s participation in such demonstrations, and the danger his family in Albania was in at the time of the removal proceedings. The inconsistency in Chen\u2019s testimony and with the documents he submitted supported the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because they involved \u201cthe heart of the asylum claim,\u201d <em>see Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308 (citing <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (2d Cir.2002)), and were not \u201cminor and isolated disparities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Because claims for withholding of removal face a heavier burden of proof than claims for asylum, <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 71, an applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding or CAT relief where, as here, the applicant\u2019s testimony is the only evidence that his or her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d in the home country. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 134, 144 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We have considered all of the petitioner\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The petition for review is therefore DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
