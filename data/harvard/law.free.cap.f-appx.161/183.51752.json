Amon, of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Defendant William Gonzalez appeals from a May 5, 2005 judgment of the District Court adjudging him, pursuant to his September 14, 2004 plea of guilty, guilty of conspiracy to import cocaine and heroin into the United States, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 952, 960, conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841, and conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute Ecstacy, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841. The District Court sentenced Gonzalez principally to one hundred twenty months\u2019 imprisonment upon a finding that Gonzalez\u2019s crimes triggered a mandatory ten-year minimum sentence<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that Gonzalez was ineligible for a \u201csafety valve\u201d provision exempting certain offenders from the mandatory minimum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">An offender has the burden of proving his eligibility for the \u201csafety valve.\u201d <em>See United States v. Tang, </em>214 F.3d 365, 371 (2d Cir.2000). The District Court\u2019s findings of fact concerning whether a defendant \u201ctruthfully provided\u201d the requisite information is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Ortiz, </em>136 F.3d 882, 883 (2d Cir.1997) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Here, the District Court\u2019s finding that Gonzalez was untruthful when describing his role in the offense as a small one and denying allegations of prior drug activity has ample support in the record. Because the District Court did not err, much less clearly err, we do not disturb the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-16\">^ 3c &amp;</p>\n<p id=\"b212-17\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b212-9\">. The mandatory minimum sentence provisions are codified at 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(a), 960(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-10\">. To qualify for a \"safety valve,\u201d an offender must satisfy five conditions enumerated at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). The District Court found that Gonzalez did not meet the requirement of Section 3553(f)(5), which states that by the time of sentencing, defendant must have \"truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
