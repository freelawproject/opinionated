We further deny all of Hargrove\u2019s pending motions, including his motions to consolidate, motion for appointment of counsel, motion to compel discovery, motion to separate the documents within the briefs, motion to compel arbitration or alternatively, to compel mediation, motion to supplement the reply brief, and any other motions pending in this appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Amx\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
