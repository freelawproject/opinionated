He argues that the evidence produced at trial, which merely established that he was present at the methamphetamine transaction, was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-24\">Flores did not move for a judgment of acquittal in the district court. Accordingly, this court reviews his argument only to determine if his conviction constitutes a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>United States v. Griffin, </em>324 F.3d 330, 356 (5th Cir.2003). When viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence produced at trial established all of the elements of the charged conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id.; United States v. Chavez, </em>119 F.3d 342, 347 (5th Cir.1997). Therefore, Flores\u2019s conviction did not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See Griffin, </em>324 F.3d at 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-25\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
