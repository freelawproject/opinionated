We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">Boyd\u2019s sentencing occurred after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), but before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At sentencing, Boyd argued the Guidelines were unconstitutional in light of <em>Blakely, </em>thereby preserving an appeal of his sentence under <em>Booker. See United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 550 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-13\">At the sentencing hearing, the government sought enhancements for (1) possessing a firearm in connection with a felony offense (specifically, the Arkansas state felony of aggravated assault, <em>see </em>Ark.Code. Ann. \u00a7 5-13-204), pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5); and (2) reckless endangerment during flight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. In support of the second enhancement, the government presented testimony that Boyd, while fleeing from police with a gun, pushed a bystander who was holding her infant child and then tried to hide the gun in the bystander\u2019s stroller. The district court denied the first requested enhancement, but found Boyd had acted recklessly and imposed the second enhancement. The court stated it was not bound by the Guidelines but considered them advisory, and sentenced Boyd to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, the top of the 37-to 46-month range under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">Boyd appeals, arguing the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>by finding he recklessly endangered others during flight rather than submitting these facts to a jury for determination. We have held there is no <em>Booker </em>error if the district court calculates the proper Guidelines sentencing range, treats the Guidelines as advisory, and imposes a reasonable sentence. <em>Pirani, </em>406 F.3d at 551. In such a case, we review de novo a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Mathijssen, </em>406 F.3d 496, 498 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-18\">In this case, the district court\u2019s findings did not violate Boyd\u2019s Sixth Amendment right because the district court treated the Guidelines as advisory rather than mandatory. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s findings are not clearly erroneous. Taken as a whole, the testimony by the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>ment\u2019s witnesses, including the arresting officer who observed Boyd\u2019s flight, and the bystander who was the victim of Boyd\u2019s actions, established Boyd recklessly endangered a woman and her infant child while fleeing from police.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Finally, Boyd claims his sentence is unreasonable. Reviewing the record in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because the district court correctly applied the Guidelines in deciding Boyd\u2019s sentencing range, we conclude his sentence is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hadash, </em>408 F.3d 1080, 1082 (8th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Boyd\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-14\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
