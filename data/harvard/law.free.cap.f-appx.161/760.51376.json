Halliburton contends these claims are subject to arbitration under the Halliburton Dispute Resolution Program (HDRP). After careful analysis of the terms of the HDRP and the issues raised by the parties, the district court held those claims are not governed by the program. We agree and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-17\">For 19 years, Rodney McCauley was employed by Halliburton as a Senior Electronics Technician. He also independently owned and operated McCauley Insulation (MI) as a sole proprietorship. On December 2, 2002, Halliburton hired MI to spray <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>foam insulation on the exterior of one of Halliburton\u2019s bulk tanks. Rodney asserts he asked Halliburton to transport the tank to another location where he had the proper equipment to do the job, but Halliburton insisted he do the work in its yard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">After Rodney finished his regular Halliburton work for the day, he picked up his MI equipment and returned to the Halliburton yard. Waiting for him was not the equipment Halliburton promised, but instead a forklift with a wooden pallet for Rodney to stand upon which had neither safety railings nor a safety harness. In the process of spraying the insulation, Rodney fell and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The McCauley family filed a complaint asserting four causes of action. Their first, third and fourth causes asserted negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and loss of consortium arising from Rodney\u2019s fall. The second cause asserted wrongful termination, fraud and deceit, and the third cause asserted intentional infliction of emotional distress against Halliburton as Rodney\u2019s employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Halliburton moved to compel arbitration of all claims, contending that as a Halliburton employee, Rodney had agreed to resolve all work-related claims under the HDRP. In response, McCauley conceded the second and third causes of action were subject to arbitration, but the remaining claims were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Nonetheless, Halliburton argued those claims were intimately interwoven with the arbitrable claims. Thus, it asserted, Rodney\u2019s employment relationship with Halliburton as well as principles of judicial economy demanded resolution of all of the McCauley claims in one efficient \u201carbitral forum.\u201d In opposition, McCauley maintained those claims stemmed from an incident which occurred while he was performing work as an independent contractor, not while working as an employee of Halliburton. Further, McCauley asserted Rodney\u2019s wife and children were not parties to the HDRP; therefore, their claims cannot be subjected to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-10\">The district court granted, in part, but rejected, in part, Halliburton\u2019s motion to compel. Although the court recognized the strong federal policy favoring arbitration, it determined the court, and not an arbitrator, must decide whether the parties had agreed to arbitrate. Although recognizing that arbitrability is a matter of contract and that a party cannot be compelled to arbitrate a dispute he has not agreed to submit to that process, the court was mindful of the over-arching federal policy favoring arbitration. Agreeing with Halliburton and noting McCauley\u2019s concession, the court held all of the McCauley claims for wrongful termination, fraud and deceit set out in the second cause, as well as for the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress contained in the third cause, fell within the HDRP. The court reasoned all of those claims are arbitrable because they \u201crelate to and arise out of McCauley\u2019s former employment relationship with Halliburton.\u201d It then granted Halliburton\u2019s motion to compel arbitration of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-11\">The court, however, refused to compel arbitration of the negligence claim because it \u201cis not rooted in any acts or omissions by McCauley as an employee or by Halliburton [as an] employer.\u201d Quoting the HDRP\u2019s language on the scope of the agreement and the definition of \u201cDis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>pute,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">A fair reading of the HDRP, broad in scope though it may be, is that, to be encompassed by the HDRP, a dispute must in some operative respect, be rooted in the <em>employment </em>relationship.... The distinction between employment and independent contracting was, it is safe to assume, well known to the Halliburton lawyers who drafted the HDRP. If they had intended the HDRP to cover any conceivable claim, even one arising entirely from an independent contractor relationship which was altogether distinct from the employment relationship, they could have written the document to say that, but they did not do so in the HDRP. As to the arbitration of McCauley\u2019s status as an independent contractor, the court concludes that Halliburton is not entitled to recast McCauley\u2019s claims, as pled, and then compel McCauley to arbitrate the matter if he takes issue with Halliburton\u2019s recasting of his claims. The negligence claim, as pled by McCauley, does not touch upon McCauley\u2019s employment relationship with Halliburton. Nor is the claim, as argued by Halliburton, inextricably intertwined or related with the employment related claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The court added the loss of consortium claims \u201care derivative of the negligence claim\u201d and do not arise out of the employment relationship. It is from that judgment Halliburton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">This interlocutory appeal is governed by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(1)(C), which permits review of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act. Determining the correctness of that denial <em>de novo </em>is confined to principles of contract. <em>Spahr v. Secco, </em>830 F.3d 1266, 1269 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cWhile federal policy generally favors arbitration, the obligation to arbitrate nevertheless remains a creature of contract. Because an arbitrators\u2019 authority arises only when the parties agree in advance to that forum, \u2018a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u2019\u201d <em>Louis Dreyfus Negoce S.A. v. Blystad Shipping &amp; Trading Inc., </em>252 F.3d 218, 224 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. v. Commc\u2019ns Workers of Am., </em>475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415, 89 L.Ed.2d 648 (1986)). Whether the HDRP applies to a particular type of controversy is a question for the court. <em>Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>537 U.S. 79, 83, 123 S.Ct. 588, 154 L.Ed.2d 491 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">We have set out the process of review in a number of cases. First, we examine \u201cthe scope of that agreement and then determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims fall within its scope.\u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Co. v. SCOR Reinsurance Co., </em>362 F.3d 1288, 1290 (10th Cir.2004). \u201cTo determine whether a particular dispute falls within the scope of an agreement\u2019s arbitration clause, a court should undertake a three-part inquiry.\u201d <em>Louis Dreyfus, </em>252 F.3d at 224. In <em>Cummings v. Fedex Ground Package Sys., Inc., </em>404 F.3d 1258, 1262 (10th Cir.2005), we followed the Second Circuit\u2019s <em>Dreyfus </em>analysis, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-13\">First, recognizing there is some range in the breadth of arbitration clauses, a court should classify the particular clause as either broad or narrow. Next, if reviewing a narrow clause, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>must determine whether the dispute is over an issue that is on its face within the purview of the clause, or over a collateral issue that is somehow connected to the main agreement that contains the arbitration clause. Where the arbitration clause is narrow, a collateral matter will generally be ruled beyond its purview. Where the arbitration clause is broad, there arises a presumption of arbitrability and arbitration of even a collateral matter will be ordered <em>if the claim alleged implicates issues of contract construction or the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><em>Cummings, </em>404 F.3d at 1262 (emphasis added) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Here, the HDRP states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">The plan is designed to provide a program for the quick, fair, accessible, and inexpensive resolution of <em>Disputes between the Company and the Company\u2019s present and former Employees </em>and Applicants for employment, related to or <em>arising out of a current, former or potential employment relationship </em>with the Company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Against this background, Halliburton now contends the plain text of the HDRP embraces McCauley\u2019s remaining claims, and, even if that reading was not readily apparent, the liberal federal policy favoring arbitration preserves it. Further, it maintains the HDRP is not limited to disputes between Employees and Halliburton. Instead its language that it is \u201cintended to create an exclusive procedural mechanism for the final resolution of all Disputes falling within its terms\u201d reflects a clear intention to resolve \u201call disputes between the parties regardless of whether they relate to or arise out of the employment relationship.\u201d Moreover, the negligence claim\u2014 under any reading \u2014 \u201ctouches\u201d the employment relationship. Halliburton points to the fact that Rodney was an employee for 19 years and continued to work for Halliburton. It reminds McCauley alleged he had to undertake the unsafe operation because he was \u201cboth an employee and sole proprietor.\u201d Thus, but for his employment with Halliburton, he would not have undertaken the work. Surely, this allegation satisfies \u201cthe low standard that his employment relationship touch\u201d his claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">Halliburton urges the root of the court\u2019s error was concluding the claim must arise from the HDRP. \u201cThis is not the test for arbitrability,\u201d it insists, citing <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 625, n. 13, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985), for the broad proposition that federal policy presumes the inclusion of all such claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Only by imposing the \u201cartificial standard\u201d of independent contractor status to \u201ceffectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>revers[e] the presumption in favor of arbitration\u201d could the district court abridge the sweep of the HDRP. Instead, Halliburton states arbitration must be required \u201cif the agreement can be interpreted in any way to cover the claim.\u201d Thus, Halliburton argues the claims of Rodney\u2019s wife and children are also swept within the HDRP, citing, <em>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Hamilton Hotel Partners of Jacksonville, </em>702 F.Supp. 1417, 1425 (W.D.Ark.1988) (holding a non-signatory trustee who opened the account for plaintiff and acted on his behalf is bound by the arbitration agreement).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Finally, Halliburton alleges error in the court\u2019s resolving Rodney McCauley\u2019s independent contractor status. It contends that is a fact issue entangled in the merits of the dispute and a gateway issue that should be reserved for the arbitrator, citing <em>Howsam, </em>537 U.S. at 84, 123 S.Ct. 588 (gateway issues are whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause and whether arbitration clause applies to a particular controversy).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, Halliburton adds, already in the outer limit of its authority when it found the dispute had to be rooted in the employment relationship, the court \u2014 at that point \u2014 should have referred the entire matter to the arbitrator. Instead, it improperly resolved a disputed issue of fact which touched on the merits of the action before the arbitrator. Further, that finding was based solely on the \u201cmere allegations\u201d of the complaint without an evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">McCauley asserts Halliburton never disputed his status when he performed the outside work as the sole proprietor of McCauley Insulation. Indeed, in its discovery response, Halliburton admitted: \u201cRodney Earl McCauley and/or McCauley Insulation was hired as an independent contractor by Halliburton Energy Service, Inc. to perform work [] on December 2, 2002.\u201d On that date, McCauley contends Rodney applied foam to a tank as an outside independent contractor, but, while fortuitous that Rodney also worked for Halliburton, McCauley asserts there is no relationship between applying foam and his work as an Electronics Technician, contending Halliburton\u2019s reading of the sweep of the HDRP would snag an ex-employee driving his family in his family car and hit by a Halliburton truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">Controverting Halliburton\u2019s contention for an expansive scope for the HDRP, McCauley quotes an \u201cexplainer\u201d to the HDRP which states: \u201c[the HDRP] is designed for use by employees at every level of the Company, for almost any work-place related conflict.\u201d Also, McCauley cites a brochure which commends the HDRP to work \u201cfor the benefit of all \u2014 the employees and the Company.\u201d These provisions, McCauley asserts, bear no other meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>than the HDRP applies to disputes between the employee and employer which relate to or arise out of the employment relationship. Otherwise, McCauley maintains under the overall contract, \u201cthe requisite clear and unmistakable evidence\u201d the parties intended to submit the matter to an arbitrator is absent here. <em>Spahr, </em>330 F.3d at 1270 (plaintiffs mental capacity is a question for the court, not arbitrator, in deciding motion to compel arbitration).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Resolving these contentions, we start with the instruction in <em>Howsam </em>that \u201ca gateway dispute about whether the parties are bound by a given arbitration clause raises a \u2018question of arbitrability\u2019 for a court to decide.\u201d <em>Howsam, </em>537 U.S. at 84, 123 S.Ct. 588. The district court properly addressed the issue and concluded the HDRP circumscribes a relationship between the employee and Halliburton in disputes arising out of that relationship. Although both sides have treated us to a great deal of Oklahoma contract law and Tenth Circuit cases addressing the issue, we think the test in <em>Cummings </em>guides us. 404 F.3d at 1262. The HDRP includes, such as here, a broad arbitration clause where there arises a presumption of arbitrability \u201cand arbitration of even a collateral matter will be ordered if the claim alleged implicates issues of contract construction or the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under it.\u201d 404 F.3d at 1262. However, \u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.\u201d <em>AT &amp; T Techs., Inc. </em>475 U.S. at 648, 106 S.Ct. 1415 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Two factors are of significance in determining whether the McCauleys are contractually bound to arbitrate their negligence claim. First, the HDRP clearly evinces Halliburton\u2019s intent to make the plan\u2019s terms applicable to disputes between the company and its employees for matters \u201crelated to or arising out of a current, former or potential employment relationship with the Company.\u201d Second, the plan defines \u201cdispute\u201d as claims \u201cbetween persons bound by the Plan ... with respect to ... the relationship between the Employee and the Company.\u201d These provisions are not so broad as to sweep within the plan\u2019s structure a sole proprietor and his family and force them to arbitrate a claim justiciable in court. Halliburton\u2019s late-game attempt to inject into this case a question of whether Rodney was acting as a sole proprietor should not change that outcome. We will not consider a new theory on appeal, even one \u201cthat falls under the same general category as an argument presented at trial or ... a theory that was discussed in a vague and ambiguous way\u201d at trial. <em>Bancamerica Commercial Corp. v. Mosher Steel of Kan., Inc., </em>100 F.3d 792, 798-99 (10th Cir.1996) (quotation omitted), <em>op. amended on other grounds, </em>103 F.3d 80 (10th Cir.1996). \u201c[T]o preserve the integrity of the appellate structure, we should not be considered a \u2018second shot\u2019 forum ... where secondary, back-up theories may be mounted for the first time.\u201d <em>Tele-Communications, Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>104 F.3d 1229, 1233 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">Neither McCauley Insulation nor the McCauley family was a party to the HDRP; nor are their negligence and loss of consortium claims grounded in Rodney\u2019s status as an employee of Halliburton. We disagree with Halliburton that its Dispute Resolution Plan could be read to include them. The district court\u2019s analysis was correct, and it committed no error in holding those claims cannot be subjected to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>arbitration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-11\">. Another panel granted Halliburton\u2019s motion to stay the proceedings in the district court, <em>McCauley v. Halliburton Energy Servs., Inc., </em>413 F.3d 1158 (10th Cir.2005). Recognizing \"[w]hether an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration divests a district court of jurisdiction to proceed on the merits of the underlying claim while the appeal is pending is a question of first impression in this circuit,\u201d the panel looked to sister circuits which had split in their responses. Following the Seventh and Eleventh Circuits and related precedent here, see <em>e.g. Stewart v. Donges, </em>915 F.2d 572, 576 (10th Cir.1990), the court held \"the district court is divested of jurisdiction while a <em>non-frivolous </em>\u00a7 16(a) motion is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1162 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">.
