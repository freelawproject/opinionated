McKAY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b797-20\">This is a pro se prisoner appeal. Although Petitioner initially brought this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the district court construed the petition as being properly raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Because Petitioner challenges the execution of his sentence rather than the validity of the underlying conviction, we also recognize this petition under \u00a7 2241. In his application to the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>Petitioner challenged a loss of \u201cgood time\u201d credits he had earned for his satisfactory performance in prison. Those credits were taken away as a result of the prison disciplinary proceeding. Specifically, Petitioner was charged with fraternizing with a prison guard. The alleged fraternization occurred when a female guard came to Petitioner\u2019s cell and gave him a softball glove which he agreed to \u201cbreak in\u201d for her. Following the prison disciplinary proceeding, Petitioner brought his claim to the district court where he maintained that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of the disciplinary infraction. In his Report and Recommendation (R <em>&amp; </em>R), the magistrate judge disagreed with Petitioner and recommended that the district court deny the petition. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R in full and denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability. Petitioner now renews his request for a certificate of appealability with this court. The issues which he raises on appeal are identical to those brought before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s brief, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or Petitioner\u2019s filing raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. For substantially the same reasons as set forth by the magistrate judge\u2019s R <em>&amp; </em>R which the district court adopted in its April 5, 2005 Order, we cannot say that it is \u201cdebatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor can we say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Accordingly, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
