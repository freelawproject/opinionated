We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">As to the application for asylum, the petition for review of that claim is dismissed because Fall did not contest on appeal to the BIA or this Court the IJ\u2019s finding that he had failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he had filed his application for asylum within one year from the date of his entry. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). He has, therefore, waived his arguments regarding the jurisdictional bar with respect to his asylum application. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>313 F.3d 732, 737 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Neither Fall\u2019s claim for withholding of removal nor his CAT claim are barred by the one year filing requirement found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(a) (\u201c[Tjhe Attorney General may not remove an alien to a country [where] ... the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16, 1208.17 (requirements for mandatory withholding of removal or deferral of removal under CAT). Each of those claims, however, fails for other reasons. With respect to Fall\u2019s CAT claim, it appears that he first abandoned it before the BIA. He has not pursued it on appeal. This court would lack jurisdiction to review it because it was not raised in the appeal to the BIA from the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004) (\u201cTo preserve a claim, we require \u2018[p]etitioner to raise <em>issues </em>to the BIA in order to preserve them for judicial review.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Cervantes-Ascencio v. INS, </em>326 F.3d 83, 87 (2d Cir.2003). Moreover, because Fall did not brief the denial of his CAT claim on appeal to this court, he has waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s CAT finding. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 542 n. 1; <em>LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that an issue is abandoned when not raised in an appellate brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Regarding the claim for withholding of removal, the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual findings are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000). In this case their determinations that the petitioner\u2019s credibility was called into question by the discrepancies between his written applications for relief and his hearing testimony were supported by substantial evidence. As for petitioner\u2019s assertion that problems with translation at his hearing violated his due process rights, by not raising that objection at the time the error was occurring before the IJ, he has waived the argument. <em>See Valladares v. United States, </em>871 F.2d 1564, 1566 (11th Cir.1989) (\u201cOnly if the defendant makes any difficulty with the interpreter known to the court can the judge take corrective measures. To allow a defendant to remain silent throughout the trial and then, upon being found guilty, to assert a claim of inadequate translation would be an open invitation to abuse.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Accordingly, the petition in DISMISSED with respect to review of the denial of the asylum claim and DENIED with respect to review of the denial of the claims for relief under CAT and for withholding of removal. The petitioner\u2019s motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
