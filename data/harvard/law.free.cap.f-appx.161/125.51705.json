Fleming, </em>397 F.3d 95, 100 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Velasquez, </em>136 F.3d 921, 924-25 (2d Cir.1998). However, where \u201cthe judge\u2019s sentencing remarks create ambiguity as to whether the judge correctly understood an available option,\u201d we will generally remand for reconsideration. <em>United States v. Thorpe, </em>191 F.3d 339, 342 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In this case, it is clear Navarro could not have challenged whether the judge considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors based on the original sentencing hearing alone. However, he contends the district court\u2019s comments in attempting to resentence him create ambiguity about whether the judge had initially understood the requirement that the sentence be \u201csufficient but no greater than necessary.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We cannot agree. This provision was pointed out to the court prior to the original sentencing, and the judge\u2019s comments at that hearing indicate that she considered a lower sentence as well as all \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Furthermore, the district court has made no comment indicating that the attempt to resentence was based on a previous misunderstanding of \u00a7 3553(a) rather than a mere change of heart. A change of heart is not a permissible ground for altering a sentence under Fed.R.Civ.P. 35(a). As this Court explained in <em>United States v. Abreur-Cabrera, </em>64 F.3d 67, 69 (2d Cir.1995), a sentencing court may not change an imposed sentence \u201csimply because further reflection has caused [the district court] to have a change of heart.\u201d Therefore Navarro\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
