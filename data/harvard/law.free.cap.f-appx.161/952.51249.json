(Rexnord) move to dismiss Habasit Belting Incorporated\u2019s appeal, 06-1048. Habasit opposes. Rexnord replies. We consider whether we should dismiss Rexnord\u2019s appeal, 06-1107.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Habasit brought suit against Rexnord in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement. <em>Habasit </em>Belting, <em>Inc. v. Rexnord Indus., Inc., </em>No. 03-CV-185. While the district court case was pending, Rexnord filed a request for inter partes reexamination with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). At Rexnord\u2019s request, the district court issued an order staying proceedings pending the outcome of the reexamination on September 22, 2005. Habasit appeals that order. Rexnord cross-appeals the district court\u2019s infringement ruling, but agrees that we should dismiss its cross-appeal if we dismiss Habasit\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Rexnord contends that the court should dismiss Habasit\u2019s appeal because the district court\u2019s order staying proceedings is not a final order. Rexnord cites <em>Gould v. Control Laser Corp., </em>705 F.2d 1340 (Fed. Cir.1983) for the proposition that an order staying district court proceedings pending reexamination by the PTO is not appeal-able. Rexnord argues that the stay order does not put Habasit \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d within the meaning of <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) even if the claims are canceled in reexamination. In <em>Gould, </em>we stated that stays to enable reexamination do not foreclose review on the merits by a federal court because district court and PTO decisions are both reviewable by this court. <em>Gould, </em>705 F.2d at 1342. Rexnord also argues that the stay order is not a \u201ccollateral order\u201d that is immediately appealable pursuant to <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">Habasit contends that the district court\u2019s stay order is a collateral order that effectively puts Habasit out of court. Habasit argues primarily that <em>Gould </em>is distinguishable because the reexamination in <em>Gould </em>was ex parte, unlike the inter partes reexamination involved in this appeal. However, Habasit does not sufficiently explain why that distinction makes a difference because the differences devolve to the detriment of Rexnord, not Habasit. Habasit also argues that the more applicable precedent is <em>Slip Track Sys., Inc. v. Metal Lite, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 1337 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">In <em>Slip Track, </em>we determined that a district court order staying proceedings pending reexamination was appealable because in the circumstances of that case cancellation of the claims was likely and the plaintiff would have been foreclosed from litigating priority issues or introducing evidence concerning an anticipatory reference in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">We conclude that the circumstances here are closer to <em>Gould </em>than to <em>Slip Track. </em>The district court\u2019s stay order does not put Habasit \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d and thus we dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-16\">(1) The motion to dismiss 06-1048 is granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-17\">(2) 06-1107 is dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-18\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
