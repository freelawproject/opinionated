We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence an adverse credibility determination, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on petitioner\u2019s submission of a fraudulent asylum application and based on inconsistencies between his first two asylum applications and his testimony at the asylum hearing with regard to his detention, his involvement in a 1995 rally, and his letters to the Chinese government. <em>See id. </em>at 1043-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Because petitioner failed to demonstrate that he was eligible for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-15\">Petitioner also fails to establish a CAT claim because he did not show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he was returned to China. <em>See Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b762-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
