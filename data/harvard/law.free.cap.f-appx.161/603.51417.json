Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we ordered a limited remand to determine whether the district court would have sentenced Ngo differently had it known that it was not bound by the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 481 (7th Cir.2005). The district judge replied that she would have imposed an identical sentence even under advisory guidelines. We invited the parties to file arguments concerning the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>sonableness of Ngo\u2019s sentence, and after considering both responses, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court, after determining that Ngo is a career offender, imposed a sentence of 210 months \u2014 the low end of the range of 210 to 240 months. Ngo makes no argument as to why this sentence might be unreasonable. Instead he argues that the \u201conly appropriate remedy for the <em>Booker </em>violation in this case is a remand for resentencing\u201d and that the sentencing error was plain \u201cregardless of the district court\u2019s speculation as to what it might have done.\u201d In short, he challenges the procedure outlined by <em>Paladino. </em>But he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that applies to a sentence within the properly calculated guideline range. <em>See United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The district court acknowledged, in accordance with our May 3 opinion, that whether Ngo should be considered a career offender under the guidelines is a close question in light of the relatedness of the predicate crimes. Upon reconsideration the district judge has decided that it was indeed appropriate to sentence Ngo as a career offender. We cannot say that its conclusion is unreasonable given the advisory nature of the guidelines and, more importantly, Ngo\u2019s failure to offer any argument on the subject. The district court considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and found that the sentence imposed was appropriate in light of the interests in holding Ngo accountable for the severity of his crimes and protecting the community from further criminal conduct. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
