Tucker appeals from the final judgment entered in the District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the Northern District of Iowa upon the revocation of his supervised release. The district court sentenced Tucker to nine months in prison. For reversal, Tucker argues that the sentence imposed is unreasonable under the standard of review announced in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). His counsel has moved to withdraw. For the reasons discussed below, we grant counsel\u2019s motion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-26\">We conclude that the sentence imposed is not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Tyson, </em>413 F.3d 824, 825 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A sentence of nine months in prison represents the middle of the range recommended by the policy statements in the Sentencing Guidelines, and it is supported by the fact that several non-prison options (outpatient drug treatment, inpatient drug treatment, and time in a community corrections center) had failed to stop Tucker\u2019s ongoing use of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-27\">.
