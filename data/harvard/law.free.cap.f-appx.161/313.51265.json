Hadeed and Joan Winter appeal from the district court\u2019s order granting Thomas and Glenda Abraham\u2019s motion for additional fees and costs under the fee-shifting provisions of the Fair Housing Act, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(c)(2) (2000). Ha-deed and Winter assert that our denial of sanctions under Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in their prior appeal, <em>see Hadeed v. Abraham, </em>103 F.App. 706 (4th Cir. June 30, 2004) (unpublished), precluded the district court from awarding additional fees and costs associated with the Abrahams\u2019 defense of that appeal. Because Hadeed and Winter raise that issue for the first time on appeal, we decline to address it. <em>See Brickwood Contractors, Inc. v. Datanet Eng\u2019g, Inc., </em>369 F.3d 385, 390 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc) (stating general rule that appellate court generally does not consider issues raised for first time on appeal and noting exception not applicable here). Moreover, Hadeed and Winter do not challenge the grounds on which the district court relied to impose additional attorney\u2019s fees and costs. <em>See United States v. Al-Hamdi, </em>356 F.3d 564, 571 n. 8 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cIt is a well settled rule that contentions not raised in the argument section of the opening brief are abandoned.\u201d). Thus, they have waived appellate review of the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-21\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order and deny the Abrahams\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal. We grant the Abrahams\u2019 motion for Rule 38 sanctions and order Hadeed and Winter to pay $6525 in attorney\u2019s fees and $562.40 in costs. Finally, we grant the Abrahams\u2019 motion to strike from the joint appendix Hadeed and Winter\u2019s motion to dismiss the Abrahams\u2019 motion for additional fees and costs on the ground that it was not filed in the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
