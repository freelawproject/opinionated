Elliott\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising several issues but stating that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Elliott was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Counsel questions the district court\u2019s compliance with Fed.R.CrimP. 11, in accepting Elliott\u2019s guilty plea. Because Elliott did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea, any error in the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). Our review of the plea colloquy leads us to conclude that the district court fully complied with the mandates of Rule 11 in accepting Elliott\u2019s guilty plea. Thus, there is no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">Next, counsel questions whether the district court erred in determining the amount of drugs attributable to Elliott, in concluding that Elliott possessed a firearm during the commission of the offense, and in declining to award a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The district court sentenced Elliott after the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and properly calculated Elliott\u2019s total offense level and criminal history category to establish an advisory sentencing guideline range of 324 to 405 months of imprisonment. However, the statutory maximum sentence applicable to Elliott\u2019s offense of conviction is twenty years, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(b) (2000); thus, the twenty-year statutory maximum became the applicable guideline range. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5G1.1(a) (2003). We therefore find no error in Elliott\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record for any meritorious issues and have found none. Accordingly, we affirm Elliott\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
