Pursuant to Federal Rul of Appellate Procedure 43(c)(2), Attorney General Alberto R.

Tall alleged persecution in Guinea based on his political opinion. The IJ found Tall was not credible and did not therefore demonstrate eligibility for the relief he sought. Tall raises only the denial of his asylum claim in his petition for review. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d. Cir.2005). This Court reviews an IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, and as such, \u201ca finding will stand if it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">The IJ found Tall to be not credible because of inconsistencies concerning his alleged three imprisonments. The IJ noted that Tall had testified that after his first arrest, he was incarcerated in Matan prison. On cross-examination, he stated that his first imprisonment was in Cereta National, his second imprisonment was in Mazon Central, and his third imprisonment was in Matan. Tail\u2019s affidavit and his asylum application, however, state that his first imprisonment was in Matam, his second was in Surete Nationale, and his third was in Maison C\u00e9ntrale. These inconsistencies support the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because they involve \u201cthe heart of the asylum claim,\u201d <em>see Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308 (citing <em>Gao v. Ashcroft, </em>299 F.3d 266, 272 (2d Cir.2002)), and are not \u201cminor and isolated disparities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 288).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">The IJ also found Tall incredible based on his contradictory testimony concerning when he decided to leave Guinea. Tall testified that he had no plans to leave Guinea any time before July 2000. When Tall was shown that his passport contained an application stamp for a French visa, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>dated April 28, 2000, and then asked when he first decided to leave Guinea, he answered, \u201c[i]t was after I went to renew my passport in January 2000,\u201d and that he wanted to leave then \u201cbecause of the problems that I have in my country.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Although the IJ relied on other grounds in making her adverse credibility finding, these two reasons amply support her adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED and the Court\u2019s previously granted motion for a stay is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
