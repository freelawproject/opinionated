Although Bright pled guilty to all three counts pursuant to a plea agreement, he now contends that his plea was not made knowingly and intelligently with respect to the conspiracy count-and that on remand he should have the option to withdraw his plea as to the remaining counts. We affirm Bright\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Bright argues that the district court deprived him of due process and violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 when it found that he had entered his plea knowingly, because: (1) Bright indicated at the onset of his co-defendant Pamela Arnold\u2019s rearraignment that he (Bright) did not intend to plead guilty; (2) Bright \u201crepeatedly stated during the rearraignment that he did not know what he was doing\u201d; (3) Bright claimed during his rearraignment that a Government informant was not telling the whole truth; and (4) at one point the district court rejected Bright\u2019s attempt to plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">As Bright concedes, he did not raise these issues before the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Constitutional objections and alleged violations of Rule 11 that were not raised before the district court are reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). To demonstrate plain error, the defendant must show there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-12\">\u201cA guilty plea involves the waiver of a number of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights, and must therefore be made knowingly and voluntarily to satisfy the requirements of due process.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. To determine that a guilty plea is knowing and voluntary, a district court must comply with Rule 11 and address its three core concerns: \u201censuring that a defendant (1) enters his guilty plea free from coercion, (2) understands the nature of the charges, and (3) understands the consequences of his plea.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1127 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-13\">Having considered the record, including the transcript of Arnold\u2019s rearraignment and the subsequent plea colloquy between Bright and the district court, we are satisfied that the district court adequately addressed the core concerns of Rule 11, and that Bright was not deprived of due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, most of Bright\u2019s arguments, when considered in the context of the plea colloquy as a whole, simply lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only argument we address in any detail is Bright\u2019s claim that a Government informant (who was the source of various allegations against Bright in the Indictment) was lying, which calls into question the factual basis for Bright\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Before a district court may accept a guilty plea, it \u201cmust determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3). \u201c \u2018The standard for evaluating challenges to the factual basis for a guilty plea is whether the trial court was presented with evidence from which it could reasonably find that the defendant was guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Frye, </em>402 F.3d at 1128 (quoting <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>907 F.2d 1096, 1100 (11th Cir.1990)). Although Bright did sign a plea agreement attesting to his guilt on each and every count charged against him, he indicated several times during his plea colloquy that he was guilty, but not to the extent the Government informant claimed. Some of Bright\u2019s objections, such as those to the exact dates alleged in the indictment, are not a cause for concern. <em>See United States v. Reed, </em>887 F.2d 1398, 1403 (11th Cir.1989) (explaining that when the Government charges that an offense occurred \u201con or about\u201d a certain date, \u201c[p[roof of a date reasonably near the specified date is sufficient\u201d). However, Bright did at one point claim that the charge of conspiracy as to the 5 kilograms of cocaine was not true, and had indicated that he was selling \u201cdimes and 20s and stuff like that,\u201d but not purchasing \u201c10 kilos of cocaine at one time.\u201d Nevertheless, after consulting with his attorney \u2014 and again being advised by the court of his right to plead not guilty and the availability of a jury trial \u201cnext week or the week after\u201d\u2014Bright made an unequivocal plea of guilty to all three counts in the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if this did not resolve the issue with respect to the 5 kilograms of cocaine, Bright clearly admitted to the other allegation in the conspiracy charge: conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base. That admission was itself sufficient (in light of Bright\u2019s prior felony drug convictions) to subject Bright to the mandatory life sentence and 10 years\u2019 supervised release he received on the conspiracy count. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>289 F.3d 696, 703 (11th Cir.2002). Thus, any error with respect to the 5 kilograms did not affect Bright\u2019s substantial rights. \u201cA defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004). Even if the district court plainly erred in accepting Bright\u2019s plea without additional factual clarification, Bright has not demonstrated a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Upon review of the record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we find no plain error. We therefore affirm Bright\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-9\">. Bright did not, for example, move to withdraw his plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b885-14\">. \"In considering whether a Rule 11 error occurred or prejudiced a defendant, we may consider the whole record, not just the plea colloquy.\u201d <em>Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1020 n. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b886-6\">. For example, although at the start of Arnold's rearraignment Bright did not intend to plead guilty, Bright thereafter changed his mind and repeatedly expressed his desire to do so. Bright did at one point state that he was pleading guilty because he \"didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d but this comment simply reflected his perception that he would lose at trial, and therefore faced a statutorily mandated life sentence (due to certain prior felony convictions) whether he pled to the conspiracy count or not. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), 846. Although the district court declined to accept Bright's plea at that time, further discussion between Bright and his lawyer led to the resumption of the plea colloquy, and to Bright\u2019s admitting of various allegations in his Indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b886-10\">. We also note that the court had previously told Bright it would not accept his plea unless he could admit sincerely and truthfully to what the Government charged against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
