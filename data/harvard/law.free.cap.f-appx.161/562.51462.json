(U.S.Fire), appeals from the district court\u2019s order declining jurisdiction in this declaratory judgment action, in which U.S. Fire sought a ruling that it is not required to indemnify its insured, defendant Albex Aluminum, Inc., for the death of an Albex employee who was injured while operating a faulty company vehicle. Because we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to decline jurisdiction based on the existence of pending state litigation involving related issues, we affirm the judgment entered in the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>court dismissing the complaint filed by U.S. Fire in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In January 2000, David Courtney, an Albex employee, was operating a company dump truck at a construction site when the frame of the truck snapped and crushed the cab. Courtney died from his injuries. As a result, Courtney\u2019s estate filed a wrongful death action against Albex, RVM Industries, Inc. (RVM), and Kagey\u2019s Body Frame &amp; Shop (Kagey\u2019s) in an Ohio state court of common pleas. The case was settled prior to the conclusion of trial in July 2001, for an amount totaling $5.35 million. Of that sum, RVM paid $4 million (75 percent), Kagey\u2019s paid $1.3 million (24 percent), and Albex paid $50,000 (less than one percent), which amount was reimbursed by U.S. Fire. The settlement agreement reserved the rights of RVM and Kagey\u2019s to maintain a cross-claim against Albex for contribution and indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In February 2004, the Ohio state court granted motions for partial summary judgment in favor of RVM and Kagey\u2019s, ruling that they could proceed in a contribution claim against Albex. In its order, the state court found, based on trial testimony, that \u201cas matter of law, Albex knew with substantial certainty that Courtney was in danger by continuing to use the truck, but instructed him to do so anyway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Albex maintained several insurance policies from U.S. Fire, including a \u201cstop-gap\u201d employers liability policy that provided defense and indemnity for the insured under circumstances stated in the policy. As a result, Albex has been represented by counsel provided by U.S. Fire throughout the state court proceedings. Nevertheless, in view of the cross-claim pending in state court against its insured, U.S. Fire initiated this federal declaratory judgment action in July 2004, seeking a ruling that it is not required to indemnify Albex for any additional sums that Albex may subsequently be determined to owe RVM or Kagey\u2019s, because the insurance policies issued to Albex do not apply to \u201cbodily injury resulting from an act which is determined to have been committed by any insured with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In response, Kagey\u2019s filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs request for a declaratory judgment, arguing that U.S. Fire was \u201cattempting to circumvent the state court issuing a ruling on the proportionate share of [its] liability.\u201d The district court granted the motion after applying the appropriate test for determining whether it should exercise jurisdiction and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. U.S. Fire now appeals that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">\u201cExercise of jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) is not mandatory,\u201d <em>Bituminous Cas. Corp. v. J &amp; L Lumber Co., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 807, 812 (6th Cir.2004), and we review a district court\u2019s decision not to exercise jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <em>See id.; see also Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., </em>515 U.S. 277, 289-90, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). We therefore reject the plaintiffs contention that because defendant Kagey\u2019s challenged this action through a motion to dismiss, we should apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. Although a ruling on a motion to dismiss is typically reviewed <em>de novo, </em>this appeal clearly does not present the typical situation. As the Supreme Court has noted, \u201c[s]ince its inception, the Declaratory Judgment Act has been understood to confer on federal courts unique and substantial discretion in deciding whether to declare the rights of litigants.\u201d <em>Wilton, </em>515 U.S. at 286, 115 S.Ct. 2137 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (a court <em>\u201cmay </em>declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>tion\u201d)). Thus, the Court has held that \u201c[although the District Court ha[s] jurisdiction of the suit under the Federal Declaratory Judgments Act, it [i]s under no compulsion to exercise that discretion.\u201d <em>Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of America, </em>316 U.S. 491, 494, 62 S.Ct. 1173, 86 L.Ed. 1620 (1942). Moreover, in contrast to the invocation of <em>Colorado River\u2019s </em>abstention doctrine, a district court does not need to point to \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in declining to exercise jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment suit. <em>See Wilton, </em>515 U.S. at 286, 115 S.Ct. 2137; <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, </em>424 U.S. 800, 818-20, 96 S.Ct. 1236, 47 L.Ed.2d 483 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In this circuit, a district court\u2019s discretion is not unfettered, however. In <em>Grand Trunk Western Railroad Co. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>746 F.2d 323 (6th Cir.1984), we adopted a five-factor test to guide the court in determining whether or not to exercise jurisdiction over a request for a declaratory judgment. Those five factors are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-5\">(1) whether the judgment would settle the controversy; (2) whether the declaratory judgment action would serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal relations at issue; (3) whether the declaratory remedy is being used merely for the purpose of \u201cprocedural fencing\u201d or \u201cto provide an arena for a race for res judicata\u201d; (4) whether the use of a declaratory action would increase the friction between our federal and state courts and improperly encroach on state jurisdiction; and (5) whether there is an alternative remedy that is better or more effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 326. Moreover, we have found reversible error when a district court fails to apply these factors. <em>See AmSouth Bank v. Dale, </em>386 F.3d 763, 785 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe district court noted this test, but did not apply each factor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">In this case, the district court reviewed each factor, ultimately finding that\u2014collectively \u2014 they weighed against exercising jurisdiction. U.S. Fire argues that the district court erred in its application of the five factors and, thus, in dismissing the case. In support, U.S. Fire cites to <em>Northland Insurance Co. v. Stewart Title Guaranty Co., </em>327 F.3d 448 (6th Cir.2003), a case in which we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction based on its application of the <em>Grand Trunk Western </em>five-factor test. <em>Id. </em>at 453-54. Although the factual circumstances of <em>Northland </em>bear some similarity to those in this case, <em>Northland </em>does not therefore mandate a reversal in this case but merely illuminates the broad discretion a district court enjoys under the Declaratory Judgment Act. Indeed, even a brief survey of Sixth Circuit cases indicates that we have consistently upheld decisions of the district courts declining jurisdiction in declaratory judgment cases after a reasoned analysis of the five-factor test. <em>See, e.g., Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Roumph, </em>211 F.3d 964, 969 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">In this case, the district court found that the first two of the five factors \u2014 whether a declaratory judgment would settle the controversy or clarify the legal relations at issue \u2014 weighed against exercising jurisdiction, noting that \u201ca declaration of [U.S. Firej\u2019s duty to indemnify Albex will do nothing to resolve the issue before the state court, <em>i.e., </em>the relative fault of Albex, RVM and Kagey\u2019s.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the district court relied in part on our decision in <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Mercier, </em>913 F.2d 273, 278 (6th Cir.1990) (abrogated on other grounds), in which we held that the first two of the five applicable factors were not met in a situation in which the related state court litigation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>not an action against the insured in which the insurer was a party. We find less than convincing U.S. Fire\u2019s argument on appeal that <em>Northland </em>requires a contrary result. In that case, we noted that an insurance company \u201cshould not be forced to participate in [a state] action\u201d if, in fact, it \u201chad no duty to indemnify its insured or to defend them [sic] in the state action.\u201d 327 F.3d at 454. Here, however, U.S. Fire has been defending Albex throughout the state court litigation. Furthermore, as we noted in <em>Bituminous Casualty Corp., </em>although a declaratory judgment in a situation such as the one in this case would \u201cclarify the legal relationship between [the insurer and the insured],\u201d it would do nothing to clarify the relationship between the parties in the underlying state action. 373 F.3d at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">U.S. Fire nevertheless contends that even if a declaratory judgment would not clarify the issues now before the state court, it would at least \u201cclarify the contractual obligations between Albex [ ] and U.S. Fire\u201d and thereby settle a dispute that \u201cis not pending in any other court.\u201d The district court noted, however, that an indemnification action against U.S. Fire in state court was inevitable <em>and </em>that one had not already been filed only because \u201cthe state jury ha[d] not yet fixed the exact amount that Albex must pay\u201d in the wrongful death action. Thus, the district court observed, \u201cIt is a foregone conclusion that Albex <em>is liable </em>to Courtney\u2019s estate; the only question is how its fault compares to that of Kagey\u2019s and RVX\u2014 once that matter is determined, Albex will sue [U.S. Fire], which can then assert whatever defenses it wishes.\u201d The court likewise cited in support of this conclusion our decision in <em>Utilities Insurance Co. v. Ledford, </em>255 F.2d 123 (6th Cir.1958), in which we held that the district court had properly declined jurisdiction over an insurer\u2019s action seeking a declaration that a third party drove the car in question with the insured\u2019s permission, because that issue \u201cwould be determined at some point in the state court litigation ..., if not in the trial, then at the latest in supplementary proceedings in aid of execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. In short, we agree with the district court that the first two factors tend to weigh against the exercise of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">The district court found that the third factor \u2014 the \u201cprocedural fencing\u201d factor\u2014 also weighed against an exercise of jurisdiction, noting our admonition in <em>AmSouth Bank </em>that federal courts should not \u201cseize litigations from state courts merely because one party, normally a defendant, goes to federal court to begin his ... defense before the state court begins the case under state law.\u201d 386 F.3d at 775 (quoting <em>Public Serv. Comm. v. Wycoff Co., </em>344 U.S. 237, 248, 73 S.Ct. 236, 97 L.Ed. 291 (1952)). The indemnification issue was admittedly not yet before the state court, nor was there any evidence in the record of bad faith on behalf of U.S. Fire in filing this action. Nevertheless, the district court concluded that because \u201c[t]he chain of events already in motion in state court ... lead[s] ineluctably to that very issue being brought before the state court,\u201d it was apparent that U.S. Fire was \u201ctrying to secure a favorable ruling here, rather than take the risk that it will not fare as well in Albex\u2019s inevitable state court action against it.\u201d Thus, despite U.S. Fire\u2019s claim that its only option to filing this action was \u201cto sit[ ] on its proverbial hands,\u201d we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that this factor weighed against exercising jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">The district court considered the last two factors \u2014 the possibility of increased friction between the state and federal courts and the possibility of a more effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>tive alternate remedy \u2014 together, observing that the issues raised by the federal litigation involve questions of Ohio state law that the state courts are in a better position to address, especially where, as here, those questions \u201carise in a field which is largely reserved to the states and thus implicates public policy considerations\u201d that form the foundation of state regulation of insurance and the state courts\u2019 development of Ohio common law. The district court concluded that in the absence of a showing \u201cthat the state courts are unable or unwilling to resolve th[ese] state law contract and insurance coverage issue[s] in a timely, competent, fair and comprehensive fashion,\u201d \u201c[j]udicial economy and comity alike militate against helping [U.S. Fire] avoid the state courts\u2019 inevitable ruling on whether it must indemnify Albex.\u201d The court found that these factors weighed against exercising jurisdiction in this case, and we agree with this assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Having concluded that the district court correctly analyzed the dispositive issues in this case and, for that reason, that the plaintiff has failed to establish that the court abused its discretion in declining to exercise jurisdiction over the complaint filed by the plaintiff, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the complaint without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
