We have jurisdiction pursuant 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-24\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Asuncion\u2019s motion to remand so that he could reapply for cancellation of removal, because Asuncion did not include any evidence in his motion that his new wife, who is a legal permanent resident, would experience \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u201d if he was removed to the Philippines, and he therefore failed to make out a prima facie case for relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D); <em>Rodriguez v. INS, </em>841 F.2d 865, 867 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that motion to remand requires showing of prima facie eligibility for relief sought).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-25\">The voluntary departure period was stayed, and that stay will expire upon issu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>anee of the mandate. <em>See Destci v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 750 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b745-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
