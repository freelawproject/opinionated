For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions but vacate the sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">King contends that the district court\u2019s admission of business records violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause and the rule of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). King did not object on these grounds in the district court, and thus this court\u2019s review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause does not permit the introduction of out-of-court testimonial evidence unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Notably, the Court discussed certain types of hearsay that \u201cby their nature were not testimonial \u2014 for example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of business records against King was not plain error, and that King\u2019s convictions should stand. <em>See United States v. Jamieson, </em>427 F.3d 394, 411 (6th Cir.2005) (business records not \u201ctestimonial\u201d under the rule in Crawford).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">Next, King argues that enhancements to his sentence violate the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines in calculating his sentence. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied the rationale of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the federal sentencing guidelines and held that the mandatory guidelines scheme that provided for sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 746-48, 755-56 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). King did not object on these grounds in the district court, and so we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">We conclude that King\u2019s guideline sentencing range was enhanced based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by King, in violation of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The government concedes that <em>Booker </em>errors occurred and that resentencing is appropriate. We agree and therefore vacate King\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-8\">. Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>\"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of King\u2019s sentencing. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4; <em>see generally Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating that an error is \"plain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\">. Because we conclude that resentencing is appropriate in light of <em>Booker </em>and the government\u2019s concession, we decline to address King\u2019s other arguments regarding improper application of the sentencing guidelines. These issues can be addressed by the district court when his sentence is recalculated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
