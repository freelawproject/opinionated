We previously affirmed Lantis Jeton Young\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Young, </em>100 Fed.Appx. 214 (4th Cir.2004) (unpublished). The Supreme Court vacated our decision and remanded Young\u2019s case to us for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">In Young\u2019s supplemental brief, filed at this court\u2019s direction after the Supreme Court\u2019s remand, he contends the sentences on count one, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, count three, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, and count five, carjacking, were based on facts not found by the jury, and that the life imprisonment term for count two, drug trafficking resulting in death, was erroneous in light of <em>Booker </em>because it was imposed under a mandatory sentencing guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government acknowledges that the sentence imposed for count five, carjacking, was based on facts not found by the jury. However, the Government argues that the error does not affect Young\u2019s substantial rights because the error will not affect the total amount of time Young is required to serve.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">Under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3D1.2(b) (2003), the probation officer grouped together three of the counts of conviction: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base (count one), use and carry of a handgun during a drug trafficking crime resulting in death (count two), and possession with intent to distribute cocaine (count three). For those counts, the recommended base offense level was forty-three. Two levels were added for obstruction of justice, for an adjusted offense level of forty-five. The offense level was reduced to forty-three, the highest level in the sentencing table.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">For the carjacking count (count five), USSG \u00a7 2B3.1 (robbery) called for a base offense level of twenty. Six levels were added because a firearm was used. Four levels were added because a person was abducted to facilitate the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the offense, and two levels were added because the offense involved carjacking, for an adjusted offense level of thirty-two. After the multiple-count adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3D1.4, the combined adjusted offense level was found to be forty-five, with a total offense level of forty-three. For the count alleging using and carrying a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking crime (count four), as well as the count alleging using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence (count six), the guideline sentence is the minimum term required by statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The judge sentenced Young to two terms of life imprisonment on counts one and two, two terms of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment on counts four and six to run consecutively with each other and the life imprisonment terms, and one term of 180 months\u2019 imprisonment on count five to run concurrently with the other terms of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">This court has identified two types of <em>Booker </em>error: a violation of the Sixth Amendment, and a failure to treat the sentencing guidelines as advisory. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 552 (4th Cir.2005). A Sixth Amendment error occurs when the district court imposes a sentence greater than the maximum permitted based on facts found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Because Young did not raise a Sixth Amendment challenge or object to the mandatory application of the guidelines in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">To demonstrate plain error, an appellant must establish that an error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48. If an appellant meets these requirements, the court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion is appropriately exercised only when failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 555 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). While the mandatory application of the guidelines constitutes plain error, <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 217 (4th Cir.2005), a defendant who seeks resentencing on this ground must show actual prejudice, i.e., a \u201cnonspeculative basis for concluding that the treatment of the guidelines as mandatory \u2018affeet[ed] the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223 (quoting <em>Williams v. United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Young was sentenced to life imprisonment on counts one and two. On each of these counts, the offense level under the sentencing guidelines was forty-three, USSG \u00a7 2A1.1(a); that offense level was based on the jury\u2019s finding that Young committed a murder during the course of the conspiracy. Because the offense level was based on the jury\u2019s verdict, and because an offense level of forty-three calls for a life sentence under the guidelines regardless of the defendant\u2019s criminal history, Young\u2019s sentence on these counts does not violate the Sixth Amendment. USSG Ch. 5, Pt. A, Sentencing Table. Moreover, nothing in the sentencing transcript or elsewhere in the record suggests that the district court would have given Young a lower sentence if the guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>were not mandatory. Therefore, Young has not established plain error that warrants resentencing under <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 223 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">As the Government concedes, Young\u2019s 180-month sentence on count five, carjacking, was based on facts not found by the jury or admitted by Young. However, we conclude that because the sentence on count five runs concurrently with the life sentences on counts one and two, he cannot show that his substantial rights have been violated by the imposition of a sentence based on judge-found facts on count five. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>326 F.3d 593 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Finally, the 240-month sentences on counts three, four, and six are statutory mandatory minimum sentences. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2000); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (2000). As such, we find they are not impacted by <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Accordingly, we reinstate our June 16, 2004 opinion affirming Young\u2019s conviction, and we affirm Young\u2019s sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>We deny Young\u2019s motion to remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b332-12\">. Young also argues that because the verdict did not apportion the culpability for the conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine base, the sentence imposed runs contrary to this court's decision in <em>United States v. Collins, </em>415 F.3d 304 (4th Cir.2005). However, this count was grouped with count four, use of a handgun in relation to drug trafficking resulting in death, for purposes of calculating the guidelines range. As a result, Young's relative culpability was not a factor in the calculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-18\">. Under USSG Ch.5 Pt. A, comment, (n.2), a total offense level of more than 43 is to be treated as an offense level of 43.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b333-8\">. Young acknowledges that the terms of imprisonment he received for counts four and six do not offend <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
