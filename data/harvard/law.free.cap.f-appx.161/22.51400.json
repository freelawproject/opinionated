R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b50-23\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed on April 7, 2005, and April 26, 2005, be affirmed. Appellant challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint seeking an order compelling the United States Ambassador of the Philippines and the Secretary of State to issue a visa for his fiancee. The district court\u2019s dismissal was proper because the district court lacked the authority to review the consular decision regarding issuance of the visa to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>fiancee, a citizen and resident of the Philippines whom he has never met. <em>Saavedra Bruno v.
