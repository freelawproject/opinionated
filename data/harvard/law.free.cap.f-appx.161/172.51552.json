We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-17\">To turn down a refugee candidate for want of sufficient corroboration, an IJ must: (1) \u201cdecide explicitly\u201d whether or not the candidate\u2019s testimony was credible (without relying exclusively on the lack of coiToborating evidence); and, if credible, (2) determine whether additional corroboration is necessary for the candidate to meet his or her burden of proof. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 285-90 (2d Cir.2000). \u201cIf the BIA insists on further corroboration, it should explain specifically, either in its decision or otherwise in the record: (1) why it is reasonable under the BIA\u2019s standards to expect such corroboration; and (2) why [the candidate\u2019s] proffered explanations for the lack of such corroboration are insufficient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 290; <em>see also Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 54-55 (2d Cir.2001) (\u201c[T]he BIA here did not identify any particular document or type of document it believed to be missing from the record (as it did in Diallo), much less explain why it would have been reasonable to expect the provision of such materials ....\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>F.3d 140, 153-54 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201cUnless the BIA anchors its demands for corroboration to evidence which indicates what the petitioner can reasonably be expected to provide, there is a serious risk that unreasonable demands will inadvertently be made.... What is (subjectively) natural to demand may not [] be (objectively) reasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">In the present case, the IJ failed to make an \u201cexplicit credibility determination.\u201d Furthermore, the IJ failed to explain why (1) it was reasonable to expect Zaoutashuili to produce the documents mentioned to corroborate her Jewish identity; and (2) why Zaoutashuili\u2019s excuses for the missing documents were insufficient. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 290.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">For these reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this order. Although we need not decide the due process claim, as remand is warranted on other grounds, the BIA is instructed to allow Zaoutashuili to present testimony regarding whatever facts she deems supportive of her claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(4)(B) (an alien \u201cshall have a reasonable opportunity ... to present evidence on the alien\u2019s own behalf\u2019); <em>see also Augustin v. Sava, </em>735 F.2d 32, 36 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
