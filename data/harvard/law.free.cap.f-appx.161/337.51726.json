Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 77-78 (4th Cir.1996) (holding that district court may not delegate its authority to set amount and timing of payments of restitution or fines to Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) or probation officer without retaining ultimate authority over such decisions). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-23\">Although Watkins\u2019 judgment refers any unpaid amount at the commencement of a term of supervised release to a payment schedule, no such schedule is delineated in the judgment. Instead, it appears that the BOP has drafted a schedule under the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d) for Watkins to follow. Participation in the IFRP does not violate <em>Miller. See Matheny v. Morrison, </em>307 F.3d 709, 712 (8th Cir.2002) (holding that BOP has discretion to place inmate in IFRP when sentencing court has ordered immediate payment of court-imposed fine) (citing <em>McGhee v. Clark, </em>166 F.3d 884, 886 (7th Cir.1999), and <em>Montano-Figueroa v. Crabtree, </em>162 F.3d 548, 549-50 (9th Cir.1998)). <em>But see United States v. McGlothlin, </em>249 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2001) (holding that district court improperly delegated payment schedule to BOP when it ordered restitution to be due immediately but intimated that BOP would collect restitution to maximum degree possible through its IFRP while defendant was incarcerated). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
