The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b44-22\">Ordered and Adjudged that Local 494\u2019s petition for review be denied, and that the Board\u2019s order be enforced in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-23\">The Board has held that Section 8(b)(1)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1)(B), applies not only in cases where the Union already has a collective bargaining relationship with the employer, but also where the Union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>lacks such a relationship but is actively seeking such a relationship. Petitioner challenges such a reading of the statute, relying primarily on Justice Scalia\u2019s separate opinion in <em>NLRB v. Electrical Workers, IBEW Local 340 (Royal Electric), </em>481 U.S. 578, 596, 107 S.Ct. 2002, 95 L.Ed.2d 557 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment only). Petitioner\u2019s argument cannot succeed, however, because this Court has already endorsed the Board\u2019s reading of the statute in a previous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">This Court\u2019s statement to that effect could not have been more clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">The law governing this case is undisputed. A union violates 8(b)(1)(B) by disciplining a supervisor who has either collective bargaining or grievance adjusting duties, thereby coercing an employer, only if it has, or is seeking, a collective bargaining relationship with the employer. <em>See Royal Electric, </em>481 U.S. at 590, 107 S.Ct. 2002. The Board has not adopted the interpretation of section 8(b)(1)(B) Justice Scalia advanced in his Royal Electric concurrence: that the section only applies \u201cto circumstances in which there is an actual contract between the union and affected employer, without regard to whether the union has an intent to establish such a contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597, 107 S.Ct. 2002 (Scalia, J., concurring [in judgment]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-7\"><em>Podewils v. NLRB, </em>274 F.3d 536, 539 (D.C.Cir.2001) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">That reading is the law of the case. As this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>explained in <em>LaShawn A. v. Barry, </em>\u201cthe <em>same </em>issue presented a second time in the <em>same </em>case in the same court should lead to the <em>same </em>result.\u201d 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C.Cir.1996) <em>(en banc) </em>(emphasis in original). \u201cThe doctrine encompasses a court\u2019s explicit decisions, as well as those issues decided by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Williamsburg Wax Museum, Inc. v. Historic Figures, Inc., </em>810 F.2d 243, 250 (D.C.Cir.1987). Having set forth the rule governing this case once already, this Court cannot change its position now. Indeed, to do so in light of <em>Royal Electric </em>would be particularly inappropriate, as the Supreme Court accepted the Board\u2019s reading in <em>Royal Electric, </em>instructing that \u201cunion discipline directed at supervisor-members without \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) duties, working for employers with whom <em>the union neither has nor seeks a collective-bargaining relationship, </em>cannot and does not adversely affect the performance of \u00a7 8(b)(1)(B) duties.\u201d 481 U.S. at 595, 107 S.Ct. 2002 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this Court, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
