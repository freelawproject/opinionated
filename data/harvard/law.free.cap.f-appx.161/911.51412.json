After careful review of the pertinent parts of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm the magistrate judge\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">The parties are familiar with the underlying facts and, accordingly, we limit our factual discussion to the circumstances surrounding the motion for a new trial. Prior to trial, Officer Kelley moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude any evidence regarding his Internal Affairs file (\u201cIA file\u201d). In support of the motion, Kelley\u2019s counsel told the district court that the IA file was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>\u201con other matters that have nothing to do with this case,\u201d to which Favuzza attorney responded: \u201cYour honor, we don\u2019t intend to introduce any of that evidence.\u201d Thus, the parties\u2019 agreement on the exclusion of the IA file ultimately mooted the <em>limine </em>motion. There was no further discussion of the IA file, nor was the file introduced or so much as referenced during the subsequent trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">At the end of the two-day jury trial, during her closing argument, Gonzalez\u2019s counsel made the following argument, which is now challenged in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmT\">Credibility of a witness, you haven\u2019t heard any history, any background of either of these two officers that would lead you to believe there was anything in their background that gave you reason not to believe them. You put that over here, and then you put the credibility of Mr. Favuza right here. And who\u2019s the more credible witness? Who is the more credible party to this case? An eight-time 25-year-old convicted felon or police officers that came before you with no evidence of any prior problems on the police force. Let me tell you something, if it was there, you would have heard it. So you can only\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC7Y\">Favuzza\u2019s counsel lodged an objection, which the district court overruled. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney concluded \u201c[y]ou can only assume that it\u2019s not there.\u201d During rebuttal argument, Favuzza\u2019s attorney said this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Zp\">Now, they say that if these officers had a bad past, if they have been accused of this stuff before, you would have heard that. Well, honestly, ladies and gentlemen, I don\u2019t know. My co-counsel doesn\u2019t know, and Vinnie [Favuzza] doesn\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know about these officers\u2019 past. We don\u2019t have any resources to find out. So don\u2019t assume that they have never done anything wrong. In fact, you can just as much assume that they have done something \u25a0wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Finally, in the course of charging the jury, the district court admonished the jury: \u201cremember that anything the lawyers say is not evidence in this case.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">Favuzza then moved for a new trial, arguing that the reference to \u201cprior problems in the police force\u201d prejudiced him and influenced the jury\u2019s verdict to such an extent that a new trial was warranted. The magistrate judge disagreed. She noted the high standard applicable to such arguments, which requires the movant to show that counsel\u2019s improper conduct \u201cwas such as to impair gravely the calm and dispassionate consideration of the case by the jury.\u201d <em>See BankAtlantic v. Blythe Eastman Paine Webber, Inc., </em>955 F.2d 1467, 1474 (11th Cir.1992). In a thorough and well-reasoned order, the magistrate judge concluded that Favuzza had not met his burden to show sufficient prejudice. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">As a preliminary matter, our review of the entire record reveals that it is not at all clear the challenged argument was improper. Favuzza, who volunteered prior to trial that he did not intend to use the IA file (thus mooting the <em>in limine </em>motion), never attempted to offer the IA file or any other evidence of \u201cprior problems in the police force\u201d in connection with these defendants. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s comments on the lack of a prior history was an entirely appropriate characterization of the evidence before the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Moreover, after defense counsel made the above-quoted argument, Favuzza\u2019s attorney was given the opportunity to rebut, and did rebut, the plaintiffs characterization of the lack of evidence. He argued that, based on the lack of evidence of prior history, the jury could \u201cjust as much as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>sume that they have done something wrong.\u201d In addition to counsel\u2019s rebuttal argument, we note that the district court advised the jury that the lawyers\u2019 arguments were not evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Even if the argument was error, we are hard-pressed to conclude that the argument rose to the level of misconduct necessary for granting a new trial. Again, in order to warrant a new trial based on improper conduct by counsel, including improper closing argument, a party must show that \u201cthe conduct was such as to impair gravely the calm and dispassionate consideration of the case by the jury.\u201d <em>BankAtlantic, </em>955 F.2d at 1474. Given that no IA file was introduced, due in large part to Favuzza\u2019s pre-trial agreement that he was not going to introduce such evidence, we fail to see how an argument highlighting that omission affected, one way or the other, the jury\u2019s decision. Indeed, as Favuzza\u2019s attorney recognized during rebuttal argument, the lack of such evidence could just as well have been construed in his client\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Simply put, we can find no abuse of the magistrate judge\u2019s broad discretion in ruling on the motion for new trial. <em>See id. </em>(reviewing district court\u2019s denial of motion for new trial based on counsel\u2019s improper conduct for abuse of district court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion\u201d). As we have explained, abuse-of-discretion review</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-6\">recognizes the range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach. By definition ... under the abuse of discretion standard of review there will be occasions in which we affirm the district court even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call. That is how an abuse of discretion standard differs from a <em>de novo </em>standard of review. As we have stated previously, the abuse of discretion standard allows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-8\"><em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>bane) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 125 S.Ct. 2516, 161 L.Ed.2d 1114 (2005). In the context of alleged improper conduct by counsel, application of the deferential abuse-of-diseretion standard is particularly appropriate since it is the magistrate judge who \u201chad the opportunity to hear the [allegedly] offensive remarks within the context of the argument and to view their effect on the jury.\u201d <em>BankAtlantic, </em>955 F.2d at 1474 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Our review of the record reveals no abuse of discretion by the magistrate judge who, in a well-reasoned order, thoroughly considered and rejected all of the arguments Favuzza raises here. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-13\">.
