We further find that we lack jurisdiction to review Cao\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his deportation proceedings. <em>See Harchenko v. INS, </em>379 F.3d 405, 410-11 (6th Cir.2004); <em>Enriquez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 246, 249-50 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Belay-Gebru v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 998, 1000-01 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Calle-Vujiles v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 472, 474-75 (3d Cir.2003); <em>Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Luis v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
