Houston appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The district judge denied Houston\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, finding both that the motion was really a successive petition and that the motion failed on its merits. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-25\">On August 6,1997, Houston was convicted of second degree murder by a California jury and sentenced to 18 years to life in prison. Houston filed a timely appeal of his conviction to the California Court of Appeal along with a request for post conviction relief. The California Court of Appeal consolidated Houston\u2019s direct appeal and his habeas petition. On November 16, 2000, both appeal and request for post conviction relief were denied by the court of appeal. In order to exhaust his state remedies, Houston filed a timely petition for review to the California Supreme Court. On February 28, 2001, the California Supreme Court denied review of his petition. His conviction became final ninety (90) days thereafter, on May 29, 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>when the time for seeking a petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Houston waited almost 18 months before submitting his petition for writ of habeas corpus to the court below, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, on October 4, 2002. The Northern District of California stamped the petition \u201cfiled\u201d on November 5, 2002. On December 23, 2002, the district judge entered an order notifying Houston that his petition might be untimely under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) one-year limitation period. Additionally, the court directed the respondent, R.L. Castro, either to (1) move to dismiss Houston\u2019s petition on the ground that it was untimely, or (2) inform the court that a motion to dismiss was unwarranted in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">On January 15, 2003, Castro filed a motion to dismiss Houston\u2019s petition as untimely. Houston did not file an opposition. On May 8, 2003, the district judge granted the motion to dismiss, finding that Houston was not entitled to equitable tolling of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitation period. The district judge explained that although Houston had claimed equitable tolling in his petition based on an actual innocence claim, he had presented no new evidence in support of his claim. The court found that Houston\u2019s argument was based on the same evidence that the trial court had considered, which was not sufficient to enable Houston to pass through the actual innocence gateway. Houston did not appeal the court\u2019s judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On May 5, 2004, almost one year after judgment was entered, Houston filed a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate the court\u2019s order dismissing his habeas petition. In his motion, Houston claimed: (1) as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, he didn\u2019t know he could appeal the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal; (2) the court should have identified the deficiencies in the petition and given him an opportunity to amend; and (3) the court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment without notifying him or giving him the chance to file opposing declarations. On May 25, 2004, Castro filed an opposition to Houston\u2019s motion to vacate judgment. Houston filed a reply on June 16, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On June 20, 2004, the district judge denied Houston\u2019s motion to vacate judgment, finding that the motion lacked merit under Rule 60(b). The court determined that it was not required to identify deficiencies in the petition and give Houston an opportunity to amend, nor did it convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Thompson v. Calderon, </em>151 F.3d 918, 920 (9th Cir.1998). \u201cAn abuse of discretion is \u2018a plain error, discretion exercised to an end not justified by the evidence, a judgment that is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts as are found.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed\u2019n v. Nat\u2019l Marine Fisheries Serv., </em>422 F.3d 782, 798 (9th Cir.2005)(quoting <em>Wing v. Asarco, Inc., </em>114 F.3d 986, 988 (9th Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">In his appeal, Houston asserts excusable neglect as a ground for relief from the court\u2019s judgment. However, in his Rule 60(b) motion, Houston claimed only extraordinary circumstances and failed to argue excusable neglect. Issues not raised in the district court are waived for appeal, <em>United States v. One 1978 Piper Cherokee Aircraft, </em>91 F.3d 1204, 1209 (9th Cir.1996), and a review of the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is limited to the grounds raised in the motion. <em>See Cel-A-Pak v. Cal. Agric. Labor Relations Bd., </em>680 F.2d 664, 668 (9th Cir.1982); <em>Lynch v. Blodgett, </em>999 F.2d 401, 403 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Upon review of proceedings in the lower court, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the district judge\u2019s judgment on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
