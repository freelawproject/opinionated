The Bankruptcy Court held that the stipulated waiver was valid, and the district court agreed. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-24\">In early November 1990, Dr. Lichtenstein began divorce proceedings against his ex-wife, Appellee Roberta Barbanel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>(\u201cMs.Barbanel\u201d), in state court. About seven months later, in June 1991, Dr. Lichtenstein filed a voluntary petition seeking relief under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, listing Ms. Barbanel as a disputed creditor. That case was dismissed on Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s own motion in August 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">On September 23,1991, Dr. Lichtenstein then filed a voluntary petition seeking relief under Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, listing Ms. Barbanel as a disputed creditor. The bankruptcy court immediately modified the automatic stay, allowing the state-court divorce action to proceed on disputed issues of child custody and support, maintenance, alimony, and division of marital assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">In the bankruptcy case, Ms. Barbanel filed a proof of claim, objected to Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s claimed exemptions, sought discovery from Dr. Lichtenstein concerning his assets, debts, and financial affairs, and moved for more time to file a complaint pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727 and 523, challenging the dischargeability of certain debts. Dr. Lichtenstein sought a protective order, seeking to prevent Ms. Barbanel\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">On January 22, 1992, in exchange for Ms. Barbanel\u2019s agreement to withdraw all pending motions and objections in his bankruptcy case, Dr. Lichtenstein entered into a Stipulation of Nondischargeability of any claims Ms. Barbanel may have arising out of their pending state-court divorce action. The Stipulation provided that, subject to the bankruptcy court\u2019s approval, \u201cDr. Lichtenstein hereby stipulates to the nondischargeability of any claims which Mrs. Lichtenstein has against Dr. Lichtenstein arising out of or related to the Marital Dissolution Action, including but not limited to, any matter adjudicated by the Jefferson Circuit Court in the Marital Dissolution Action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">On January 23, 1992, the bankruptcy court approved entry of an Agreed Order providing, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-9\">In consideration for [Dr. Lichtenstein] entering into a Stipulation of Nondischargeability (a copy of which is attached hereto) and the filing of such Stipulation with this Court simultaneously with the tendering of this Agreed Order, Roberta J. Lichtenstein (\u201cMrs.Lichtenstein\u201d) agrees that upon Court approval of such Stipulation, she will withdraw all pending Motions and Objections filed on her behalf in connection with this case (including her Objection to Exemptions filed on November 13, 1991) and shall not further participate in any way in such case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">Dr. Lichtenstein subsequently received a discharge in his initial Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">On June 6, 1996, the state court presiding over the divorce proceedings between Dr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Barbanel, entered an order requiring Dr. Lichtenstein to pay Ms. Barbanel $179,294.21 for child support, the marital share of his medical practice, medical expense arrearages, maintenance, other marital debts, and Ms. Barbanel\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. On August 28, 1998, this order was affirmed by the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Dr. Lichtenstein made approximately 18 payments, totaling $8,817.74. February 28, 2000 was the last date Dr. Lichtenstein made any payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-12\">On January 30, 2003, Ms. Barbanel filed a motion in the state-court divorce action seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>that Dr. Lichtenstein be held in contempt of court for fading to make payments in compliance with the court\u2019s June 6, 1996 order. A January 29, 2004, hearing date was set by the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">On January 12, 2004, Dr. Lichtenstein filed a second Chapter 7 voluntary petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>for bankruptcy and simultaneously filed an adversary proceeding with the bankruptcy court, seeking a determination on the dischargeability of the debt owed to Ms. Barbanel under the June 6, 1996 state-court divorce judgment, now totaling over $500,000 because of accrued interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">On February 17, 2004, Ms. Barbanel filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding, arguing that the Stipulation of Nondischargeability, approved by the bankruptcy court in Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s first Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, was a valid waiver of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(10) and thus excepted from discharge in his second Chapter 7 bankruptcy case under \u00a7 523(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">On May 12, 2004, the bankruptcy court granted Ms. Barbanel\u2019s motion seeking dismissal, concluding that Dr. Lichtenstein \u201cwaived his right to challenge the dischargeability of the debt arising from the parties\u2019 [Divorce] Action when he entered into the Stipulation and it was approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\u201d It reasoned that, because the stipulation was in writing and approved by the Bankruptcy Court as required under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(10), \u201cthe Stipulation constitutes a waiver of discharge\u201d in a prior Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Accordingly, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(10), it \u201cis <em>res judicata </em>in this [subsequent] Chapter 7 case.\u201d \u201cA determination of nondisehargeability in one bankruptcy case has <em>res judicata </em>effect on the same debt in a subsequent case.\u201d Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied. Dr. Lichtenstein filed a timely appeal of these decisions to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">On October 18, 2004, the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court \u201cwas correct in all respects\u201d and affirmed its decision that \u201ca stipulation of nondischargeability entered into by Dr. Lichtenstein in his first Chapter 7 case was a valid waiver of discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(10) in his second Chapter 7 case.\u201d Moreover, because the Stipulation satisfied the formality requirements under \u00a7 727(a)(10) of being in writing and approved by the bankruptcy court, it \u201cis, in effect, <em>res judicata </em>in [Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s] subsequent bankruptcy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">The district court, applying the plain language found in \u00a7 727(a)(10), rejected Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s argument that a waiver of discharge is enforceable only if it (a) applies to all debts, or (b) satisfies the reaffirmation requirements of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c). It likewise rejected Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s argument that the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision improperly prohibited him from challenging the reasonableness of the debt owed to Ms. Barbanel. It observed that Dr. Lichtenstein can raise his reasonableness challenge in the state court presiding over the divorce proceedings and further observed that \u201cthe alleged unreasonableness arises solely from Lichtenstein\u2019s failure to pay the original debt in a timely fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Dr. Lichtenstein filed a timely notice of appeal on October 21, 2004. This Court has appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">This Court, in reviewing a bankruptcy decision appealed to the district court, directly reviews the decision of the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. In re Am. HomePatient, Inc., </em>414 F.3d 614, 617 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">On appeal, Dr. Lichtenstein argues that the bankruptcy court erred because: (1) a waiver of discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(10) is valid and enforceable only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>it waives discharge of all debts as opposed to a single debt; (2) the Stipulation waived only a single debt and thus must satisfy the reaffirmation of debt requirements under \u00a7 524(c) and it failed to do so; (3) the Stipulation is governed by \u00a7 524(c) and not \u00a7 727(a)(10), and thus is not entitled to any <em>res judicata </em>effect under \u00a7 523(a)(10); and (4) lacking <em>res judicata </em>effect, the court-approved Stipulation entered in the first Chapter 7 bankruptcy case did not bar the bankruptcy court in the second Chapter 7 bankruptcy case from determining the reasonableness of the debt that was the subject of that earlier court-approved Stipulation. We reject each of these arguments and affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">A. Valid and Enforceable Waiver Under \u00a7 727(a)(10)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Section 727(a)(10) provides that the Bankruptcy Court \u201cshall grant the debtor a discharge, unless\u201d it \u201capproves a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor after the order for relief under this chapter.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(10).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the Bankruptcy Code does not define \u201cwaiver of discharge,\u201d the Supreme Court has defined \u201cwaiver\u201d as \u201cthe \u2018intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quoting <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)). <em>Accord In re Mapother, </em>53 B.R. 433, 435-36 (Bankr.W.D.Ky. 1985) (observing in a case dealing with the waiver of discharge of a single debt that an effective waiver under \u00a7 727(a)(10) requires \u201conly an unequivocal waiver by the debtor of his right to a discharge against certain creditor(s)\u201d). Dr. Lichtenstein executed the written Stipulation of Nondischangeability after he filed his first Chapter 7 petition for relief in bankruptcy court. When he executed the written Stipulation and moved the bankruptcy court to enter an order approving that Stipulation, he intentionally and unequivocally relinquished his right to have the debt it addressed discharged in that first bankruptcy case. Accordingly, once the bankruptcy court approved the Stipulation of Nondischargeability and entered the Agreed Order on January 23, 1992, it became a valid waiver of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s argument that \u00a7 727(a)(10) permits only waivers of all debts as opposed to a single debt is not supported by the plain language of that Section. Section 727(a)(10) contains no textual limitation on partial waivers of dischargeability, nor is there any textual indication that such a limitation is intended. To add to or amend the plain language of that Section would violate one of the core principles of statutory construction. <em>Telespectrum v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Kentucky, </em>227 F.3d 414, 421 (6th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we decline to require valid waivers of discharge to waive all debts under \u00a7 727(a)(10) and hold that the bankruptcy court properly concluded that the court-approved Stipulation executed by Dr. Lichtenstein in his first bankruptcy case was a valid \u00a7 727(a)(10) waiver of discharge of the debt it addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">B. Effectiveness of the Stipulation is Governed by \u00a7 727(a)(10), Not \u00a7 524(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-12\">Dr. Lichtenstein next argues that to effectively avoid the discharge a single debt, a creditor must comply with the reaffirmation provisions under \u00a7 524(c). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>bankruptcy court erred, Dr. Lichtenstein argues, when it concluded that a waiver under \u00a7 727(a)(10) would suffice. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">A similar argument was rejected in <em>Sol-er v. Soler (In re Soler), </em>205 B.R. 737 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1997), <em>aff'd, </em>217 B.R. 166 (E.D.Pa.1998). In that case, the bankruptcy court observed that \u201cthe debtor has the right to waive his discharge as to <em>all </em>debts, by virtue of section 727(a)(10), simply by executing a postbankruptcy written agreement which is approved by the bankruptcy court.\u201d <em>In re Soler, </em>205 B.R. at 746. Thus, the court reasoned, it made no sense to \u201cprotect a debtor from his own actions and thus render unenforceable an agreement in favor of one creditor but which, in identical form, would be enforceable in favor of all creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Mapother, </em>53 B.R. 433 (Bankr.W.D.Ky. 1985) as support).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">On appeal, the district court held that the bankruptcy court properly distinguished between reaffirmation agreements and nondischargeability agreements and concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 524(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code governed the requirements for reaffirmation agreements only. <em>In re Saler, </em>217 B.R. at 169. It observed that the debtor and creditor had entered into a nondischargeability agreement, not a reaffirmation agreement. <em>Id. </em>It further observed that \u201c[o]nee that agreement was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, it had the same force as a court\u2019s order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, by virtue of the post-petition waiver of discharge agreement in the first bankruptcy proceeding, the debt was rendered nondischargeable. Examining the plain language of \u00a7 524, the court concluded that \u201cby its terms, [it] only applies to reaffirmation of <em>dischargeable </em>debts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cTherefore, by the terms of section 524, the agreement could not be governed by that section.\u201d <em>Id.Accord Martinelli v. Valley Bank of Nev. (In re Martinelli), </em>96 B.R. 1011, 1014 (BAP 9th Cir.1988) (observing that \u201cSection 524(c) by its express terms only applies to debts that are dischargeable\u201d and thus in this case \u201cwhere the parties have stipulated that the debt is nondischargeable, the provisions of \u00a7 524(c) are not applicable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">After evaluating \u00a7 524\u2019s legislative history, the court concluded that it likewise confirms that \u00a7 524 \u201cwas intended to govern reaffirmation agreements and [was] not intended to govern or limit discharge-ability agreements.\u201d <em>In re Saler, </em>217 B.R. at 169. (citing legislative history). Adoption of a statutory argument similar to the one advanced here, the court noted, \u201cwould lead to an illogical result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If \u00a7 524 applied to post-petition nondischargeability agreements, as the debtor urged, that section and the bankruptcy rules would allow the debtor to \u201center into a nondischargeability agreement, wait until the time for the creditor to file [dischargeability litigation] has passed and then rescind the agreement.\u201d The district court concluded that Congress would not intend such a result. <em>Id.Accord Indiana Nat\u2019l Bank v. Lones (In re Lanes), </em>50 B.R. 801, 803 (Bankr.W.D.Ky.1985) (observing that Bankruptcy Rule 4004(c)(3) \u201cconcerning a debtor who filed a waiver under Section 727(a)(10) contemplates something separate and apart from a reaffirmation under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Section 524(c), or there would be no necessity to defer entry of an order granting a discharge for 30 days to permit a debtor to enter into a reaffirmation agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Similar to the facts presented in <em>In re Saler, </em>Dr. Lichtenstein and Ms. Barbanel entered into a Stipulation of Nondischargeability in Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s first bankruptcy case. They did not enter into a reaffirmation agreement. When the court in that first bankruptcy case approved and entered the Agreed Order detailing their nondischargeability agreement, the debt at issue was no longer dischargeable. Because \u00a7 524(c), by its terms, only applies to agreements reaffirming <em>dischargeable </em>debts, it cannot be used here by Dr. Lichtenstein to protect him from his own actions and to allow him to render void a post-petition, court-approved waiver of discharge that satisfies all the statutory requirements of \u00a7 727(a)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The decisions Dr. Lichtenstein relies on for a contrary result are distinguishable. Unlike the post-petition Stipulation of Nondischargeability at issue here, these decisions address pre-petition, prospective waivers of a bankruptcy discharge entered in non-bankruptcy cases. <em>See Klingman v. Levinson, </em>831 F.2d 1292, 1292-96, 1296 n. 3 (7th Cir.1987) (observing in <em>dictum </em>that public policy reasons preclude a debt- or from contracting away a right to obtain a discharge in bankruptcy on a specific debt in the future); <em>Hayhoe v. Cole (In re Cole), </em>226 B.R. 647, 651-54 (BAP 9th Cir.1998) (concluding that such pre-petition waivers are void as against public policy); <em>Chilcoat v. Minor (In re Minor), </em>115 B.R. 690, 694-96 (D.Colo.1990) (holding that a pre-petition waiver of discharge of debt in a state court action was unenforceable in a subsequent bankruptcy case because it failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for a waiver of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(10) or for reaffirmation of a dis-chargeable debt under \u00a7 524(c)); <em>Marra, Gerstein &amp; Richman v. Kroen (In re Kroen), </em>280 B.R. 347, 351 (Bankr.D.N.J.2002) (observing that \u201csuch waivers are void, offending the policy of promoting a fresh start for individual debtors\u201d); <em>Doug Howie\u2019s Paces Ferry Dodge, Inc. v. Ethridge (In re Ethridge), </em>80 B.R. 581, 586 (Bankr.M.D.Ga.1987) (holding that a prepetition state-court consent judgment waiving debtor\u2019s right to discharge a particular debt violates the spirit of the Bankruptcy Code and is thus void).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Similar to the court in <em>In re Cole, </em>the bankruptcy court here properly distinguished between decisions addressing the validity <em>of </em>\u201cprepetition waivers of discharge resulting from state court litigation\u201d and those holding \u201cthat waivers of discharge did not have to comply with the reaffirmation requirements of \u00a7 524.\u201d <em>In re Cole, 226 </em>B.R. at 652 (citing <em>Martinelli v. Valley Bank of Nev. (In re Martinelli), </em>96 B.R. 1011, 1014 (BAP 9th Cir.1988); <em>Saler v. Saler (In re Saler), </em>205 B.R. 737, 744 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1997), <em>aff'd, </em>217 B.R. 166 (E.D.Pa.1998); and <em>Laing v. Johnson (In re Laing), </em>1993 WL 732230, at *4 (N.D.Okla. Oct.25, 1993), <em>aff'd, </em>31 F.3d 1050 (10th Cir.1994) as falling within the second category of cases). The decisions the <em>bankruptcy </em>court relied upon addressed stipulations or agreements not to discharge a specific debt in the context of \u201cnondischargeability litigation in the bankruptcy court and not litigation in the state court.\u201d <em>In re Cole, 226 </em>B.R. at 652. This is an important distinction because \u201c[i]n prebankruptcy litigation, the question of the dischargeability of the debt is not in issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652-53 (quoting <em>In re Saler, </em>205 B.R. at 745-16). It is, however, the central issue in bankruptcy dischargeability litigation. <em>Id. </em>at 653. \u201cConsequently, a state court stipulated judgment where the debtor waives his right to discharge is unenforceable as against public policy. However, a stipulation in a related bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ruptcy case that a debt is nondischargeable is enforceable and res judicata.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Saler, </em>205 B.R. at 749).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We agree with the decisions in <em>In re Saler </em>and <em>In re Cole. </em>A pre-petition stipulation in a state-court action waiving a debtor\u2019s right to obtain a discharge of a specific debt in a future bankruptcy case is void because it offends the public policy of promoting a fresh start for individual debtors. Because it is executed before bankruptcy proceedings begin and is not approved by a bankruptcy court, such prepetition waivers of discharge do not satisfy the statutory requirements for a waiver of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(10). In circumstances like those presented here, however, where \u00a7 727(a)(10)\u2019s requirements have been satisfied and the bankruptcy court has approved the waiver of dischargeability, there is no reason not to give it effect. Because its approval is required, the bankruptcy court can assure that the waiver is fair to both the debtor and other creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The remaining decisions Dr. Lichtenstein relies on are likewise distinguishable. Unlike the post-petition stipulation of nondischargeability at issue here, the post-petition agreement to \u201caffirm\u201d a debt in <em>Airlines Reporting Corp. v. Mascoll (In re Mascoll), </em>246 B.R. 697 (Bankr.D.C.2000), was never approved by the bankruptcy court and thus was held unenforceable under both \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(10) and 524(c). In <em>Rulr-Lan v. Rulr-Lan (In re Rulr-Lan), </em>186 B.R. 938 (Bankr.W.D.Mo.1995), the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting relief from the automatic stay, thus allowing the creditor wife to pursue a judgment in a pending state-court divorce proceeding, was held insufficient to satisfy \u00a7 727(a)(10)\u2019s waiver of discharge requirements. Finally, <em>In re Catron, </em>186 B.R. 194 (Bankr.E.D.Va.1995), and <em>In re Smyth, </em>277 B.R. 353 (Bankr. N.D.Ohio 2001), addressed the validity of reaffirmation agreements, not post-petition waiver of discharge agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">We therefore conclude that a validly approved waiver of discharge, meeting the \u00a7 727(a)(10) requirements, need not comply with \u00a7 524(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">C. The Post-Petition Stipulation is Entitled to <em>Res Judicata </em>Effect Under \u00a7 528(a)(10)</p>\n<p id=\"b496-12\">We now address the final issue raised in Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s appeal \u2014 whether the post-petition Stipulation of Nondischargeability of the debt owed Ms. Barbanel, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court in Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s first bankruptcy case, precludes relitigation of the dischargeability that same debt in his subsequent bankruptcy case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">Section 523(a)(10) provides that a prior discharge in bankruptcy \u201cdoes not discharge an individual from any debt\u201d that \u201cthe debtor waived\u201d from discharge. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(10).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we have determined that the court-approved 1992 Stipulation of Nondischargeability entered in Dr. Lichtenstein\u2019s first bankruptcy case is a valid and enforceable waiver of discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(10), it has a <em>res judicata </em>effect on the same debt that was the subject of that waiver in his subsequent bankruptcy case. <em>See In re Saler, </em>217 B.R. at 169-70 (citing <em>Webb v. McIntosh (In re Webb), </em>157 B.R. 614, 616 (Bankr.N.D.Ohio 1993)). Moreover, \u201c[all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>though by agreement rather than by litigation, that order has the same effect as a district court\u2019s judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>In re Laing, </em>31 F.3d at 1051 (internal quote and citations omitted). Dr. Lichtenstein chose to enter into the 1992 Stipulation rather than litigate the dischargeability of Ms. Barbanel\u2019s debt in connection with their on-going divorce proceedings. He cannot avoid this nondischargeable debt by filing another bankruptcy action. <em>See In re Saler, 217 </em>B.R. at 170. Contrary to his arguments here, Dr. Lichtenstein is not foreclosed from challenging the reasonableness of his current debt to Ms. Barbanel. Just as Dr. Lichtenstein challenged the reasonableness of the amount of his original debt owed to Ms. Barbanel in the state-court divorce proceeding and in the Kentucky Court of Appeals, he can now return to the Jefferson Family Court and raise this argument about his current debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b493-7\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(10) provides that: (a) The court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless\u2014 (10) the court approves a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor after the order for relief under this chapter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">An agreement between a holder of a claim and the debtor, the consideration for which, in whole or in part, is based on a debt that is <em>dischargeable </em>in a case under this title is enforceable only to any extent enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived, only if \u2014 [certain requirements for reaffirmation of the debt are satisfied], (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\">. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(10) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">(a) A discharge under section 727, 1141, 1228(a), 1228(b), or 1328(b) of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(10) that was or could have been listed or scheduled by the debtor in a prior case concerning the debtor under this title or under the Bankruptcy Act in which the debtor waived discharge, or was denied a discharge under section 727(a), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) of this title, or under 14c(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), or (7) of such Act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
