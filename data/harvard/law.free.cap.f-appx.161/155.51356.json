We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-21\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Brice v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-22\">The BIA\u2019s discretion to grant motions to reopen or reconsider is subject to the restrictions contained in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Under these regulations, an alien in removal proceedings pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229 may file only one motion to reconsider a decision that the alien is removable from the United States. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Because Jiang was in such removal proceedings, filing a motion to reconsider on December 30, 2003, necessarily precluded him from filing this second motion in February 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The regulations also restrict the BIA\u2019s discretion to grant a motion to reopen by stating that, with certain exceptions not pertinent here, a motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or on or before September 30, 1996, whichever is later. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA summarily affirmed the decision below and rendered final the IJ\u2019s order of removal on December 4, 2003; a motion to reopen would have been timely until March 3, 2004. Because the BIA did not receive Jiang\u2019s motion to reopen until March 16, the motion was clearly outside of the time limitation. Thus, the BIA\u2019s application of this procedural rule was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
