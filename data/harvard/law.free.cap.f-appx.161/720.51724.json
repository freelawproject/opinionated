We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After de novo review, <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1117 (9th Cir.2003), we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-23\">The district court dismissed Del Raine\u2019s action because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to all of his claims. We have since held that the Prison Litigation Reform Act does not require \u201ctotal exhaustion.\u201d <em>See Lira v. Herrera, </em>427 F.3d 1164, 1170-75 (9th Cir.2005). We therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with our decision in <em>Lira. See id. </em>at 1175-76 (describing dual rule that depends on degree of relatedness between exhausted and unexhausted claims). The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Del Raine leave to amend or supplement his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>complaint by adding new defendants whose relationship to the events underlying the original complaint was not specified. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), (c), (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Contrary to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, sovereign immunity does not provide an alternative basis for dismissal, because it is clear from the record that Del Raine sought to sue defendants in their individual capacities. <em>See Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 26-27, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (distinguishing capacity in which an official is sued from capacity in which the official inflicts the alleged injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b748-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
