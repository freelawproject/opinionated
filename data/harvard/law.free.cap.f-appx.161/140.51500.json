(A 885). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-15\">The district court dismissed appellant\u2019s claims, except for his appeal to the Social Security Commissioner\u2019s decision. The standards for reviewing dismissals granted under Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) are identical. This Court reviews a judgment dismissing a complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) <em>de novo. Flaherty v. Lang, </em>199 F.3d 607, 612 (2d Cir.1999). In doing so, this Court \u201cmust accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Jaghory v. New York State Dept. of Educ., </em>131 F.3d 326, 329 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-16\">When reviewing determinations made by the Social Security Commissioner, this Court conducts a plenary review of the administrative record. <em>See School v. Apfel, </em>134 F.3d 496, 501 (2d Cir.1998) (quoting <em>Pratts v. Chater, </em>94 F.3d 34, 37 (2d Cir.1996)). This Court may only set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision if the factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence, or if incorrect legal standards were applied. <em>See Bubnis v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 177, 181 (2d Cir.1998). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). If the administrative record adequately supports the Commissioner\u2019s finding on a particular factual issue, the Commissioner\u2019s conclusion governs, even if the record would also support a contrary finding. <em>See Schauer v. Schweiker, </em>675 F.2d 55, 57 (2d Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-17\">The district court did not err by concluding that the Commissioner was a proper party to appellant\u2019s suit. This Court has never held that where a plaintiff appealing a decision of the Commissioner pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>name the Commissioner as a defendant, the Commissioner is precluded from filing legal papers in the lawsuit. Moreover, the district court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 405(g) \u201cclearly contemplates the Commissioner\u2019s appearance as a party in any such action\u201d is a reasonable reading of that provision. Appellant argues that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(x)(1)(A) does not apply to his conviction. However, this argument is undermined by the fact that appellant was incarcerated pursuant to a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, which provides for a maximum sentence of twenty years, and as such is a Class C felony under federal law. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The Commissioner\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. The Social Security Act provides that an overpayment of benefits shall not be recovered where the claimant is \u201cwithout fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this title or would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.506. This Court has analyzed waiver of overpayment cases in a two-step process: if the Commissioner\u2019s finding that the claimant was not without fault is supported by substantial evidence, there is no need to consider whether recovery of the overpayments would defeat the purpose of Title II or would be against equity and good conscience, \u201csince those factors come into play only if the recipient is without fault.\u201d <em>Chlieb v. Heckler, </em>777 F.2d 842, 846 (2d Cir.1985). Appellant signed a statement indicating that his reporting responsibilities had been explained to him, and the record reflects that he received a notice that the requirement to report to the SSA if he was incarcerated was among his responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Regarding appellant\u2019s tort claims, by arguing that the district court improperly distinguished <em>Bennett v. Arkansas, </em>485 U.S. 395, 108 S.Ct. 1204, 99 L.Ed.2d 455 (1988), appellant argues on appeal that section 402(x) is unconstitutional insofar as it allows the Commissioner to recover Social Security benefits from appellant. This argument is meritless. The district court correctly distinguished <em>Bennett </em>from appellant\u2019s case. In previously considering appellant\u2019s argument, this Court ruled that the suspension of Social Security benefits during incarceration does not violate either Due Process or Equal Protection. <em>See Langella v. United States, </em>6 Fed.Appx. 116, 117 (2d Cir.2001) (citing <em>Zipkin v. Heckler, </em>790 F.2d 16 (2d Cir.1986)). This Court also noted that \u201cevery circuit court to consider whether section 402(x) violates the prohibitions against bills of attainder or ex post facto laws has concluded that it does not,\u201d and declined to take the opportunity to hold otherwise. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he related doctrines of res judicata (claim preclusion) and collateral estoppel (issue preclusion) are meant to protect parties from having to relitigate identical claims or issues and to promote judicial economy.\u201d <em>Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, </em>162 F.3d 724, 731 (2d Cir.1998). Here, the district court properly held that appellant\u2019s constitutional and tort claims were barred because prior judgments precluded consideration of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">Finally, appellant has moved for a warrant to arrest. This motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
