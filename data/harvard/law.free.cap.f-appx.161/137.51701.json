We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-23\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ decision without opinion. <em>See Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110, 111 (2d Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam). </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s findings of fact, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard. Accordingly, we will vacate findings that are based on flawed reasoning, misunderstanding of evidence, or erroneous legal standards. <em>See, e.g., Secaidas-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). On the other hand, we will not reverse a finding of fact, unless a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled by the evidence to reach a conclusion contrary to that reached by the IJ. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ pointed to specific instances in the record where Lin\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the documents he provided to support his asylum claim, including Lin\u2019s household registration, which indicated that he was a student with no marital status, contrary to his testimony that he was a married farmer, as well as the \u201cfloating population marriage and birth certificate,\u201d which reflected that his purported wife had received an intrauterine device (\u201cIUD\u201d) only once, contrary to his testimony that the Chinese government had twice required his wife to receive an IUD, and had forced her to undergo an abortion in September 2001. Because Lin\u2019s asylum claim was based on his alleged resistance to the coercive family planning policies, the inconsistencies between Lin\u2019s testimony and his supporting documents involved facts central to Lin\u2019s claim and thus, bore a \u201clegitimate nexus\u201d to the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In regard to Lin\u2019s CAT claim, because he did not devote any argument in his brief to the IJ\u2019s determination that Lin did not merit relief under the CAT, this Court deems his petition for review of the IJ\u2019s findings on this point abandoned. <em>See Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 542 n. 1, (2d Cir.2005). However, to the extent that Lin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief could be construed to argue, as he did in front of the BIA, that he feared torture after illegally departing China, the claim fails because Lin offered no evidence, other than his own statement, that he would be tortured for leaving China illegally. Accordingly, there is nothing in the record to suggest that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary regarding Lin\u2019s CAT claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">We have considered all of the petitioners\u2019 claims and find them to be without merit. The petition for review is therefore DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
