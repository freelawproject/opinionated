We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts in this case, the relevant procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Guaman\u2019s arguments that the remedial opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), cannot, consistent with the <em>ex post facto </em>principle of the Due Process Clause, be applied retroactively to his case and that the Due Process Clause requires sentencing factors to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt are foreclosed by our recent opinion in <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 524-26 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Guarnan, however, objected below to the application of the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because Guarnan preserved his claim, we remand this case to the district court to resentence in conformity with <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, and <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2005). We address the sentencing issue raised by Guarnan because it may impact resentencing. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 (2d Cir.2005) (addressing defendants\u2019 sentencing argument in order to facilitate the district court\u2019s task on remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Guaman\u2019s argument that the district court erred by imposing a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) for having reentered the country illegally after a conviction for a crime of violence is without merit. Guarnan previously pled guilty to attempted rape in the second degree, in violation of N.Y. Pen. L. \u00a7 130.30, which prohibits a person who is \u201ceighteen years old or more\u201d from \u201cengag[ing] in sexual intercourse with another person less than fifteen years old.\u201d \u201cCrime of violence,\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines provision at issue, includes attempted statutory rape. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), cmt. (nn.1(B)(iii), 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction of the district court is AFFIRMED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
