We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review adverse credibility findings for substantial evidence, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review. The IJ denied relief on the ground that Lin was not credible. Lin presented inconsistent accounts of his interactions with police, and the agency adequately considered his explanations regarding these discrepancies. <em>See Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1256 (9th Cir.2003) (upholding IJ\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s explanation for inconsistency was unlikely). The record does not compel a contrary conclusion. <em>See id. </em>at 1259 (so long as one of the identified grounds is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of the claim of persecution, the Court is bound to accept the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-24\">In the absence of credible testimony, petitioner failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b740-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
