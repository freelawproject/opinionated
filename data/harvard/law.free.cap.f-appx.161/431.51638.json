She thus could not continue receiving benefits under the \u201cany gainful work or service\u201d test in the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">The district court, in a comprehensive and thoughtfid 51-page Memorandum and Order entered on July 15, 2004, granted summary judgment on the claim for wrongful termination of benefits after deciding that the plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying continuation. Evans appeals <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-21\">We have reviewed the briefs and pertinent portions of the record. We AFFIRM, essentially for the reasons carefully explained by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-18\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR.
