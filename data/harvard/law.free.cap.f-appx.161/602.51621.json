Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 757, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we ordered a limited remand to determine whether the district court would have sentenced Rosas differently had it known that it was not bound by the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Paladino, </em>401 F.3d 471, 481 (7th Cir.2005). The district judge has replied stating that he would like the opportunity to resentence the defendant in light of the now-advisory nature of the guidelines. Specifically, Judge Randa informed this court that, had he known that the guidelines were advisory at the time Rosas was sentenced, he \u201cwould have looked at the sentencing differently and taken into consideration the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553.\u201d We invited the parties to file arguments concerning the reasonableness of the sentences, however, neither party accepted that invitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-23\">Because the district court\u2019s statement evinces plain error in Rosas\u2019 sentence, <em>see United States v. Askew, </em>417 F.3d 648, 649 (7th Cir.2005), we hereby VACATE Rosas\u2019 original sentence and REMAND this matter to the district court for resentencing. <em>See Paladino, </em>401 F.3d at 484.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
