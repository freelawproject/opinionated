It is</p>\n<p id=\"b35-31\"><em>Ordered and Adjudged </em>that the order of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Kenneth Diggs appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion attacking his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Diggs argues that his 1995 conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 860(a) was tainted by the Government\u2019s knowing use of perjured testimony at his trial, requiring the conviction to be set aside under <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Specifically, Diggs claims that the Government\u2019s narcotics expert, Johnny St. Valentine Brown, committed perjury with respect to his employment status by stating that he was at the time \u201cemployed by the Metropolitan Police Department\u201d (\u201cMPD\u201d), having been \u201crehired\u201d three days after his retirement. In fact, Diggs contends, Brown had not been \u201crehired\u201d by MPD in any official capacity, but rather was serving only as an unpaid consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We conclude that this case is controlled by <em>United States v. Gale, </em>314 F.3d 1 (D.C.Cir.2003). An examination of Brown\u2019s testimony in its full context reveals that, to the extent that Brown misstated his employment status, his misstatements were corrected by his subsequent testimony. Brown initially testified that he was \u201crehired\u201d by MPD and was \u201cback in the same posture\u201d as a \u201cDetective Grade One, assigned to the Narcotics and Special Investigations Division,\u201d the job that he held prior to his retirement. On further questioning by the prosecutor, however, Brown clarified that he had been retained only as a \u201cnarcotics consultant,\u201d not as a \u201cDetective Grade One.\u201d Diggs does not contend, and could not in light of <em>Gale, </em>that Brown testified falsely by claiming he was a \u201cnarcotics consultant.\u201d Accordingly, we think that Brown\u2019s initial use of the terms \u201crehired\u201d and \u201cemployed,\u201d though misstatements in light of his status as an unpaid consultant, did not rise to the level of perjury, because he clarified that he had been \u201crehired\u201d only as a \u201cconsultant.\u201d Moreover, as in <em>Gale, </em>we do not think there is \u201cany \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 that any gap between Brown\u2019s statements and perfect truth on [this matter] could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d 314 F.3d at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Diggs alternatively contends that he is entitled to discovery to determine whether Brown made other false statements at his trial. Rule 6(b) of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts requires that requests for discovery in such proceedings specifically detail the interrogatories and requests for admission proposed and the documents sought. The advisory committee notes explain that the purpose of this requirement is \u201cto advise the [district] judge of the necessity for discovery and enable him to make certain that the inquiry is relevant and appropriately narrow.\u201d In this case, Diggs never submitted the specific requests required by Rule 6(b). Accordingly, we find that Diggs did not adequately present his discovery requests to the District Court or preserve them for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
