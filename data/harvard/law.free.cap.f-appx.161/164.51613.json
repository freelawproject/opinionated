We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">In its August 27, 2003 order, the BIA concluded that Sepulveda had not met his burden of proof for establishing that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel in his removal proceedings. The BIA reiterated, in its December 10, 2003 order, that Sepulveda had not met his burden of proof and also stated that it had no authority to extend the deadline for filing a visa application necessary for adjustment of status under \u00a7 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). We need not reach the issue of whether the filing deadline in \u00a7 245(i) is a statute of repose or a statute of limitations subject to equitable tolling or whether <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief would be available in the circumstances of this case. In the absence of any documentary evidence establishing the existence of an 1-130 application prepared in 1999 and in light of the fact that Sepulveda and his wife attest only that they \u201cbegan preparing\u201d the 1-130 application with their attorney\u2019s paralegal at that time and that Sepulveda\u2019s wife indicated, in the 1-130 application filed in April 2002, that she had not previously filed such an application, we agree with the BIA that Sepulveda has not met his burden of proving his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"ARi\">For the foregoing reasons, Sepulveda\u2019s petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
