(\u2018Weeks Marine\u201d) petitions this Court for review of an August 25, 2004 order of the Benefits Review Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) reversing a forfeiture order issued against respondent Alfred J. BrisMe (\u201cBriskie\u201d) under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 <em>et seq. </em>We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">On March 3, 2005, the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs at the United States Department of Labor (\u201cDirector\u201d), who is also a respondent in this case, filed a motion to dismiss the petition for review on the grounds that our Court lacks jurisdiction to review the petition in its current posture. Specifically, the Director maintains that the Board failed to issue its decision within one year of the \u201cfiling\u201d of Briskie\u2019s appeal to the Board, as is required by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 (\u201cAppropriations Act of 2004\u201d), Pub.L. No. 108-199, 118 Stat. 3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board issued its decision on August 25, 2004 (one day before the one-year anniversary of the Board\u2019s receipt of Briskie\u2019s notice of appeal), rather than by August 18, 2004 (the one-year anniversary of the <em>effective </em>\u201cdate of filing\u201d provided for under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 802.207(b)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Director maintains that, pursuant to the Appropriations Act of 2004, the July 23, 2003 decision of ALJ Romano in favor of Weeks Marine was automatically affirmed as of August 18, 2004, and, consequently, the August 25, 2004 decision of the Board reversing the ALJ is a nullity. As a result, the Director argues, the Board\u2019s decision is not appeal-able and Weeks Marine lacks standing to challenge the ALJ\u2019s decision issued in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-14\">However, even assuming that the date for the \u201cfiling of the appeal\u201d referenced in the Appropriations Act of 2004 is synonymous with the \u201cdate of filing\u201d of a notice of appeal under 20 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>\u00a7 802.207(b), the facts presented here demonstrate that Briskie, as well as Weeks Marine, justifiably relied on the Board\u2019s mistaken conclusion that the date of \u201cfiling\u201d was August 26, 2008, the date the Board <em>received </em>Briskie\u2019s notice of appeal, rather than August 18, 2003, the date Briskie <em>mailed </em>his notice of appeal to the Board. <em>See Briskie v. Weeks Marine, Inc., </em>No. 03-0796, Decision &amp; Order, at 4 n. 4 (BRB Aug. 25, 2004) (stating that \u201cthe Board is required to issue its decision within one year of the date [that] claimant\u2019s appeal was filed on August 26, 2003\u201d). We conclude that Briskie should not be required to bear the harsh consequences of the Board\u2019s apparent error under these circumstances. The filing date established by \u00a7 802.207(b) is designed to preserve an aggrieved party\u2019s right to appeal an ALJ\u2019s decision to the Board when the appeal would otherwise be untimely; it should not in turn operate to deprive that party <em>of </em>any effective remedy before this Court, at least where all of the relevant parties operated on the assumption that the Board\u2019s decision was indeed appealable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we deny the motion of the Director (joined by Weeks Marine) to dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">With respect to the merits of the issues presented, we reject Weeks Marine\u2019s contention that the Board erred in deferring to the Director\u2019s interpretation of the operative statutory phrase\u2014 specifically, a \u201cdisabled employee\u201d under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(j)(l) \u2014 as \u201can employee to whom [an employer] is paying compensation,\u201d <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.285. To the extent that the statute does not clearly define the precise outer limits of what constitutes a \u201cdisabled employee,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the agency\u2019s regulation construes that term \u2014 and thus fills the \u201cimplicit\u201d gap left by Congress \u2014 in a manner that is both \u201creasonable and permissible.\u201d <em>See Coke v. Long Island Care at Home, Ltd., </em>376 F.3d 118, 126 (2d Cir.2004); <em>see also Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (stating that where \u201cthe legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit rather than explicit ____ a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency\u201d). We therefore defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statutory scheme it is charged with administering. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Based on our independent assessment of the parties\u2019 submissions, the applicable case law, and the record on appeal, we conclude that Weeks Marine has failed to demonstrate either (1) that the Board erred in concluding that Briskie was not a \u201cdisabled employee\u201d subject to the reporting requirements and forfeiture penalties outlined in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(j), or (2) that the Board erred in considering the merits of Briskie\u2019s challenge to the February 11, 2002 forfeiture order of ALJ Brown, as well as the July 23, 2003 decision of ALJ Romano. We therefore deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">We have carefully considered all of the arguments of Weeks Marine and find each of them to be without merit. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated by the Benefits Review Board, the petition for review is DENIED, as a result of which the August 25, 2004 Decision and Order of the Benefits Review Board awarding Briskie permanent partial disability benefits is affirmed. Moreover, for the reasons stated above, the motion to dismiss of the Director and Weeks Marine is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\">. The Act of 2004 provides in relevant part that a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-9\">decision pending a review by the Benefits Review Board for more than 1 year shall be considered affirmed by the Benefits Review Board on <em>the 1-year anniversary of the filing of the appeal, </em>and shall be considered the final order of the Board for purposes of obtaining a review in the United States courts of appeals....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">Pub.L. 180-199, 118 Stat. at 234 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\">. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.285 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-12\">(a) Date of receipt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-15\">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a notice of appeal is considered to have been filed only <em>as of the date it is received </em>in the office of the Clerk of the Board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-16\">(b) Date of mailing. If the notice of appeal is sent by mail and the fixing of the date of delivery as the date of filing would result in a loss or impairment of appeal rights, it will be considered to have been filed <em>as of the date of mailing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-17\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.285 (emphases added). In this case, the date of mailing referenced in \u00a7 702.285(b) served as the operative date for the filing of Briskie\u2019s appeal to the Board because his appeal would otherwise have been untimely under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) were the date of filing calculated as the date of receipt under \u00a7 702.285(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b209-5\">. Moreover, even if we were to dismiss the current petition for review, because Briskie justifiably relied on the Board\u2019s error and Weeks Marine failed to object to the timeliness of the Board\u2019s decision- \u2014 -indeed, appealing the Board\u2019s decision as if it were the final agency order \u2014 we would toll Briskie's time to file a valid petition for review challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision as the final agency order. We decline to adopt this approach, however, inasmuch as it would unduly delay the resolution of the issues squarely presented here and deprive our Court of the full benefit of the agency\u2019s considered deliberations, as reflected in the already-issued decision of the Benefits Review Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b209-6\">. We conclude that the plain language of 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908(j)(l) and 902(10) does not conclusively support either the broad construction of \"disabled employee\u201d offered by Weeks Marine, defining a \"disabled employee\u201d as any employee who suffers an \"injury\u201d or files a claim under the LHWCA, or the more limited construction offered by the Director, defining a \"disabled employee\u201d only as those employees who are actually receiving disability compensation benefits at the time they receive a request for earnings information under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908(j)(1). Indeed, the Director\u2019s brief appears to be inconsistent on this very issue. <em>Compare </em>Br. for the Fed. Resp't at 33 (\"[A] \u2018disabled employee\u2019 is an individual engaged in maritime employment whose wage-earning capacity is adversely affected (presumed or proven) by an injury and who is therefore <em>entitled </em>to compensation.\") (emphasis added), <em>with id. </em>at 34 (\"[T]he 'disabled employee\u2019 referenced in \u00a7 908(j) is an employee who <em>receives </em>compensation for his lost wage-earning capacity pursuant to the applicable \u00a7 908 payment provision.\u201d) (emphasis added). <em>See also id. </em>at 43 (acknowledging \"that the bare phrase, without more, may be uninstructive as to its scope.\u201d); <em>Briskie, </em>No. 03-0796, Decision &amp; Order, at 8 n. 8 (stating that \"the term standing alone is susceptible to the interpretation given it by the administrative law judge, as well as to other interpretations\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
