The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the petition for review be granted and the case vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (\u201cWPS\u201d) petitions for review of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s initial and rehearing orders dismissing WPS\u2019s complaint. In those decisions, FERC upheld the determination by the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (\u201cMISO\u201d) that WPS was not entitled to merger of two partial path transmission reservations because WPS was a party to only one of the underlying transmission service agreements and merely the beneficiary of the other. WPS, which had relied on the combination of the two paths for transmission to its customers, argues, among other things, that MISO\u2019s refusal to merge the paths departed from prior applications of \u00a7 10.3 of its Business Practices in similar circumstances. Specifically, WPS asserts that \u201cMISO worked with WPS to merge an identical transmission reservation transaction (involving the merger of a point-to-point and network reservation) between WPS and Manitoba Hydro and has likely merged others with other customers.\u201d Req. for Rh\u2019g at 16. Yet FERC\u2019s rehearing order failed to explain, or even to acknowledge, these allegations of differential treatment and denied WPS\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing. As a result, we grant the petition, vacate, and remand to FERC so that it may respond or hold an evidentiary hearing. <em>See, e.g., PSEG Energy Resources &amp; Trade LLC v. FERC, </em>360 F.3d 200, 205 (D.C.Cir.2004) (remanding \u201c[b]e-cause FERC\u2019s failure to respond cogently to [petitioner\u2019s] argument ... requires granting the company\u2019s petition\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
