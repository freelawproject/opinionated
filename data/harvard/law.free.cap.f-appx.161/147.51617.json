We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a short opinion affirming the IJ\u2019s decision, in part, and modifying it in part, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s opinion as modified by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). The BIA fails to mention whether it agreed with two of the three reasons cited by the IJ as supporting his adverse credibility finding, and raises a different issue for the first time. Because we cannot tell whether the BIA intended to modify the analysis of the IJ or merely to supplement it, we will analyze each of the reasons given by both the BIA and the IJ for disbelieving the petitioner\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79; <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">The IJ and BIA agreed that Kasongo did not provide a persuasive explanation for failing to mention his wife\u2019s rape in his asylum application, despite bringing it up in his later affidavit and testimony. The IJ speculated that Kasongo later added this detail to \u201cbolster\u201d his asylum claim. In his asylum application, Kasongo stated, \u201c[W]hen Mr. Kabila\u2019s security force come to our house looking for me, and when they heard that I was left, ... they were very angry about it, questionned [sic] my familly [sic], beat up and burned our house in Congo there.\u201d In his testimony, however, Kasongo stated, \u201cMy wife said what had happened. And her face had said something but didn\u2019t speak. It is hard for me to speak it, but I will tell you. She was crying and she couldn\u2019t tell me. And afterwards, she told me that she had been raped by the military.\u201d Thus, the discrepancy is between his original statement that his family was beaten up, and his later statement that his wife was raped. Kasongo\u2019s psychologist summarized Kasongo\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>mental health as \u201cextremely emotionally frag\u00fce ... and a classic presentation of posttraumatic stress disorder.\u201d In light of the psychological evaluation, the discrepancy between the words \u201cbeat\u201d and \u201crape\u201d is insufficient to support an adverse credib\u00fcity finding. It is an isolated, minor inconsistency, for which Kasongo offered a reasonable explanation, and his testimony was otherwise consistent, rational, and believable. <em>See Diallo, </em>282 F.3d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In its decision, the BIA found Kasongo not credible for the additional reason that he had faded to explain why he did not mention being beaten in his asylum application. However, this is a complete mischaracterization of the evidence. The IJ never once mentions that Kasongo was beaten in either his findings of fact or credibility assessment. The BIA appeared to draw the finding that Kasongo was beaten from the government\u2019s closing statement, but the transcript is devoid of any testimony to that fact, and the government\u2019s response briefs to the BIA and this Court contain no mention of beatings suffered by Kasongo. Kasongo testified that he was part of a UDPS demonstration that was dispersed when soldiers began shooting at people, but he never said that he was beaten. This was the only direct encounter with government forces to which Kasongo testified. Flawed analyses of testimony which are used to support adverse credibility determinations, such as here, cannot satisfy the substantial evidence standard. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 307 (citing <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990)). Therefore, the adverse credibility determination must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For the same reasons, there are flaws in the IJ\u2019s additional reasons for finding the petitioner not to be credible. The IJ faults the petitioner for having at least some proficiency in English in face of the fact that petitioner \u201cindicated several times to the Court that he did not speak, nor understand, the English language but for a few words.\u201d To the contrary, the petitioner\u2019s testimony to that effect was far more tempered. When asked by the IJ: \u201c[D]o I understand that you don\u2019t understand any English at all, sir?\u201d the petitioner responded only: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me.\u201d Obviously, based on his behavior during the hearing, the petitioner understood some of what was being asked him in English, and according to the IJ, he attempted to answer certain questions before they were translated. That fact does not undercut the credibility of petitioner\u2019s statement that said only that understanding English was difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The IJ also disbelieved the petitioner because he produced documents that had been stored in his house, which the IJ said had been burned down. In doing so, the IJ misapprehended the fact that the house suffered damage, but had not been leveled. As the petitioner explained, the neighbors had come to the family\u2019s assistance and removed items from parts of the house that were not destroyed by the fire that the soldiers had set.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">Kasongo failed to raise his claim for withholding before the BIA, and failed to raise his claim for CAT relief before either the BIA or this Court. This Court, therefore, lacks jurisdiction to review either claim because Kasongo did not exhaust his remedies before the BIA. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA with a recommendation that it remand to the IJ for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
