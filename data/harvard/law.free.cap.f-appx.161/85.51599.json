We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision where, as here, the BIA summarily adopted or affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews an IJ\u2019s finding, including past persecution and well-founded fear of persecution findings, under the substantial evidence standard, and as such, \u201ca finding will stand if it is supported by \u2018reasonable, substantial, and probative\u2019 evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>see also Damko v. INS, </em>430 F.3d 626, 2005 WL 3209452 at *5 (2d Cir. Nov.30, 2005). The IJ\u2019s findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to find otherwise. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4). The BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s application of law to undisputed facts are reviewed <em>de novo. See Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161,165 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">As the IJ correctly noted in this case, a government does not commit persecution simply by requiring its citizens to perform military service, or punishing them for failure to serve. <em>See Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Foroglou v. Reno, </em>170 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir.1999); <em>Mojsilovic v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 743, 746-47 (7th Cir.1998). Forced conscription can constitute persecution if (1) the applicant would be subject to a disproportionate punishment for failing to serve, on account of a protected ground, or if (2) the military is one that has been condemned by the international community for human rights abuses and would require the asylum applicant to commit human rights abuses. <em>See Islami, </em>412 F.3d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>The applicant has the burden to prove that he in fact suffered past persecution. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B). In this case, Cako failed to provide sufficient evidence that military deserters in Macedonia are subject to severe punishment. There is no evidence in any of the documents in the record, including U.S. Department of State Country Reports and articles from human rights groups, that military conscripts are subject to severe punishment for fleeing. Accordingly, the IJ properly determined that Cako failed to meet his burden of proof that he fell within the first exception set forth in <em>Islami </em>The IJ also properly found that Cako failed to prove that the Macedonian military was engaging in human rights abuses that were condemned by the international community. <em>See Islami, </em>412 F.3d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The IJ found that Cako was credible but held that Cako\u2019s fear was not objectively reasonable because he failed to prove that he would be persecuted on account of one of the enumerated grounds if he returned to Macedonia. As discussed above, the documents in the record do not discuss what type of punishment a draft evader might be subject to in Macedonia. Even if draft evaders do face punishment in Macedonia, the documents do not show whether Cako would be persecuted on account of any of the enumerated grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Because Cako did not sufficiently address the denial of his withholding of removal and CAT claims before the BIA or in his brief to this Court, challenges to these forms of relief are deemed abandoned and waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). One conclusory statement in a brief is not sufficient to raise an issue. <em>Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 545 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Accordingly, the petition is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
