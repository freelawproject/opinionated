Helton, </em>115 Fed. Appx. 687 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (unpublished). Following our judgment, Helton filed a petition for certiorari. The Supreme Court granted Helton\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our judgment, and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We now reconsider the matter in light of <em>Booker </em>and decide to reinstate our previous judgment affirming Helton\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Helton raised a Booker-related challenge to his sentence for the first time on direct appeal. Because Helton never raised a <em>Booker </em>objection in trial court, however, Appellant\u2019s claim would fail under the plain-error test discussed in <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-22 (5th Cir. 2005). There is no indication that the district court, if given the opportunity to treat the guidelines as advisory only, would have imposed a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">For the reasons stated above, our prior disposition remains in effect, and we REINSTATE OUR EARLIER JUDGMENT affirming Helton\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
