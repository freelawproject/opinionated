He contends that, in light of <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence is unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Cunningham asserts on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable because he presented mitigating factors at the sentencing hearing to support a lower sentence. Although the Sentencing Guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court \u201cmust consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court). The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2005), and then impose a sentence. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005) (applying <em>Booker </em>on plain error review). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In sentencing Cunningham, the district court considered the properly calculated advisory Sentencing Guideline range and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Because the court sentenced Cunningham within the advisory Guideline range and within the twenty-year statutory maximum, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), we conclude that the sentence is reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm Cunningham\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
