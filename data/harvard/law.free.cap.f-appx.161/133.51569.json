We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">In order to be eligible for asylum, an applicant must show that he or she is a refugee by establishing that he \u201cis unable or unwilling to return to [his home country] because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 one of five enumerated grounds: \u201crace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42); <em>see also Liao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>293 F.3d 61, 66 (2d Cir.2002). We review an IJ\u2019s findings under the substantial evidence standard, and therefore \u201ca finding will stand if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We can reverse only by concluding that no reasonable factfinder could have failed to find that Zou established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See, e.g., Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir.2004). Additionally, \u201cwhere the agency\u2019s determination is based on an inaccurate perception of the record, ... we may remand for reconsideration or rehearing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">In this case, we believe that the IJ\u2019s decision, as affirmed by the BIA, was based on an inaccurate perception of the record. The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination seems to have been based primarily on the erroneous perception that Zou had definitively testified that she became pregnant in June of 2000. The IJ reasoned that this was inconsistent with Zou\u2019s testimony that she had missed her menstrual periods in April and May of 2000, and with her testimony that at the time of her allegedly forced abortion in August of 2000, she was visibly pregnant. In her testimony, however, Zou stated that she <em>discovered </em>her pregnancy in June.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Zou\u2019s testimony that she discovered her pregnancy in June is consistent with her having missed menstrual periods in April and May, and with her having been visibly pregnant by August (by which time she would have been approximately four months pregnant). Furthermore, apart from commenting during Zou\u2019s testimony that his own preference when he felt \u201cill and nauseous\u201d was \u201cto get sick inside,\u201d the IJ failed to explain why he found implausible Zou\u2019s testimony that her boyfriend\u2019s neighbors discovered her pregnancy when they saw her vomiting outside after being unable to control herself. Additionally, although the IJ expressed doubt that Zou\u2019s physician would have told her, in August 2000, that she was about four months pregnant without conducting an ultrasound, Zou testified that the physician came to this estimate after she informed him that she had begun missing her menstrual periods in April. The IJ did not explain why he found this testimony implausible. Finally, the IJ\u2019s finding that Zou\u2019s testimony was \u201cvery general and meager, and unspecific\u201d is not sufficient to support his adverse credibility determination. <em>See, e.g., Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 400 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that an \u201cIJ can dismiss an applicant\u2019s testimony as too vague to satisfy his burden only if it does not identify facts corresponding to each of the elements of one of the refugee categories of the immigration statutes\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">We note that the IJ also based his decision, in part, on the fact that Zou\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the information contained in the State Department\u2019s country profile. This alone, however, cannot support the IJ\u2019s decision, given Zou\u2019s testimony as to the particular circumstances of her case. As this Court has previously explained, where a State Department report \u201csuggests that, in general, an individual in the applicant\u2019s circumstances would not suffer or reasonably fear persecution in a particular country, the immigration court may consider that evidence, but it is obligated to consider also any contrary or countervailing evidence with which it is presented, as well as the particular circumstances of the applicant\u2019s case demonstrated by testimony and other evidence.\u201d <em>Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">For these reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-11\">. The transcript indicates that, in the -various colloquies between the IJ and Zou, there was clearly some confusion as to the distinction between when Zou <em>became </em>pregnant and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>when she <em>discovered </em>her pregnancy. For example, the following interchange occurred between the IJ and Zou:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">Q. Ma\u2019am, when did you become pregnant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-13\">A. In the mainland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-14\">Q. No, ma\u2019am. Please listen to the question. When is it that you discovered that you were pregnant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-15\">A. It was in June, year 2000.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
