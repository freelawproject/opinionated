Chaney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there were no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning whether the district court erred when it sentenced Chaney as a career offender and as an armed career offender. Chaney filed a pro se supplemental brief, raising additional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The <em>Anders </em>brief and Chaney\u2019s pro se supplemental brief were filed after <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and prior to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). While Chaney\u2019s counsel makes general arguments as to the propriety of the district court\u2019s sentence, he does not reference either <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker. </em>Because this is an <em>Anders </em>appeal, we nonetheless consider the impact of those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">As Chaney did not assert a <em>Blakely </em>or Boo/cer-type issue in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>416 F.3d 298, 300 (4th Cir.2005). To establish a Sixth Amendment error occurred during sentencing, a defendant who entered a guilty plea must show that the district court imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum allowed based only on the facts to which he admitted. <em>Id. </em>However, this court has recognized an exception to the general rule in that a district court may enhance a sentence based on the \u201cfact of a prior conviction\u201d regardless of whether or not it was admitted to by the defendant or found by a jury. <em>See United States v. Thompson, </em>421 F.3d 278, 282, 283-86 (4th Cir.2005). Such enhancement will not constitute Sixth Amendment error if the facts necessary to support the enhancement \u201cinhere in the fact of conviction\u201d rather than being \u201cextraneous to it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">We find Chaney\u2019s arguments regarding his sentence are foreclosed by <em>Thompson. </em>Chaney does not dispute he has at least three prior convictions qualifying as \u201cviolent felonies\u201d and that they were \u201ccommitted on occasions different from one another.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2000). Because the facts necessary to support the enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(B) (2002) \u201cinhere in the fact of conviction,\u201d there is no error under <em>Blakely, Booker, </em>or their progeny. <em>See Thompson, </em>421 F.3d at 283, 287 &amp; n. 5; <em>see also United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that the armed career criminal designation based on prior convictions does not violate <em>Booker), cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005); <em>United States v. Collins, </em>412 F.3d 515, 521-23 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that, when the facts are undisputed, the application of the career offender enhancement falls within the exception for prior convictions). As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have thoroughly reviewed the record for any potential sentencing claims and conclude that Chaney is not entitled to relief under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">With regard to the remaining issues raised in Chaney\u2019s pro se supplemental brief, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not cognizable on direct appeal unless the record conclusively establishes ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). To allow for adequate development of the record, claims of ineffective assistance generally should be raised in a proceeding commenced pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). After comprehensive inquiry, the district court properly concluded that Chaney\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Moreover, there is no reference to Chaney\u2019s other claim that his right to self-incrimination was violated. In fact, Chaney offers nothing but his bare allegations in support of this con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>tention. Because the record does not conclusively establish counsel was ineffective in this regard, we decline to review this claim on direct appeal since the claim should be brought in a \u00a7 2255 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Chaney\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw <em>from </em>representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
