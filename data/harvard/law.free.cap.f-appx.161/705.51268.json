We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>Reyes v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 592, 595 (9th Cir.2004), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Assuming that Zapeta-Osorio did not waive his challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration by failing to raise it in his-brief, <em>see Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259 (9th Cir.1996), we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied reconsideration. Zapeta-Osorio alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, but did not comply with any of the procedural requirements of <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and did not identify ineffective assistance that is plain on the face of the record. <em>See Reyes, </em>358 F.3d at 597. He also failed to allege an error of law or fact, the discovery of new evidence, or a change in circumstances. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b734-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
