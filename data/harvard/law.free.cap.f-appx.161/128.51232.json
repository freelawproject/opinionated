The IJ rejected the petitioner\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a), 1231(b)(3), and denied relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), adopted Dec. 10, 1984, S. Treaty Doc. No. 100-20 (1988), 1465 U.N.T.S. 85; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Ordinarily, this Court reviews the order of the BIA rather than that of the IJ. <em>Yang v. McElroy, </em>277 F.3d 158, 162 (2d Cir.2002). However, where, as here, the BIA issues a short opinion that primarily adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision rather than the BIA\u2019s. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">The IJ correctly concluded that petitioner did not establish entitlement to asylum. Chen\u2019s claim, essentially, is that she fears persecution because she refuses to marry a well-connected man from her village. While we sympathize with Chen\u2019s situation, it is not persecution \u201con account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d so as to establish eligibility for asylum under 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(42). Although Chen testified that her parents were persecuted under the one-child policy, Chen did not establish a connection between her parents\u2019 situation and her own predicament. Finally, Chen\u2019s argument that her refusal to marry this man will be construed as a political opinion and will lead to future persecution under the one-child policy is simply too tenuous, given that Chen is currently unmarried and childless and has never had any run-ins with family planning officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">For these same reasons, the IJ properly concluded that Chen could not meet the higher burden of establishing eligibility for withholding of removal. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 306. Lastly, because Chen has not challenged in this Court, nor in the BIA, the IJ\u2019s denial of her application for CAT relief, she has waived any challenge to that portion of the BIA\u2019s order. <em>See, e.g., Yueqing-Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that CAT claim was waived because it was not discussed in the appellate brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-15\">We have considered all of the petitioner\u2019s claims and find them to be without merit. The petition for review, and motion for stay, are therefore DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
