Provident Life Insurance Co., </em>No. 04-55406, and <em>Faragi v. Provident Life Insurance Co., </em>No. 04-55156. In each case the District Court upheld a denial of long-term disability benefits utilizing an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). In each case Appellants argue for the first time on appeal that discretionary clauses in disability insurance policies (clauses that purport to give the insurer, as claims administrator, \u201csole and exclusive discretion\u201d to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan) are unconscionable and therefore unenforceable under California law. We take judicial notice of the recent decisions of the California Department of Insurance (\u201cCDI\u201d) interpreting California Insurance Code \u00a7 10291.5 and withdrawing approval of policies containing such clauses.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>We do not believe that the possible implications of the CDI\u2019s withdrawal of approval of discretionary policy terms should be addressed and resolved for the first time on appeal. We are concerned, however, that a failure to address the issue at all could result in a miscarriage of justice in these two cases. We therefore consolidate these two cases for the limited purpose of issuing this order, VACATE the judgments and REMAND to the respective District Courts to permit the parties the opportunity to develop the record and offer arguments regarding the viability of discretionary clauses under California insurance law and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>Should the District Courts conclude that the clauses granting discretion are invalid, they should reconsider the denial of benefits de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b678-12\"> Specifically, we grant the following motions seeking judicial notice: (1) Appellants' request to take judicial notice of (a) the CDI\u2019s Letter Opinion issued February 26, 2004; (b) the CDI\u2019s Notice to Withdraw Approval issued February 27, 2004; (c) the CDI\u2019s letter to Judge William Alsup, United States District Court, dated March 24, 2004; and (d) the CDI\u2019s Response to Petitioners\u2019 Opening Briefs In the Matter of Withdrawal of Policy Form Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>proval For: Unum Life Insurance Company of America et al., filed on June 25, 2004.
