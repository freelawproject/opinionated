We assume familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal. This Court reviews a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, </em>162 F.3d 724, 729 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">A Rule 60(b) motion is granted only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances, and cannot be used to relitigate the merits. <em>Nemaizer v. Baker, </em>793 F.2d 58, 61 (2d Cir.1986). Liu cites Rule 60(b)(3), claiming that the district court\u2019s judgment should be vacated because defendants defrauded the district court. A party seeking vacatur under Rule 60(b)(3) must establish the opposing party\u2019s fraud by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Fleming v. New York Univ., </em>865 F.2d 478, 484 (2d Cir.1989). Liu provides no such evidence. The 60(b) motion merely labeled several of defendants\u2019 trial maneuvers as fraudulent, neither explaining, or providing support as to why these maneuvers were fraudulent, or providing evidence in support. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Liu\u2019s 60(b) motion to vacate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
