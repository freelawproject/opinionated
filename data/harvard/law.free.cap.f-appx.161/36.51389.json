We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">The IJ properly denied relief based on an adverse credibility finding that is supported by substantial evidence. Specifically, the IJ noted that Zhang was unable to provide detailed testimony about key events, such as his wife\u2019s allegedly coerced use of an IUD and the imposition of a fine on Zhang for having a second child. In addition, the IJ concluded that Zhang\u2019s testimony that he remained in bed when family planning officials raided his home was unbelievable. In sum, the IJ provided \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d for finding Zhang to be incredible, and those reasons \u201c[bore] a legitimate nexus to\u201d his asylum and withholding of removal claims. <em>Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-16\">For these reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, and the decision of the BIA is AFFIRMED. Having completed our review, the stay of deportation previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
