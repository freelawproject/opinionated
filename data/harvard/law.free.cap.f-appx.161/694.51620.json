Where, as here, the BIA issues a separate decision, the court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision and those portions of the IJ\u2019s decision expressly adopted by the BIA. <em>Molinar-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo, Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871, 876 (9th Cir.2002), while findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence, <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1203 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">1. Petitioner cannot show that substantial evidence compels the conclusion that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of her Pentecostal religious beliefs. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir.1988). Although Petitioner experienced acts of violence while in her country of origin, she failed to show that these acts of violence, if rising to the level of persecution, were \u201con account of\u2019 her religion. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 482-83, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">2. We decline to consider Petitioner\u2019s Convention Against Torture (CAT) claim because she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Following the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Petitioner had not presented evidence to support her CAT claim, Petitioner failed to pursue the appeal of the CAT claim before the BIA. Hence, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s CAT claim. <em>Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 713, 721 (9th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to <em>or by </em>the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
