His sentence followed his guilty plea to a single offense of conspiring to file false income tax claims, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 286. In connection with his guilty plea, Mondell entered into a plea agreement with the Government, which included several sentencing stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">On appeal, Mondell contends that the district court erred in cross-referencing \u00a7 2T1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, because that provision was not included in the plea agreement\u2019s sentencing stipulations. As Mondell acknowledges, however, the agreement expressly provides that \u201c[t]he Defendant understands that these stipulations are not binding upon the Court.\u201d J.A. 19. On these plain terms, the court was not bound by the plea agreement\u2019s sentencing stipulations, and we must accordingly affirm Mondell\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions of this appeal are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid us in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
