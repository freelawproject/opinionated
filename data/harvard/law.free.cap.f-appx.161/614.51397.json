Henderson was sentenced to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment. On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support Henderson\u2019s drug convictions. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-18\">This court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, resolving evidentiary conflicts in favor of the government, and accepting all reasonable inferences that support the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Ramirez, </em>350 F.3d 780, 783 (8th Cir.2003). We hold that the evidence was sufficient to support Henderson\u2019s convictions. Regarding the count for possession with intent to distribute, the evidence sufficiently established that, on October 29, 2003, Henderson possessed a plastic bag containing a beige rock-like substance which tested positive for cocaine base and weighed over 50 grams. Henderson\u2019s intent to distribute the substance was sufficiently established in light of the testimony of cooperating witnesses regarding his extensive drug-dealing activities, the drug quantity, and the cash recovered from him at the time of his arrest. <em>See United States v. Brett, </em>872 F.2d 1365, 1370 (8th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Cir.) (intent to distribute may be inferred from circumstantial evidence such as quantity of drugs and large amount of cash), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 932, 110 S.Ct. 322, 107 L.Ed.2d 312 (1989). The cooperating witnesses\u2019 testimony also amply supported Henderson\u2019s conviction on the conspiracy count. <em>See United States v. Galaviz-Luna, </em>416 F.3d 796, 799 (8th Cir.) (evidence including cooperating witnesses\u2019 testimony regarding defendant\u2019s drug-dealing activities held sufficient to support drug conspiracy conviction), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 814, 163 L.Ed.2d 640 (2005) (No. 05-7396).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Henderson\u2019s motions for appointment of new counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-14\">.
