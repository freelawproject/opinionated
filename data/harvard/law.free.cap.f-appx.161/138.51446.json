The BIA\u2019s initial affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision, which Wang failed to appeal, is not directly before us. Familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>facts and the procedural history of the case is presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider one of its previous decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>See Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir.2004) (citing <em>Brice v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>806 F.2d 415, 419 (2d Cir.1986)). A motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s decision and be supported with pertinent authority. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. DOJ, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In this case, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Wang\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Wang contends that the BIA overlooked three errors cited in his motion to reopen: the IJ\u2019s reliance on the State Department country profile, the IJ\u2019s belief that the authorities only issue abortion certificates for voluntary abortions, and the BIA\u2019s characterization of Wang\u2019s testimony as inconsistent without specifying the relevant inconsistencies. The first two alleged errors, however, were raised in his initial appellate brief and considered by the BIA, which nonetheless affirmed solely on the strength of Wang\u2019s testimonial inconsistencies. With respect to the third ground, Wang offered no argument or legal authority in support of his contention that it was error for the BIA to adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, which was based on enumerated inconsistencies: namely, those in Wang\u2019s account of the number of abortions his wife was forced to undergo and whether or not they were fined for violating China\u2019s family planning policy. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
