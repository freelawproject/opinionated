He argues that the district court erred in only considering the claims raised in his \u201cpetition for amended habeas corpus,\u201d and failing to consider and adjudicate the claims raised in his previously filed \u00a7 2254 petition because he did not understand the legal distinction between an amended filing and a supplemental filing, and his <em>pro se </em>pleading must be held to a less stringent standard than those filed by a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-21\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas petition, we review questions of law <em>de novo. LeCroy v. Sec\u2019y, Florida Dept. of Corr., </em>421 F.3d 1237, 1259 (11th Cir.2005). This court has held that \u201c[p]ro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Trawinski v. United Technologies, </em>313 F.3d 1295, 1297 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-22\">A review of Beaver\u2019s filings in the district court shows that he was attempting to supplement his original \u00a7 2254 petition when he filed his \u201cpetition for amended habeas corpus,\u201d and not to abandon his previously raised claims. The district court erred in failing to liberally construe Beaver\u2019s motion as a motion to supplement his petition and to consider same.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-23\">VACATED AND REMANDED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
