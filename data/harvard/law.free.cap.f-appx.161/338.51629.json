The Sekeons petition for review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order denying their request for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> They claim that the Board erred in affirming the immigration judge\u2019s denial of their applications for withholding of removal. \u201cTo qualify for withholding of removal, a petitioner must show that he faces a clear probability of persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 324 n. 13 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). Based on our review of the record, we find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that the Sekeons have failed to meet this standard. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b366-19\"> The Sekeons do not challenge the Board\u2019s denial of the asylum claim as untimely or the denial of protection under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
