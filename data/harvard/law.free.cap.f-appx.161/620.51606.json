Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 975, 988-89 (8th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">Ritos also claims he is entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3), which is not subject to a one-year filing deadline. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that Ritos is not entitled to withholding of removal because he failed to demonstrate a clear probability that he would be persecuted on one of the enumerated grounds if removed to Greece. <em>See Taum v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 740, 744 (8th Cir.2004). Ritos also failed to carry his burden for relief under the CAT because he has not shown that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he returns to Greece. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-22\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-33\">.
