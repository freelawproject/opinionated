Soto Caro claimed that he was persecuted by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d), a Colombian guerrilla group, because of his involvement with Liberal Party politics in Colombia. The BIA found that Soto Caro was not credible because he: (1) lived in the United States, and was not directly involved in Colombian politics, for most of the three years preceding the time when he claimed the FARC began to threaten him; (2) testified that he was kidnaped by the FARC and that he told his wife about it, although she did not report the kidnaping in the judicial denouncement she submitted to the Colombian police regarding the FARC\u2019s threats against their family; and (3) admitted that his home was vacant for nearly an entire year before FARC graffiti appeared on the building, although he alleged that the graffiti was a threat against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">On appeal, Soto Caro argues that the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination was erroneous because Soto Caro presented testimony that was both internally consistent and consistent with his written application, without embellishment. Soto Caro contends that the adverse credibility finding did not go to the heart of his asylum claim, and that his testimony and the record establish that he suffered past persecution and that it is more likely than not that he will be persecuted upon his return to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Our review focuses strictly on the BIA\u2019s decision, \u201cexcept to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Here, we review the BIA\u2019s decision, as well as the IJ\u2019s, since a portion of the IJ\u2019s reasoning was incorporated into the BIA\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The BIA\u2019s \u201cfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial evidence test,\u201d and we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Antipova v. United States Attorney General, </em>392 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Likewise, we review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Forgue v. United States Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005). Substantial evidence is lacking only in those cases where the petitioner can carry the burden of establishing that the evidence of record was \u201cso compelling that no reasonable fact finder could [have] fail[ed] to find\u201d the petitioner qualified for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>I.N.S. v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">\u201cThe trier of fact must determine credibility, and [we] may not substitute [our] judgment for that of the IJ with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed v. United States Attorney General, </em>388 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2004). Adverse credibility determinations must be made explicitly. <em>See Yang v. United States Attorney General, </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s credibility decision was not supported by \u2018specific, cogent reasons\u2019 or was not based on substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">As an initial matter, Soto Caro cites several new pieces of evidence, describing conditions in Colombia, for the first time on appeal. We may not consider evidence outside the administrative record. INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>Therefore, we do not consider Soto Caro\u2019s new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Soto Caro argues on appeal that he presented evidence of political activity, and resulting threats against him by the FARC, that was sufficient to demonstrate past persecution on account of his political opinions and a well-founded fear that his political opinions would cause future persecution if he returned to Colombia. An alien may obtain asylum if he is a refugee within the meaning of INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A). INA \u00a7 208(b)(1)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A). A \u201crefugee\u201d includes any person who is unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of, the country of his nationality or where he last habitually resided, because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An alien is entitled to asylum if he can establish, with specific and credible evidence: (1) past persecution on account of political opinions or other statutorily listed factor; or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that his political opinions or other statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287. Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">We have indicated that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). If an alien is unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, \u201che is generally precluded from qualifying for either asylum or withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Soto Caro\u2019s oral testimony and written evidence were inconsistent regarding his claim that he was persecuted because of his political activities in Colombia. Given the Id\u2019s calculation that Soto Caro spent the majority of the time during which he claimed to be persecuted in Colombia actually residing in the United States, the alleged persecution seems unlikely. The lack of corroborating evidence, either in the form of a police report or other testimony, supporting Soto Caro\u2019s alleged kidnaping and the supposed threats in graffiti made at his home, also belies his claim of persecution. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s factual determinations and the finding that Soto Caro was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">In light of the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility findings regarding much of Soto Caro\u2019s testimony, the remaining evidence does not compel a finding that Soto Caro was threatened by the FARC, as a result of his political activity, at a level that would qualify as past persecution or establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because Soto Caro has failed to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>reversible error. Accordingly, Soto Caro\u2019s petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b959-8\">. An alien shall not be removed to a country if his life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. INA \u00a7 241(b)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3).
