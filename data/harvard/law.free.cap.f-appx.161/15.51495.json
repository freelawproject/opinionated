R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. R. 34(j). The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C. Cir. R. 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b43-20\">Ordered and Adjudged that the order of the District Court be affirmed for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-21\">The defendant argues that the district court erred in declining to apply Section 5C1.2 of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (the \u201csafety valve\u201d) in determining her sentence. That provision allows a court to disregard any statutory minimum if, among other things, \u201cthe defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct.\u201d Following her arrest for the sale of narcotics, Ms. Waldrop initially was cooperative and forthcoming about her guilt. At the outset of Waldrop\u2019s plea hearing, the government stated that, <em>\u201cwithout forcing </em>me <em>to take a final position </em>right now, I believe Ms. Waldrop does qualify for treatment under 5C1.2.\u201d 4/10/03 Tr. at 11-12 (emphasis added). The trial judge also stated that \u201cwhat the government is saying now ... does not govern the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At that point, neither the court <em>nor </em>the government had committed to a particular position regarding the safety valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-22\">Later, during the plea hearing, Waldrop stated that her husband \u201chad nothing to do with this.... He wasn\u2019t even there.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24. In light of the police reports and planned testimony from an undercover officer indicating that Waldrop\u2019s husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>was not merely present but actually involved in the drug transactions, there was ample evidence to support a finding that Waldrop was not speaking \u201ctruthfully\u201d at this point. The government, not having committed or bound itself in any way to a position on Waldrop\u2019s safety-valve eligibility, argued at sentencing that her insistence upon her husband\u2019s innocence disqualified her from receiving the benefits of that provision. 9/11/03 Tr. at 3-4. The burden was on Waldrop to show that she qualified under \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>216 F.3d 18, 29 (D.C.Cir.2000). After conducting a hearing, the court agreed with the government that Waldrop failed to carry this burden. The court\u2019s judgment is amply supported by the evidence, and the finding upon which it rests certainly is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Pursuant to Rule 36 of this Court, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C. CIR. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
