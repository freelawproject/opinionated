Kaplan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b129-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">UPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Brieant, J.) is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Plaintiff-appellant Harry Zirlin appeals from the judgment of the district court. He argues that the court erred in denying his pre-trial motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 and dismissing his claims under <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Zirlin appeals also from the district court\u2019s denial of his post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its relevant procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Zirlin argues that the female motorist\u2019s tip that there was a man in the woods with an open knife did not \u201cexhibit[ ] sufficient indicia of reliability,\u201d <em>Florida v. J.L., </em>529 U.S. 266, 270, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), to give rise to reasonable suspicion to justify the investigating officers\u2019 decision to stop and frisk him. Zirlin\u2019s reliance on <em>Florida v. J.L. </em>is misplaced. In <em>J.L., </em>the Supreme Court held that an anonymous \u201ccall made from an unknown location by an unknown caller\u201d who reported that a young, black male in a plaid shirt standing at a particular bus stop was carrying a gun did not bear sufficient indicia of reliability to give rise to reasonable suspicion on the part of the investigating officers. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, the tipster was not fully anonymous; she remained at the scene after the tip was reported, and when Sergeant Pobereskin arrived, she conveyed her tip to him directly. Although the tipster did not identify herself by name, she placed herself in a position where she could easily be identified and held accountable for her intervention. Her tip was thus endowed with sufficient indicia of reliability to give rise to reasonable suspicion on the part of the investigating officers. <em>Id. </em>at 276 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (contrasting a truly anonymous tip from a tip conveyed to a police officer from an unnamed individual at the scene); <em>United States v. Bold, </em>19 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir.1994) (describing our reasoning in <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>945 F.2d 47, 50-51 (2d Cir.1991), that a \u201cface-to-face informant must be thought more reliable than an anonymous telephone tipster, for [the] former runs the greater risk that he may be held accountable if his information proves false\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-12\"><em>Zirlin </em>argues that even if the tip was reliable, the possession of a knife is not a crime and that the police had no reason to suspect he was \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d In the totality of the circumstances \u2014 including the reliability of the informant\u2019s tip, the fact that a knife can be a deadly weapon, and the fact that the investigating officers were aware of a recent, hostile dispute at a sanitation plant bordering the woods \u2014 there is no question that the investigating officers were \u201cwarranted in the belief that [their] safety or that of others was in danger.\u201d <em>United States v. Rahman, </em>189 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir.1999) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, we have held that when a police officer believes that an individual poses a safety threat, the officer is permitted \u201cto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>take necessary measures ... to neutralize the threat without converting a reasonable stop into a <em>de facto </em>arrest.\u201d <em>United States v. Newton, </em>369 F.3d 659, 674 (2d Cir.2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original). Although a lawful seizure may \u201cbecome unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete the mission,\u201d <em>Muehler v. Mena,</em>\u2014U.S.-,-, 125 S.Ct. 1465, 1471, 161 L.Ed.2d 299 (2005) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the incidents at issue here lasted no more than a few minutes and merely enabled the police to determine that Zirlin posed no immediate threat to their safety or his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Zirlin further argues that the district court erred when it informed the jury that officers may conduct <em>Terry </em>stops if they have reason to believe they are dealing with an \u201carmed or dangerous individual.\u201d Zirlin has failed to make the requisite showing that this instruction infringed his \u201csubstantial rights\u201d or that it seriously affected \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Zirlin argues also that the district court improperly dismissed his <em>Monell </em>claims. Because we have identified no constitutional violation in this case, we decline to reinstate these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">We have considered Zirlin\u2019s additional arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons discussed, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
