We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts in this case, its relevant procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Sheikh\u2019s argument that a district court violates the Sixth Amendment when it calculates an advisory Guidelines sentence, as we held it is required to do in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 112 (2d Cir.2005), with enhancements based on facts not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>413 F.3d 201, 220 n. 15 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cjudicial authority to find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence survives <em>Booker\u201d </em>and that, under advisory Guidelines, a sentencing court may find facts relevant to sentencing without violating the Sixth Amendment); <em>see also United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 525-26 (2d Cir.2005) (rejecting claim that the Due Process Clause requires that a defendant be sentenced only in accordance with facts proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
