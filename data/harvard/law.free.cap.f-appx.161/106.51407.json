We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178-83 (2d Cir.2004); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 306-13 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 286-88 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In this matter the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Lin\u2019s application for asylum was based in large part on adverse credibility determinations. These adverse determinations, given the explanations provided by the IJ, were seriously flawed in that they were based on rank speculation. Although this court must refrain from substituting its view of the evidence for that of the hearing officer who actually considered it, <em>see Qiu v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 140, 149 (2d Cir.2003) (Factual findings supporting a denial cannot be assumed on the basis of record evidence not relied on by the BIA), we do note that had the IJ been more thoughtful in crafting her decision, there would be ample support in the record on which to base an adverse credibility determination and to deny the asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Although the IJ\u2019s opinion falls short in its rationales for finding that the petitioner is not credible, there is \u201cno realistic possibility of a different result on remand.\u201d <em>see Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391 (2d Cir.2005). For that reason we will not reject outright the IJ\u2019s conclusion where the futility of a remand would support affirming the result despite legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Lin\u2019s application for asylum must fail because he did not establish a nexus between the alleged persecution and his political opinion. While Lin could have argued that the Chinese government had imputed the same political opinion as practitioners of Falun Gong because Lin sold Falun Gong books, Lin failed to do so. In his appeal to the BIA, Lin mentioned in only one sentence that he had established \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion, namely, the right to sale [sic] Falun Gong books.\u201d Likewise, his brief before this Court states only that he testified \u201che suffered wrongful punishment and threats of detention for being associated with Falun Gong.\u201d Moreover, Lin stated in his asylum application that the officials tried to arrest him because he \u201cinsulted\u201d them and \u201cacted against the Communist Party.\u201d It is clear that, according to Lin\u2019s claim, the officials knew Lin and his father had illegally sold Falun Gong books; however, the single statements in Lin\u2019s briefs do not adequately develop an argument that the officials targeted Lin because of imputed political opinion. Because Lin failed to establish this nexus, he cannot meet his burden that he was persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution on account of his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">To the extent that Lin has failed to meet his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum, he accordingly fails to satisfy the more stringent standards of his withholding claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Because Lin failed to raise the issue of CAT relief in his appeal to the BIA, this Court does not have jurisdiction to review this claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Theodoropoulos v. INS, </em>358 F.3d 162 (2d Cir.2004) (finding that where exhaustion is required, a court must dismiss any unexhausted claim for lack of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
