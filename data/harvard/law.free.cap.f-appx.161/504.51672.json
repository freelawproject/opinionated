Anderson now appeals. Because the Board\u2019s decision was not arbitrary and capricious, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-18\">During her 14-year employment with Emerson, Anderson was a Participant in Emerson\u2019s retirement plan. Under the Plan, \u201cactive Participants\u201d who attain age 40 with at least ten years of credited service and who become disabled are entitled to a $100 per month disability pension. Anderson\u2019s employment terminated in 1995 when she became disabled. At that time Anderson had accumulated over 14 years of credited service but was only 33 years old \u2014 seven years too young to qualify for a disability pension. She sought and received disability benefits under the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">About eight years later, after Anderson turned 40, she contacted Emerson about receiving the $100-per-month disability pension under the Plan. A plan adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>trator informed Anderson she was ineligible because she did not meet the age requirement \u201cat the time of [her] disability.\u201d Anderson appealed this determination to the Board, which agreed that Anderson was ineligible, stating: \u201cEach of the [eligibility] conditions must be satisfied at the time the disability commences.\u201d The district court upheld the Board\u2019s denial of benefits, and Anderson filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s ruling, applying the same legal standard as the district court. <em>See Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare Sys., Inc., </em>150 F.3d 609, 613 (6th Cir.1998). A district court applies the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review to an ERISAplan administrator\u2019s decision regarding benefits where, as here, \u201cthe plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Darland v. Fortis Benefits Ins. Co., </em>317 F.3d 516, 527 (6th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Under the arbitrary and capricious review standard, the administrator\u2019s determination will be upheld if \u201cit is \u2018rational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marks v. Newcourt Credit Group, Inc., </em>342 F.3d 444, 457 (6th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Borda v. Hardy, Lewis, Pollard &amp; Page, P.C., </em>138 F.3d 1062, 1066 (6th Cir.1998)). Put another way, \u201c[a] decision is not arbitrary and capricious if it is based on a reasonable interpretation of the plan.\u201d <em>Shelby County Health Care Corp. v. S. Council of Indus. Workers Health &amp; Welfare Trust Fund, </em>203 F.3d 926, 933 (6th Cir.2000). Moreover, a reviewing court \u201cmust accept a plan administrator\u2019s rational interpretation of a plan even in the face of an equally rational interpretation offered by the participants.\u201d <em>Morgan v. SKF USA, Inc., </em>385 F.3d 989, 992 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Under Plan Section 6.1, to be eligible for a disability pension Anderson must be \u201c[a]n active Participant who shall have attained at least age 40, who has at least 10 years of Pension Credited Service, and who becomes permanently and totally disabled, as set out in Section 6.2.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dispute here is over <em>when </em>the age requirement of Section 6.1 must be satisfied. Anderson contends she can become \u201ctotally and permanently disabled\u201d prior to her fortieth birthday and still qualify for a disability pension upon reaching the required age. Emerson, on the other hand, insists the age requirement must be satisfied before the onset of the triggering disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Anderson first argues Emerson\u2019s interpretation is arbitrary and capricious because it unreasonably requires her to satisfy an unwritten eligibility requirement \u2014 attaining age 40 <em>before </em>becoming disabled \u2014 in order to receive a disability pension. Emerson acknowledges it may not deny benefits by imposing a condition not encompassed within the Plan documents, <em>see Jones v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., </em>385 F.3d 654, 661 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cDiscretion to interpret a plan ... does not include the authority to add eligibility requirements to the plan.\u201d), but contends the Plan language already expresses the eligibility requirement in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">The grammatical structure of Plan Section 6.1 states the age requirement as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>condition precedent to the disability requirement: \u201cAn active Participant who <em>shall have attained </em>at least age 40, ... and who <em>becomes </em>permanently and totally disabled, ... shall receive a [disability] pension.\u201d (emphasis added). Use of the future perfect tense (\u201cshall have attained\u201d) expresses the idea that one event will occur before another in the future. Emerson interprets the combination of the future perfect tense with the present tense (\u201cbecomes\u201d) to mean that to be eligible, Anderson must have attained the age of 40 before she becomes disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Although Emerson\u2019s interpretation may be open to debate, under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review we uphold it if it is reasonable. Here we judge reasonableness by whether the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation adheres to the language of the plan \u201cas it would be construed by an ordinary person.\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>385 F.3d at 992 (citing <em>Shelby County Health Care, </em>203 F.3d at 934). And \u201c[w]e must accept a plan administrator\u2019s rational interpretation of a plan even in the face of an equally rational [differing] interpretation.\u201d <em>Morgan, </em>385 F.3d at 992 (citing <em>Ross v. Pension Plan for Hourly Employees of SKF Indus., Inc., </em>847 F.2d 329, 334 (6th Cir.1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Although Anderson argues that \u201cthe Plan could have included language stating that a participant must be 40 years old at the time of disability in order to qualify for benefits,\u201d she is wrong to conclude that the absence of such specificity renders the administrator\u2019s interpretation unreasonable. Anderson offers no alternative reading of Section 6.1 that would prove Emerson\u2019s reading untenable. Nor does she point to other sections of the Plan that are ignored or rendered meaningless by Emerson\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Anderson also complains that the district court erred by upholding the Board\u2019s decision on a ground not originally offered by the Board. Specifically, she contends that the district court\u2019s sole rationale for its decision was reading the term \u201cactive Participant\u201d to mean \u201ca current employee of the Company,\u201d whereas the Board\u2019s stated rationale was that the age requirement was a condition precedent to disability. Emerson correctly responds that this \u201cnew rationale\u201d was instead only an explanation offered to defend the rationality of its denial decision. <em>See Gallo v. Amoco Corp., </em>102 F.3d 918 (7th Cir.1996) (\u201cWhen challenged in court, the plan administrator can defend his interpretation with any arguments that bear upon its rationality. He cannot augment the administrative record with new facts ..., but he is not limited to repeating what he told the applicant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Finally, Anderson contends that interpreting the term \u201cactive Participant\u201d to only encompass current employees renders the Plan\u2019s promise of a disability pension illusory and thus is arbitrary and capricious. Plan Section 6.1 mandates that an active Participant become \u201cpermanently and totally disabled\u201d in order to receive a disability pension, and Plan Section 6.2 states that in order to satisfy the definition of \u201cpermanently and totally disabled,\u201d a Participant must suffer a disabling injury while employed and must also currently be receiving disability benefits under the Social Security Act (\u201cSSDI\u201d). As Anderson\u2019s argument goes, because one who is receiving SSDI necessarily is not employed, no Participant will ever receive a disability pension under Emerson\u2019s Plan interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Anderson\u2019s argument ignores a plain reading of the Plan\u2019s language, which does not require a Participant receive SSDI while employed in order to receive disability-pension payments, but rather creates a two-step process for determining disabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ty-pension eligibility. The first step is to determine whether an active Participant satisfies the disability-pension eligibility requirements, including suffering a disabling injury, <em>while </em>employed. At the second step the date SSDI payments begin sets the commencement date for disability-pension payments under the Plan. Importantly, this interpretation allows a Participant to qualify for a disability pension <em>after </em>leaving employment, so long as she meets the eligibility requirements <em>while </em>employed. The Plan\u2019s promise of a disability pension is not illusory; the Plan includes no requirement that a Participant be employed when SSDI payments commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\">. Plan Section 6.2, in turn, provides that a Participant is \"permanently and totally disabled\" only if: \"a) while employed by the Employer he or she has been totally disabled by bodily injury or disease ... and b) he is eligible for and is receiving disability benefits under the Social Security Act.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
