A search of Diaz\u2019s house, pursuant to a warrant, yielded 751 packets of heroin, weighing 23.5 grams, and a loaded .25 caliber pistol. Diaz pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute within 1,000 feet of a school in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(a). The Presentence Investigation Report calculated Diaz\u2019s sentencing range at 188 to 235 months, using an offense level of 31 and criminal history category VI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">Prior to sentencing, Diaz moved for downward departure from the recommended sentence pursuant to (1) U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4A1.3 (2001), on the grounds that his criminal history category significantly overstated the seriousness of his criminal history; (2) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 and <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), based on the conditions of his confinement; and (3) U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 and <em>United States v. Sally, </em>116 F.3d 76 (3d Cir.1997), based on his claims of postconviction rehabilitation. The government opposed Diaz\u2019s motions, but moved for downward departure based on his cooperation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. At a sentencing hearing on March 19, 2003, Judge Newcomer granted the government\u2019s motion, denied Diaz\u2019s motions, and sentenced Diaz to 180 months imprison<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ment, 6 years supervised release, a $2,500 fine and a special assessment of $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On appeal, Diaz argues that Judge Newcomer did not adequately explain the basis for his denial of Diaz\u2019s downward departure motions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The government responds that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal because the decision whether to grant Diaz\u2019s motion was within the Judge\u2019s discretion. However, because we conclude that Diaz\u2019s appeal raises questions under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Diaz did not respond to our initial letter notifying him of his right to raise <em>Booker </em>claims. We sent a second letter directing Diaz to comment on the applicability of <em>Booker </em>to his case, and Diaz responded that he wishes to be resentenced in light of <em>Booker. </em>Diaz\u2019s failure to raise a <em>Booker </em>issue within the time specified in our first letter, while regrettable, \u201cis not fatal\u201d to his appeal. <em>United States v. RamirezErregun, </em>149 Fed. App\u2019x 111, 113 (3d Cir. 2005). Because such claims are \u201cquestion[s] of law that require[ ] no additional findings of fact,\u201d and failure to address them would result in miscarriages of justice, <em>see United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 162, 164 (3d Cir.2005) (en banc) (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s substantial rights may have been affected where the District Court erred by treating the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory.\u201d), we retain discretion to consider them even if they have been waived. <em>Ramirez-Erregun, </em>149 Fed.App\u2019x at 113 (citing <em>Bagot v. Ashcroft, </em>398 F.3d 252, 256 (3d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In <em>United States v. Davis, </em>we held that defendants sentenced under the mandatory guideline regime whose sentences were on direct appeal when <em>Booker </em>was decided are entitled to a remand for resentencing pursuant to <em>Booker. Davis, </em>407 F.3d at 165. Applying <em>Davis </em>here, we will vacate Diaz\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-12\">. The PSI recommended, based on Diaz\u2019s three prior controlled substance convictions, that Diaz should be sentenced as a career offender within the meaning of U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 4B 1.1 (2001). As a result of this recommendation, Diaz\u2019s base offense level, before a three-level acceptance of responsibility reduction, was enhanced from 22 to 34, and his criminal history category was increased from V to VI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b231-23\">.
