He contends that the introduction of this evidence did not meet the admissibility requirements under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) and denied him a fair trial. The error, if any, was harmless. <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>235 F.3d 1173, 1178-79 (9th Cir.2000) (erroneous evidentiary rulings are reversed only if the \u201cerror more likely than not affected the verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">The prosecution presented abundant evidence of Gilbreath\u2019s guilt, including marijuana and drug paraphernalia found in Gilbreath\u2019s bathroom, Gilbreath\u2019s admission that he owned the charged weapons, and Gilbreath\u2019s admission to the agents that the marijuana was his and that he regularly smoked marijuana once or twice a week. As a result, the introduction of his prior marijuana possession did not materially affect the verdict. The trial judge provided cautionary instructions when the prior incident was mentioned. Further, the government neither accused Gilbreath of lying about the earlier incident, nor did it state that Gilbreath had been arrested as a result. Consequently, given the substantial evidence of Gil-breath\u2019s guilt and the consistent use of limiting instructions, any error, in briefly introducing Gilbreath\u2019s prior marijuana possession, was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Gilbreath challenges the denial of his motion to suppress, arguing initially that he did not voluntarily consent to the search of his apartment. After considering the evidence, the district court reached the opposite conclusion. This factual finding is reviewed for clear error, <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Preciado, </em>399 F.3d 1118, 1126 (9th Cir.2005), and the district court\u2019s determination is amply supported by the record. The voluntariness of a suspect\u2019s consent is determined from the totality of the circumstances, and the relevant factors support the trial court\u2019s finding. <em>United States v. Patayan Soriano, </em>361 F.3d 494, 501-02 (9th Cir.2004). There was evidence that the agents informed Gilbreath that they did not have a search warrant, that no threats were made, and that Gilbreath signed a consent form which explained his right to refuse consent. In light of the evidence, the district court\u2019s finding was not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">Gilbreath\u2019s alternative scope-of-consent argument is similarly unpersuasive. The question of \u201c[w]hether a search went beyond the scope of a suspect\u2019s consent is a determination reviewed for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Perez, </em>37 F.3d 510, 515 (9th Cir.1994). The description on the consent form of the property to be searched listed Gilbreath\u2019s address. The district court found that Gilbreath consented to a search of his entire apartment \u201cfor any type of guns he might have.\u201d This search would have reasonably encompassed items that could fit within the disputed container, like a small pistol, a disassembled gun or its parts. In addition, the consent form explicitly stated: \u201cI understand that any contraband or evidence of a crime found during the search can be seized and used against me in any court of law or other proceeding.\u201d Therefore, the district court could have reasonably found that Gilbreath\u2019s consent extended to this container. Moreover, Gilbreath\u2019s \u201c[fjailure to object to the continuation of a ... search after giving general consent to search \u2018is properly considered as an indication that the search was within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>of the initial consent.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cannon, </em>29 F.3d 472, 477 (9th Cir.1994) (citation omitted); <em>see also Perez, </em>37 F.3d at 516. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s determination was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Gilbreath also argues that his incriminating statements should have been suppressed because the agents failed to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. This argument is without merit. There is substantial support in the record for the district court\u2019s findings that Gilbreath was told he was not under arrest and was free to go, that he was neither handcuffed nor physically restrained, and that he was questioned in a public setting. These findings were not clearly erroneous, and they support the denial of Gilbreath\u2019s suppression motion. <em>See United States v. Kim, </em>292 F.3d 969, 973 (9th Cir.2002) (factual findings underlying district court\u2019s \u201cin custody\u201d decision are reviewed for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b729-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publi: cation and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.

After review of the record, we conclude that this argument is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
