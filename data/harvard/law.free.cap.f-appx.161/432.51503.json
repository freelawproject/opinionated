Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997). <em>Jerome v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 101, 63 S.Ct. 483, 87 L.Ed. 640 (1943), does not affect this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-28\">Lozano\u2019s constitutional challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Lozano contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Lozano properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Lozano contends that his sentence must be vacated because he was sentenced pursuant to mandatory sentencing guidelines that were held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He asserts first that the error in his case is reversible because the error is structural and is insusceptible of harmless error analysis. Contrary to Lozano\u2019s contention, we have previously rejected this specific argument. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">In the alternative, Lozano contends that the Government cannot show that the error that occurred at his sentencing was harmless. We review Lozano\u2019s preserved challenge to his sentence for harmless error under Fed.R.Ckim.P. 52(a). <em>Walters, </em>418 F.3d at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Lozano was sentenced at the bottom of the guideline range, and the district court provided no commentary regarding the sentence that it imposed. The record provides no indication, and the Government has not shown, that the district court would not have sentenced Lozano differently under an advisory guidelines system. <em>See United States v. Garza, </em>429 F.3d 165, 170-71 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Lozano\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and his case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Lozano\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED; Lozano\u2019s sentence is VACATED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b460-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
