R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order, filed August 25, 2004, dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, be affirmed. Given appellant\u2019s assertions, that President Bush, former President Clinton, unnamed \u201cJane and John Does,\u201d and the United States Navy gave appellant\u2019s brother cancer and thereby caused his death, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint as frivolous. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(1); <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 327, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
