We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Where, as here, the BIA fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision or issues a so-called \u201caffirmance without opinion,\u201d we review only the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d. Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Jin Hui Gao v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>400 F.3d 963, 964 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73-79 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Daku\u2019s testimony was incredible. The IJ noted that Daku testified that he was in Greece for \u201ctwo or three months\u201d until the police apprehended and deported him back to Albania, but in his written statement he claimed that he was in Greece for \u201cfive or six months\u201d until he returned on his own accord. The IJ also properly analyzed, then rejected as incredible, Daku\u2019s attempt to explain the discrepancy. The IJ further noted that Daku testified, that in September 1998, his father participated in a demonstration in Albania for which he was arrested, detained and beaten by the police. However, Daku\u2019s written application states that the police simply approached his father, asked him whether he had participated in the demonstration, then left without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">These two significant inconsistencies constitute cogent reasons for a finding of adverse credibility that bear a legitimate nexus to Daku\u2019s overall claim. Additionally, other than his incredible testimony, Daku has provided little evidence to support his claim. Accordingly, Daku has failed to establish eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal or relief under the CAT. For the foregoing reasons, Daku\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
