PeraltaCabrera was charged with deportability as an alien who entered the United States without inspection, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a)(1)(B) (1994) (current version at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a), (b)(1)). His traveling companion telephoned his brother-in-law who lived in Chicago, Florentine Arias, and asked him to come to O\u2019Hare and help them seek their release.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-25\">According to Peralta-Cabrera, he told the INS agents who arrested him that he would stay with Arias once released. After Arias arrived, he spoke with the INS agents and provided the following address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>where the INS could contact Peralta-Cabrera: \u201c841 West Cornelia, Chicago, Illinois 60657.\u201d However, Arias did not specify that mail should be sent to PeraltaCabrera \u201cin care of\u2019 Arias.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">On August 10, 1994, the immigration court issued notice that Peralta-Cabrera\u2019s deportation hearing was scheduled for November 23, 1994; the notice was sent to Peralta-Cabrera via certified mail and addressed to him at \u201c841 West Cornelia, Chicago, Illinois 60657.\u201d The notice was returned to the immigration court <em>on </em>August 12, 1994, bearing the postal stamp \u201cAttempted Not Known.\u201d Peralta-Cabrera did not appear at the November 23 deportation hearing, and an IJ ordered him removed <em>in absentia. </em>The court then mailed a copy of the IJ\u2019s decision to Peralta-Cabrera at the same address; the decision again was returned to the immigration court bearing the stamp \u201cAttempted Not Known.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">Nearly ten years later, Peralta-Cabrera applied for adjustment of status based upon an approved employment-visa petition and moved to reopen his deportation proceedings, rescind his <em>in absentia </em>deportation order, and change venue to the immigration court in Bloomington, Minnesota. In a memorandum supporting his motion, Peralta-Cabrera asserted that service of the hearing notice was not reasonably calculated to reach him in Chicago because the INS failed to address the notice to be sent to him \u201cin care of\u2019 Arias. He argued, in essence, that it was the INS agent\u2019s responsibility to ensure that all mail sent to Peralta-Cabrera was sent \u201cin care of\u2019 Arias because the agent had constructive notice that Peralta-Cabrera was staying with Arias. Peralta-Cabrera included with his motion an affidavit attesting that he lived at the Corneila address when the immigration court attempted to mail notice of the hearing and that he never refused the delivery of any mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The IJ denied Peralta-Cabrera\u2019s motion to reopen, reasoning that it was PeraltaCabrera\u2019s responsibility to specify that his mail needed to be sent \u201cin care of\u2019 Arias, and that \u201che can be \u2018charged\u2019 with receiving notice which was sent to the only address he provided.\u201d Peralta-Cabrera appealed to the BIA, which upheld the denial of the motion to reopen, finding that the motion was sent to Peralta-Cabrera\u2019s last known address and that he received proper notice of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">On appeal, Peralta-Cabrera does not contend that the address he provided to the INS agent was incorrect; he instead argues that it was the INS agent\u2019s fault that the mail was not addressed \u201cin care of\u2019 Arias. The government, however, asks us to remand the case to the BIA in light of our recent decision <em>Sabir v. Gonzales, </em>421 F.3d 456 (7th Cir.2005), to examine whether Peralta-Cabrera can be charged with receiving notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">We accept the government\u2019s suggestion. On remand, the BIA should consider <em>Sabir </em>and determine whether Peralta-Cabrera thwarted the postal service\u2019s attempts to deliver notice to him. If the BIA concludes that Peralta-Cabrera did not thwart delivery of notice, then it should examine whether his motion to reopen should be granted on the basis that he did not receive notice in accordance with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C)(ii). Each side shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
