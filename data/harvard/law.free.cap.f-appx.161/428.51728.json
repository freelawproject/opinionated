Mutchler, </em>559 F.2d 955, 960 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-22\">Hernandez asserts that his case was similar to that of Ester Hutchinson because both cases involved smuggling contraband through the Sierra Blanca checkpoint and because Agent Angel Gomez testified in each. However, Hernandez testified in his own case and admitted the substance of Agent Gomez\u2019s testimony, i.e. that he knowingly transported illegal aliens. After that admission, the only contested issue in Hernandez\u2019s case was whether he transported aliens <em>for profit, </em>which was not an issue in Hutchinson\u2019s drug smuggling case, and to which Agent Gomez did not testify. Because there was no overlap of contested issues and because Agent Gomez\u2019s credibility was not at stake in the Hernandez\u2019s trial, we hold that Hernandez\u2019s case was not similar to Hutchinson\u2019s. <em>Cf. United States v. Brown, </em>699 F.2d 704, 708 (5th Cir.1983) (reversing defendant\u2019s conviction under <em>Mutchler </em>because credibility of government witness was at stake in defendant\u2019s trial).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-19\">. Hernandez also challenged his sentence under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). At oral argument,' however, he conceded that his <em>Booker </em>objection was moot as he had already completed his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b456-24\">. We disagree with Hernandez\u2019s argument that a common government witness by itself renders two trials similar. The cases Hernandez cites for this proposition never squarely addressed the issue of whether two cases were actually similar. <em>See e.g. United States v. Price, </em>573 F.2d 356, 363 (5th Cir.1978). We do not take their language as having implicitly answered a question explicitly left open by <em>United States v. Mutchler, </em>566 F.2d 1044, 1044 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
