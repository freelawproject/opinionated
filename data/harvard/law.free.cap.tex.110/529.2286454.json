By the provisions of that act its capital could consist of first mortgages upon unincumbered real estate in this State, the title to which was valid and whose market value was double the amount loaned thereon exclusive of buildings, unless the buildings were insured in some responsible company and the policy or policies were transferred to the corporation. Article 4711, Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">The question in the case is whether the subscribers\u2019 note and first mortgage upon the land constituted \u201cproperty actually received\u201d by the corporation, within the meaning of section 6 of article 12 of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">We held in Washer v. Smyer, 109 Texas, 398, 4 A. L. R., 1320, 211 S. W., 985, that the naked note of a subscriber to the capital stock of a corporation given in payment of his subscription was not property within the intendment of the Constitution, since it was simply his promise to pay the amount of his subscription in another form. But under the established rule of decision in this court, that contract rights transferred to a corporation in payment for stock are, to the extent of their value, \u201cproperty actually received\u201d by the corporation, Cole v. Adams, 92 Texas, 171, (46 S. W., 790)\u2014a decision whose soundness cannot be controverted\u2014a subscriber\u2019s note secured by a valid first mortgage upon real estate, accepted by the corporation in payment for stock, cannot be held as other than property in the full sense of the Constitution. The corporation thereby obtains something more than the mere promise of the subscriber to pay. It obtains the right to have the land appropriated to the payment of the note. This is a valuable right, a property right, as fully so as any contract right, and, in general, as valuable as any such right. The corporation receives it and owns it. It constitutes a distinct asset in its hands; recognized, generally, as one of the most stable, desirable and easily convertible forms of property, as instanced by the Legislature\u2019s Act authrizing. the capital of such corporations as this one to consist of such mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The right acquired under such mortgages is clearly property, and the law was therefore one within the power of the Legislature to enact.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>The judgments of the District Court and Court of Civil Appeals are reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for trial upon the issues of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
