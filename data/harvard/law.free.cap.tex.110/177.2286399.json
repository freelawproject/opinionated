Stats., arts. 5623, 5635, 5637); and this is true though he have given to such owner notice of the items and amounts of his claim as required before such owner settled with the contractor.

This reserved fund, where the contractor abandoned the work, and the owner, entitled so to do under the contract, completed the construction at a cost which, with payments already made exceeded the contract price, never became money due the contractor which could be subjected to the lien.

Wynne, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEN\">The Lecoutenr Brothers Stair Manufacturing Company, being a materialman, and having furnished material at a value of five hundred ninety and 70/100 $590.70) dollars, to the contractor for the use in, and which was used in the bank\u2019s building, and having given the bank notice, as required by law, of its claim, while there were funds in its hands, owing to said contractor, said claimant\u2019s lien, given by the Constitution was preserved, and so much of the funds in the bank\u2019s hands, owing to said contractor, as was necessary to pay the claim were impounded, and said bank, paying to said contractor, after the notice was given, more than the amount of said claim, became personally liable to claimants, notwithstanding the fact that said funds may have been paid out of the so-called 20 per cent reserve fund, because, by mutual agreement, the contractor, Bank and surety had already mutually agreed, prior to the making of the contract with claimant, that said reserve fund would be released from the reservation, and would be used in payment for labor and for material, furnished for the. completion of said building. The claimant was therefore entitled to its lien, and a judgment should have been in its favor for the amount of its debt and interest, and for the foreclosure of its lien.

T. Finn, contractor, and to foreclose a lien, for said amount, on the building and appurtenant lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The District Court denied plaintiff in error a recovery because it did not appear that the Bank owed the contractor any sum of money at or subsequent to the date of service of notice of plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>in error\u2019s claim, it appearing that no payments were made to the contractor after service of such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The District Court\u2019s conclusions of fact show that the contract between the Bank and contractor Finn authorized the Bank to retain 20 per cent, of the amount of labor and material going into the building, as estimated by' the architect, until its completion, and that prior to the service of notice of plaintiff in error\u2019s claim, the Bank and the contractor agreed for the Bank to use part of this reserve fund to pay for labor and material required to complete the building and the Bank made certain payments for such labor and material subsequent to the receipt of notice of plantiff in error\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">It further appears, from the conclusions of fact, that plaintiff in error failed to file any account in the office of the county clerk, and the Court of Civil Appeals held that such failure precluded the award to plaintiff in error of any relief sought by it against the Bank or its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The holding of the Court .of Civil Appeals was correct. We have stated our reasons for this conclusion in considering the claim of the Ingram Millwork Company for materials furnished to contractor Finn, for the Bank\u2019s building, in the case of the First National Bank of Paris, Texas, et al., v. Lyon-Gray Lumber Company et al., <em>ante, </em>p. 162, 217 S. W., 133, and refer to our opinion this day filed in that case, without restating our views.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We are also of the opinion that the conclusion of the District Court was correct, on the finding that the facts fail to show an indebtedness from the owner to the contractor, at any time after the service of notice of plaintiff in error\u2019s claim, such as was requisite to warrant holding that the Bank became liable to plaintiff in error or that plaintiff in error was entitled to enforce any lien on the Bank\u2019s property. What we said in the opinion above referred to, in considering the claims of the Texas Glass &amp; Paint Company and others is decisive on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">It follows that the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals was correct and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
