The purpose of the statutes requiring notice to the owner of material furnished to a contractor for the erection of buildings under contract on property of the owner is, that the owner may withhold from the contractor moneys that should be paid to those furnishing material, and that purpose is met when notice is given while the owner still has enough of the contract price in his hands to pay the claim.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ABY\"><em>Adams &amp; Stennis, </em>for defendant in error American Surety Co.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASYK\">In making payments to a sub-contractor, the original contractor is protected by the provision of art. 5623, confining the lien to \u201cthe material furnished at the time or subsequent to the giving of the written notice,\u2019\u2019 and by the provision of art. 5625, requiring \u201cnotice in writing of each item as the same was furnished. \u2019' Johnson v.
