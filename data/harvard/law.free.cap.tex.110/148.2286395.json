This left the contractor free to make such terms for the purchase as it chose and to change those terms in good faith. Such action did not change the terms of the surety\u2019s guaranty.

A surety company which had guaranteed payment by the contractor of all debts for materials and labor was not entitled to complain nor to claim release because of this diversion of collateral security held by the party whose debt it had guaranteed, since this was used to discharge other debts which it was equally bound to meet by its contract of guaranty.

He had previously assigned all proceeds of his contract to a surety company guaranteeing performance, including payment of his debts to laborers and material men. Held that the bank did not become subrogated to the claims of the laborers, nor was its debt protected by the bond; and being merely the holder of the junior of the equitable assignments, it was error to give its claim priority over that of the surety to the balance due the contractor, which the debtor had paid into court.

The contest, both here and on appeal, being between plaintiff in error and the First Natl.

The suit was brought by the Lion Bonding Co., joining the Engineering Co. which was only nominally interested, to enjoin the payment of the balance due by the County to the Bank or to the Yincennes Bridge Co. An action by Turney against the County, in which the Bonding Co. and others had intervened was consolidated with the injunction suit, and numerous interveners claiming liens against the property made themselves parties. These other numerous issues were settled by the judgment of the trial and of the appellate court (207 S. W., 171) and not involved in the questions on which the writ was granted and which are considered in this opinion.

It is not denied that the Bridge Company supplied the Hess &amp; Skinner Engineering Company material,- viz: steel, in the prosecution of the work covered by the contract, nor that the balance justly due therefore is $6407.09. It is contended that the Surety Company was discharged from its obligation to pay for this material to the Bridge Company on two grounds: (1), that the Bridge Company shipped the steel without requiring, one-half its cost to be paid in cash at point of shipment, when the contract between the Bridge Company and the Engineering Company entitled it to such cash payment; and; (2), that the Bridge Company, when it held an assignment of the contract from the Engineering Company, to secure the purchase price of the steel, consented for $6499.80 to be applied to claims of laborers and local merchants, and that this had the effect to reduce the surety\u2019s obligation to the Bridge Company in that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\">We do not agree with the intimation in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals that the rules which determine the rights of uncompensated sureties have no application in determining the rights of corporation sureties, who enter into contracts of suretyship for profit. One who contracts as surety for another cannot be held bound save in so far as the. law binds a surety. The views of this Court on that subject are too clearly and emphatically stated in Lonergan v. San Antonio Trust Co., 101 Texas, 77, 22 L. R. A. (N. S.), 664, 130 Am. St., 803, 104 S. W., 1061, 106 S. W., 876, to require further statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The Surety Company invokes the elementary rules that material change in the terms of a contract, on which one is secondarily liable as surety, such' as extension of time for performance, without the surety\u2019s consent, will discharge the surety from his obligation under the contract, and that the act of a creditor in releasing collateral securities so as to deprive a surety of the right to have same applied in satisfaction of the debt of the principal, guaranteed by the surety, will release the surety to the extent of the value of the securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">There never was any change in the contract guaranteed by this Surety Company. Such contract was silent as to the terms on which the material for the construction of the bridge was to be purchased. The bond in effect authorized the contractor to make his own terms, and we see no good reason why it should be held that this did not include authority, while acting in good faith, to change such terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">As. said by the Supreme Court of the United States in United States Fid. &amp; Guaranty Co. v. Golden Pressed &amp; Fire Brick Co., 191 U. S., 425, 48 L. Ed., 242, 24 Sup. Ct., 144: \u201cThe guarantor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>is ignorant of the parties with whom his principal may contract, the amount, the nature, and the value of the materials required, as well as the time when payment for them will become due. These particulars it would probably be impossible even for the principal to furnish, and it is to be assumed that the surety contracts with knowledge of this fact. Not knowing when or by whom these materials will be supplied, or when the bills for them will mature, it can make no difference to him whether they were originally purchased on a credit of sixty days, or whether, after the materials are furnished, the time for payment is extended sixty days, and a note given for the amount maturing at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">The Surety Company was liable, on the bond, for the payment of the debts to the local merchants and laborers, being essentially claims for labor in the prosecution of the work of performing the Engineering Company\u2019s contract. Hence, it sustained no injury by the Bridge Company\u2019s consent to the application of $6499.80 to satisfy such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">On April 30, 1914, the Hess &amp; Skinner Engineering Company, \u201cin consideration of the execution of said bond\u201d agreed in writing to reimburse the Lion Bonding &amp; Surety Company all amounts of money which it might pay or become liable to pay, on account of the bond\u2019s execution, and agreed that all payments specified in the bridge contract, withheld by Bastrop County until- completion of the work, should be paid to the Surety Company, and that such agreement should operate as an assignment of the payments, it being stipulated that any residue, after full reimbursement of the Surety Company, should be paid by it to the Engineering Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">On February 20, 1915, the Engineering Company gave to defendant in error, First National Bank of Smithville, its note for $500, and, on February 26, 1915, it gave to said Bank its note for $1000, for borrowed money, and to secure the payment of the notes, the Engineering Company gave the Bank an order on Bastrop County, to be paid out of the money to become due the Engineering Company on the bridge contract, and the County, acting by the County Judge, accepted the order. The Engineering Company represented to the Bank that the borrowed money was needed to pay wages of laborers, employed in the prosecution of the work of constructing the bridge, and the money was so applied. The laborers were not parties to the loans, and no assignment was taken by the Bank of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The outstanding claims for material and labor, protected by the bond other than the debt of the Bank, exceeded the amount due the Engineering Company, which was withheld by the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">On these facts the trial court gave the Bank judgment against the Surety Company, for the amount of the two notes of the Engineering Company, and also adjudged that the Bank be first paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>out of the sum of $6854.33, which had been paid into the registry of the court by Bastrop County, said sum having been withheld until completion of the work, in accordance with the terms of the bridge contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\">The Court of Civil Appeals reformed the trial court\u2019s judgment so as to deny the Bank a personal judgment against the Surety Company but affirmed the direction that the fund in the registry of the court be first applied to the payment of the Bank\u2019s debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u25a0 By proper assignment, the Surety Company challenges the correct ness of th\u00e9 judgment ordering payment of the notes to the bank out of the fund on deposit in court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals holds that though the Bank held a mere equitable assignment of sufficient of the money due the Engineering Company by the County to satisfy its notes, and though the assignment to the Surety Company was prior in time, and though the Bank was subrogated to no right of the laborers, nevertheless the Bank held an equitable claim on the money in the registry of the court superior to any right thereto of the Surety Company, for two reasons: first, that there was no consideration for the assignment to the Surety Company and the money obtained from the Bank was actually used to pay claims for labor on the bridge; and, second, that the assignee of a chose in action who first gives notice to the debtor is entitled to precedence, in determining priority between assignees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In our opinion the rule is sound, which gives priority in rank to^ equitable assignments in the order of their dates, without regard to \u00a1 notice to the debtor. Brander v. Young, 12 Texas, 335; Harris Co. v. Campbell, 68 Texas, 27, 2 Am. St., 467, 3 S. W., 243; Milmo Natl. Bank v. Convery, 8 Texas Civ. App., 181, 27 S. W., 829; Harris Co. v. Donaldson, 20 Texas Civ. App., 9, 48 S. W., 791; Henke v. Keller, 50 Texas Civ. App., 533, 110 S. W., 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">The debtor is fully protected because he is not affected by the assignment until notified, and the subsequent assignee, in dealing with a chose in action, is chargeable with knowledge that he can get no better right than that of his assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">It increases uncertainty in the law\u2019s administration to substitute the date of notice to the debtor as the test of priority for the date of assignment; and we pan see _how grave harm would follow for us to now depart from our thoroughly established simple test of priority in right from priority in time of the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-10\">The assignment to the Surety\" Company was supported by a valuable consideration. Campbell v. Grant Co. 82 S. W., 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">The case of Harris County v. Donaldson, 20 Texas Civ. App., 9, 48 S. W., 791, involved a controversy between assignees of a fund held by Harris County to pay the contract price of certain furniture. The debt of the senior assignee had no relation to the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>tract, while that of the junior assignee was for work in installing Ihe furniture under the contract. The senior assignment was given precedence, because the junior claimant \u201chad no lien upon this fund, and his rights in it arose from his assignment alone, and the assignments take rank in the order in which they were given.\u201d 48 S. W., 794. The same principle is equally conclusive here against the Bank\u2019s claim of a superior equity because of the nature of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">We agree with the conclusion of the Court of Civil Appeals that the Bank did not become subrogated to the rights of the laborers, and there can be no doubt that its debt is not protected by the bond, Gaylord v. Loughridge, 50 Texas, 577; Lion Bonding &amp; Surety Co. v. Bank, 194 S. W., 1012; People\u2019s Natl. Bank v. Corse, 182 S. W., 917; United States v. Bundle, 107 Fed., 227, 52 L. R. A., 505, 4 C. C. A., 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The Bank and the Surety Company each hold merely an equitable assignment of the fund in the registry of the court, and the Surety Company\u2019s, as the elder, must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The remaining assignments complain of rulings, in which we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals be so reformed as to deny the Bank any recovery herein, and that said judgment, as so reformed, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em>Reformed and </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
