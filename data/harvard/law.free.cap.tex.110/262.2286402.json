Time does not admit of inquiry as to a man\u2019s previous experience in fighting fire, and negligence cannot be predicated on the act of directing an employee into a place of exposure to heat, with due warning against remaining there too long, though he had only the experience of the ordinary man in regard to the danger of such exposure.

W., 120.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-16\">It was not only the right of the defendant to call upon its adult employees to aid in extinguishing a fire that threatened the destruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tion of its property, but when there was any possibility of the fire spreading to the property of others, it was the absolute duty of the defendant to use every means available to it to put out the fire, and in so doing, to call on all of its loyal employees to aid, and the fact that it did so call on its employees did not lay it open to a charge of negligence. 19 Cyc., Fires, pp. 979, 983.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-3\">It is the civic duty of every intelligent able-bodied adult male to respond without call and aid in stopping and averting the consequences of fires, floods and all other like catastrophes, and it is no more negligence to call on able-bodied adult males so to do, than it would be to call on such parties to put down a riot or protect the life of a prisoner, and negligence cannot be predicated on such a call. 19 Cyc., 979, 983.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-4\">That Bennett may not have had any special experience in fighting fires is not material. The majority of men do not have such experience. He was, however, a man over forty-one years of age, sound in body and mind, with seven years active work and experience in the bridge and building department of a railroad company, and' certainly, in the light of these facts, equipped beyond the ordinary citizen to guard himself against those dangers incident to a large fire, of which practically every intelligent adult male has knowledge. San Antonio Gas Co. v. Robinson, 93 Texas, 503; Hightower v. Gray, 83 S. W., 254; Brown v. Miller, 62 S. W., 547.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">Persons called upon to meet great emergencies, involving great danger and peril to property and person, when the situation does not allow time for mature, deliberation, are not to be charged or measured by the same rules that would apply when no emergency existed. 29 Cyc., 434; H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. v. Fowler, 56 Texas, 452.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">And certainly the inexperience, if any, on the part of an adult able-bodied male in fighting fire cannot be of avail as establishing negligence on the part of the master unless such inexperience is shown to have been known to the master, or the party acting for the master, in calling on the party injured to go into danger. G. H. <em>&amp; </em>S. A. Ry. Co. v. Hughes, 54 S. W., 266; T. &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Sherman, 87 S. W., 887.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">It is not negligence on the part of a master calling his servants to assist in fighting a fire, to do that which experience has taught to be the safe and proper thing for the protection of those fighting the fire and the thing necessary to do to enable them to fight the fire, to-wit: to throw water on them; and a charge of negligence cannot be predicated upon the fact that the master did throw water upon his employees fighting the fire at his call, to protect them from the effects of the fire and to enable them to properly discharge their duties as citizens and loyal employees. H. &amp; T. C. Ry. Co. v. Alexander, 132 S. W., 120.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-8\">The order to Bennett, if it be conceded that such order was given, implied no more than that he should render such assistance as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>he could without risk of injury to himself. There is no basis for the inference that any more than this was intended or expected, and therefore, no basis for an inference of negligence. T. &amp; N. O. R. Co. v. Sherman, 87 S. W., 887.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-3\">Though it was not shown as a fact that Bennett undertook to fight the fire acting under any order of the defendant, still if such inference can fairly be indulged in, then, under the testimony of Harry Huffman, which furnishes the only basis for such inference, it is shown that when Bennett first undertook this work, and repeatedly thereafter, he was told not to remain until he became too hot or too tired, and when he reached this point to retire and let others relieve him Any inference of negligence, therefore, that could be drawn from the further inference that Bennett fought the fire because he was commanded to do so, is destroyed by the direct proof that he was repeatedly told to have regard for his own physical well being and to quit before injury resulted to him. La. West. Ext. Ry. Co. v. Carstens, 47 S. W., 36.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-5\">The command to fight the fire was inseparably coupled with the injunction to those who undertook this work that they should not remain until they became too hot or too tired. That one should disregard a natural instinct of self-preservation, and the warning thus given, was not reasonably to have been contemplated, and the result which followed in Bennett\u2019s case was hot a proximate result, nor should the jury have been permitted to find that it was. Bennett\u2019s intervening act in so undertaking the work of fighting the fire as to expose himself to fatal injury became the proximate cause \u00f3f his death, and the negligence, if any, in commanding him to fight the fire became a remote cause. Under the undisputed evidence, the Court of Appeals should have so held as a matter of law. Seale v. Gulf C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co., 65 Texas, 274; Newsome v. S. W. T. <em>&amp; </em>T. Ry. Co., 47 S. W., 667.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-6\">A man of mature years cannot plead inexperience in a matter of common knowledge, as in this case the danger incident to fighting fire, nor can those claiming under him avail themselves of such plea. Hightower v. Gray, 83 S. W., 254; I. &amp; G. N. Ry. Co. v. Arias, 30 S. W., 446.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-7\">There was no proof to show that the defendant had knowledge of any inexperience on Bennett\u2019s part. In the absence of such knowledge, and in the exercise of ordinary care and common sense, the defendant could presume that Bennett did not lack such intelligence and experience as would have advised him fully as to the risk which he was exposed to. G. H. <em>&amp; </em>S. A. Ry. Co. v. Hughes, 54 S. W., 224.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b287-8\">The proof in this ease does not establish \u201cinexperience\u201d on the part of Bennett, as that term is used in the law. It was not necessary for Bennett to have had actual experience in fighting large nres in order that he should have been advised that the greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>the fire the greater the heat and the greater the heat the greater the risk incident to coming in close contact with it or remaining in contact with such heat too long. T. &amp; N. O. Ry. Co. v. Sherman, 87 S. W., 887; San Antonio Gas Co. v. Robinson, 93 Texas, 503.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b288-6\">Where the uncontradicted evidence of plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses established that the pouring of water on the men was the <em>proper </em>thing to do, the charge of negligence in that respect was not sustained, nor can a recover; be had for injury resulting therefrom.

The uncontradicted evidence in this case showed that the negligence of the defendant, in two well established particulars, originated and caused the great fire in the defendant\u2019s switch yards and machine shops on August 12, 1912. The uncontradicted evidence showed that this fire so originated and produced by the gross negligence of the defendant, inflicted, produced and caused the injuries to and on the deceased, which resulted in his death, and the evidence tended to and did show that the defendant should have anticipated that some injury might follow to some employee from the acts of negligence in originating this fire under all of the facts and circumstances in evidence.

The evidence in this case showed that after the deceased was ordered into the dangerously hot place, by the defendant, with directions to remain there and to aid and assist in putting out the fire, that the defendant negligently threw water upon the deceased thereby preventing the deceased from realizing the hot place in which he had been ordered, and that the defendant also negligently permitted the deceased, in this condition, to remain too long a period of time in said hot place, thereby negligently causing the injuries to deceased which resulted in his death, and with this issue of negligence raised by the pleadings and by the evidence the court peremptorily in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>strueted the jury to return a verdict for the defendant which was error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b290-4\">Primarily all questions of fact on the trial of cases are for the .jury, and unless it appears without doubt, that what would ordinarily be a question of fact as set forth from the state of the evidence, becomes a question of law, a court cannot deprive a party of his constitutional right of trial by jury by deciding such questions and peremptorily instructing verdict against plaintiff.

C. Bennett, an employee of the defendant railway company, while engaged with other employees in fighting a large fire in the yards of the company at Cleburne which threatened to destroy all the property in the yards and adjacent property as well, became overheated, with some parts of his body blistered or \u2022 burned, causing his death. The suit was one for damages on this account by his wife, as administratrix of his estate, and. 'in. her own right and for the use of their minor children.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-21\">The origin of the fire was an explosion of the gas in an empty oil tank car, caused by an employee named Campbell going into the car for the purpose of repairing it, with a lighted torch. It spread quickly to near-by sheds, and elsewhere, burned fiercely, fanned by a strong wind, for several hours, producing a general conflagration, consuming a large amount of property within the . thirty or forty acres comprising the yards of the company, and at certain stages imperilling all the property, shops, etc., in the yards. It produced, as pleaded by the plaintiffs, a condition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>great excitement and emergency. The numerous employees of the company in and about the yards, including Bennett, joined generally in the effort to subdue it. A superintendent of one of the company\u2019s departments about the shops or yards, named Dunlop, together with another official named Bird, were evidently attempting to in some measure direct the efforts of the men. The company had fire-plugs in the yards, and its own hose which the men were using. To lessen the effect of the heat upen those engaged in the immediate zones of the fire, water from the hose was thrown upon them by others. Some was thrown upon Bennett and the men immediately with him while he was helping to subdue\u00ae the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">At the direction or request of Dunlop and Bird, Bennett, with others went, at a certain stage of the fire, into the particular place where his injuries were received, a place where the fire was intense, to relieve other men\u2014to prevent their becoming too hot. About the time of this direction and while Bennett had hold of the hose at that place, Dunlop, according to the undisputed testimony of one of the men with Bennett, a witness introduced by the plaintiffs, told Bennett and his companions \u2018 not to get too hot and not to stay in there if we got tired and that if we got too hot or tired to get out and let others relieve us.\u201d \u201cThere were other men there at all times to relieve us,\u201d stated this same witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">It appears from the testimony that the water was thrown upon Bennett and the men with him, at their own request,\u2014to keep them cooled off while they were fighting the fire. The fire occurred in mid-summer, and according to other testimony, undisputed, this was the proper thing to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Bennett was a strong man, in full physical vigor. It is urged that he was inexperienced in fighting fire, but there is no proof that Dunlop or Bird knew of his being any less experienced in that regard than the average man, or that_ it would be any more hazardous for him to attempt to subdue the fire in the manner stated than it would be for the average man.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The suit was rested upon three grounds of negligence:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">1. The acts of the defendant and its employees in causing the explosion in the oil tank car, which started the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">2. Directing or commanding Bennett, an inexperienced man, to fight the fire under the existing conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">3. Throwing the water upon him while he was fighting the fire, which, it is charged, deceived him as to the extent of the heat to which he was subjected, causing him to remain too long where he was and become overheated.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">In the trial court, a verdict was directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">In our opinion there was nothing to take the case to the jury, and the action of the trial court was accordingly proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-13\">Under the authority of Seale v. Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry, Co., 65 Texas, 274, 57 Am., 602, and Texas <em>&amp; </em>P. Ry. Co., v. Bigham, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Texas, 223, 38 S. W., 162, the negligence of the defendant\u2019s employees in the origin of the fire cannot be justly regarded as the proximate cause of the injury to Bennett. The test of this question is, ought the defendant and its agents to have reasonably foreseen that as the consequence of the negligence which caused the explosion in the tank car, the injury to Bennett, or like injury to some other employee in his situation, would probably result ? In the language of Judge Gaines\u2019 opinion in the Bigham Case, nothing short of prophetic ken could have anticipated the happening of the combination of events which resulted in Bennett\u2019s becoming overheated. Ho one standing at the stage of the entire happening which had to do with the gas explosion in the tank car, could have regarded it as other than a bare possibility, at best, that at a later period of a fire thus produced in an open enclosure, an employee of the company, in attempting to extinguish it, would get so close to the fire or stay in such a situation so long as to be injured by the heat of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">It was Bennett\u2019s duty, as it was of every other employee about the premises, to assist in extinguishing the fire. Regardless of any duty, such would have been any man\u2019s impulse. It was a large fire, a time of danger, of excitement, of sudden emergency, and threatened destruction of property other than that of the defendant. The ordinary actions of men in such situations furnish reliable standards of duty. It is ordinarily not such a time as admits of inquiry as to any man\u2019s previous experience in fighting fire, or where such experience is taken into account in the individual\u2019s desire and effort to help subdue the danger, or in a direction or request that he help at some particular place where the fire is the fiercest. Every one present, at such a fire as this one, is supposed to do his best, and generally does, without stopping for these things.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">While Bennett, along with the other men present, was directed to help extinguish the fire, that would have been his duty, and no doubt his willing act, regardless of the direction, or command. What duty owing him did the defendant breach or neglect? Let it be admitted that Dunlop or Bird should have warned him of the danger of becoming overheated. Dunlop did so, as effectually we think as any commensurate warning could have done. He told Bennett and the other men \u201cnot to get too hot, not to stay there if they got tired; and if they got too hot or tired, to get out and let others relieve them,\u201d as others were there to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">This, to our minds, showed concern and care for Bennett and the men engaged with him, a desire that they not endanger themselves in their effort. It likewise expressed a warning for them to be on the alert for the effect of the heat. If the fire was' to be fought at all at that place, it seems to us that under the condition it fully answered any demand of a reasonable standard of duty and hence the demand of any reasonable rule of law. It warned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and enjoined them\u2014necessarily the best judges of the dangers of the situation\u2014not to risk their own safety by staying too long in the heat, but to come out at will and let fresh men take their places. The negligence charged here cannot be sustained by such a state of facts. The issue is not made.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">This is equally true as to the throwing of the water on Bennett. According to the uncontradicted proof, this was the proper thing to do as a means of safeguarding him and the men with him; and it was done at their express request.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed and that of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\n<em>Reversed and judgment of District Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
