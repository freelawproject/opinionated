It certainly ought not to be presumed that counsel has prepared a special requested charge and submitted it to the court and that the court has refused it without adverse counsel having seen it. Sanger v. First Natl. Bk. of Amarillo, 170 S. W., 1087. It was reversible error for the court to give an instruction to the jury which required the jury to believe that the agents and servants of the defendant were guilty of negligence, both in the manner of stopping the train and also in having plaintiff\u2019s wife to alight at that place, and that plaintiff\u2019s wife was injured both by the manner in which the train <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>was stopped and by the long step that she was required to take in alighting from said train, before the jury would be authorized to find for the plaintiff, the plaintiff being entitled to recover if his wife was injured by the negligence of the defendant in either manner.

Vernon\u2019s Sayles\u2019 Civil Statutes, art. 1973; Lumber Co. v. Illig, 179 S. W., 1093; Railway Co. v. Hargrave, 177 S. W., 509; Floegge v. Meyers, 172 S. W., 194; Terrell v. Houston, 189 S. W., 575; Railway Co. v. Jones, 175 S. W., 488.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b217-6\">When the whole of the fifth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge, a part of which is complained of, is considered together, it is clear that the jury could not have been misled to plaintiff\u2019s injury, by the conjunctive statement of matters of negligence contained in the first part of the charge, because the court therein expressly tells the jury that if they believed plaintiff\u2019s wife was injured by the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants, they should not, under said instruction, find for the defendant, and any error which there may be in the said paragraph of the court\u2019s charge was harmless.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b217-7\">Mr. Justice GREENWOOD</author>\n<p id=\"Aqg\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AlW\">In this case the Court of Civil Appeals refused to consider assignments of error based on the trial court\u2019s refusal of special charges, requested by plaintiff in error, because of the failure of his bill of exceptions to show that the charges were submitted to opposing counsel, it appearing from the bill that the special charges were prepared and presented to the court, upon the court\u2019s submission to counsel for pl\u00e1intiff \u25a0 in error of the charge prepared by the court, and before such charge was read to the jury, and that the court, after due consideration, refused to submit the special charges, to which action exceptions \u25a0 were duly taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">In construing section 3, of the Act of the 33rd Legislature, approved March 29, 1913, to require the party presenting a special charge to submit it opposing counsel, the court of Civil Appeals followed the decisions of other Courts of Civil Appeals in Floegge v. Meyer, 172 S. W., 194; International <em>&amp; </em>G. N. Ry. Co. v. Jones, 175 S. W., 488; Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. R. Co. v. Hardgrave, 177 S. W., 509; J. B. Farthing Lumber Co. v. Illig, 179 S. W., 1092, and Terrell v. Houston &amp; T. C. Ry. Co., 189 S. W., 575, but held differently from the prior decision of the Amarillo Court of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Appeals in Sanger v. First National Bank of Amarillo, 170 S. W., 1087, to the effect that section 3 made it the duty of the trial judge to submit special charges to opposing counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">We concur in the construction of the section in the opinion in the last mentioned ease and hence conclude that plaintiff in error\u2019s assignments were entitled to cpnsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The portion of section 3, which is relied on to prevent consideration of the assignments,, read as follows: \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>Either party may present to the judge, in writing, such instructions as he desires to be given to the jury; and the judge may give such instructions, or a part thereof, or he may refuse to give them, as he may see proper, and he shall read to the jury such of them as he may give; provided, such instructions shall be prepared and presented to the court and submitted to opposing counsel for examination and objection within a reasonable time after the charge is given to the parties or their attorneys for examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">This language plainly requires the preparation of special charges in writing and their presentation to the judge, within a reasonable time after the charge of the court has been submitted to the parties or their attorneys. It also plainly requires that the special charges be submitted to opposing counsel, without expressly declaring by whom this duty is to be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">A previous portion of the section makes it the duty of the judge to submit the charge prepared by him to. the respective parties or their attorneys. After the parties or their attorneys comply with the express command to present the special charges to the judge they are in his hands and he determines their ultimate disposition. Any objections of counsel which may follow the inspection of special charges must be presented to the judge. Under these circumstances, we think it must have been intended for the judge, having received the special charges within the proper time, to submit them to opposing counsel. It will be presumed the judge performed his duty in the absence of a showing to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Notwithstanding the Court of Civil Appeals erred in refusing to pass upon the errors assigned on the refusal of the special charges, we shall not determine the assignments. For no such findings of fact were made by the Court of Civil Appeals as we consider requisite to their proper disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">We would, therefore, remand the ease for further consideration by the Court of Civil Appeals, were it not for the fact that this action appears to be unnecessary in view of our conclusion that plaintiff in error is entitled to have the judgments of both the trial court and of the Court of Civil Appeals reversed, and the cause remanded to the district court, for error in the main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">Paragraph 4 of the court\u2019s charge submitted to the jury facts entitling plaintiff in error to recover as follows: \u201cTherefore, if you believe from the evidence that at the time and place men<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tioned in plaintiff\u2019s petition, plaintiff\u2019s wife was a passenger on defendant\u2019s train, and that as said train arrived at the station of Burrow plaintiff\u2019s wife used ordinary care to alight from said train when it stopped at station; and if you find that defendant\u2019s servants in charge of said train failed to stop said train at said station a reasonable and sufficient length of time for plaintiff\u2019s wife, in the exercise of ordinary care, to have alighted therefrom; and if you further find that in making the second stop that defendant\u2019s servants stopped said train suddenly with a quick, unusual and unnecessary jerk and lurch and thereby caused plaintiff\u2019s wife to be injured; and if you find that in so stopping said train, if they did, defendant\u2019s agents and servants were guilty of negligence \u25a0 as that term is defined in paragraph one hereof and that such negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of the injuries, if any, to plaintiff\u2019s wife, you will find for plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">\u201cOr, if you believe from the evidence that at the time and place mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s petition plaintiff\u2019s wife was a passenger on defendant\u2019s train, and that as said train arrived at the station of Burrow, plaintiff\u2019s wife used ordinary care to alight from said train, when it stopped at said station; and if you find that defendant\u2019s servants in charge of said train failed to stop said train at said station a reasonable and sufficient length of time for plaintiff\u2019s wife, in the exercice of ordinary care, to have alighted therefrom; and if you find that defendant\u2019s agents and servants, in carrying her past said station and stopping said train where it stopped for plaintiff\u2019s wife to alight, and in the manner, place and means furnished by defendant\u2019s agents and servants to plaintiff\u2019s wife in alighting from said train, were in any or all the respects named guilty of negligence, as defined in paragraph one, and that such negligence, if any, was the proximate cause of injuries to plaintiff's wife, if any, you will find for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Paragraph 5 of the court\u2019s charge read: \u201cUnless you'believe from the evidence that defendant\u2019s servants failed to stop said train at the station of Burrow a reasonable and sufficient length of time for plaintiff\u2019s. wife, in the exercise of ordinary care to safely alight therefrom and unless you believe that defendant\u2019s servant\u2019s in making the second stop stopped said train suddenly, with a quick and sudden jerk and lurch; and unless you believe that defendant's agents and servants, in carrying plaintiff\u2019s wife past said station and in having her to alight at the place and in the manner and with the means furnished were guilty of negligence as defined in paragraph one, hereof; or unless, you find that plaintiff\u2019s wife was injured by the negligence, if any, of defendant\u2019s servants; or unless you find that the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants, if they were negligent, was the proximate cause of the injuries to plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>wife, if she was injured, then and in either event you will find for the defendant. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">Paragraph 5 of the court\u2019s charge cannot be otherwise construed than to require the jury to find for defendant in error unless they believed that its servants stopped the train with a quick and sudden jerk and lurch, and unless they further believed that defendant in error\u2019s agents and servants were guilty of negligence in carrying plaintiff in error\u2019s wife past the station and having her alight in the place and in the manner and with the means furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Since plaintiff in error was entitled to recover, as recognized in the preceding paragraph of the charge on a finding of negligence based either on the quick and sudden lurch of the train or on the place and manner and means provided for plaintiff in error\u2019s wife to alight from the train, paragraph 4 and 5 of the charge are contradictory, and it is impossible to say that the jury did not find a verdict for defendant in error because the jury failed to find more than the law required to entitle plaintiff in error to recover.

W., 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">For the error in the court\u2019s charge, the judgments of the Court of Civil Appeals and of the District Court are reversed and the cause is remanded to the District Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
