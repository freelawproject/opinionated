Plea, as to four lots included in the tract sued for, nul disseisin ; and a disclaimer as to the residue. Trial before <em>Metcalf, </em>J., who reported to the full court the following case :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAt\">The demandant claimed title under two mortgages to secure the payment of $20,000, made by John Marland to James L. Little and others in December 1847, and since foreclosed, of \u201c a certain parcel of land, situated in said Andover, being the homestead of me the said John Marland, in that part of said Andover called Ballard Vale, containing two hundred acres of land, being the same estate now occupied by me.\u201d The tenant claimed title under a second mortgage, made by Marland in March 1848, which described by metes and bounds the four lots specified in the plea. At the time of making the demandant\u2019s mortgages, these four lots, with the houses and shops thereon, were owned by Marland, and occupied by tenants at will; paying rent to him ; and were separated by walls and fences from the residue of the land demanded, which was used and occupied by Mai-land as a farm, and had his mansion house upon it. Marland owned about two hundred acres of land at Ballard Vale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">The demandant offered in evidence certain policies of insurance upon buildings on these lots, effected by Marland and assigned by him to said Little and others; and also offered to prove that the property owned by Marland at Ballard Vale was not worth more than twenty thousand dollars. But the judge ruled that this evidence was incompetent.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b84-8\"><em>J. W. Emery, (O. P.

The deed of John Marland to Little and others passed all the estate owned by Marland at Ballard Vale, at its date. All the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>land then owned by him was but two hundred acres. The word \u201c homestead \u201d in this country has no settled legal meaning, and must be so construed, in connection with all the words used in the description of the thing granted, as to give effect to the intent of the grantor. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Mixer, </em>11 Pick. 346. <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals, </em>5 Met. 15. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>6 Met. 529. <em>Dana </em>v <em>Middlesex Bank, </em>10 Met. 250. <em>Aldrich </em>v.

The use of the words \u201c homestead estate,\u201d and not \u201c farm,\u201d shows that more than his farm was intended to be conveyed. The addition of the words <em>\u201c </em>being the same estate occupied by me,\u201d if repugnant, cannot alter, limit or control the preceding description. <em>Cutler </em>v. <em>Tafts, </em>3 Pick. 272. <em>Cartwright </em>v. <em>Amatt, </em>2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 43. <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals, </em>5 Met. 28. <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Thacher, </em>2 Met. 44, note. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>6 Met. 529. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Kendall, </em>10 Cush. 241. <em>Hibbard </em>v. <em>Hurlburt, </em>10 Verm. 173. In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Saltonstall, </em>3 Met. 425, the words were not' \u201c estate occupied,\u201d but \u201c house and land occupied; \u201d and were used in a devise, which must be construed, if possible, so as not to disinherit the heir. <em>Denn </em>v. <em>Gaskin, </em>Cowp. 661.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-5\">2.
