Half the roof remained, and covered that portion of the store which remained standing after the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201c At the date of the policy, and at the time of the accident, the plaintiffs occupied the store as tenants, and had stock therein to the amount of seventy thousand dollars and upwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\">\u201c Shortly after the accident above mentioned, with an interval stated by the witnesses to have been between fifteen and forty minutes, a fire (supposed to have been occasioned by the commingling of chemicals) broke out amongst the ruins of the adjoining store aforesaid (which had been used as a drug store); which fire communicated with and burned portions of that part of the plaintiffs\u2019, store which remained standing, and also partially burned and damaged some of the goods therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">\u201c For the purpose of extinguishing said fire, large quantities of water were thrown by the fire department of the city upon the ruins of store No. 95, and into and upon that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 store which remained standing, and upon the goods remaining therein, whereby the said stock of goods remaining in that portion of said store was damaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">\u201c No portion of the goods for which the plaintiffs claimed damage under the policy fell; nor were they injured, otherwise than by fire or water, or both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">\u201c The jury, by order of the presiding judge, returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, which is to be set aside if in the opinion of the full court it cannot be sustained.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-9\"><em>H.

The description \u201c contained in the new granite store No. 93 \u201d is a warranty that the property, while covered by the policy, shall be thus \u201c contained \u201d in said granite store. 1 Phil.

The stock, for injury to which the suit is brought, was not, at the time of the injury, \u201ccontained\u201d in the store, within the meaning of the contract; for, by a true construction of the policy, \u201c contained in \u201d imports \u201c protected by \u201d the store. At the time of this fire the store had ceased to exist as a store and it is immaterial how long the store fell before the fire. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>placing the goods on this mass of ruins is sufficient, then the plaintiff might recover if he had placed them there after the fire. [Shaw, C. J. Suppose the goods had been moved out to avoid the fire, would they not be within the description of and covered by the policy?] The fire would then be the proximate cause. If moved for any other purpose, they would not be covered by the policy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b169-5\"><em>C. P. Curtis &amp; C.

All the plaintiffs\u2019 stock was in their store, just as the defendants contend they warranted that it should be, when the partition between their own and the adjoining store began to give way. That was the commencement of one common and general disaster. The fire, and the falling of the walls and of other parts of the two stores, which immediately followed, were not separate and independent events, but were merely parts and successive circumstances in the progress of a single calamity. Though the cause and origin of the fire may perhaps be satisfactorily conjectured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>t ie precise moment when it was kindled is not known ; bat the interval which elapsed before it was discovered, after the crash of the buildings had been heard, was certainly very brief. The witnesses who testified of it varied in their estimate of its durati 3n from fifteen to forty minutes. This slight difference of opinion on a mere matter of judgment of the lapse of time is really of no importance. The material fact is, that the flames bloke out and burned the plaintiffs\u2019 goods before there could have been any possible interposition for their safety, and must thus be considered as having occurred substantially at the same time with the other incidents of the disaster. They were all blended together in one catastrophe, and constituted a single ev ent, upon a due consideration of which the rights of all parties are to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">As it is thus shown that the defendants cannot maintain one of the two propositions, both of which are indispensable to susta n their objection, the direction to the jury to return a verdict fo \u2022 the plaintiffs was correct, and judgment must accordingly be entered upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict for the plaintiffs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
