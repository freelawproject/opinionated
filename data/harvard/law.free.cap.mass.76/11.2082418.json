Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>123, \u00a7 3. Declaration of Rights, art. 12. He has not been convicted of the offence charged in the indictment. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Holt, </em>7 Car. &amp; P. 518. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Ryan, 2 </em>M. &amp; Rob. 213. Archb. Crim. Pl. (10th ed.) 439. 1 Russell on Crimes, (7th ed.) 741, 742. The verdict returned was a special verdict. <em>Dyer </em>v. <em>Commomoealth, </em>23 Pick. 402. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Call, </em>21 Pick. 509. A verdict in a criminal case cannot be amended.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-12\">The Commonwealth has relied on the Rev. Sts. c. 137, \u00a7 11, providing that \u201c whenever any person indicted for felony shall on trial be acquitted by verdict of part of the offence charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>in the indictment, and convicted of the residue thereof, such verdict may be received and recorded by the court; and thereupon the person indicted shall be adjudged guilty of the offence, if any, which shall appear to the court to be substantially charged by the residue of such indictment, and shall be sentenced and punished accordingly.\u201d \u2022 But it is submitted that that statute is unconstitutional, as conflicting with art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights, which declares that <em>\u201c </em>no subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, described to him.\u201d See also 1 Chit. Crim. Law, 644; Bac. Ab. Verdict, D; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Call, 21 Pick. 513; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>5 Cox C. C 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-5\">It results, therefore, that the verdict in question is a substantial acquittal. Rev.

H, Clifford, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b21-7\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AO\">1. The indictment charges an assault with intent to murder. It is plain that the jury intended to find the defendant guilty of the assault without the felonious intent. In the entry of the verdict by the clerk, the words \u201c and battery \u201d were inadvertently included ; the jury, as the report shows, \u201c having found nothing as to a battery.\u201d The entry was amended during the sitting of the court, to conform to the truth. That the entry was rightly corrected we have no doubt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stebbins, </em>8 Gray, 492. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Vodden, </em>1 Dearsly, 229, and 6 Cox C. C. 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">2. The verdict as corrected is a good general verdict, with a qualification negativing the felonious intent. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Campb. 646. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>23 Pick. 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">If, as suggested by the learned counsel for the prisoner, the verdict is to be deemed a special one, it is nevertheless the corrected entry that is the evidence of such verdict. The entry as amended shows a sufficient verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">3. The defendant was convicted of a simple assault. He was charged with an assault with an intent to murder. The jury have found him guilty of the assault, but have negatived the felonious intent. It is objected that the defendant was not convicted of the offence charged in the indictment. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>convicted of an assault included in the charge on the face oi the indictment, and which constituted part of the transaction prosecuted as felony. The case seems to us to fall clearly within the provision of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>137, \u00a7 11. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fischblatt, </em>4 Met. 354. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drum, </em>19 Pick. 479. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodhue, 2 </em>Met. 193. <em>2 </em>Bennett &amp; Heard\u2019s Lead. Crim. Cas. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">4. To the suggestion that the provision of the revised statutes is unconstitutional as in conHict with art <em>12 </em>of the Bill of Rights, the answer is that the offence is <em>\u201c </em>fully and plainly, substantially and formally \u201d described; that the whole may include a distinct part, and the greater the less.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
