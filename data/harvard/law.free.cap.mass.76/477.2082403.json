And both sides treating the question as one for the court, the court decided that they did, and that there was no variance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-8\">\u201c The defendant contended that in the indictment the name of the cashier was spelt with the letter \u2018 u,\u2019 viz: \u2018 Droun; \u2019 whereas upon the bill the name was spelt with a w,\u2019 viz: Drown,\u2019 and that this constituted a variance.

Certain inquiries thereon following, it appeared, from the statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, (which it was agreed should be received as sworn testimony, if the facts stated therein were at said stage competent, which the government denied, and subject to all objections on either side as to its competency,) that at May term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>1857 three false, forged and counterfeit bank notes were before the grand jury; that, on due evidence, said grand jury duly found and returned into court three indictments against the defendant for uttering said notes, each on distinct occasions; that all of said indictments were alike in their allegations, except that, in setting out the tenor, one read \u2018Aug. 3, 1851,\u2019 another Aug. \u2014 1854,\u2019 and the third \u2018 Aug. 7, 1854\u2019; that in the mean time, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney having become convinced that the date of the day of the month had by the process of the alteration or forgery been substantially obliterated, and, on inspection, was practically a blank, brought the matter before the same grand jury at the succeeding June term ; and thereupon the grand jury, without the examination of any witnesses at said June term, and at the suggestion and request of the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, returned three new indictments against the defendant for the same three distinct utterings, and on the same three bank notes, as the first three indictments, and as substitutes for the original indictments, one of which is the present, and in all of which the date of the bill was set forth as in this one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\">\u201c Thereupon the defendant moved that, for the above reasons, and on the ground that it did not appear that he was upon trial for the same offence for which he stood indicted, the indictment be quashed. The judge overruled the motion.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the defendant alleged exceptions to the rulings above stated, and also to the overruling of a motion in arrest of judgment, founded upon the manner of the finding of the indictment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-7\"><em>N. St. J. </em>Green, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABiK\">1. The allegation of a false, forged and counterfeit note is not supported by evidence of an altered note. At common law an altered note is a forged note; but in the statutes of Massachusetts the word \u201c forged \u201d is used in a restricted sense, and alteration is not forgery. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>127. <em>Kirby </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Ohio State R. 185.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-8\">2. The allegation that the defendant had in his possession a certain promissory note is not supported by evidence that he had in his possession a bank note or bank bill. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>6 N. H. 529. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>15 N. H. 355. If <em>\u201c </em>promissory. note,\u201d under the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>127, \u00a7 2, includes a bank bill of another state, then the punishment is twice as great for counterfeiting a bank bill of another state, as for counterfeiting a bill of a bank incorporated in this state, under \u00a7 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-5\">3. The variance between the word \u201c Cashier \u201d and the combination of letters \u201cCash\u201d is material. Whether words are <em>idem sonantia </em>is a question for the jury. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Lead. Crim. Cas. 346.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-6\">4. It was a question of fact for the jury whether the erroneous spelling of the name of the cashier was or was not a variance. The parties did not treat this question as one for the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b488-7\">5. The objection to the irregularity in the finding of the indictment was taken seasonably, in a proper manner, supported by competent evidence, and the proceedings must be quashed. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 401. <em>Low's case, </em>4 Greenl. 439. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>1 Hawks, 352. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Coolidge, </em>2 Gallis. 364. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Bridgewater &amp; Taunton Canal, </em>7 B. &amp; C. 514. If this is regarded as an amendment of one of the former indictments, then it was amended after it had been returned into and made a part of the record of the court, and had passed out of the jurisdiction of the grand jury. If it is regarded as a new indictment, then it was found without evidence. The defendant was not tried for the same offence for which he stood indicted.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b488-8\"><em>S. H. Phillips, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b488-9\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8g\">1. There is no legal ground for the objection that evidence tending to show that the bank note described in the indictment was originally a genuine note for one dollar, and had been fraudulently altered to one purporting to be for ten dollars, was incompetent under an indictment alleging a forgery of such ten dollar bank note. In a case like the present, the indictment is properly framed where it charges the defendant with having in his possession a forged promissory note, and uttering and passing the same as true, although the proof of the forgery be merely the false and fraudulent altering of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>genuine bank note. If any part of a true instrument be altered, the indictment may allege it as a forgery of the whole instrument. <em>2 </em>East P. C. 978. <em>2 </em>Russell on Crimes, (7th Amer. ed.) 320. Archb. Crim. Pl. (13th ed.) 467. The distinction is, that where the forgery is of a mere addition to the instrument, which has not the effect of altering the instrument itself, but is merely collateral to it, the forgery must be specially alleged Archb. Crim. Pl. <em>ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\"><em>2. </em>The indictment properly describes the instrument alleged to have been forged to be \u201c a promissory note.\u201d The instrument alleged to be forged was a bank bill of a bank incorporated and doing its business in another state. A careful examination of our statutes leads to the conclusion that there is no provision in terms for punishing the offence of uttering and publishing as true a counterfeit bill of another state, unless it is embraced in the general provision for punishing the offence of uttering and publishing forged and counterfeit promissory notes, knowing them to be such. The words used in the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>127, \u00a7 2, are quite broad enough to include such bank bills or notes, and the only objection to thus applying them is that which arises from the fact that there are various provisions in other parts of this same chapter of the revised statutes, providing punishments and penalties for knowingly having bank bills in possession that are forged and counterfeit, with intent to pass them as genuine, as well as the further provision in \u00a7 6, for the punishment of uttering and publishing counterfeit bank bills of banks within the Commonwealth, and making the maximum of punishment in such latter case less than that provided in \u00a7 2, for uttering and publishing promissory notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">This question is not a new one. Much the same question arose under the earlier <em>St. </em>of 1804, c. 120. It was somewhat considered in the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Mass. 59. The form of indictment was sanctioned in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>2 Pick. 47, and again in the municipal court of Boston by Thacher, J. in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>Thach. C. C. 67, where the objection was taken that a bank bill was not a promissory note within the <em>St. </em>of 1804, c. 120, but it was said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>form of indictment was conformable to the practice in such cases in the highest criminal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The Rev. Sts. c. 127, \u00a7 2, may, we think, be considered as equally authorizing this form of describing bank bills of other states in cases of indictment under it. The cases of <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>6 N. H. 529, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>15 N. H. 355, hold differently, but under a statute having more distinct provisions for punishing the offence of uttering and publishing counterfeit bank bills of another state. As already remarked, we have no provision by statute for punishing this offence, unless it is found in the second section of c. 127 of the Rev. Sts., punishing the uttering and publishing of forged and counterfeit promissory notes. We think, under our practice heretofore recognized, and upon the proper construction to be given to c. 127 of the Rev. Sts. the form of the indictment was proper in the present case to authorize the admission of the evidence tending to prove the uttering and publishing counterfeit bank bills of another state, knowing them to be forged and counterfeit.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">3. As to the question of variance, in that the indictment describes a bank bill purporting to be signed by C. R. Drown, \u201c Cashier,\u201d whereas the bill offered in evidence purports to be signed by C. R. Drown, <em>\u201c </em>Cash\" \u201d, using an abbreviated form of expression, we have no doubt great strictness is required in the recitals where, as in the present case, the indictment alleges the counterfeit promissory note \u201c to be of the tenor following.\u201d But whether this would be such an error as would be fatal, we have not found it necessary to decide, as this objection applies only to the first count, and in the second count, charging the same offence, the description accords with that of the bank bill produced in evidence, and judgment may therefore be taken on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">4. Some objection was suggested to the manner of describing the name of the cashier; the defendant insisting that in the indictment the name of the cashier was spelt with the letter \u201c u,\u201d viz : \u201c Droun ; \u201d whereas upon the face of the bank bill offered in evidence it was spelt \u201c Drown,\u201d and this was urged to be a variance. But we think it would savor quite too much of nicety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>to attempt to distinguish between the two letters as they appear in the present case, or to say that the name, as set forth in this indictment, did not correspond with the name as written on the face of the bank bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">We perceive no legal objection to the course of proceedings in reference to the finding of the present indictment, nor any ground for arresting the judgment for that cause, if there were not other objections to taking this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
