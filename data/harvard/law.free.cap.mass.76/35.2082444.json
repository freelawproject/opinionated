Most of your labor was directly for or on account of the widow. My impression is, that you could not collect directly of me, as administrator, anything. It must, be done through the widow. I do not mention this legal objection to get rid of anything, but to direct 3*011 in settlement with the widow. When the matter comes up, I shall be disposed to do what is right and just. I think 3*ou had better do something at once towards settlement with the widow, as I want to square up things all round.\u201d</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">Action of contract for services claimed to have been rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant while the latter was administrator of the estate of Dr. Spaulding, more than six years before the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ. The defendant pleaded the statute of limitations, which was admitted to be a sufficient bar to the action, unless the following letter, which was written and received within six years of the commencement of the action, was a sufficient acknowledgment or new promise to inter rupt the operation of the statute :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-8\">\u201c Lowell, April 2d 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-9\"><em>\u201c </em>Miss Rhoades: I have time to write only a line. On reflection I do not think what labor you performed for the estate would be worth over $75 to $100, including board, in the whole. Most of your labor was directly for or on account of Mrs. Spaulding. Since seeing you, it has occurred to me that it is doubtful whether any legal claim can be made against me oi the estate. I obtained a legal discharge by regular process of law; and my impression is that you could not collect directly of me, as administrator, anything. It must be done through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Mrs. Spaulding. I do not mention this legal objection to gel rid of anything, but to direct you in settlement with Mrs. S. When the matter comes up, I shall be disposed to do what is right and just. I think you had better do something at once towards settlement with Mrs. S., as I want to square up things all round\u2014Mrs. S. and Dr. U. soon. You must not use or refer to my advice in proceeding as to the price of labor against the estate, as that might show collusion. But when things are examined and exposed, as they probably will have to be, you will find me disposed to do right. I am full of business and schools ; examinations every day. My visit to Salem was pleasant and satisfactory. Yours &amp;c. N. Allen.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-5\"><em>E.

Story on Con. \u00a7\u00a7 1013, 1014. This case shows both an acknowledgment and a promise. The words in the letter, \u201c for the estate,\u201d are agreed to refer to services performed by the plaintiff for the defendant while administrator, and, taken in connection with the rest of the letter, admit an existing debt which had not been settled. The words <em>\u201c </em>I will do what is just and right \u201d contain a promise to pay. <em>Galway </em>v. <em>Barrymore, 1 </em>Dick. 163, quoted by Metcalf <em>arguendo, </em>in <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Needham, </em>11 Mass. 453.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b44-7\"><em>S.
