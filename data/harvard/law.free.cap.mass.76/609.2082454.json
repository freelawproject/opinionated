Head, to purchase from them an estate on Washington Street in Boston, for the sum of \u00a712,000; but, not having funds enough for that purpose, applied to Lob-dell to join with him in the purchase, and they two purchased the estate and had it conveyed to Lobdell in fee, and Lobdell paid \u00a73000 therefor, and gave his promissory notes secured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>mortgage of the premises for the remaining $9000. At the time of the purchase, it was agreed between said Montague and Lobdell, that, whatever disposition should be made of the estate, the profit and loss should be divided between them, deducting interest, and that Sidney Bartlett, Esq., should make such papers as might be necessary to carry this agreement into effect; and Lobdell accordingly signed and addressed to Mr. Bartlett the following letter: \u201c August 5th 1844. The agreement between Mr. Montague and myself is simply this: We have purchased an estate of F. C. Head and T. Motley, Jr., on Washington Street, which has by mutual consent been conveyed to me (I having paid and secured the purchase money); whatever disposition is made of the property, the profit and loss is to be divided between us, deducting interest.

His estate was represented insolvent, and his administrators, heirs and devisees appeared and answered in this suit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-6\"><em>B.

Bmcroft, </em>for the heirs and devisees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b619-7\">By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"ADrG\">The letter to Mr. Bartlett was a valid offer; and being accepted and acted upon by the parties, it constituted a contract by which either a trust or a partnership was created. And whether a trust or a partnership, Lobdell became accountable for the proceeds of the sales, and this liability devolved upon his administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">If the property has been alienated, it having been done ir pursuance of the arrangements between the parties, the title was vested in the purchasers, discharged of the trust; and therefore, if all the property has been alienated, no specific performance. in the way of a transfer of real estate can be decreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">If the property bought and held under the agreement has been sold, and mortgages taken back by Lobdell to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>whole or part of the purchase money, such mortgages constitute a part of the trust or partnership fund, and must be deemed a part of the trust property in which the plaintiff has a right and interest, the extent of which is to be determined by taking an account.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The case must be referred. to a master to state an account. Lobdell\u2019s estate is to be allowed interest on the half of the purchase money advanced by him for William H. Montague, and is to be allowed for all other moneys advanced and for expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Whether the plaintiff can have a preference over other creditors depends on the question whether the specific trust property or mortgages taken to secure the purchase money on sales thereof remain, or whether the balance, if any, due the plaintiff results only in a sum which is a debt due from Lobdell\u2019s estate. This question will properly arise when the master reports; all other questions to be reserved till the coming in of the report. -</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
