Potter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">The defendant also claimed an interest in the Robert Potter lot, as tenant in common, and a right to remove the wall from the Robert Potter lot, where it was placed by the plaintiffs, back to the boundary between the Hudson and Potter lots.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">The Potter lot was in the common pasture, and had never been inclosed; and all the lands at Nahant, not inclosed, have always been used as a common pasture by the owners of the lots laid out in 1706 ; each owner having a right in the general pasture in proportion to the land he held uninclosed. Before May 1855 the common pasture extended over the land between the old wall and the road, which is a town way running through the common pasture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">The plaintiffs showed no interest in the Potter lot, and there was no evidence of any division or partition of that lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">The defendant put in evidence a deed of quitclaim, dated March 14th 1839, from John Stone and others to Samuel Tufts, of \u201c a certain undivided fifth part of a lot of land, said lot in the whole containing about two and a half acres, our part of the same being about one half of an acre, undivided ; said lot is situate on Nahant, being a part of the third lot in the fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>range; \u201d also a deed, dated March 26th 1847, from Tufts to the defendant of \u201c sixty four rods; being part of the third lot in same range, laid out to Robert Potter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">The Potter lot contained nearly two acres, and it was admitted by the defendant upon examination of the title, that the interest of Tufts in that lot was but thirty one and three fifths rods, and that the land between the old wall and the road contained more than that.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">The plaintiffs objected that by the deed of .Tufts to the de fendant the defendant took an interest in severalty in the Potter lot, and not in common, and had no right to enter upon any part of the Potter lot, except upon what h\u00e9 held in severalty ; and as there was no evidence of his holding in severalty any part of the land between the road and the old wall, that he had no right to remove the wall, even if the plaintiffs bad no title. And <em>Mellen, </em>C. J. ruled, that under the deed of Tufts the defendant could not justify entering and removing the wall; and ordered verdicts for the plaintiffs, which were returned, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b88-7\"><em>W.

The words \u201c sixty four rods\u201d merely explain the amount of the \u201c part \u201d conveyed, but do not indicate any assignment or limitation in severalty. It can make no difference whether a deed states the number of rods of land in the part, or states the fractional part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b88-8\">Upon the same principle, if the grantor, instead of being seised of the whole parcel, is a tenant in common in the whole, and conveys a part or moiety, being his whole interest, without words of limitation or assignment in severalty, then the grantee takes as tenant in common. Under the deed from Stone and others, Tufts was seised as tenant in common of thirty one and three fifths rods (that being found upon examination of title to be all that they held) in the Potter lot. It is not to be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Burned, in the absence of express words, that Tufts intended to convey an estate in severalty in any particular portion of the lot, for he did not own the whole; nor that he intended to create another estate in common, in a particular portion, within the general estate in common, unless he clearly so describes it, by naming the boundaries, or in some way designating its position, it having been in common pasture and undivided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-5\">Where a grantor conveys a certain number of acres in a large tract, to be selected by the grantee, the grantee takes as tenant in common.

But in all those cases the land was conveyed by metes and bounds ; and such a deed has never been decided to be a conveyance in severalty without metes and bounds, or something equivalent. The word \u201c undivided \u201d is not necessary to create a tenancy in common ; and the fact that no particular estate in severalty is described shows that the estate is conveyed in common and not in severalty.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b89-7\">Words in a deed operate according to the intention of the parties, if by law they may; and if they cannot operate in one form, they shall operate in that which by law will effectuate the intention.

There is nothing to indicate that the grantor intended to convey an undivided interest in the whole lot. On the contrary, it does not purport to convey the whole interest of the grantor, nor an undivided interest in the entire tract. It is only a grant of sixty four rods, parcel of a larger lot. He owned a certain portion or fraction of the whole lot. This he does not grant, but he <em>conveys </em>sixty four rods, and describes it as part of a lot, in the whole of which he was the owner of an undivided interest. The deed does not come within that class of cases where the owner of an entire tract conveys a certain part of the whole. In such cases there is no difficulty in construing the conveyance as a grant of an undivided interest in the proportion which the quantity granted bears to the whole parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">What was then the effect of the deed ? A conveyance in severalty of sixty four rods in a close containing a larger quantity and owned in common with others, without boundaries or other means to designate or fix the location of the land intended to be granted, if valid as against all persons except other owners in common of the whole close, cannot take effect until the grantee has entered and taken possession of the quantity of land conveyed by the deed, and thus made certain the part of the close which he claims to hold in severalty under his grant. Until such entry and possession, it is wholly uncertain what part of the close is comprehended within the grant, and the deed cannot take effect as to any specific part. There was no proof of any such entry in the present case upon the land where the trespass was committed. The defendant had no title to enter as a tenant in common, and he proved no entry upon any portion of the land to hold in severalty.</p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
