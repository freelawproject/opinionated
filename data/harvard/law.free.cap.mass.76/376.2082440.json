The answer denied the plaintiff\u2019s right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b384-12\">At the trial in the superior court of Suffolk at January term 1857, before <em>Huntington, </em>J., the plaintiff introduced evidence that he held the estate by lease from the owner; that the window in question, which was in the fourth story of the house, had existed uninterruptedly from the year 1829 until the autumn of 1855, free and unobstructed, and then the defendant, in rebuilding his house, built his wall directly against the window in question; that the sill of the window projected over the defendant\u2019s land so much that it was cut off by the builders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>when the defendant built the wall complained of; and that the title of the two estates had not been in the same person since 1826.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b385-5\">The plaintiff asked the court to instruct the jury that the free and unobstructed use of the window for more than twenty years prior to 1852, without interruption, especially if the sill of the window projected over the defendant\u2019s land, constituted an adverse use or enjoyment, the title of the two estates having been in different persons during that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-6\">But the court instructed the jury \u201c that the mere open and unobstructed use of the window for light and air for more than twenty years prior to 1852 without interruption, either with or without the existence of the sill and the state of the title, did not necessarily constitute an adverse enjoyment, so as to enable the plaintiff to recover; that the word adverse\u2019 meant that the plaintiff\u2019s use must be under a claim of right, with the knowledge of the owner, and not with his permission ; that the plaintiff must have exercised some right, conflicting with that of the defendant, other and farther than the mere ordinary use of the window for the admission of light and air; that the use must work some wrong, or must deprive the defendant of some beneficial right; that the existence of the sill was a fact tending to show that the plaintiff claimed the use of the window adversely to the defendant, and proper for the jury to consider with the other evidence in the case; that, in considering the same, they might well take into view the position of the sill and the opportunities the defendant had of knowing of its existence ; and, by way of illustration, stated that more weight might perhaps be due to the fact that such a sill existed, if it was near the ground in a frequent passageway and in full view, than if it was very high up in the fourth story of the plaintiff\u2019s house and over the defendant\u2019s roof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b385-7\">The jury found a verdict for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b385-8\"><em>T.

We shall therefore omit such a discussion of that question, as we might otherwise have deemed advisable.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">By the English common law, as shown by the authorities cited by Mr. King, the open and uninterrupted use, by the plaintiff, of the window in question, for more than twenty years before the <em>St. </em>of 1852 took effect, constituted, or was at least <em>prima facie </em>evidence of, such an adverse possession and use thereof, as entitled him to an easement of light and air, and to an action for an interruption of such easement by the defendant ; and this, upon the ground that such uninterrupted use and possession would warrant, if not require, a jury to find a grant from the defendant, or from those under whom he claims, of a right to such possession and use. Is this the common law of Massachusetts ? We think not, and for the reasons given in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>American decisions cited by Mr. Sotuer, and the additional case of <em>Cherry </em>v. <em>Stein, </em>11 Maryland, 23. The case of <em>Pierre </em>v. Fern<em>ald, </em>26 Maine, 436, satisfactorily answers the plaintiff\u2019s argument drawm from the Rev. Sts. c. 60, \u00a7\u00a7 27, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The short grounds of the decisions cited are, 1st. That the making of a window in one\u2019s building, on his own land, and overlooking the land of his neighbor, is no encroachment on his neighbor\u2019s rights, and therefore cannot be regarded as adverse to him : 2d. That the English doctrine is not applicable to the state of things in this country, and would, if applied, work mischievous consequences in our cities and villages. And we may add, that even by the English law, before <em>St. 2 </em>&amp; 3 W. 4, <em>c. </em>71, was passed, the defendant might lawfully have done in the oily of London what he has done in Boston. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Keeme, </em>Calthrop, 41. <em>Anon. </em>Com.
