But Abbott, J. ruled \u201c that a general appearance and filing an affidavit of merits was sufficient, without proving the act of incorporation ; and that after such appearance and affidavit of merits the defendants could not in this action deny that they were a corporation.\u201d The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b382-5\"><em>J.

Such defence was open to the defendants, and was properly raised in their answer. The entry of a general appearance operated as a waiver of all objections to the want of a proper service of the writ upon the defendants, but did not affect the defence upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"ANO\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
