The defendant had not pleaded in abatement the nonjoinder of the other members of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-10\"><em>Nash, </em>J. ruled that the fact that the goods were sold and delivered to the defendant as one of the committee of the company, of which company he was a member, was not a defence to the action. A verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-11\"><em>A. V. Lynde, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWlC\">This company, having been formed before the passage of the act of congress of 1792, <em>c. </em>29, or the militia laws of the Commonwealth, differs in organization from military companies formed since. It is in the nature of a corporation, and the company, and not a committee, much less vt single member of the committee, is liable to this action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b409-12\"><em>A. E. Giles, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b410-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"AtH\">The resolve of 1786 was not an act of incorporation. The Waltham Artillery were a voluntary association of individuals, recognized by law, but having none of the attributes of a corporation. Of this association the defendant was a member, and liable jointly with his associates for their debts. The nonjoinder of the others as defendants, upon familiar principles of pleading, could be pleaded in abatement only.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled, with double costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
