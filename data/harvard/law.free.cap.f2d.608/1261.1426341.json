Appellant and one Roger Zamora both had been charged with the drug offenses. The cases were severed and appellant was tried first.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-10\">After considering each of the points raised on appeal by appellant, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-12\">The facts when viewed in a light most favorable to the Government as the prevailing party at trial, <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942), are as follows. Appellant and Zamora left San Francisco heading for Los Angeles for a weekend vacation. Appellant drove his 1973 Capri which, as Zamora explained, was paid for and owned by appellant but was registered in Zamora\u2019s name. En route to southern California, appellant pulled out a plastic bag containing a \u201clittle rock\u201d or cocaine hidden below the console area attached to the stick shift, showed it to Zamora, and told him it was for an \u201cemergency\u201d if they needed some. Later that evening, they were stopped and cited by California Highway Patrol Officer Sergeant Field. Appellant was the driver. Upon the officer\u2019s questioning, Zamora indicated he was the owner of the vehicle. Sometime after the stop, appellant removed from his pocket approximately <em>Vi </em>to <em>xh </em>gram of cocaine wrapped in a dollar bill. The two snorted the cocaine using a \u201ccoke spoon\u201d pin appellant was wearing on his jacket. The two checked into a hotel in Tijuana and were joined by Esteban Leon, a friend of appellant. During the evening, the three went to a couple of nightclubs and snorted some of appellant\u2019s cocaine taken from the \u201crock\u201d. The next morning, appellant agreed to give Zamora a ride to the San Diego Airport. Before reaching the border checkpoint, Zamora became apprehensive about the cocaine and repeatedly asked appellant to leave it behind or throw it away. Appellant was driving as they approached the Port of Entry at San Ysidro, California. During questioning, the Customs Inspector noticed appellant began to show signs of nervousness, his face turned flush, and his speech quickened. At that point, Zamora interrupted and attempted to befriend the inspector. The inspector became suspicious and inspected the vehicle. He found small quantities of marijuana and a bag containing what the parties stipulated to be five grams of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-18\">The appeal attacks the conviction on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-19\">APPELLANT\u2019S CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1347-20\">1. <em>Insufficient Evidence Establishing a Distributable Amount of Cocaine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1347-22\">Appellant first contends that mere possession of five grams of cocaine is insufficient to support an inference of an intent to distribute within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He cites <em>Turner v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 422-423, 90 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>S.Ct. 642, 24 L.Ed.2d 610 (1970), in which the Court held that the defendant\u2019s possession of 14 grams of cocaine was insufficient in and of itself as a predicate for concluding defendant was dispensing or distributing. However, where there is other evidence of a plan or intent to distribute, possession of as small a quantity as 4 or 5 grams is sufficient to establish an intent to distribute cocaine. <em>United States v. James, </em>161 U.S. App.D.C. 88, 111-112, 494 F.2d 1007, 1030-1031 (D.C. Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1020, 96 S.Ct. 495, 42 L.Ed.2d 294 (1974). In the instant case, there is direct evidence that appellant engaged in the \u201cdistribution\u201d of cocaine; although apparently no commercial scheme is involved, his sharing the cocaine with Zamora and Leon constitutes \u201cdistribution\u201d for purposes of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). <em>United States v. Branch, </em>483 F.2d 955,. 956 (9 Cir. 1973). <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>593 F.2d 105, 108 (9 Cir. 1979). In addition, there is some evidence in the record that a typical dose of cocaine may not exceed one fourth of a gram. Thus the five grams found in appellant\u2019s possession is a distributable amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-4\">2. <em>Admission of Evidence of Threats Made by Appellant to Zamora</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-5\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the Government to elicit testimony from Zamora about alleged threats made by appellant for Zamora\u2019s cooperation with the prosecution because although the Government at least two weeks prior to trial had reason to believe Zamora had been threatened, appellant was not advised until the morning of trial of such evidence. Appellant asserts that the admission of the evidence was in violation of General Order No. 150 (referred to in the omnibus form filed in this action) which requires trial evidence to be disclosed within three working days before trial and prejudiced appellant\u2019s opportunity to prepare adequately his defense. Furthermore, appellant claims that the Government failed to disclose a prior inconsistent statement of Zamora made to the Assistant United States Attorney that he had not been threatened by appellant. According to appellant, this failure constitutes a violation of the prosecutor\u2019s duty under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87-88, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), to disclose timely all exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1348-9\">As to its llth-hour disclosure, the Government replies that it did not have substantial evidence of the threats until the night before trial and that its disclosure the following morning was as early as was practicable. However, the Government admits that in an interview with Zamora two weeks before trial, Zamora\u2019s attorney represented that threats had been made by appellant and Zamora himself made vague references to possible threats. Assuming the threat allegations should have been explored further <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and disclosed in advance of trial, any error by the trial court in admitting the evidence did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1348-10\">Defense counsel was informed the morning of trial and had two opportunities thereafter to question Zamora about the alleged threats, first on cross-examination during the prosecution\u2019s case and second on direct examination when Zamora was called as the opening witness for the defense. It should be noted that an hour long lunch recess was taken during the course of appellant\u2019s initial cross-examination of Zamora. We conclude that appellant had an adequate albeit brief opportunity to prepare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>his defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, defense counsel could have moved for a continuance had it been demonstrated that circumstances prevented the presentation of an effective defense. <em>See Gaspar v. Kassm, </em>493 F.2d 964, 968-969 (3 Cir. 1974); <em>see generally, </em>9 C. Wright and A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2352, pp. 141 \u2014 144 (1971). No such motion was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-5\">This opportunity to prepare cross-examination distinguishes the instant case from <em>United States v. Roybal, </em>566 F.2d 1109, 1110 (9 Cir. 1977), cited by appellant. In that case, the Government obtained evidence from an informant damaging to the defendant one month prior to trial but waited until the informant was on the stand before adducing it <em>without any prior warning </em>to the defendant. Moreover, the surprise testimony was the only direct evidence that defendant had trafficked in drugs, whereas, in the instant case, the threat allegations were peripheral and did not constitute the sole evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1349-6\">In response to the <em>Brady </em>claim, the Government contends that although Zamora had stated two weeks before trial that no \u201cthreats\u201d had been made, that statement was a mistake resulting from Zamora\u2019s limited proficiency in English. According to the Government, Zamora did not understand the meaning of \u201cthreat\u201d and his prior statement was consistent with his testimony at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1349-17\">However, the prior disclaimer was ostensibly favorable and potentially useful to appellant and thus arguably falls within the scope of the Government\u2019s <em>Brady </em>obligation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even assuming a violation of <em>Brady, </em>however, we find no grounds for reversal. To make out a <em>Brady </em>claim requiring a new trial, appellant must demonstrate that the suppressed evidence was material. <em>Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. The standard of materiality varies with the situation in which <em>Brady </em>applies. <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103-104, 112-113, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976). Where, as in the instant case, there has been no specific defense request for the evidence, the failure to disclose violates due process only \u201cif the omitted evidence creates a reasonable doubt [about the defendant\u2019s guilt] that did not otherwise exist.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 112, 96 S.Ct. at 2402. We conclude that the inconsistent statement of Zamora does not create such a reasonable doubt. The prior statement would have had little impeachment value since it is evident that the prior disclaimer was merely the product of Zamora\u2019s language difficulty. Additionally, we note that the trial judge believed that Zamora\u2019s testimony about the threats was not important to the case since it was \u201cmore or less meaningless.\u201d While a trial judge\u2019s opinion, of course, cannot be dispositive on appeal, his judgment should be afforded substantial weight given his relative advantage in being able to render a firsthand appraisal of the record. <em>See Agurs, supra, </em>427 U.S. at 113-114 and 117-119, 96 S.Ct. 2392 (Marshall, J., dissenting); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>497 F.2d 99, 101 (5 Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1035, 95 S.Ct. 519, 42 L.Ed.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-4\">3. <em>The Government\u2019s Failure to State and Define the Advantage Zamora Was to Gain for His Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1350-5\">Appellant argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because the Government failed to disclose the advantage Zamora was promised in return for his testimony. Specifically, appellant alleges that contrary to Zamora\u2019s testimony, the Government had secretly promised Zamora the opportunity to plea to a misdemeanor or dismissal prior to appellant\u2019s trial. It is well established that the prosecutor has a duty to disclose any promises of leniency made to a witness testifying at trial since any such agreement is relevant to his or her credibility. <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972); <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1350-10\">In cases in which the courts have ordered new trial on <em>Giglio </em>grounds, it was clear that an undisclosed agreement of leniency between the Government and the witness had been reached prior to the witness\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although Zamora was indeed allowed to plea to a misdemeanor shortly after appellant\u2019s trial, the record is void of any evidence that an agreement allowing such a disposition had been reached at the time of the trial which was not disclosed to the jury. Zamora testified he understood he would be given an opportunity to plead to a lesser felony of smuggling goods but that no promises had been made for a plea less than a felony, or with respect to recommendations as to sentencing. He did state that even that agreement would be important to him because he understood that pleading to the lesser felony potentially could save him from deportation. At trial the court caused a letter from the prosecutor to Zamora\u2019s attorney, specifying the nature of the agreement to be read to the jury and stating that in return for his cooperation, \u201cMr. Zamora will be given an opportunity to plead guilty to at least\u201d the goods-smuggling count, but that no promises regarding sentencing could or would be made. Zamora\u2019s attorney testified that the possibility of a misdemeanor disposition or dismissal was not foreclosed, but that the Government had made no promises beyond that stated in the letter.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>Even if a prior plea bargain has not been clearly established, where there is a substantive claim that an undisclosed agreement had been reached, <em>DeMarco v. United States, </em>415 U.S. 449, 450, 94 S.Ct. 1185, 39 L.Ed.2d 501 (1974), requires remanding the case to the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing in order to determine whether a bargain was reached prior to the witness\u2019s giving of his testimony. <em>United States v. Piet, </em>498 F.2d 178, 182 (7 Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1069, 95 S.Ct. 655, 42 L.Ed.2d 664 (1974). However, the mere fact that the witness was subsequently allowed to plead to a lesser offense in and of itself is not sufficient to warrant a <em>DeMarco </em>hearing. <em>See United States v. Curry, </em>497 F.2d 99, 101 (5 Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1035, 95 S.Ct. 519, 42 L.Ed.2d 311 (1974). In <em>DeMarco, </em>the existence of a plea agreement was clear and the remarks of the United States Attorney at the witness\u2019s sentencing hearing indicated that the agreement may have been reached prior to the witness\u2019s testimony. 415 U.S. at 449, 94 S.Ct. 1185. Appellant has not presented us with any substantial indicia of a prior agreement allowing for a misdemeanor disposition other than Zamora\u2019s actual plea three days after appellant\u2019s trial. The transcript of the Zamora proceedings provided by appellant does not reveal any evidence of a plea bargain which, if it existed, was required to have been disclosed on the record under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-5\">4. <em>Denial of Appellant's Motion to Reopen the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-6\">Appellant maintains that the trial court erred in refusing to reopen the case in order to allow appellant to introduce into evidence the summary of Zamora\u2019s pretrial interview for purposes of impeaching his testimony about the alleged threats. Generally, the reopening of a criminal case after the close of evidence lies within the sound discretion of the court. <em>See United States v. Sisack, </em>527 F.2d 917, 919 (9 Cir. 1978); <em>Eason v. United States, </em>281 F.2d 818, 822 (9 Cir. 1960); <em>see generally </em>23 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 1055 (1961). In the instant case, appellant had an ample opportunity to cross-examine Zamora during trial upon learning of the threats and had advance possession of the summary. In view of an insufficient reason for not having introduced the summary at the proper time<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> together with the discharge of Zamora who returned to San Francisco immediately after both sides announced the close of their evidence, <em>see State v. Massey, </em>358 Mo. 1108, 219 S.W.2d 326, 332 (1949),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-10\">Moreover, we note that the impeachment potential of the summary was at most marginal since it would have been based on an apparent omission or silence and not an affirmative inconsistent statement on Zamora\u2019s part. That omission could easily have been attributed to Zamora\u2019s language difficulty, mistrust of the prosecutor, or misunderstanding of its importance or relevance to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1351-11\">5. <em>Attorney-Client Privilege</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1351-12\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred in sustaining Zamora\u2019s counsel\u2019s assertion of the attorney-client privilege when asked whether he had advised Zamora of the possibility of a misdemeanor disposition or dismissal in exchange for his cooperation with the Government. Essentially, appellant contends that Zamora waived the privilege when he responded negatively to the question, \u201cYou were never advised by anyone that you might get less than a felony?\u201d Assuming the applicability of the attorney-client privilege to the facts in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>instant case, which appellant has not challenged,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the general denial by Zamora cannot be construed to be a voluntary waiver. Zamora made no affirmative reference to any communication with his attorney; the denial would be consistent with his not having any discussions with his attorney about a disposition less than a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-4\">6. <em>Misconduct of the Prosecutor</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0mG\">Appellant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s characterization during summation of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Zamora as malicious constituted prejudicial misconduct. Upon examination of the record we conclude that the remarks were only a zealous presentation of the Government\u2019s case. We note that unlike most cases dealing with prosecutorial misconduct in argument before the jury, the remarks were directed at defense counsel and not appellant, and was not likely to be prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-5\">7. <em>Failure to Give Appellant\u2019s Requested Jury Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1352-6\">Defense counsel requested an instruction as to an attorney\u2019s affirmative duty to advise his client of negotiations with the Government in an effort to mitigate counsel\u2019s assertion during trial of the attorney-client privilege. Appellant contends that the instruction was erroneously refused. The record fails to reveal defense counsel\u2019s objection to the instructions as finally given to the jury. Therefore, for appellant\u2019s assignment to be considered, it must fall within the plain error rule. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.2d 595, 596 (9 Cir. 1971); E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 53, p. 120 (2d ed. 1972). We find no \u201cplain error\u201d was committed below, especially in view of the fact that defense counsel was allowed to argue to the jury an attorney\u2019s duty to inform his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1352-10\">Appellant\u2019s contentions of error are either without merit or were not substantial enough to warrant reversal of the conviction. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1347-15\">. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-16\">\u201c(a) Except as authorized by this subchap-ter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1347-23\">\u201c(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1348-6\">. Appellant\u2019s additional contention that the evidence of threats should have been excluded as irrelevant is without merit. As the jury was properly instructed, while such evidence is not sufficient in itself to prove guilt, it is probative evidence tending to show appellant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. <em>See United States v. Honore, </em>450 F.2d 31, 33-34 n. 1 (9 Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1048, 92 S.Ct. 728, 30 L.Ed.2d 740 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1348-11\">. The prosecutor\u2019s failure to explore fully the threat issue may have amounted to negligence. It may be argued that such negligence warranted exclusion of the evidence even though the non-disclosure was not the result of bad faith on the Government\u2019s part. <em>Cf. Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (holding <em>Brady </em>applies whether the nondisclosure is the result of design or negligence of the prosecution).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1349-7\">. Compare the minimal amount of time the courts have held adequate for defense counsel to prepare after receipt of Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, and <em>Brady </em>material. <em>See United States v.

To require the Government to explain the apparent inconsistency after the defendant has adduced it at trial seems more consistent with <em>Brady </em>as opposed to allowing the Government unilaterally to decide that the inconsistency is only illusory and therefore need not be disclosed.

We are not unaware of the reality that the Government has ways of indicating to witness\u2019s counsel the likely benefits from cooperation without making bald promises (see <em>Butler, supra, </em>567 F.2d at 888), and that conceivably Zamora\u2019s and his counsel\u2019s protestations that the Government made no \u201cpromises\u201d while perhaps literally true might have been misleading. The prosecutor has a duty to apprise the court when he or she knows the witness is giving misleading testimony regarding such promises or negotiations. <em>United States v. Harris, supra, </em>498 F.2d at 1169. However, there is no substantive evidence that this occurred in the instant case. Indeed, notwithstanding this fact, defense counsel was allowed to argue facts not in evidence in his summation before the jury when he implied that Zamora\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>disposition would depend upon how things went at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1351-8\">. We note that defense counsel earlier had objected to the introduction into evidence of the summary sought by the Government.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1351-13\">. The summary could not be fairly introduced without the Government\u2019s being able to question Zamora about the circumstances of the interview from which the summary was taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1352-7\">. Since appellant does not argue the point, we need not decide the issue here. We note, however, that whether the privilege applies under these circumstances might present a substantial question. What is involved is a possible offer from a third party conveyed through the attorney to his client. Although the states are divided as to whether communications from an attorney to a client as opposed to the reverse come under privilege, the federal courts have generally held that communications in both directions are covered. <em>See Schwimmer v. United States, </em>232 F.2d 855, 863 (8 Cir. 1956), <em>cert. denied, </em>352 U.S. 833, 77 S.Ct. 48, 1 L.Ed.2d 52 (1956); <em>Hearn v. Rhay, </em>68 F.R.D. 574, 579 (E.D.Wash. 1975); <em>but see United States v. Goldfarb, </em>328 F.2d 280, 282 (6 Cir. 1964). But it has been held that as to an attorney\u2019s communication to the client, the privilege extends only to those based on confidential information provided by the client, <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. v. United States Dept. of Air Force, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 362, 566 F.2d 242, 254 (D.C. Cir. 1977), or containing legal advice or opinions of the attorney. <em>Matter of Fischel, </em>557 F.2d 209, 211-212 (9 Cir. 1977); <em>United States v. United Shoe Machinery Corp., </em>89 F.Supp. 357, 359 (D.Mass. 1950); <em>see Fisher v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 48 L.Ed.2d 39 (1976); <em>SCM Corp. v. Xerox Corp., </em>70 F.R.D. 508, 521-522 (D.Conn.1976), <em>app. dismissed, </em>534 F.2d 1031 (2 Cir. 1976); <em>8 in 1 Pet Products, Inc. v. Swift and Co., </em>218 F.Supp. 253, 253 (S.D.N.Y. 1963); <em>see also </em>Cal.Evid.Code \u00a7 952 (West Supp.1978). The limitation is consistent with the modem justification of the privilege of encouraging full disclosure by the client to the attorney for the furtherance of the administration of justice. <em>See </em>E. Cleary, McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 89, pp. 182-183 (2d ed. 1972). Mere conveyance of an offer from the Government without any discussion of advice arguably does not fall within the scope of the privilege. More importantly, in balancing the competing interests, the due process right of a criminal defendant to fully explore and expose any leniency agreements and negotiations between the Government and its witness established in <em>Giglio, Napue, </em>and their progeny weighs heavily against the interests underlying the privilege. <em>See Robinson v. State, </em>550 S.W.2d 54, 59 (Tex. Cr.App.1977); Mays v. <em>State, </em>594 P.2d 777 (Okl.Cr. App.1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
