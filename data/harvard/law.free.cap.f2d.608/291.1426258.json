Her complaint in this diversity action states that she was severely burned in 1958<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the City\u2019s negligent placement of \u201csmudge pots\u201d containing hot oil near her home. The City moved to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). The District Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> issued a memorandum and order dismissing the complaint because, under Arkansas law <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> on the date of the injury, tort actions against cities were barred by the doctrine of municipal immunity. We affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal on the basis of its memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Lumpkin also challenges the constitutionality of the Arkansas sovereign immunity doctrine. We find no merit in the challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-14\">. Plaintiff, who was three years old at the time of her injury, filed her complaint the day before her twenty-first birthday.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b376-15\">. Honorable G.
