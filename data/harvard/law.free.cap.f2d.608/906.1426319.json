The first issue is whether the District Court correctly held appellant\u2019s suit not timely under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1976), given plaintiff\u2019s filing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 30 days after the adverse termination of state agency proceedings but over six years from the date of the alleged wrong. The second issue is whether any claims plaintiff may have under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1976) are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. We agree with the District Court\u2019s determinations that the action was not timely under Title VII and any claim under \u00a7 1981 was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Plaintiff, Daughtry, was laid off by defendant, King\u2019s Department Store, on December 26, 1970. Feeling his dismissal was caused by racial prejudice, Daughtry filed a claim with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) in January of 1971. More than six years after plaintiff filed his claim, MCAD rendered its decision. MCAD found no cause to believe Daughtry had been discriminated against by King\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"AHG\">Thereafter, within 30 days of the state agency\u2019s decision, Daughtry filed his same complaint with EEOC. On August 18,1977, the EEOC issued plaintiff a right-to-sue letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">Plaintiff then filed his complaint in this case on November 11, 1977 in the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the Title VII action as untimely and because any claim under \u00a7 1981 is barred by the relevant statute of limitations. The District Court agreed with defendant on both grounds and dismissed the suit. Plaintiff, <em>pro se, </em>timely appealed that decision to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">The first issue revolves around an interpretation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(e) (1976). As plaintiff himself admits in a succinct and well-written brief, that section governs procedurally the resolution of Title VII employment discrimination claims. Plaintiff also concedes that \u00a7 2000e-5(e) presently provides that a charge must be filed with the EEOC either (1) within 180 days of the alleged unlawful employment practice; <em>or </em>(2) within 300 days of the unlawful practice if plaintiff instituted proceedings with a state agency; <em>or </em>(3) within 30 days after receiving notice that the state agency has terminated the proceedings, <em>whichever is earlier.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">Plaintiff argues that the six years MCAD took to resolve his complaint should toll the running of the time periods laid out in \u00a7 2000e-5(e). As the' magistrate who heard this case commented, \u201cThe failure of MCAD to resolve [plaintiff\u2019s complaint] in less than six years is perplexing; the failure of MCAD to inform plaintiff of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>rights with respect to the EEOC is inexcusable.\u201d Nevertheless, while the application of the \u00a7 2000e-5(e) time limits may seem unduly harsh to plaintiff, the statute is explicit in giving him 300 days within which to file with the EEOC if he originally filed with a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">The language \u201cor within 30 days after receiving notice that the state agency has terminated the proceedings . .\u201d only operates to cut short the 300-day period \u2014 it cannot lengthen it. See <em>International Union of Electrical Workers v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 229, 236-40, 97 S.Ct. 441, 50 L.Ed.2d 427 (1976); <em>Everson v. McLouth Steel Corporation, </em>586 F.2d 6 (6th Cir. 1978). Thus, if toward the end of the 300-day period plaintiff\u2019s claim was still unresolved by MCAD, he should have filed with the EEOC. The language of Congress is clear and specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Since timely filing with the EEOC under \u00a7 2000e-5(e) is a procedural prerequisite to the District Court\u2019s entertaining the case, plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply precluded relief under that statutory scheme in the District Court. See, e. <em>g., United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 555, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977); <em>Olson v. Rembrandt Printing Co., </em>511 F.2d 1228, 1231 (8th Cir. 1975). Our decision is also supported by the EEOC\u2019s indicating that it considered plaintiff\u2019s charge untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-10\">Although the parties did not raise the issue, we would note that a line of cases has arisen which allows for an \u201cequitable tolling\u201d of the \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(e) time limitations. Those cases, however, deal with misleading action on the part of the employer or federal agency which resulted in the claimant\u2019s late filing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-11\">On the other hand, the Supreme Court and the Seventh Circuit have referred to the \u00a7 2000e-5(e) requirements as \u201cjurisdictional prerequisites.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court, however, has also referred to the time periods as merely \u201climitations.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Union of Electrical Workers v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>429 U.S. 229, 97 S.Ct. 441, 50 L.Ed.2d 427 (1976).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s only equitable sounding argument is based on MCAD\u2019s six-year delay. There is no evidence, however, that MCAD, EEOC or King\u2019s in any way caused plaintiff to not file within the 300-day period. Moreover, Congress has already provided an exception for state agency delay in the \u00a7 2000e-5(e) time limits. Congress specifically provides an extra 120 days within which to file with EEOC if a claimant first resorts to a state agency. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since we are not faced with a situation which argues for an equitable tolling, we leave this entire statute of limitations and jurisdictional requirements issue open for another day. Accord, <em>Smith </em>v. <em>American President Lines, </em>571 F.2d 102, 108-11 (2nd Cir. 1978); <em>Gabriele v. Chrysler Corp., </em>573 F.2d 949, 954 at n.15 (6th Cir. 1978). See also, <em>Hadfield v. Mitre Corp., </em>562 F.2d 84, 88 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">Plaintiff also argues that the time period under \u00a7 2000e-5(e) is tolled if his alleged improper termination constitutes a continuing violation. See <em>Gautam v. First National City Bank, </em>425 F.Supp. 579 (D.C.N.Y.1976), cer<em>t. denied, </em>440 U.S. 919, 99 S.Ct. 1241, 59 L.Ed.2d 470 (1979). Plaintiff argues that since he was laid off rather than fired, the possibility of defendant\u2019s rehiring him continues to exist. Thus, defendant\u2019s failure to rehire him for that position, he argues, constitutes a continuing violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">We note initially that Daughtry\u2019s argument is improper since he raises the possibility of rehire for the first time here on appeal. <em>Gibson v. Kroger Co., </em>506 F.2d 647, 653 (7th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 914, 95 S.Ct. 1571, 43 L.Ed.2d 779 (1975). Moreover, the argument is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">Defendant\u2019s termination of employment is a completed, one-time violation. <em>Krzy-zewski v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, </em>584 F.2d 802, 806 (6th Cir. 1978); <em>Prophet v. Armco Steel, Inc., </em>575 F.2d 579, 580 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Terry v. Bridgeport Brass Co., </em>519 F.2d 806, 808 (7th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977), is particularly instructive. In <em>Evans, </em>plaintiff was a stewardess fired under company rules in 1968 because she married. She was rehired in 1972 after United\u2019s practice was held to violate Title VII, but denied seniority. She alleged that the denial of seniority constituted a continuing violation which would make her belated complaint timely. The Court rejected her contention stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-10\">A discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge is the legal equivalent of a discriminatory act which occurred before the statute was passed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-11\">Respondent emphasizes the fact that she has alleged a continuing violation. United\u2019s seniority system does indeed have a continuing impact on her pay and fringe benefits. But the emphasis should not be placed on mere continuity; the critical question is whether any present <em>violation </em>exists, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 558, 97 S.Ct. at 1889. As with Evans\u2019 claim, Daughtry\u2019s was a one-time violation which had a continuing effect on plaintiff\u2019s life, but is not a continuing violation of Title VII. Furthermore, just as plaintiff raises the idea of a continuing violation for the first time here on appeal, we note that plaintiff took no exception below to the court\u2019s specific finding that he was <em>not </em>alleging a continuing violation. Thus, as mentioned <em>supra, </em>plaintiff\u2019s failure to file within 300 days of the alleged violation bars his \u201cnon-continuing\u201d claim under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">We now turn to the second issue in this case as to whether any claim plaintiff might have under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1976) is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">While plaintiff\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint was unclear, conceivably, it could be read to state a claim under \u00a7 1981. Consequently, defendant also moved to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint as barred by the applicable statute of limitations. The District Court so held and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Since \u00a7 1981 does not contain an express statute of limitations, courts must look to state law to determine the applicable period. The lower courts in this circuit have applied both two and six year statute of limitations. <em>Compare Currington v. Polaroid Corporation, </em>457 F.Supp. 922 (D.Mass.1978) with <em>Sims </em>v. <em>Order of United Commercial Travelers, </em>343 F.Supp. 112 (D.Mass.1972). Since plaintiff filed his claim more than six years after the alleged wrongdoing, it is barred under both statutes. Any decision by us as to which Massachusetts statute should be incorporated into \u00a7 1981 would be premature and mere dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">In summary, the decision of the District Court is affirmed. Failure to comply with 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(e) foreclosed the possibility of relief under Title VII in these circumstances, and any claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Accordingly, we hold upon careful consideration of the pertinent law, all briefs and submissions and after oral argument that the judgment of the District Court dismissing the complaint is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b991-12\">. Appellant discussed his claim entirely in terms of \u00a7 2000e-5(e) as amended in 1972. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (1976) as amended by Pub. L. 92-261 \u00a7 4(a), 86 Stat. 105. Consequently, we will discuss his claim in this opinion in terms of the 180- and 300-day limitations now specified. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, we must note that technically, since plaintiffs claim arose prior to the 1972 amendments, Pub. L. 92-261, \u00a7 4(a), 86 Stat. 105, the earlier statutory time periods should apply. See <em>United Air Lines v. Evans, </em>431 U.S. 553, 554-55, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977). When plaintiff filed his claim with MCAD in 1971, he had 90 days in which to file an original claim with EEOC, or 210 days from the time of filing with a state commission. Civil Rights Act of 1964, Pub. L. 88-352, \u00a7 706(d), 78 Stat. 260. Thus, plaintiffs failure to file within the 300-day period which we use for analysis is even more remiss since the appropriate period was 90 days shorter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b992-6\">. <em>Leake v.

Emco Machine Works Company, </em>601 F.2d 1295 (5th Cir. 1979), the Fifth Circuit, whose <em>Reeb </em>case provides the foundation for an equitable tolling principle, stated that tolling was thus far limited to three situations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-8\">\u201cFirst, the Supreme Court has upheld the tolling of the time period during the penden-cy of an action before a state court which had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit, but which was the wrong forum under state law, reasoning that the policy of repose inherent in the timely filing requirement was satisfied since the initial state court action was filed against the same parties served in the federal suit and alleged an identical cause of action. . . . Second, this court' has upheld deferring the commencement of the running of the 180-day period until the claimant knew or should have known the facts which would give rise to his Title VII claim. . . . Third, this court has indicated that equitable modification is appropriate when the EEOC misleads a complainant about the nature of his rights under Title VII.\u201d <em>Chappell, supra.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b992-15\">. <em>United Air Lines v.

The Fifth Circuit recently decided that a claimant\u2019s delay in filing caused by a state commission\u2019s failure to file with the EEOC would not toll the time limits in \u00a7 2000e-5(e). <em>Chappell v. Emco Machine Works Co., </em>601 F.2d 1295 (5th Cir. 1979). The claimant\u2019s case in <em>Chappell </em>was even stronger than Daughtry\u2019s. In <em>Chappell, </em>the state commission\u2019s employee promised that he would file with the EEOC and represented to plaintiff that he had filed her complaint after her diligent and repeated checking over a six-month period. The court declined \u201cto extend the tolling principle from the EEOC misrepresentation cases to embrace the [fact] situation here. [The state] employee was not an employee of the EEOC, and [the complainant] could easily have discovered whether her complaint was filed merely by writing or phoning the EEOC office.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b993-13\">. We should also note an inconsistency in plaintiffs own argument. In this brief, he argued that he was laid off which he argued suggests a dormant job waiting to be filled. Consequently, he argued that King\u2019s failure to rehire him was a continuing violation. At oral argument, however, plaintiff said that he had been <em>replaced </em>rather than <em>laid off. </em>King\u2019s replacing plaintiff is synonymous with King\u2019s firing him, which is a one-time effect rather than a continuing violation. <em>Terry v.
