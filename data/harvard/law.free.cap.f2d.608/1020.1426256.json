United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 633, 89 L.Ed.2d 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-19\">Reliance Insurance Company (Reliance) brought this interpleader action to determine its liability to various claimants on three statutory warehouse bonds it had issued to guarantee the performance of Walker\u2019s, Inc. (Walker\u2019s), as a warehouseman. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court entered \u201cpartial summary judgment as to some claims and issues.\u201d Among the claims partially resolved was that of Ray and W. D. Luke. The court determined that Reliance was liable to the Lukes for the sum of $15,611.07 because of Walker\u2019s conversion of cotton belonging to the Lukes. The court granted judgment in favor of several other claimants, however, and the total amount of the claims exceeded the amount of Reliance\u2019s obligation on its three bonds. Thus, the district court found, there \u201cremain[ed] to be determined to what extent some or all of the claims must be prorated. In that regard it is necessary to establish the particular bond against which each claim will be assessed.\u201d For this purpose, there remained to be decided \u201cthe precise date upon which Reliance\u2019s liability arose as to each of these claimants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-20\">Under these circumstances, the district court has not entered a final, appealable order as required by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 (West 1966); nor has it certified this appeal pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Thus, we lack jurisdiction over the appeal. <em>See S.E.C. v. Independence Drilling Corp., </em>595 F.2d 1006, 1008 (5th Cir. 1979); <em>Gonzalez v. Texas Employment Commission, </em>563 F.2d 776, 777 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-21\">DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
