K. HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b621-23\">The Commonwealth appeals from an order of the district court granting habeas corpus relief to Virginia prisoner Richard C. Sennett II, who was convicted in 1977 of robbing a gas station. The district court held that Sennett had been denied a fair trial because the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney refused, despite a specific request by defendant\u2019s counsel, to identify two persons whose testimony could have discredited one of the Commonwealth\u2019s two key identification witnesses. We agree, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-24\">As the district court noted, the Commonwealth\u2019s case was \u201cfar from overwhelming\u201d and was based entirely upon the testimony of two witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-25\">Michael Kelly, the station attendant, testified that he was held up at gunpoint at about 9:20 p. m., the robber took $150.00 and drove away in a small yellow car. The defendant was picked up shortly thereafter, six miles from the scene, in a small yellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>car, but minus the money and the gun. Sennett was immediately taken to the gas station for a showup, but Kelly was not certain that the defendant was the robber and said he did not want to \u201cgo to court on it.\u201d Nine days later he made a positive identification from a photo array.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Cosmos Grasso told the police, and later testified at trial, that he had been visiting at his daughter\u2019s house across the street from the gas station, when shortly before the robbery, at about 9:10 p. m., he saw a small yellow car drive into the station. He and his granddaughter saw two young women there that they knew. As they watched, one of the women walked over to the car and spoke to the driver. Then the car drove away. This evidence reinforced the attendant\u2019s identification of the defendant and may have allowed the jury to conclude that the gun and the money were not found in defendant\u2019s car because they had been passed to an accomplice. When the young women were questioned by a police investigator, they denied being at the station that evening and claimed no knowledge of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Before trial, defense counsel specifically requested the names of the two young women, but the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the police investigator refused to disclose this information. Independent efforts to discover their identities, through a private investigator, were also unsuccessful. The women were not available at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">We think the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to turn over the requested information violated Sennett\u2019s right to a fair trial. In <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Supreme Court admonished:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Although there is, of course, no duty to provide defense counsel with unlimited discovery of everything known by the prosecutor, if the subject matter of [a specific] request is material, or indeed if a substantial basis for claiming materiality exists, it is reasonable to require the prosecutor to respond either by furnishing the information or by submitting the problem to the trial judge. When the prosecutor receives a specific and relevant request, the failure to make any response is seldom, if ever, excusable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">427 U.S. at 106, 96 S.Ct. at 2399.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">The identities and statements of the young women were material. The Commonwealth\u2019s case was not strong, and Gras-so\u2019s testimony was critical. It supported the attendant\u2019s identification and rebutted Sennett\u2019s testimony that he was not at the station on the evening of the robbery. The statements of the two young women contradicted Grasso\u2019s detailed and personalized account.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-12\">This is not a case where the impeachment evidence would be merely cumulative or have no significant effect on the witness\u2019 credibility. <em>See United States v. Figurski, </em>545 F.2d at 391-92. Therefore, we think the prosecution\u2019s refusal to honor defense counsel\u2019s specific pretrial request denied Sennett a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-8\">. Evidence tending to discredit a government witness falls within the rule of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) as refined in <em>Agurs. See Giglio v.
