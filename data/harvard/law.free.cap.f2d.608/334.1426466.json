Number 78-1140 is a petition by Montana Power to review the EPA\u2019s determination that, despite the district court\u2019s holding, the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act (1977 Amendments) subject Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4 to PSD review and permitting under a new and stricter definition of \u201ccommenced construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">We have jurisdiction over the appeals by EPA and the Tribe under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and over Montana Power\u2019s petition under \u00a7 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act. We reverse the judgment of the district court and affirm the EPA\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ABTN\">\n<em>A. The PSD Regulations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">The EPA promulgated regulations under the Clean Air Act, effective on January 6, 1975, -to prevent the significant deterioration of air quality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 40 C.F.R. 52.21 (1975). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The purpose of the regulations was to restrict the increase in levels of particulate matter and sulfur dioxide in areas with air cleaner than that required by the national ambient air quality standards. Three classes of clean air areas were designated, in which differing additional amounts of these two pollutants would be allowed over levels existing on the baseline date.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Increases exceeding the specified limits were prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Enforcement of the restrictions was provided through preconstruction review and permitting of specified stationary pollution sources that included electric coal-burning power plants like Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4. If the EPA suspected a violation of the applicable class increments would occur, it refused the source a permit and prohibited construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The regulations contained a grandfather clause, excluding from PSD review and permitting those sources that \u201ccommenced construction or modification prior to June 1, 1975.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52.21(d)(1). \u201cConstruction\u201d was defined as \u201cfabrication, erection or installation of a stationary source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52.21(b)(6). More important here is the definition of \u201ccommenced\u201d, which means that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHo\">an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or modification or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 52.21(b)(7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">If a source could establish it should be grandfathered, it might avoid additional expensive pollution control efforts. In some cases, exemption from PSD review and permitting might be the only way a source could be built in a particular location even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>if best available pollution control technology were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Before June 1, 1975, Montana Power had taken some significant preliminary steps for the construction of Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4. Plans for Units 1 &amp; 2, being built in the same area planned for Units 3 &amp; 4, included excess capacity for common facilities such as a surge pond, water intake structures, and power transmission lines to serve all four plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The company arranged for an environmental analysis of the Colstrip project in early 1973. It applied for a state construction permit in June under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7 70-801 <em>et seq. </em>(Supp.1977), and executed several contracts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Due to delay in processing the permit application, Montana Power entered into no other major contracts after October 1974. The Siting Act permit was finally granted in July 1976.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">In September 1975, the administrator of EPA\u2019s Region VIII informed Montana Power that its plans to build Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 might be subject to PSD review and permitting, and requested more information about the project. The company responded in February 1976 and petitioned the EPA for a ruling on the applicability of the PSD regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\n<em>B. The Strelow Memoranda.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In evaluating Montana Power\u2019s request for exemption from PSD review and permitting, Region VIII\u2019s administrator relied upon two memoranda written by Roger Strelow, then EPA\u2019s Assistant Administrator for Air and Waste Management, which interpreted the phrase \u201ccommenced construction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\">The first memorandum, dated December 18, 1975, provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-15\">[T]he term \u201ccommencement of construction\u201d . . . refers to on-site construction. Ordinarily therefore only significant and continuous site preparation work such as major clearing or excavation or placement, assembly, or installation of unique facilities or equipment at the site should be considered a \u201cprogram of construction or modification\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 52.21(b)(7). However each case must be reviewed on its own facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-17\">There may also be situations where, although actual on-site work has not commenced or been contracted for, the source is so irrevocably committed to a particular site that it should be considered as having commenced construction. Such situations could include sources which are only a few days or weeks from commencing on-site construction or sources which have contracted for or constructed unique site specific facilities or equipment which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>are not yet being installed on-site. Such situations will be rare but may be taken into account in determining whether the source is in effectively the same position as if it had commenced on-site construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-4\">Finally, 40 CFR \u00a7 52.21(b)(7) states that an owner or operator has commenced construction not only when he has undertaken a continuous program of construction or modification himself but also when he has entered into a \u201ccontractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification\u201d. The question of whether a contract represents a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d will depend upon the unavoidable loss that would be suffered by a source if it is required to cancel such contract. [W]here the contract may be cancelled or modified at an <em>insubstantial ioss </em>to the plant operator, the proposed source should not be allowed to escape review under these regulations. The determination of whether a source will suffer a <em>substantial loss </em>if the contract were terminated and therefore whether there is, in fact a \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d, must be made on a case-by-case basis as there are no general guidelines that would cover all situations. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The second memorandum of April 21, 1976, clarified what was necessary for a contractual obligation to qualify a source for exemption from PSD review and permitting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">[A]s a general rule, for one to qualify for the contractual exemption, <em>he must have contracted for continuous on-site construction work. </em>The discussion [on the \u201ccontractual obligation\u201d exemption in] my December 18 memo is <em>not </em>intended to provide exceptions to this general rule. That discussion relates to situations in which <em>even though </em>a \u201ccontract\u201d for on-site work were executed prior to June 1975, the \u201ccontract\u201d <em>might still not qualify </em>the source for an exemption [because the source would experience no substantial loss].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-11\">Accordingly, the mere fact that a source had contracted for the fabrication of a piece of equipment prior to June 1975 (i. e., placing an order for a boiler) would <em>not </em>ordinarily exempt the source. Only if a non-site-work contract could fit within the \u201cirrevocably committed\u201d exception . . . would it qualify the source for an exemption from review. As my memo indicates, such situations should be \u201crare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">The second memorandum also stated that the absence of a state construction permit should be a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in determining whether a source should be exempt from PSD review and permitting because it was irrevocably committed to a specific site.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">Thus, using the Strelow Memoranda to interpret its regulations, the EPA would grandfather a source from PSD review and permitting only if, by June 1, 1975, the source had: (1) actually begun a continuous program of on-site construction; (2a) contracted for a continuous program of on-site construction which could not be terminated without substantial loss; or (2b) contracted for construction not amounting to a continuous program of <em>on-site </em>construction, but which nevertheless irrevocably committed the source to a specific site.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\n<em>C. Applicability of the PSD Regulations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">Region VIII\u2019s administrator advised Montana Power on February 26, 1976, of the EPA\u2019s decision that Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 were subject to PSD review and permitting. A following letter in May affirmed that decision and gave the reasons.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In EPA\u2019s view, before June 1, 1975, Montana Power: (1) had not begun actual on-site construction; (2) had not received the necessary state preconstruction permits; and (3) had not demonstrated an irrevocable commitment to a specific site, partly because it would suffer no substantial loss from the termination of its contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The EPA based its conclusion that the company would suffer no substantial loss on a ratio of unavoidable losses to total project cost. It found that contract payments and cancellation charges amounting to $8.7 million were clearly \u201ccontractual obligations\u201d for the construction of Units 3 &amp; 4 and that another $13.6 million was arguably in this category.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It rejected claims totaling an additional $106.5 million.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Using a total project cost of $790 million, the EPA calculated that the company\u2019s contractual obligations constituted 2.8 percent of the project\u2019s cost and concluded that this sum was not substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">Montana Power sought judicial review of the EPA\u2019s final determination. In January 1977, the court granted the company declaratory, but not injunctive, relief,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> holding that it had commenced construction of Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4 before June 1, 1975, and was therefore exempt from PSD review and permitting. <em>Montana Power v. EPA, </em>429 F.Supp. 683 (D.Mont.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">In reaching its holding, the court concluded that the EPA\u2019s determination was arbitrary and capricious because the agency recently had exempted two other electric generating plants not as far advanced as Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4. <em>Id. </em>at 699-701. It also concluded that, although the use of a ratio in determining substantiality of loss is itself not necessarily arbitrary and capricious, its application here was because of the huge sum of money, in absolute terms, already committed to the units\u2019 construction.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\n<em>D. 1977 Amendments.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">While the district court\u2019s judgment was on appeal, Congress passed the 1977 Amendments, effective August 7, 1977. These provided for the first time explicit <em>statutory </em>authority for the prevention of significant deterioration of air quality, a subject previously covered only in EPA\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The amendments generally preserved the structure of the PSD regulations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But, among other modifications,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the amendments enacted a stricter definition of \u201ccommenced\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">(2)(A) the term \u201ccommenced\u201d as applied to construction of a major emitting facility means that the owner or operator has obtained all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits required by Federal, State, or local air pollution emissions and air quality laws or regulations and either has (i) begun, or caused to begin, a continuous program of physical on-site construction of the facility or (ii) entered into binding agreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of construction of the facility to be completed within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">(B) The term \u201cnecessary preconstruction approvals or permits\u201d means those permits or approvals, required by the permitting authority as a precondition to undertaking any activity under clauses (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">Clean Air Act \u00a7 169(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">Although the definition in the amendments is substantially different on its face from the definition in the regulations, it is generally consistent with the interpretation of the regulation definition in the Strelow Memoranda. A significant difference is that the possession of necessary precon-struction permits, only a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in determining if a source had commenced construction under the regulations, is required for such a determination under the 1977 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The transition from the regulatory to the statutory scheme is outlined in \u00a7 168. Section 168(a) provides that, until a state\u2019s implementation plan is revised to conform to the Act\u2019s new PSD procedures, the pre-amendment regulations will remain in effect for that area, except as provided in subsection (b).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">Section 168(b) also provides that, in the case of a source which commenced construction \u2014 under the new definition of \u00a7 168(a) \u2014after June 1, 1975, and before the effective date of the 1977 Amendments on August 7, 1977, PSD review and permitting \u201cshall be in accordance with the regulations for the prevention of significant deterioration in effect prior to the enactment of the Glean Air Act Amendments of 1977.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>On November 3, 1977, EPA amended its PSD regulations to reflect the immediately effective changes required by the 1977 Amendments, including the \u00a7 169(2) definition of \u201ccommence.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 57,459 (1977). It also proposed amendments to the regulations, to take effect later, which would incorporate the other changes enacted by Congress.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> 42 Fed.Reg. 57,471, 57,-479 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">The proposed regulation amendments would \u201cgreatly expand the coverage of the EPA\u2019s current regulations and generally impose more stringent requirements for pollution sources seeking to construct or modify in clean air areas.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 57,479 (1977). A source would not be subject to the <em>new </em>PSD regulations if it had obtained a final PSD permit by March 1, 1978, and commenced construction before December 1, 1978.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 57,481. Somewhat behind schedule, the EPA published its final amendments to the PSD regulations on June 19, 1978, conforming the regulations to the remaining requirements of the 1977 Amendments. 43 Fed.Reg. 26,388 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">The EPA issued a final determination on November 29, 1977, that Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 had not timely commenced construction under \u00a7 169(2) of the Clean Air Act because Montana Power had not received all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits. The agency therefore found the plants were subject to PSD review and permitting under the 1977 Amendments. 42 Fed.Reg. 60,784 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Montana Power petitioned this court for review of EPA\u2019s determination and, without prejudice to its contentions on appeal, continued its efforts to obtain a PSD permit for Units 3 &amp; 4. On June 12, 1978, EPA denied the company\u2019s application because it determined the units would violate the Class I pollution increments applicable to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">We face two issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">(1) whether the district court erred in reversing EPA\u2019s determination that Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4 were subject to PSD review and permitting under the regulations because construction had not commenced before June 1, 1975; and</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">(2) whether the EPA erred in concluding Montana Power had not commenced construction of the units under \u00a7 169(2), thus subjecting them to PSD review and permitting under the 1977 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">WHETHER CONSTRUCTION COMMENCED UNDER THE REGULATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The district court focused on EPA\u2019s application of a \u201csubstantial loss test\u201d, read into the regulations by the Strelow Memoranda, in holding the agency\u2019s refusal to exempt Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 from PSD review and permitting to be arbitrary and capricious. Although the EPA cited other reasons for its refusal, also challenged by Montana Power here,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we need not reach those questions because of our disposition of the substantial loss issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-14\">\n<em>A. Degree of Deference.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-15\">A reviewing court may set aside an agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (1976). When making this determination, the court ordinarily must give agency interpretations of its regulations upon which the action is based the degree of deference described in <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 85 S.Ct. 792, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-16\">When faced with a problem of statutory construction, this Court shows great deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration. . . . When the construction of an <em>administrative regulation </em>rather than a statute is in issue, <em>deference is even more clearly in order.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS2\"><em>Id. </em>at 16, 85 S.Ct. at 801 (emphasis added). <em>Accord, Burglin v. Morton, </em>527 F.2d 486, 490 (9th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 973, 96 S.Ct. 2171, 48 L.Ed.2d 796 (1976); <em>Brubaker v.

Klein, </em>456 F.2d 1391, 1393 (9th Cir. 1972). The court concluded, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">when an analysis of an agency\u2019s activities involves a question concerning the meaning of a statutory term, the application of a statutory term to facts, or an agency interpretation of a statute, then the breadth of judicial review is much wider.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqN\">429 F.Supp. at 695. It also found that the Strelow Memoranda were merely intra-agency, non-public guidelines to interpret the PSD regulations and, as such, were not entitled to the usual degree of deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">We are aware that a court reviewing an agency action \u201cmust consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors\u201d and that the \u201cinquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824. But, \u201cthe ultimate standard of review is a narrow one\u201d and the objective of the inquiry is to determine \u201cwhether there has been a clear error of judgment\u201d by the agency. <em>Id. See also Bone v. Hibernia Bank, </em>493 F.2d 135, 139 \u2014 40 (9th Cir. 1974); <em>Hughes Air Corp. v. CAB, </em>482 F.2d 143,145-46 (9th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. Whelan, </em>463 F.2d 1093, 1094 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Unlike the district court, we do not believe the standard set forth in <em>Tallman </em>allows the courts any broader grant of review when an agency determination \u201cconcern\u00eds] the meaning of a statutory term\u201d, as long as the agency does not exceed its own statutory authorization. Here, the EPA was not interpreting a statute, but rather its own regulations, which is entitled under <em>Tallman </em>to even more deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Similarly, even though we agree with the district court that the Strelow Memoranda \u201cwere merely intra-agency, non-public guidelines\u201d, we are unpersuaded they should be given any less than normal deference as long as they are a reasonable interpretation of the PSD regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">While we express no opinion about the other parts of the Strelow Memoranda, we conclude that a \u201csubstantial loss test\u201d is reasonable to determine if an owner \u201chas entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or modification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">We agree with the Tribe that, if the Memoranda alter the meaning of the regulation at all in this respect, it is to liberalize the regulation\u2019s requirements.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Thus, if a source executes contracts that could not be cancelled or modified without substantial loss, indicating an irrevocable commitment to a specific site, it would be unnecessary under the EPA\u2019s interpretation for the contractual commitment to be either continuous or inclusive of completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">It is not enough, however, to note that the district court applied an incorrect standard of deference to the Strelow Memoran-da. Nor is it sufficient for us to conclude that passing a substantial loss test is a reasonable prerequisite to being grandfathered under the irrevocable commitment exception to PSD review and permitting.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Applying the proper degree of deference, we still must decide if the substantial loss test, as applied here to Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4, was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\n<em>B. Prior Decisions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Before the EPA\u2019s final determination in May 1976 refusing to grandfather Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4, the agency exempted two other power plants in arguably similar contractual positions. The apparent inconsistency in interpreting the regulations clearly influenced the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In May 1975 the Region X administrator notified Portland General Electric (PGE) that its plant at Boardman, Oregon was exempt from PSD review and permitting. The finding that PGE had obligated itself to complete within a reasonable time a continuous program of construction was based on a contract to purchase a turbine generator.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">After the first Strelow Memorandum was issued, the Region VIII administrator ruled in March 1976 that Pacific Power and Light Company\u2019s Jim Bridger Unit 4 was \u201cirrevocably committed\u201d to its site as of June 1, 1975, because it had been designed to share facilities with existing units at that location and had executed contracts involving $5.4 million in cancellation charges. The plant was grandfathered from PSD review and permitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Montana Power argues that before June 1, 1975, it had contracted for a turbine generator for each plant, designed Units 3 &amp; 4 to share facilities with Units 1 &amp; 2 then under construction, and entered into contracts that could not be cancelled without penalties of $8.7 million. It contends it was further committed to a program of construction than were the two companies building the grandfathered power plants and that Units 3 &amp; 4 therefore were entitled to exemption from PSD review and permitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">Although the EPA and the Tribe attempt to distinguish the other two rulings on their facts,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we may assume for our purposes that Montana Power\u2019s contractual commitment to construct Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 was at least as advanced as, if not greater than, those for the Boardman and Bridger plants. We may also assume, as the district court found, that the prior decisions were consistent with the regulations and that the Stre-low Memoranda demonstrated a change in policy. The question remains, however, what significance these apparently inconsistent determinations should have when evaluating the EPA\u2019s refusal to exempt Units 3 &amp; 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">The district court concluded that since the EPA \u201cha[d] switched horses in midstream\u201d, the policies implicit in the earlier two decisions, rather than in the Strelow Memoranda, should have been used to evaluate Montana Power\u2019s request for PSD exemption.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> 429 F.2d at 700-01. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>admitting that the EPA is not absolutely bound by its prior rulings, Montana Power argues that a definite shift in the interpretation of the regulations occurred, entitling the agency\u2019s determination that Units 3 &amp; 4 had not met the exemption prerequisites to little deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Both the district court and Montana Power misconstrue the scope of judicial review of agency action. Even if the action involves a new interpretation of a regulation, the traditional standard of deference announced in <em>Tallman </em>applies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">The scope of our review of an administrative order wherein a new principle is announced and applied is no different from that which pertains to ordinary administrative action.

INS, </em>375 F.2d 262, 265 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">The Boardman decision was made before either of the Strelow Memoranda was issued. It did not represent a settled agency policy. The EPA has since admitted it mistakenly exempted that plant from PSD review and permitting on the basis of a turbine generator contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-14\">In light of our limited scope of review and the prerogative of the agency to evolve the interpretation of its regulations, we cannot say the agency was bound by that decision or improperly disregarded it in ruling on Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 once national guidelines in the Strelow Memoranda had been issued. Nor can we say that the Col-strip decision is entitled to any less deference because of the Boardman plant ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-15\">The Bridger plant was exempted from PSD review and permitting under the \u201cirrevocable commitment\u201d exception explained in the first Strelow Memorandum. But the decision came prior to the second Memorandum that clarified the kind of contracts necessary for a sufficient contractual commitment to exist and emphasized that the situations in which a plant could be irrevocably committed to a site should be \u201crare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>In view of this clarification and the power of the agency to reasonably depart from prior rulings in light of experience, we are unable to conclude with the district court that this ruling necessarily \u201cshow[s] that an agreement to purchase a turbine generator, the sharing of on-site facilities such as a water system and a transmission system, and contracts for major components amount[s] to a commencement of construction within the meaning of 40 C.F.R. 52.-21(b)(7).\u201d 429 F.Supp. at 696. The EPA is free to make reasonable changes in the interpretation of its regulations and in the application of the regulations to specific cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We realize that Montana Power was first notified it was subject to PSD review and permitting on February 26, 1976, prior to the decision exempting the Bridger plant. But the letter that explained the basis of the agency\u2019s ruling was not sent until May, after the second Strelow Memorandum was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Whether the agency was mistaken in its application of the first Strelow Memorandum to the Bridger plant, or it found a new and different rationale in the second Memorandum for refusing to exempt Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4, makes no difference. Providing the EPA does not single out the Colstrip plants for discriminatory treatment under a peculiarly harsh interpretation of its regulations and the Strelow Memoranda,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we cannot say in the absence of any other evidence alleged to show arbitrary or capricious agency action that EPA was bound by its Bridger decision or that the Colstrip ruling is entitled to any less than normal deference. Cases cited to the contrary by Montana Power are either consistent with this conclusion or are distinguishable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>We agree with the district court in a factually similar case that, under the circumstances here, it does not matter that the EPA \u201cswitched horses in midstream\u201d as long as it \u201cwas astraddle a good horse when it reached the other side.\u201d <em>Gulf Power Co. v. EPA, </em>PCA No. 77-0477 (N.D.Fla. May 2, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\n<em>C. Use of a Ratio.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The district court allowed that some concept of substantiality of unavoidable loss is reasonable in determining if a source\u2019s contractual commitment is the functional equivalent of having commenced actual construction. But the court found that, under this fact situation, use of a ratio of unavoidable loss to total project cost to determine substantiality was improper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">The ratio itself is not arbitrary or capricious. Its application can be. The function of the ratio is to establish a proper balance between entrepreneurial risks and social and economic utility. . [W]ith those cases that have not commenced on-site construction but have gone past the intracorporate planning stage . . . , what the agency must do is reach the equilibrium point between investor risk and irrevocable external commitments that amount to a continuing program of construction, a program based not on speculation but upon a well-designed construction plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">429 F.Supp. at 701. The court concluded that the \u201cassumption that \u2018substantial\u2019 must be measured in relative rather than absolute terms . . . results in a capricious application of the policy designed to strike a balance between investor risk and social utility.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Although Montana Power apparently agrees that the Strelow Memoranda properly read into the regulations a \u201csubstantial loss test\u201d, it argues that nothing in the memoranda justified use of a ratio to determine substantiality in its case. It concedes that, despite the lack of reference in the memoranda, a ratio might be the fairest way to measure substantial loss for smaller projects, but argues that a ratio works an injustice on larger projects in which the stakes are higher. It contends that its unavoidable loss exceeding $22.3 million as of June 1, 1975, was clearly substantial in absolute terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">Had we such an option, we might as a matter of policy define \u201csubstantial loss\u201d to include significant cancellation or modification costs, in absolute terms, that only constitute a small percentage of the total anticipated cost of a large project such as Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4. In light of the deference we must accord the EPA\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, however, we do not have that option.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">The EPA could reasonably conclude that the developers of a large power plant were not \u201cirrevocably committed\u201d to the project at a given site unless their investment had reached a specific percentage of the total cost, regardless of the amount already expended. Here, $22.3 million is clearly a significant sum, but it was only 2.8% of the total cost, a relatively modest investment in terms of the overall project.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The EPA is not required to view the substantiality of loss from the stockholder\u2019s perspective, which might include sums significantly smaller than that committed by Montana Power here. It may use a more objective standard such as a ratio. It does not matter that the EPA apparently failed to use a ratio in the Boardman and Bridger plant decisions. As we have discussed, an agency may make reasonable changes in the interpretation of its regulations in light of experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">Neither the district court nor Montana Power suggested a formula by which sub-stantiality of loss could be measured by a ratio on some projects, particularly on smaller ones, but by the absolute amount of unavoidable loss for larger power plants such as Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4. Nor was it practical for them to have done so. The determination of substantiality of loss for exemption from PSD review and permitting must be made on a case-by-case basis and is properly consigned to the sound discretion of the EPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Even if the EPA\u2019s objective in determining substantiality of loss was to \u201cstrike a balance between investor risk and social utility,\u201d we cannot say that the agency showed a \u201cclear error of judgment,\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, </em>401 U.S. at 416, 91 S.Ct. 814, in using a ratio of unavoidable loss and total project cost to strike the balance. The district court merely substituted its judgment for that of the agency. As the Supreme Court noted in another context, the agency\u2019s \u201cinterpretation may not be the only one permitted by the language of the [regulations], but it is quite clearly a reasonable interpretation; courts must therefore respect it.\u201d <em>Tallman, </em>380 U.S. at 4, 85 S.Ct. at 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\n<em>D. Notice and Hearing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The district court interpreted the alleged policy changes effected by the Strelow Memoranda to be an exercise of EPA\u2019s rule-making function. Because the memoranda</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">were issued without notice or hearing, it found them to be adopted improperly.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">We conclude, however, that the memoranda were merely \u201cinterpretive rules\u201d under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b)(3)(A) (1976), and that rulemaking procedures were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">WHETHER CONSTRUCTION COMMENCED UNDER THE 1977 AMENDMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">Although we have determined that Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4 are subject to PSD review and permitting under the pre-amendment regulations,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we still face the question of how the 1977 Amendments affect the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">No party discussed adequately the interrelationship of the pre- and post-1977 Amendment PSD review and permitting schemes. The EPA and the Tribe imply they would be \u201csatisfied\u201d if Units 3 &amp; 4 are subject to review under either scheme. In light of changes in the regulations after the 1977 Amendments, however, which could make more difficult securing a PSD permit for the units, we consider Montana Power\u2019s petition for review of the EPA\u2019s determination that it had not commenced construction under the 1977 Amendments before August 7, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-16\">\n<em>A. Refining the Issue.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-17\">The new definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in the 1977 Amendments generally follows the Strelow Memoranda interpretation of the pre-amendment regulatory definition, with one significant distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">As with the Memoranda interpretation, an owner or operator must <em>either </em>begin \u201ca continuous program of physical on-site construction\u201d <em>or </em>enter into contractual obligations, \u201cwhich cannot be canceled or modified without substantial loss . . ., to undertake a program of construction of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>facility to be completed within a reasonable time.\u201d <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Clean Air Act \u00a7 169(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The difference is that, whether a source \u201chas obtained all necessary preconstruction approvals or permits required by Federal, State or local air pollution emissions and air quality laws or regulations,\u201d id, is no longer merely a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in determining if a source is irrevocably committed to its site, but rather is a prerequisite to satisfying the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d irrespective of how the source claims its exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Section 168 bridges the gap between the regulatory and statutory definitions of \u201ccommence.\u201d It provides that if a source meets the statutory definition <em>between </em>June 1, 1975, and August 7, 1977, \u201cthe review and permitting of such facility shall be in accordance with\u201d the pre-amendment PSD review and permitting procedures in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Thus, three time periods are relevant under the 1977 Amendments to determine the effect of PSD review and permitting on a given source. If the source \u201ccommenced construction,\u201d as defined in the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">(1) before June 1, 1975, it is exempt from PSD review and permitting under the 1977 Amendments;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">(2) between June 1, 1975, and August 7, 1977, it is subject to PSD review and permitting under the pre-amendment regulations; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">(3) after August 7, 1977, or not at all, it could be subject to stricter PSD review and permitting under the PSD regulations amended to conform to the 1977 Amendments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">There is no question that Montana Power did not commence construction, under the statutory definition, before June 1,1975. It concedes it began no on-site construction before that date and we determined above that, under the EPA\u2019s acceptable interpretation, the company would sustain no substantial loss if it had been forced to cancel or modify its contractual obligations as of that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">Montana Power argues that, even if it had not commenced construction under the statutory definition before June 1, 1975, it did so before August 7, 1977. It maintains that the language in \u00a7 168, specifying that sources commencing construction in this interim shall be reviewed \u201cin accordance with\u201d the regulations in effect before the 1977 Amendments, preserves the Colstrip Units\u2019 grandfather status as established by the district court. Since we reverse the district court, we need not reach this issue.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">Montana Power is at least subject to PSD review and permitting under the pre-amendment regulations. Even if it commenced construction under the statutory definition before August 7, 1977, the same PSD requirements would apply. The issue then becomes whether it failed to commence construction before August 7, 1977. If so, Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 might be subject to the stricter PSD review and permitting procedures in the regulations amended to conform to the 1977 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">\n<em>B. Necessary Preconstruction Approvals or Permits.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">After prevailing in the district court, Montana Power began land clearing at the Colstrip site in June 1977. It asserts these operations began a \u201cprogram of physical on-site construction\u201d that would have been continuous but for the EPA\u2019s order to halt construction in September.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It also argues that its unavoidable loss as of August 7, 1977, had grown to $78.5 million and that this sum was clearly substantial, even using the EPA\u2019s ratio approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Establishing only that on-site construction had begun or that its unavoidable loss would be substantial is insufficient to meet the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in the 1977 Amendments. It is also necessary to demonstrate a source has all necessary precon-struction approvals or permits prior to the cut-off date.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Montana Power obtained a permit in June 1976 under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7 70-801 <em>et seq. </em>It did not receive a permit from the state\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, under the Montana Clean Air Act, Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7 69-3911 (Supp. 1977), until January 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The company argues that it needed neither permit to satisfy the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in the 1977 Amendments. Alternatively, if any permits were required, it asserts the only one necessary was the one received under the Siting Act, issued before the effective date of the 1977 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Because of the way we decide the approvals or permits issue, we do not reach Montana Power\u2019s representations about on-site construction begun or substantial loss incurred before August 7, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">\n<em>1. Section 169(2)(B)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Montana Power argues that \u00a7 169(2)(B) makes clear it needed no preconstruction permits to satisfy the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in the 1977 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">Referring to the immediately preceding subsection, \u00a7 169(2)(A), which defines \u201ccommence\u201d as having \u201call necessary precon-struction approvals or permits\u201d and either (i) having begun on-site construction or (ii) having entered into sufficient contractual obligations, \u00a7 169(2)(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">The term \u201cnecessary preconstruction approvals or permits\u201d means those permits or approvals, required by the permitting authority as a precondition to undertaking any activity under clauses (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in connection with the plural \u201cclauses\u201d creates a significant problem of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Montana Power emphasizes the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d and argues that the phrase \u201cany activity under clauses (i) or (ii)\u201d is the grammatical equivalent of \u201cany activity under clause (i) or any activity under clause (ii).\u201d It says that a source must have pre-construction permits necessary for <em>either </em>on-site construction <em>or </em>entering into contractual obligations, but not both. Since the contractual obligations on which it relies for its PSD exemption claim required no approval from any permitting authority before their execution, the company argues it satisfied the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in \u00a7 169(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The EPA emphasizes the plural \u201cclauses\u201d and contends the phrase \u201cany activity under clauses (i) or (ii)\u201d means \u201cany activity mentioned in either clause.\u201d It argues that the company needed all permits necessary for contracting <em>and </em>for on-site construction. Since it had no permit under the Montana Clean Air Act<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> before August 7, 1977, it could not have commenced construction under \u00a7 169(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">The disputed phrase is ambiguous and could be given either interpretation, another example of poor drafting requiring judicial deciphering. Unfortunately, the legislative history is equally confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">The definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in the 1977 Amendments, as reported out of committee, did not define \u201cnecessary preconstruction approvals or permits.\u201d During Senate debate on the measure, Senator Henry M. Jackson proposed an amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-16\">[T]he term \u201cnecessary preconstruction approvals or permits\u201d means those permits or approvals, <em>if any, </em>required as a precondition to undertaking any activity <em>relied upon by an owner or operator to satisfy the requirements in </em>clauses (i) or (ii)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>123 Cong.Rec. at S9455 (daily ed., June 10, 1977) (emphasis added).

No. 95-564, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 153 (1977), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1977, p. 1533, the company says the original intent of Jackson\u2019s amendment was preserved. That intent allegedly was to permit a source that had relied only on its contractual commitments for its PSD exemption claim to satisfy the permit requirement automatically because it needed no permits just to execute contracts.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">The EPA responds that, even if Montana Power correctly read Senator Jackson\u2019s intent in offering the amendment, Congress did not agree. It cites the Senate Report describing the purpose of the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>\u201ccommence,\u201d a comment by Senator Jackson as an introduction to his amendment, and remarks of Senator Muskie, to show a congressional intent that a source needed <em>all </em>preconstruction permits, notably those necessary for on-site construction, to satisfy the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d in \u00a7 169(2)(A).<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It reminds us that the version that emerged from the Conference Committee removed any possibility of a different interpretation.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Although conceding that Congress wanted to preserve the issues in the district court case, the EPA also quotes remarks by the chief sponsor of the 1977 Amendments in the House that the Conference Committee intended to create no special exception for Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> which the EPA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>contends would result by using Montana Power\u2019s interpretation of the Jackson amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">The EPA finally argues Senator Jackson held the mistaken idea that, when he proposed his amendment, Montana Power had all necessary permits for on-site construction. This is consistent, the agency contends, with his comment that Montana Power \u201cha[d] completely complied with the law\u201d and that his amendment would \u201cnot prejudice the litigation that is pending\u201d in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The legislative history is rife with inconsistencies, and the explanations of the parties attempting to rationalize it to correspond with their different interpretations are often strained. When conflicting, inconclusive views form the greater part of the legislative history, we are left with divining the \u201cintent\u201d of Congress from the overall purpose of the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">One of the declared purposes of the Clean Air Act is \u201cto protect and enhance the quality of the Nation\u2019s air resources so as to promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its population.\u201d Clean Air Act \u00a7 101(b)(1). PSD review and permitting is the only method of enforcing the allowable pollution increments applicable to sources such as Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4. Exemptions claimed from PSD review and permitting therefore must be so examined as not to contravene the basic policy of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Section 169(2)(A) requires a source seeking to satisfy the definition of commence to obtain <em>\u201call </em>necessary preconstruction approvals or permits required by Federal, State, or local air pollution emissions and air quality laws or regulations\u201d (emphasis added). On its face, this language admits of no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The <em>kind </em>of permits specified is also important. By requiring <em>\u201cpreconstruction </em>approvals or permits,\u201d the language of the statute implies that the kinds of permits required are those necessary to begin construction. This does not coincide with Montana Power\u2019s understanding that it did- not need any construction permits to satisfy the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d because it relied only upon its contractual obligations to claim a PSD exemption, and no permits are necessary to enter contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">All parties agree that the \u00a7 169(2) definition of \u201ccommence\u201d is stricter than the pre-amendment regulatory definition. Yet, when the regulatory definition is viewed in light of the Strelow Memoranda, there is but one important distinction that could make the statutory definition stricter. As interpreted by the Memoranda, the regulatory definition made possession of necessary preconstruction permits only a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in determining if a source was irrevocably committed to a specific site. In \u00a7 169(2)(A)-(B), possession of required permits is mandatory to satisfy the definition of commence. This casts doubt on any interpretation of the statute that would weaken the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d and allow a source to satisfy it easily.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Montana Power suggests a definition of \u00a7 169(2)(A)-(B) that would allow a source to \u201ccommence construction\u201d merely by entering into contractual commitments. Under this interpretation a source could begin construction illegally, lacking the necessary permits, but satisfy the definition of \u201ccommence\u201d as long as it relied solely on its contractual obligations in claiming PSD exemption. This is hardly a \u201cstricter defini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>tion\u201d than that in the regulations, and we doubt Congress intended such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Senator Jackson may have intended in his proposed amendment to allow Col-strip Units 3 &amp; 4 to satisfy the permit requirement under \u00a7 169(2)(A) merely on the basis of its contractual commitments. But so interpreted, the amendment appears to be special legislation the primary purpose of which is to benefit Montana Power. Absent a clearer showing, we are unwilling to ascribe this intent to Congress. If Congress had wanted the Jackson amendment to protect the Colstrip Units against the possible adverse effects of the 1977 Amendments, it could easily have so stated. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\n<em>2. Requirements of the Montana Clean Air Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Even if the phrase \u201cnecessary precon-struction approvals or permits\u201d in \u00a7 169(2)(A)-(B) is interpreted to mean those permits necessary for actual on-site construction, Montana Power argues it obtained the only permit required before the effective date of the 1977 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The company received approval under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, Mont. Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 70-801 <em>et seq., </em>in July 1976. It received no permit under the state Clean Air Act, Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 69-3906 <em>et seq., </em>until January 1978. It asserts that the state Clean Air Act permit is not required under \u00a7 169(2)(A)-(B), and that it sought one only to avoid protracted litigation as to its necessity. The EPA contends that permits under both the Siting Act and the state Clean Air Act are \u201cnecessary pre-construction approvals or permits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">The state Clean Air Act was enacted in 1967. With its regulations, it is part of the state\u2019s implementation plan under the federal Clean Air Act. While a parent organization administers the plan generally, the Board of Health and Environmental Sciences controls the permitting of all new sources of air pollution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\">The board may by rule prohibit the construction, installation, alteration, or use of a machine, equipment, device, or facility which it finds may directly or indirectly cause or contribute to air pollution . , unless a permit therefor has been obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7 69-3911. The regulations require two permits, one for construction and one for operation or use. Mont.Admin.Code \u00a7\u00a7 16 \u2014 2.14(1) \u2014 S1400(l)\u2014 (9), (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">The Major Facility Siting Act, enacted in 1973, specifically governs \u201cthe construction of additional power or energy conversion facilities\u201d and is meant \u201cto ensure that the location, construction and operation of power and energy conversion facilities will produce minimal adverse effects pn the environment.\u201d Mont.Rev.Codes Ann. \u00a7 70-802. Before a facility may be constructed or operated, it must obtain a \u201ccertificate of environmental compatibility and public need,\u201d the equivalent of a permit. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 70-804.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">The Board of Natural Resources and Conservation controls the issuance of permits under the Siting Act. It may not grant one unless it determines</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-14\">that duly authorized state air and water quality agencies have certified that the proposed facility will not violate state and federally established standards and implementation plans .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-15\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 70-810(l)(h). The relevant agency is the Board of Health, which is responsible for issuing a permit under the state Clean Air Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Section 70-817 of the Siting Act provides that, once a permit under the act has been granted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-17\">[notwithstanding any other law, no state or regional agency, or municipality or other local government, may require any approval, consent, permit, certificate, or other condition for the construction, operation, or maintenance of a facility authorized by a certificate issued pursuant to this chapter; <em>except </em>that the state air and water quality agency or agencies shall retain authority which they have or may be granted to determine compliance of the proposed facility with state and federal standards and implementation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>plans for air and water quality and to enforce those standards . . . . (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Montana Power argues that findings of the Board of Health in certifying a source to the Board of Natural Resources under the Siting Act duplicate those it must make under the state Clean Air Act. Since the Siting Act deals specifically with new energy sources and is, comprehensive to the exclusion of other state statutes,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> the company argues that the certification by the Board of Health that was necessary to obtain its Siting Act permit constitutes permission to construct under the state Clean Air Act as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The company reads narrowly the exception to \u00a7 70-817, which protects the authority of state air quality agencies like the Board of Health \u201cto determine compliance of the proposed facility with state and federal standards.\u201d Instead of interpreting the exception as ensuring the Board of Health\u2019s power to issue construction permits, which might detract from the comprehensive scheme of the Siting Act, Montana Power argues that the exception only preserves the Board\u2019s power to grant <em>use </em>permits, for which there is no analogue in the Siting Act. Since a use permit is issued only after a source is constructed, it cannot be a <em>preconstruction </em>approval or permit required by the definition of \u201ccommence m \u00a7 169(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">This understanding of the relationship between the state Clean Air Act and the Siting Act is strained, at best. The language of \u00a7 70-817 preserving the authority of the Board of Health is not limited to issuing use permits.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> It allows the Board \u201cto determine compliance of the <em>proposed </em>facility\u201d with applicable standards. Use permits granted after a facility is built cannot be for a \u201cproposed\u201d facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">Whether construction permits required under the state Clean Air Act and Siting Act are duplicative is not our concern. That is a matter for the Montana legislature. Section 169(2)(A)-(B) requires a source to obtain \u201cthose permits or approvals . . required by the permitting authority,\u201d in this case the State of Montana and its agencies.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Since Montana Power did not have both a state Clean Air Act permit and a Siting Act permit before August 7, 1977, it did not commence construction under the definition in the 1977 Amendments.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">Montana Power did not commence construction of Colstrip Units 8 &amp; 4, as that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>term is defined in the pre-amendment regulations, before June 1, 1975.

EPA, </em>No. 77-3058, challenging the propriety of the reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ3\">After vacillating in its decision, first advising the company it would deny the permit and then that it would grant it under certain conditions, the EPA announced after an extended period for public comment that it was denying the permit because of an expected violation for a few days each year of the Class I sulfur dioxide limits for the reservation. Montana Power also intervened in another case on appeal, <em>Puget Sound Power and Light Co. v. EPA, </em>Nos. 78-2821, 78-3234, challenging the permit denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b428-13\">. Montana Power takes particular issue with the interpretation of the regulations in the second Strelow Memoranda making possession of state construction permits a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in determining whether a project is irrevocably committed to a specific site. The company contends that this interpretation exceeds the scope of the regulations, which have no mention of state permits in the definition of \u201ccommence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-20\">The EPA responds that the company may not accept the Strelow Memoranda\u2019s interpretation of the regulations by claiming an \u201cirrevocable commitment\u201d exemption while asserting the memoranda are invalid insofar as they make possession of state permits a relevant factor in determining the degree of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-21\">The Tribe agrees with Montana Power that the second memorandum is inconsistent with the regulations, but for a different reason. It contends the possession of state permits should be a requirement, not merely a relevant factor, in determining the degree of commitment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b429-6\">. The Tribe reads the regulations literally to require contracts for actual commencement and completion of a continuous program of construction. It argues the regulations \u201csimply do not permit construction to be deemed to have commenced merely because sums of money, large or small, have been expended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adn\">Although we disagree with the Tribe\u2019s contention that the EPA exceeded its authority by including a substantial loss test in the regulations, we agree that the EPA\u2019s interpretation liberalized the regulation\u2019s facial meaning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b429-13\">. As discussed <em>infra, </em>the district court and Montana Power concede that some concept of substantiality of loss is properly read into the regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">. The Tribe argues the Boardman decision is distinguishable because Portland General Electric had received a state construction permit before June 1, 1975. Montana Power had no state permit for Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 until July 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">The company responds that there is no indication possession of a state permit was even considered in the Boardman decision since the regulations did not clearly require it and the Strelow Memoranda, which made possession a \u201crelevant factor\u201d in determining if a source was sufficiently committed to a site to be grandfathered, had not yet been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The Tribe attempts to distinguish the Bridger ruling, asserting the EPA believed at the time of its decision that the total Bridger cost would be $60 million and that $5.4 million in cancellation charges would have amounted to 9% of the total cost. The EPA also asserts it had this belief and offers similar calculations in its attempt to distinguish the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">This proposition is difficult to sustain. Sixty million dollars is a meager sum for a major power plant. Moreover, the EPA\u2019s exemption letter to Pacific Power and Light stated that \u201cthe record reflects that prior to June 1, 1975, contracts for major components of the system had been entered into resulting in a <em>commitment </em>of approximately $60,000,000 which could not be breached without incurring cancellation charges in excess of $5,400,000.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the EPA properly understood that $60 million was not the total cost of the Bridger project, but rather was the total of contract commitments by June 1, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b430-15\">. The court implied that Montana Power had relied on the EPA\u2019s interpretation of the regulations before the Strelow Memoranda, as reflected in the Boardman and Bridger decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-16\">It spoke of the weight to be given the memo-randa:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-17\">The principle of <em>Udaii </em>that deference is due the agency\u2019s interpretation of the regulations addresses the extra-agency statements, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>the intra-agency guidelines. An agency\u2019s public acts bear more weight than its private working papers. To overcome a good faith reliance on the former, the record must affirmatively reflect a basis to give deference to the latter. None exists in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">429 F.Supp. at 698. Later the court concluded: The intercorporate communication networks in industries like the utility industries are sophisticated and thorough. Thus, a very logical and a good faith interpretation by the Montana Power Company would be that its contractual commitments would exempt Units Three and Four from the preconstruction review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-18\">There is no basis in the record for finding that Montana Power relied on the Boardman and Bridger rulings in developing Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4 to avoid PSD review and permitting. Nor does the company make that contention. It would have been difficult to do so. The Boardman decision was announced two weeks before the grandfathering cut-off date and the Bridger decision came nine months later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b432-5\">. In its proposed rules to conform the PSD regulations with the requirements of the 1977 Amendments, published just before the EPA\u2019s final determination on Colstrip Units 3 &amp; 4, the agency described for public comment a \u201c10% test\u201d by which substantial loss could be measured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">Under this test, if the amount the owner would have to pay to cancel construction agreements (as of the date in question) would total more than 10% of the total project cost for the source in question, the loss would be deemed \u201csubstantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">42 Fed.Reg. 57,479, 57,481 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">In the commentary accompanying the new PSD regulations promulgated on June 19, 1978, the EPA noted the result of the public comments and outlines its current practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">Several comments were received, particularly from industry, on the \u201c10 percent\u201d test. Many of the commentators thought that the 10 percent rule was arbitrary since they regarded even smaller percentage losses on a $100,000,000 project as clearly being substantial. In response to these comments, EPA has abandoned the proposed 10 percent test as a firm rule. However, in order to help minimize administrative burdens and to provide some certainty, the Administrator will consider a loss as being substantial if it would be more than 10 percent of the total project cost. Whether a loss equal to or less than 10 percent is substantial will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The dominant consideration will be whether the \u201csource has so committed itself, financially and otherwise, to the use of a particular site for a particular facility that relocation is not an option and delay or substantial modification would be severely disruptive.\u201d [S.Rep. No. 95-127, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 32 (1977)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agm\">43 Fed.Reg. 26,388, 26,396 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">The current practice is not inconsistent with that used to measure Montana Power\u2019s sub-stantiality of loss for Units 3 &amp; 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\">.

If an owner of a proposed facility can demonstrate that he had <em>all the air quality-reiated clearance necessary to construct the facility, </em>and was not making the commitments involved entirely at his own risk, before he could be assured that construction could legally take, then such physical construction or contractual obligations might be deemed to have commenced construction within the meaning of this definition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">It should be added that for a contractual obligation to qualify a source as having commenced construction, the definition requires that the obligation be in connection with a continuous program of construction.
