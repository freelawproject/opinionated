Kelly. While waiting for his employer\u2019s boat to be refueled, Kelly leaned out of the fuel company\u2019s office window and indiscriminately fired three shots into the harbor. One of these shots ricocheted and struck Jack Trahan who was on shore at the time. Trahan sued Kelly\u2019s employer, Lafayette Crewboats, Inc. (Lafayette), and Lafayette\u2019s insurers, American Employers\u2019 Insurance Company (American Employers\u2019), American Motorists Insurance Company (American Motorists), and St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (St. Paul), in state court. Lafayette was provided comprehensive general liability insurance by American Employers\u2019, primary protection and indemnity insurance by American Motorists, and excess protection and indemnity insurance by St. Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">Trahan\u2019s state court action was settled before it came to trial. American Employers\u2019, American Motorists, and St. Paul jointly funded in varying portions a settlement of $525,000 in Trahan\u2019s favor, while reserving the right of each to litigate the issue of coverage of their various policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-12\">Subsequently, American Motorists and St. Paul filed a diversity action in district court against American Employers\u2019, claiming that they were entitled to reimbursement for that portion of the settlement fund which they had contributed. In its initial decision, the district court ruled in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. It held that American Motorists\u2019 and St. Paul\u2019s coverage did not extend to Kelly\u2019s shots since those policies protected only against liability arising out of the ownership of Lafayette\u2019s vessel. Further, relying upon <em>National Surety Corp. v. Western Fire &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>318 F.2d 379 (5th Cir. 1963), the district court refused to allow American Employers\u2019 to escape liability by proof that Kelly acted outside the scope of his employment and that, as a result, its policy did not apply to the shooting incident. The court observed that the introduction of such evidence would constitute litigation after settlement of Lafayette\u2019s liability to Trahan. The court concluded that <em>National Surety </em>prohibits such litigation after settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Upon rehearing, however, the district court reversed its decision as to American Employers\u2019 defense. It reaffirmed its conclusion that the settlement conclusively established Lafayette\u2019s liability to Trahan. However, it noted that a court may look to the underlying facts of an accident in determining whether an insurance policy covers that particular event. As a result, the district court concluded that American Employers\u2019 defense could be raised although the issue whether Kelly acted within the scope of his employment related both to the liability of his employer, Lafayette, and to the applicability of American Employers\u2019 policy to the incident. The court found that Kelly did not act within the scope of his employment and that, accordingly, American Employers\u2019 policy did not cover the accident. Since none of the insurance policies applied to the shooting, the court held that \u201call insurance companies must bear the losses resulting from their respective contributions to the settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">We note that the district court\u2019s handling of this matter was quite capable and correct. We write this opinion only to dispel any confusion that might exist as to the significance of this court\u2019s decision in <em>National Surety Corp. v. Western Fire &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>318 F.2d 379 (5th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\"><em>National Surety </em>presented a situation quite similar to this case. The two insur-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>anee companies, National Surety Corp. (National) and Western Fire &amp; Indemnity Co. (Western), had jointly funded a settlement to an injured plaintiff on behalf of their defendant insured, while reserving the right to litigate their liability under their respective policies. National attempted to avoid liability by asserting that its insured was not liable to the injured plaintiff because of the latter\u2019s contributory negligence. Holding that this defense was not available to National, the court stated that, in view of the insurers\u2019 settlement, the liability of their insured</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACrz\">should be taken as established for the purpose of thereafter determining as between themselves the extent of the obligation of each under its respective policy to discharge such liability and the right of each to recover from the other any amount of such $30,000 paid by it, which the other under its policy should have paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">318 F.2d at 386.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">This statement that an insurer cannot litigate after settlement the liability of its insured must be placed in the context of that case. In <em>National Surety, </em>as in this case, the relevant issue was whether, and to what extent, each insurance policy covered the activity which gave rise to the insured\u2019s potential liability. National\u2019s defense related solely to its insured\u2019s liability to the settling plaintiff, an issue which it was foreclosed from litigating by the settlement. The issue of contributory negligence was therefore irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In contrast, American Employers\u2019 defense here \u2014 that Kelly did not act within the scope of his employment \u2014 was relevant to this action, for it pertains to the issue whether American Employers\u2019 policy covered Lafayette\u2019s employee\u2019s actions. The fact that the defense coincidently concerned Lafayette\u2019s liability to Trahan is irrelevant; all issues concerning the insurers\u2019 policy coverage are to be litigated in this sort of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s judgment that the insurers\u2019 various contributions to the settlement fund should remain undisturbed even though none of the policies applied to the accident. In deciding to settle this case, the insurers performed various calculations concerning Lafayette\u2019s potential liability and the possible applicability of their respective policies. To the extent that they miscalculated, they must bear the burden of their gamble; their initial distribution must stand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-7\">. There might be situations in which it would be proper for a court to give effect to insurers\u2019 proration clauses even though none of the insurers\u2019 policies applies to the incident which gave rise to their joint funding of a settlement. We need not reach this issue, however, for this proration claim was not raised before us or the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
