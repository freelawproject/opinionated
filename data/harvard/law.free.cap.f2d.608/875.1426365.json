The board held that there was no likelihood of confusion over the source of the services offered from the contemporaneous use of opposer\u2019s \u201cBURGER CHEF\u201d and \u201cSANDWICH CHEF\u201d in \u201ctheir natural settings with distinctly different chef caricatures.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Sandwich Chef, Inc. has filed an application <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for registration of the following service mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Burger Chef Systems, Inc. has opposed registration alleging prior use and a likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception when applicant\u2019s mark is applied to applicant\u2019s services concurrently with opposer\u2019s use of its marks. Appellant\u2019s common-law mark is shown below.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Appellant\u2019s registered marks<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> include \u201cBURGER CHEF\u201d and the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">The board said that, because the services associated with the marks are identical, the only question was whether appellee\u2019s \u201cSANDWICH CHEF\u201d design mark would be equated with or confused with opposer\u2019s \u201cBURGER CHEF\u201d mark \u201cused alone and/or with a chef design.\u201d It opined that, although there could be no dispute that a \u201cburger\u201d is a type of sandwich, the average person upon encountering a \u201cBURGER CHEF\u201d sign or restaurant would recognize and accept it at its face meaning and not attempt to equate the term \u201cBURGER\u201d with the term \u201cSANDWICH.\u201d The board also said that persons seeking or frequenting appellee\u2019s \u201cSANDWICH CHEF\u201d eating places would not be likely to substitute the word \u201cBURGER\u201d for \u201cSANDWICH\u201d either in referring to or in recollecting those eating places.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b961-17\">It is well settled that in considering the question of likelihood of confusion, the only relevant application of the law to the facts is in the context of the marketplace, because that is where confusion of prospective purchasers would occur; moreover, all evidence of record bearing on the question of likelihood of confusion must be considered. <em>In re E. I. DuPont DeNemours &amp; Co., </em>476 F.2d 1357, 177 USPQ 563 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1973). The record before us clearly indicates that, in reaching its decision on the question of likelihood of confusion, the board considered all factors listed in <em>DuPont, supra </em>at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567, which are relevant here. The decision is amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>It is also well settled that, in considering the question of likelihood of confusion, although the involved marks must be regarded in their entireties, it is proper to recognize that one feature of a mark is more significant than the other features and to give greater force and effect to that dominant feature. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Crown Zellerbach Corp., </em>422 F.2d 918, 920, 57 CCPA 968, 970, 165 USPQ 171, 172 <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 911, 91 S.Ct. 140, 27 L.Ed.2d 151 (1970). <em>See Tektronix, Inc. </em>v. <em>Daktronics, Inc., </em>584 F.2d 915, 917, 189 USPQ 693, 695 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1976). Therefore, appellant\u2019s argument that the board erred in recognizing that the terms \u201cBURGER\u201d and \u201cSANDWICH\u201d are dominant features of the respective marks is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Appellant states that the common-law mark and appellee\u2019s mark are \u201cquite similar\u201d and implies that the board failed to consider its common-law mark. At most, the implication amounts to a restatement of the likelihood of confusion issue involving appellant\u2019s common-law mark and designation \u201cBURGER CHEF\u201d compared to the \u201cSANDWICH CHEF\u201d mark. As related above, the board made the proper inquiries, and its decision has ample basis in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Appellant also implies that the board used \u201can actual confusion\u201d test rather than the test of \u201clikelihood of confusion.\u201d This, too, is without merit. <em>DuPont, supra </em>at 1361, 177 USPQ at 567, expressly states that the nature and extent of any actual confusion, and the length of time during and conditions under which there has been concurrent use without evidence of actual confusion are factors that <em>must </em>be considered, when of record, in testing for likelihood of confusion. Also, it is clear from the board\u2019s opinion<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that it considered the absence of actual confusion as merely one factor in holding that the marks differ \u201csufficiently ... to preclude a likelihood of confusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Finally, appellant argues that the board failed to resolve doubt in favor of the prior user. However, it does not identify any doubt manifested by the examiner or members of the board, and we have none.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">Appellant cites <em>Burger Chef Systems, Inc. v. Burger Man, Inc., </em>492 F.2d 1398, 181 USPQ 168 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974), in which this court, in reversing the dismissal of an opposition to the registration of the words \u201cBurger Man\u201d with the design of a man as a composite trademark for \u201cdrive-in and carryout restaurant services,\u201d recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-9\">the circumstances of use of the marks by the parties in chain restaurants catering to the motorist trade where many customers are on the move and in a hurry and often select their eateries on the basis of casual recollection of what they may have experienced in other places at other times, or on the basis of the psychological impact of a TV or radio commercial which may have made a fleeting impression.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">However, a case involving the mark \u201cBurger Man\u201d can hardly serve as precedent for a decision involving the mark \u201cSANDWICH CHEF\u201d with a distinct caricature. <em>Interstate Brands Corp. v. Celestial Seasonings, Inc., </em>576 F.2d 926, 927, 198 USPQ 151, 152 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1978); <em>Industrial- Nu-cleonics Corp. v. Hinde, </em>475 F.2d 1197,1199, 177 USPQ 386, 387 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-12\">.
