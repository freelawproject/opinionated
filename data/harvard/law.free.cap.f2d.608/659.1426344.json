It presents rather a situation far too common and too often condemned by this court to be in any manner excusable. We must deal again with grossly improper pros-ecutorial comment during closing argument which substantially prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial on the evidence presented in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">David Garza was convicted by a jury on counts of conspiracy, distribution of heroin, and possession of heroin with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The Government\u2019s case rested heavily upon the testimony of Juan Juarez, a \u201ccooperating individual\u201d\u2014 that is, a confidential informant \u2014 and Rudy Gonzales, an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration, who worked as an undercover agent in the ease. Juarez and Gonzales testified as to their participation directly with Garza and his co-conspirator David Sauceda in setting up and carrying out the alleged heroin transactions in Laredo, Texas, which formed the basis for the prosecution. Garza\u2019s defense, however, was alibi; he presented a number of witnesses who testified that at the time the Government contended he was participating in the heroin transactions, he was actually helping move a trailer in a trailer park in Laredo. Garza\u2019s defense was not insubstantial, and therefore a major issue in the trial became the credibility of Juarez and Gonzales and that of Garza\u2019s alibi witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The major issue presented on this appeal arises from remarks of the prosecutor in his closing argument in which he sought personally to vouch for the credibility of Juarez and Gonzales and to bolster the Government\u2019s case by indicating that it would not have been brought, and he would not personally have participated, if Garza\u2019s guilt had not already been determined. During the opening of his argument, the prosecutor stated that David Sauceda, Garza\u2019s alleged co-conspirator, was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">[o]ut there at that Boys Club and never left until after he got arrested for murder. Out there selling heroin, selling to somebody else that is trying to improve the reality. Rudy Gonzales, the man from San Antonio that came over here. He wants to make this a better place. He wants to improve things. He wants to make that a prettier picture on the wall than it is right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-11\">Those pictures are sometimes hard to face. We don\u2019t like to look at the things. We don\u2019t like to do things that are unpleasant. None of us do. Being on the jury is unpleasant. But don\u2019t you know Rudy Gonzales\u2019 job is unpleasant too? Don\u2019t you know, even though Juan Juarez gets paid for what he is doing and probably paid pretty well, that even that is unpleasant. But it\u2019s something that needs to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-12\">Rudy Gonzales and these other officers over here made a responsibility that they accepted upon themselves when they took that job to go out and improve that total picture. And I think he\u2019s a dedicated man, and you know what? You accepted the responsibility too, in this jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">A few minutes later, the prosecutor returned to, and amplified, these themes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avz-dedup-0\">And there isn\u2019t any reason in the world why Rudy Gonzales would take that stand. He\u2019s a professional man. He has been in this a long time. And if he wasn\u2019t good at it over there when he was doing it for the San Antonio Police Department, if he wasn\u2019t doing his job right over there, do you think he would ever have gotten on with the Drug Enforcement Administration? He did, and he has been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for 4 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-14\">If Mr. Juan Juarez wasn\u2019t doing the right thing, wasn\u2019t doing what he said he should do, he said that every case he had ever worked on had been a conviction. That\u2019s what he said. For 8 years. Do you think he would still be doing it? Do you think anybody would tolerate his wasting the taxpayers\u2019 money if he wasn\u2019t doing a good job? They get up here and say that\u2019s the man. If it wasn\u2019t the man, they wouldn\u2019t have any reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>to say it, ladies and gentlemen. They would just go on off about their business and do something else.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">Those people and the Government has [sic] no interest whatsoever in convicting the wrong person. But the person who does these things has a lot of interest in getting off the hook, doesn\u2019t he? He sure does.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Defense counsel in his closing argument attacked the credibility of Juarez and Gonzales. He argued that Juarez had stated that he was paid for his work on a case-by-case basis and that, unless he made a case, he would not be paid. As for Gonzales, defense counsel argued that alleged inconsistencies in his testimony undercut his credibility. Then, after arguing that the Government had not proved Garza\u2019s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, he anticipated the prosecutor\u2019s argument on the need to protect society from criminals and added, \u201cFine, I want to protect society from criminals, and you do too, but I don\u2019t want innocent people going to jail, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t either.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">In his rebuttal argument, the prosecutor responded to these comments by enlarging upon his original themes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">And he [defense counsel] said something else that kind of irritated me at one point. He said that he hoped an innocent man was not found guilty. I have been doing this kind of work for a long time. He\u2019s a defense lawyer, and I told you while ago that I thought Rudy Gonzales over here was a professional man. And I think these Drug Enforcement Administration people are professionals. And I think the record of being able to move from one job to another job and staying in that work as long as they have indicates that they are professionals. He talks about motive. I think their motives are pure as the driven snow. Their motives are to get out and make this world a better place to live in. A better place to live in, and I\u2019ll tell you they don\u2019t have to fabricate to do it because there is enough wrong going on and there is enough corruption going on out there that if you just go out and walk around the streets and know what you are looking at and looking for you just bump right into it. You don\u2019t have to frame anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">And, ladies and gentlemen, if I thought that I had ever framed an innocent man and sent him to the penitentiary, I would quit. Now, I resent the innuendoes that I would stand up here and try to send an innocent man to the penitentiary, and that\u2019s what it was. I resent that because it\u2019s simply not true because, believe you me, there is presently enough work to do without fooling around with innocent people. Plenty enough. All over the place.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Defendant challenges these remarks as improper closing argument which substantially prejudiced his right to a fair trial. We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">A criminal trial provides a neutral arena for the presentation of evidence upon which alone the jury must base its determination of a defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt. Attorneys for both sides, following rules of evidence and procedure designed to protect the neutrality and fairness of the trial, must stage their versions of the truth within that arena. That which has gone before cannot be considered by the jury except to the extent it can be properly presented at the trial and those things that cannot properly be presented must not be considered at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">The role of the attorney in closing argument is \u201cto assist the jury in analyzing, evaluating and applying <em>the evidence. </em>It is not for the purpose of permitting counsel to \u2018testify\u2019 as an \u2018expert witness.\u2019 The assistance permitted includes counsel\u2019s right to state his contention as to the conclusions that the jury should draw from the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Morris, </em>568 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir. 1978). (emphasis in origi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>nal) To the extent an attorney\u2019s closing argument ranges beyond these boundaries it is improper. Except to the extent he bases any opinion on the evidence in the case, he may not express his personal opinion on the merits of the case or the credibility of witnesses. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Rodriquez, </em>585 F.2d 1234, 1243-44 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Morris, supra, 568 </em>F.2d at 401; <em>Hall v. United States, </em>419 F.2d 582, 585-87 (5th Cir. 1969). Furthermore, he may not suggest that evidence which was not presented at trial provides additional grounds for finding defendant guilty. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Morris, supra, </em>568 F.2d at 401; <em>Hall v. United States, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 587; <em>Gradsky v. United States, </em>373 F.2d 706, 710 (5th Cir. 1967).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">It is particularly improper, even pernicious, for the prosecutor to seek to invoke his personal status as the government\u2019s attorney or the sanction of the government itself as a basis for conviction of a criminal defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">The power and force of the government tend to impart an implicit stamp of believability to what the prosecutor says. That same power and force allow him, with a minimum of words, to impress on the jury that the government\u2019s vast investigatory network, apart from the orderly machinery of the trial, knows that the accused is guilty or has non-judicially reached conclusions on relevant facts which tend to show he is guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-7\"><em>Hall v. United States, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 583-84. The Supreme Court emphasized the special responsibility and status of the government\u2019s attorney in <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1934). Justice Sutherland, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and <em>vigor </em>\u2014 in<em>deed, </em>he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 633. This analysis of the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cdouble burden\u201d has been carried forward in numerous cases from this Court. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Corona, </em>551 F.2d 1386, 1391 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Washington v. United States, </em>327 F.2d 793, 795 (5th Cir. 1964); <em>Hall v. United States, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 587-88; <em>Handford v. United States, </em>249 F.2d 295, 296 (5th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">We must now turn to an examination of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case in light of the rules outlined above and this Court\u2019s cases applying them. We must first determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper and, if so, whether it \u201cprejudicially affect[ed] substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Corona, supra, </em>551 F.2d at 1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">In his remarks set forth above, the prosecutor made extremely improper re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>marks of two varieties, both of which have often been discussed by this Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the prosecutor sought personally to bolster the credibility of its key witnesses, Juarez and Gonzales, by reference to matters which were outside the record in the case. For instance, he inserted repeatedly his opinion of their motives. Of Gonzales, for example, the prosecutor insisted, \u201cHe wants to make this a better place. He wants to improve things. He wants to make that a prettier picture on the wall than it is right now.\u201d At another point, the prosecutor asserted that Juarez and Gonzales \u201cget up here and say that\u2019s the man. If it wasn\u2019t the man, they wouldn\u2019t have any reason to say it, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d On rebuttal he took up this cudgel again, asserting of both Gonzales and Juarez, \u201cI think their motives are pure as the driven snow. Their motives are to get out and make this world a better place to live in.\u201d Aside from personally vouching for his witnesses\u2019 motives and general integrity, the prosecutor attempted to bolster their credibility by maintaining that they had taken on the responsibility for doing an \u201cunpleasant job\u201d and that they were \u201cprofessional\u201d and \u201cdedicated\u201d men, doing a good job and the \u201cright thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In all these attempts, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper, and this court has all too often had to make such a determination. In <em>Gradsky v. United States, supra, </em>the Court condemned the prosecutor\u2019s statements that the government did not put on a witness \u201cunless there appears to be some credibility, until he appears to be a truthful witness,\u201d because it found that \u201cthe government\u2019s belief in the credibility of the witness was based on something other than the evidence of record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710. Similarly, this court has condemned a prosecutor\u2019s statements that he knew a witness to be \u201ca fine F.B.I. officer\u201d and \u201c[a] man of absolute integrity.\u201d <em>Hall v. United States, supra, </em>419 F.2d at 585-87. In <em>United States v. Corona, supra, </em>the court found improper the prosecutor\u2019s argument that government agents who had testified in the case \u201cdid the best they could under the circumstances,\u201d and were doing \u201ca dirty, nasty job\u201d and were \u201cassociating daily with dirty, nasty people, because I, for one, consider dope dealers and dope traffickers as dirty, nasty people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1388. These statements were held to have impermissibly asserted the prosecutor\u2019s credibility as a basis for conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 1389. Finally, where the prosecutor maintained in his closing that a government agent/witness \u201cdid a real good job\u201d and \u201cwas doing his duty to his country,\u201d the Court held such statements to be outside the record and therefore impermissible comment, requiring reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>451 F.2d 1231, 1235-36 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s attempts to bolster his witnesses\u2019 credibility in this case crossed the boundary of proper comment in all the respects noted above. He not only attempted to assert his own credibility as a foundation for that of his witnesses, but attempted to take advantage of his status as government\u2019s attorney to give sanction to his witnesses\u2019 testimony and to suggest that the \u201cgovernment\u2019s vast investigatory network\u201d knew, from information not presented at trial, that these witnesses were telling the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The prosecutor entered a second line of improper comment when he argued that the prosecution would not have been commenced, and that he personally would not have participated unless it had already been determined that defendant was guilty. At one point, he argued that \u201cthose people [the government agents] and the Government has [sic] no interest whatsoever in convicting the wrong person.\u201d On rebuttal, he resumed this tack, stating at one point, \u201cAnd, ladies and gentlemen, if I ever thought that I had framed an innocent man and sent him to the penitentiary, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>quit.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This entire line of argument presumed that the whole government apparatus, and the prosecutor individually, had reached a determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt before the trial and implied that the jury should give weight to this fact in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">This particularly egregious form of argument has also been considered and condemned by this Court. In <em>Hall v. United States, supra, </em>the Court considered the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201cwe try to prosecute only the guilty.\u201d In holding the statement indefensible, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"arq-dedup-0\">Expressions of individual opinion of guilt are dubious at best. . . . This statement takes guilt as a pre-determined fact. The remark is, at the least, an effort to lead the jury to believe that the whole governmental establishment had already determined appellant to be guilty on evidence not before them. Or, arguably it may be construed to mean that as a pretrial administrative matter the defendant has been found guilty as charged else he would not have been prosecuted, and that the administrative level determination is either binding upon the jury or else highly persuasive to it. Appellant\u2019s trial was held and the jury impaneled to pass on his guilt or innocence, and he was clothed in the presumption of innocence. The prosecutor may neither dispense with the presumption of innocence nor denigrate the function of the trial nor sit as a thirteenth juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgnU\"><em>Id. </em>at 587. (Citations and footnotes omitted) Hall\u2019s reasoning was expressly adopted in <em>United States v. Lamerson, </em>457 F.2d 371, 372 (5th Cir. 1972), to condemn the prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201cand, Mr. Lamer-son, had [he] not committed a crime, we would not be [prosecuting him]. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s statements here are fully as improper as those in <em>Hall </em>and Lamerson.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-10\">Our finding that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper does not end our inquiry. Since defense counsel failed to object to these comments at trial, we must determine whether they rise to the level of \u201cplain error\u201d \u2014 that is, errors or defects \u201caffecting substantial rights\u201d of the defendant. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). \u201c[W]hen an appellate court should take notice of an error not raised below must be made on the facts of the particular case, and there are no \u2018hard and fast classifications in either the application of the principle or the use of the descriptive title.\u2019 \u201d 3 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 856, at 373 (1969), <em>quoting Dupoint v. United States, </em>388 F.2d 39, 45 (5th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">While any single statement among those we have isolated might not be enough to require reversal of the conviction \u2014 and, indeed, some clearly would not \u2014 we think it beyond question that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments, taken as a whole, affected substantial rights of the defendant. As already discussed, perhaps the most important problem facing the jury was its decision whether to credit the testimony of Gonzales and Juarez, the government witnesses, or that of defendant\u2019s alibi witness<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>es.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor\u2019s comments that we have considered were expressly intended to influence this critical credibility choice; he introduced for the jury\u2019s consideration his own personal opinion as to this choice, suggested the existence of information beyond that presented at trial to support his witnesses\u2019 credibility, and sought to use the status and influence of the entire government investigatory apparatus to bolster the believability of his case. It is impossible to imagine this strategy did not have substantial influence on the jury. Furthermore, while defense counsel could and, indeed, should have objected to the first instances of improper comment by the prosecutor, at some point the transgressions of this prosecutor cumulated so greatly as to be incurable; then objection to these extremely prejudicial comments would serve only to focus the jury\u2019s attention on them.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, as this Court observed in overturning a conviction because of improper prosecutorial comment, despite a corrective instruction, once such statements are made, the damage is hard to undo: \u201cOtherwise stated, one \u2018cannot unring a bell\u2019; \u2018after the thrust of the saber it is difficult to say forget the wound\u2019; and finally, \u2018if you throw a skunk into the jury box, you can\u2019t instruct the jury not to smell it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dunn v. United States, </em>307 F.2d 883, 886 (5th Cir. 1962). Finally, this Court has several times recognized in similar contexts the necessity for holding such comments as were made here to be \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See, e. g., United States v. Corona, </em>551 F.2d at 1388 n. 2; <em>Ginsberg v. United States, </em>257 F.2d 950, 955 (5th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The prosecutor in this case ignored the \u201cdouble burden\u201d imposed upon him as the government\u2019s attorney both to conduct his case zealously and to assure that justice is done by complying fully and fairly with the rules of conduct by which he is bound. He sought instead a triple burden: prosecutor, judge and jury. A prosecutor can be vigorous without being venomous; forceful without being fanatical; adversarial without being <em>a priori. </em>Here the prosecutor failed to observe these elementary principles of advocacy. Because his conduct so prejudiced defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial as to amount to \u201cplain error\u201d, we reverse the conviction and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-8\">. Garza raises several other contentions in this appeal, including challenges to other comments by the prosecutor in his closing argument. Since the comments set out above are so clearly improper and so obviously require reversal, we find it unnecessary to discuss the other points raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-9\">. Such improper comments by an attorney also violate his ethical responsibilities. It is the duty of an attorney not to \u201c[ajssert his personal opinion as to the justness of a cause, as to the credibility of a witness, . . . or as to the guilt or innocence of an accused . . ..\u201d ABA Code of Professional Responsibility \u00a7 DR7-106(C)(4) (1976). <em>See generally </em>ABA Standards, The Prosecution Function \u00a7 5.8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b748-5\">. In selecting examples of improper comment for our discussion below, we have attempted to be only illustrative, not exhaustive. The longer quotations from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument set out above are virtually textbook examples of what a closing argument should <em>not </em>be.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b749-7\">. This statement was ostensibly in response to defense counsel\u2019s argument to the jury that, while society needed protection from criminals, such need did not justify convicting innocent people. But while defense counsel\u2019s argument can at most be construed as contending that the evidence did not warrant defendant\u2019s conviction, prosecution\u2019s argument went far beyond the evidence and sought to invoke the prosecutor\u2019s own credibility as a basis for a conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b749-8\">. The government has excavated and relied upon an old case from the Seventh Circuit to defend this type of comment. There, the court found the prosecutor\u2019s statement not improper when he argued, \u201cIf I, in my own mind, thought for one minute that these defendants were not parties to this case, I certainly wouldn\u2019t have the courage to stand up here and argue before you that they were guilty. It is never our intention to prosecute and try innocent men.\u201d <em>United States v. Battiato, </em>204 F.2d 717, 719 (7th Cir. 1953), cert. <em>denied, </em>346 U.S. 871, 74 S.Ct. 118, 98 L.Ed. 380 (1953). This decision is in clear conflict with the newer and, we feel, better reasoned precedents from this circuit. We therefore decline to follow it, even if it is still good law in the Seventh Circuit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b750-5\">. The jury apparently found the case quite close despite the prosecutor\u2019s improper attempts to influence it. It took eleven hours for the jury to reach a verdict.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b750-6\">. We think important to note that in such circumstances the trial judge has an obligation to intervene to assure protection of defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. As the court noted in <em>United States v. Corona, supra, </em>551 F.2d at 139In5 n. 5, \u201cWe do not intend to indicate that only the prosecuting attorney in this case is worthy of blame. Indeed, the trial judge has an obligation in the interests of fairness and justice to stop the prosecutor from delivering a greatly prejudicial argument sua sponte. <em>See Viereck v. United States, </em>318 U.S. 236, 63 S.Ct. 561, 87 L.Ed. 734 (1943).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
