Hollingsworth, petitioner, operates a nursing home in Duncan, Mississippi. Daniel B. Mitchell, co-respondent, plans to construct a competing facility in nearby Shelby, Mississippi. Pursuant to 42 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1320a \u2014 1 (West 1974 &amp; Supp.1979), Mitchell sought and obtained from the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, co-respondent, a determination that patrons of his proposed facility would be eligible for certain federal transfer payments. The way being thus cleared for \u201ccompetitive\u201d entry, petitioner sought administrative reconsideration, 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.108(a) (1978), and failing in that commenced the instant law suit. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 702 (West 1977). Petitioner asserts that, in passing on Mitchell\u2019s proposed facility under \u00a7 1320a-l, the Secretary failed to observe its own procedures set forth in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.106(c)(2) (1978). The district court held that it was without jurisdiction to hear this claim by reason of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a-l(f) (West 1974), and that in any event petitioner lacked standing to raise it. We reverse on both points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-17\">Respondents do not question that administrative agencies must follow their own procedures, \u201ceven where the internal procedures are possibly more rigorous than would otherwise be required.\u201d <em>Morton v. Ruiz, </em>415 U.S. 199, 235, 94 S.Ct. 1055, 1074, 39 L.Ed.2d 270 (1974). <em>Accord, Vitarelli v. Seaton, </em>359 U.S. 535, 539-40, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012 (1959). Here, petitioner claims <em>inter alia </em>that the \u201cfair hearing\u201d required by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.106(c) (1978) was held without the public notice required by 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.16(c)(2)(i) (1978). Although 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a \u2014 1(f) (West 1974) withdraws federal court jurisdiction to review \u201cdeterminations\u201d by the Secretary under that section, \u201cjudicial review is [nonetheless] available where the administrative agency fails to follow procedures outlined in regulations adopted by that administrative agency.\u201d <em>Graham v. Caston, </em>568 F.2d 1092, 1097 (5th Cir. 1978). We express no view on whether the Secretary in fact violated its own procedures; we hold only that the district court had jurisdiction to decide the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-18\">Respondents argue that, even if jurisdiction is present, petitioner lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>standing to challenge the alleged procedural omission. We disagree. Economic \u201cinjury\u201d in the form of increased competition plainly can form the basis of a case or controversy. <em>See, e. g., Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 733-34, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <em>Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 154-56, 90 S.Ct. 827, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970); <em>Hardin v. Kentucky Utilities Co., </em>390 U.S. 1, 6, 88 S.Ct. 651, 19 L.Ed.2d 787 (1968). And we think that Mitchell\u2019s competitive entry is \u201cfairly traceable,\u201d e. <em>g., Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, Inc., </em>438 U.S. 59, 72, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978); <em>Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 261, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977), to the Secretary\u2019s favorable decision under \u00a7 1320a \u2014 1. Finally, since the claimed omissions here appertain to \u201cpublic\u201d notice and all \u201cinterested parties,\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 100.-106(c)(2Xi), 100.106(c)(2)(ii) (1978), petitioner clearly falls \u201cwithin the zone of interests protected by\u201d the regulation. <em>Association of Data Processing Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, </em>397 U.S. 150, 156, 90 S.Ct. 827, 831, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). We hold that petitioner has standing to challenge the Secretary\u2019s alleged violation of 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.-106(c) (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The judgement of the district court is vacated and the cause is remanded for the sole purpose of determining whether the Secretary observed his own procedures in passing on Mitchell\u2019s application under \u00a7 1320a-l.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
