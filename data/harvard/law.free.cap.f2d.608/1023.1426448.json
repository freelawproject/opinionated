HILL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1108-15\">Plaintiff-Appellant Lionel McGruder, Jr., an inmate of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, filed this action under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 on October 31, 1978 on behalf of himself \u201cand all others similarly situated.\u201d On his form petition he claimed deprivation of constitutional rights, discriminatory deprivation of privileges that were accorded to inmates in other cellblock areas, and failure of prison officials to apprise inmates of standards used to decide whether to transfer inmates out of Cellblock \u201cC.\u201d On a separate sheet, apparently accepted as part of his complaint, he further alleged that \u201cthe totality surrounding the operations and deprivations\u201d of inmates in Cell-block \u201cC\u201d constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the eighth amendment. The deputy clerk of Court returned to him other materials that he had submitted with a cover letter that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU-\">I am returning your memorandum of law for the reason that all pertinent facts must be included in your petition. No attachments will be accepted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1108-16\">We do not have these materials before us but in a later letter to the Clerk, appellant stated that they contained a \u201cstatement of facts.\u201d Record, at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-17\">On November 5, 1978 plaintiff requested permission to amend his complaint and the district judge granted this request on November 8, 1978. On November 11, 1978, in a letter addressed to the Clerk of Court but which began \u201cYour Honor,\u201d plaintiff acknowledged receiving the district judge\u2019s letter and stated that he had decided to submit no more facts at that time and requesting instead that he be allowed to reserve the right to traverse defendants\u2019 answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-18\">On January 5, 1979 defendants filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) stating as reasons:</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-19\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-20\">\u201cThere is no constitutional right to be moved out of maximum security.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s incarceration in maximum security is proper due to the nature of the disciplinary charge brought against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">On January 17, 1979 plaintiff filed what he denominated a \u201cMEMORANDUM IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO DISMISS PLAINTIFF\u2019S COMPLAINT\u201d in which he stated that inmates in Cellblock \u201cC\u201d are confined to their cells an average of twenty-three and one-half hours a day and are deprived of outdoor exercise privileges as afforded inmates in all other cellblocks units, that the cellblock review board often takes as long as five months to meet in Cellblock \u201cC,\u201d and that more than five months elapsed before the review board reviewed (and continued) plaintiff\u2019s assignment to Cellblock \u201cC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">The magistrate prepared his report of January 26, 1979 without oral argument and recommended dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. As we read that report, Record, at 32-33, the magistrate considered only plaintiff\u2019s allegations of discrimination in regard to privileges and the absence of objective criteria made known to prisoners to be used by prison officials in transferring prisoners out of Cellblock \u201cC.\u201d On February 8, 1978, plaintiff filed a \u201cTraverse\u201d in which he urged that he had alleged facts to support his allegations in the papers he filed on January 15, 1979 (which actually were filed on January 17, 1979). He again asserted eighth and fourteenth amendment violations. Record, at 35-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-8\">On February 14, 1979 the district judge, \u201cafter due consideration of the Magistrate\u2019s Report of January 26, 1979, and the objections thereto filed by the plaintiff, and for the reasons stated in the Magistrate\u2019s Report,\u201d granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-9\">We focus on the facts alleged in the materials that plaintiff filed on January 17, 1979. It is true that the district judge had earlier informed the plaintiff that he might amend his complaint and plaintiff had then declined to do so. It is also true, however, that on January 17, 1979, the plaintiff could amend his pleading as a matter of course because defendants had only made a motion to dismiss. Under Rule 15(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure a party may amend without leave of court at any time before a responsive pleading is served and in this circuit a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading for purposes of Rule 15(a). <em>McLellan v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co., </em>526 F.2d 870 (5th Cir. 1976), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>545 F.2d 919 (5th Cir. 1977) (in all other respects panel opinion remains undisturbed). In view of the liberality accorded to the pleadings of <em>pro se </em>petitioners in <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), and similar cases, we find that the district judge should have treated the materials filed by plaintiff on January 17, 1979, however denominated, as an amendment to his complaint or an addition in the nature of an amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">The facts asserted in those materials, confinement to a cell for twenty-three and one-half hours per day for periods of months and absence of outdoor exercise, may make out an eighth amendment violation. The district court therefore erred in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. We reverse and remand for further proceedings in the district court where facts must be developed in regard to this claim. We invite the district court\u2019s attention to the following cases dealing with a lack of sufficient exercise as a possible violation of the eighth amendment. <em>Campbell v. McGruder, </em>188 U.S.App.D.C. 258, 580 F.2d 521 (D.C.Cir.1978); <em>Dorrough v. Hogan, </em>563 F.2d 1259, 1264 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Carson, </em>563 F.2d 741, 749-50 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Nadeau v. Helgemoe, </em>561 F.2d 411, 420 (1st Cir. 1977); <em>Smith v. Sullivan, </em>553 F.2d 373, 379 (5th Cir. 1977); <em>Kirby v. Blackledge, </em>530 F.2d 583, 586-87 (4th Cir. 1976); <em>Sweet v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, </em>529 F.2d 854 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Sostre v. McGinnis, </em>442 F.2d 178 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>James v. Wallace, </em>406 F.Supp. 318 (M.D.Ala.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>Appellant\u2019s allegations regarding the restrictions on institutional, educational and vocational programs, religious services, participation in the blood plasma program, and movie privileges are without merit, see, <em>Dorrough v. Hogan, </em>563 F.2d 1259, 1262-63 (5th Cir. 1977), and as to this issue the dismissal was proper. The same holds true of his contention that the rights of Cell-block \u201cC\u201d inmates are violated because no objective criteria is made known to them for classifying them <em>out of </em>the unit, since there is no requirement in either state or federal law that such objective criteria be made known. (He has not challenged his classification <em>to </em>the unit.) Classification of inmates in Louisiana is a duty of the La. Dept, of Corrections and inmates have no right to a particular classification under state law. LSA-R.S. 15:824; 828, 829; <em>Fulford v. Phelps, </em>365 So.2d 575 (La.App.1978). Prison officials must have broad discretion, free from judicial intervention, in classifying prisoners in terms of their custodial status. <em>Montanye </em>v. <em>Haymes, </em>427 U.S. 236, 242, 96 S.Ct. 2543, 49 L.Ed.2d 466 (1976); <em>Jones v. U. S., </em>534 F.2d 53, 54 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 978, 97 S.Ct. 487, 50 L.Ed.2d 586 (1976); <em>Young v. Wainwright, </em>449 F.2d 338, 339 (5th Cir. 1971). We do, however, call the district judge\u2019s attention to petitioner\u2019s claim that the cellblock review board often does not review assignment to extended lockdown for five months in violation of the institution\u2019s ninety-day review standards and to the materials appended to appellee\u2019s brief containing a copy of the judgment rendered in civil action No. 71-94 finding that agreements reached in regard to the operation, maintenance, and administration of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola met constitutional requirements. These agreements include rules and regulations for disciplinary hearings and lockdown at that institution, one of which appears to require periodic review, at least every ninety days, of inmates in extended lockdown to determine whether to release them from lockdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
