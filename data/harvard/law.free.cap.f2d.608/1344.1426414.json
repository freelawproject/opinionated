The issue presented is whether substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the finding of the NLRB (three-member panel)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the Company violated sections 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(aX3) and (1))<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by changing its early in-early out practice involving the Company\u2019s six test technicians because of their union activities. The NLRB\u2019s findings of section 8(a)(1) violations with respect to other activities of the Company and the portions of its order pertaining thereto are not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">At the time the testimony was taken in this case before the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) in 1977, the Company had about 730 employees, of whom some 550 were employed in the manufacturing division. These included two dispatchers and three expediters whose duties were to see that the 6,000 parts processed at the plant were directed from one production employee\u2019s work station to another, so that no employee would run out of work. They were not bargaining unit employees but were part of the unit that the United Auto Workers of America (\u201cUAW\u201d) had petitioned for in 1976. The six test technicians were employed in the engineering division. Pat Burns was in overall charge of the manufacturing division, and Clint Boyd was in overall charge of the engineering division. The chain of supervisory command down to the test technicians was from Boyd to Eldon Drake to Stan Claiboum to Don Workman. Four of the six test technicians, Lynn Hudson, Jim Wyse, Doilis Taylor, and Vance Bates, were active in the UAW\u2019s organizing campaign commencing in October of 1976 and continuing until an NLRB election January 28, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-15\">In early November of 1976, Claiboum, who was serving on jury duty, stopped at the plant and learned from Workman that union activities were going on there. On November 11, when he returned to work at the plant, he interrogated employees about their union activities; on November 23, Drake told employees that the Company knew which department originated the union activities and what the employees were doing; on the same day, according to technician Wyse, Workman told him, during a conversation about union activities, that he had been asked \u201cto watch us 100 percent of the time\u201d; and also on the same day, Workman ordered employees to remove union insignia from their hard hats.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We note that the ALJ, whose findings, reasons, and conclusions were almost totally affirmed by the NLRB, observed that the testimony of Hudson, Wyse, Taylor, and Bates was un-controverted, adding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>The Respondent did not cross-examine any of these witnesses following their direct testimony. I found these technicians to be sincere, intelligent witnesses, and I credit their testimony throughout the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">All but one of the test technicians worked a regular shift from 8 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. However, it was a long-established practice <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that if a technician had a legitimate reason for leaving early, he could request permission from Workman or Claibourn to come in early and leave early, and permission would routinely be granted. Hudson testified that, nevertheless, when he telephoned Workman on the evening of January 12, 1977, and requested that he be permitted to report early the next day so that he could leave early to take his wife to an appointment with her doctor, Workman denied the request and told him that the practice was discontinued; that when he asked Workman why, \u201che just stuttered and said he better not say. And I asked him was it because of the UAW drive, and he again said he better not say.\u201d As found by the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-5\">On the next day, Technicians Bates, Wyse, Hudson, Duane Hale and Taylor were together in the lab. Taylor testified that Workman came down to the lab \u201cand told us that the policy [early in-early out] had been changed, that we couldn\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d When asked by General Counsel if Workman gave any reason Taylor responded that Workman said \u201cthat it was against the law, more or less.\u201d Workman, who was still employed by the Respondent at the time of the hearing, did not testify, and no explanation was offered as to why he did not testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-6\">Bates testified that on the same day, Workman notified him that no one would be allowed to come in early without a supervisor being present at the same time. Bates had been taking his asthmatic son to the doctor\u2019s since the spring of 1976, and utilized the early in-early out practice by coming in at 7 a. m. and leaving at 3:30 p. m., an hour ahead of his regular quitting time. Following Workman\u2019s statement of the change in policy, Bates had two occasions to take his son to the doctor\u2019s, which he did by coming in at the regular time and leaving an hour early, thereby losing an hour each day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"azl-dedup-0\">Wyse testified that prior to the union organizing drive the technicians received light supervision. \u201cWorkman would come through three or four times a day to explain what he would want done, and that was the extent he would supervise us.\u201d Hudson testified that Workman occasionally came into the lab, but that normally he was not present more than three hours of an eight-hour period.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-8\">Burns testified that in early November of 1976 it was brought to his attention by the manager over the expediters and dispatchers that the test technicians were coming into the manufacturing area and were interfering with the expediters and dispatchers in their work; that he personally observed the technicians, primarily Bates and Hudson and occasionally Wyse, spending a lot of time out of their area and in the manufacturing area during normal working time and carrying on conversations with the expediters and dispatchers; and that such activity developed \u201cbottlenecks.\u201d According to his testimony, he went to Claibourn and requested that he keep the technicians out of the manufacturing area and in the area of his own responsibility because they were interfering with operations; that the situation continued and he then went to Drake, who was over Claibourn, and complained to him; that there seemed to be a pause in the activity, but it then continued; that he finally went to Boyd, the top management official over the engineering division, and \u201cI told him point blank I wanted him to keep these people out of the manufacturing area . . . I told him they were interfering with the operations .\u201d; that \u201cHe assured me that he would take the action to Mr. Claiboum, and ... we did see a change in the amount of time that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>in the manufacturing area\u201d; that he did not know about the early in-early out practice involving the test technicians (which was not a Company-wide practice) until the complaint in the case was filed (in March of 1977); and that he knew about the UAW organizing campaign at the time of the above related conversations, but that concern about the campaign was not one of the reasons he tried to put an end to the activities of the test technicians in the manufacturing area. Burns was asked on cross-examination whether he had any idea what was being discussed in the conversations between the test technicians and the expediters and dispatchers. He replied: \u201cI am sure from the standpoint \u2014 there are a lot of things that could have been discussed, but I have no idea.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APT\">Boyd testified that in Late November or December of 1976 Burns brought to his attention that the test technicians \u201cwere spending an unusual amount of time out of their area and that they were interfering with the work of the dispatchers and expediters in the manufacturing [area]\u201d; that he had Drake and Claibourn come to his office, told them about it, and \u201casked them at that time to have Don Workman to make sure that he stayed down on the floor 100 percent of the time, which was his work station, and see that these people stayed in their area and performed the duties that they were being paid to do, except for the normal breaks that they were entitled to.\u201d Like Burns, he stated that he did not know about the early in-early out practice involving the test technicians until the complaint in the case was filed; also, that he had never directed Claibourn or anyone else under his supervision to discontinue or modify that practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">Claibourn corroborated the testimony of Burns and Boyd. In mid-November, Burns complained to him, and he then told Workman about the complaint and told Workman \u201cto stay on the floor and keep these technicians in their area and working.\u201d In December he was called to Boyd\u2019s office, along with Drake, and \u201crather severely reprimanded for the very loose supervision that we had allowed in the test lab .... I was informed that my test technicians were still roaming around the manufacturing area talking to the dispatchers and . to the expediters. . . . And he wanted them back in the test lab. He told me to have Don Workman spend 100 percent of his time in the test lab and supervising these test technicians.\u201d Claibourn related what he told Workman following the meeting in Boyd\u2019s office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-9\">Yes, I called Don Workman up again and told him that I had just gotten a very bad chewing out from Clint Boyd, that our people were abusing the privileges that they had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-10\">I told him that he was to spend 100 percent of the time in the test lab, and that the technicians were to be supervised 100 percent of the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-11\">He then related a conversation with Workman in late December:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-12\">Workman came to me and asked me what he should do if the technicians requested to come in early and leave early.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1431-13\">And I told him that if he was scheduled for overtime that the technicians in question could come in, but if he was not scheduled for overtime, Don Workman was not scheduled for overtime, then the technicians could not come in since the technicians had to be supervised 100 percent of the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1431-14\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-15\">We agree with the NLRB that the General Counsel established a prima facie case of violation of sections 8(aX3) and (1) by the Company\u2019s change (\u201cemasculated\u201d is how the AU put it) in the early in-early out practice relative to the test technicians. Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the following statement of the NLRB:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>Inasmuch as Respondent had knowledge of the test . . . technicians\u2019 active involvement in the union campaign, as evidenced, <em>inter alia, </em>by its admission of several illegal interrogations and threats of reprisal to these employees, we cannot but conclude that its subsequent change in the early in-early out policy was motivated by a desire to insulate the technicians from other employees and thereby discourage union activity. Thus, regardless of the actual content of the conversations of the employees or respondent\u2019s knowledge thereof, we find that Respondent violated Sec. 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by curtailing an existing employment benefit of the technicians because of their union activities. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-5\">This statement is reenforced by inferences reasonably drawn by the ALJ:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1432-7\">In ascertaining Respondent\u2019s real motive for drastically curtailing its policy of early in-early out, the statements of Don Workman are most revealing, and damaging to the Respondent\u2019s cause. On the evening of January 12, 1977 Hudson, a credible witness, had telephoned Workman for permission to come in early the next morning, only to be turned down because of the new policy; when Hudson asked why, Workman stuttered and added that he better not say. When Hudson pressed the point, and asked him specifically was it because of the UAW drive, his foreman again said he better not say. The next day, when Hudson talked with Workman at the plant about the policy change, Workman again dodged Hudson\u2019s plain question about the UAW drive, and again answered that he better not say. The inference is reasonable that Workman knew that the policy had been changed because of the union organizing drive, and I draw that inference.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] To the same effect, was Workman\u2019s reason given to the technicians . . . after he told them that the policy had been changed. Workman\u2019s stated reason to Taylor for the change in policy, \u201cbecause it was against the law, more or less,\u201d given at the January 12, 1977 meeting . does not ring true, and I regard it as an evasive answer, made to avoid the true reason. The failure of the Respondent to call Workman as a witness, without any explanation, gives rise to the inference, adverse to the Respondent, that he would not contradict the testimony of Hudson and Taylor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1432-12\"><em>International Union (UAW) v. NLRB, </em>148 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 312-13, 459 F.2d 1329, 1336-37 (D.C.Cir. 1972), and cases cited; 2 <em>Wigmore on Evidence </em>\u00a7 285 (3d ed. 1940); <em>see United States v. Latimer, </em>511 F.2d 498, 502-03 (10th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1432-13\">The Company vigorously argues that the change in the early in-early out practice involving the technicians was a management prerogative and was not improperly motivated. Although Burns, who complained to Boyd about the activities of the technicians, and Boyd, who directed Drake and Claibourn \u201cto have Don Workman spend 100 percent of his time in the test lab and supervising these test technicians,\u201d both testified without contradiction that they did not even know until later about the early in-early out practice, this does not prove absence of improper motivation of the Company.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Actually it was Claibourn who enlarged Boyd\u2019s directive in such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>way as to change the early in-early out practice. Thus, the AU found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-4\">It was Claibourn who enlarged Boyd\u2019s instructions, and took it upon himself to tell Workman that the technicians were to be supervised 100 percent of the time. It was Claibourn who, when asked by Workman, what he should do with the technician\u2019s request that he be permitted to come in early and leave early, changed the long standing policy, and instructed Workman that the technicians could only come in early, if Workman was scheduled to come in early.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1433-5\">I do not find that Burns or Boyd directed that the early in-early out policy be changed, but I do find that Claibourn effectuated the change, and as an agent of the Company, the Company is bound by his act. The record is clear that the Respondent [Company] was strongly anti-union, which, of course, is not an unfair labor practice, but in carrying out its antiunion campaign, it set about to restrict the technicians from engaging in union activity. One of its tools was to have its Supervisor Workman observe the technicians\u2019 movements at all times. As a consequence of this policy, the technicians lost their right to come in early, unsupervised. The loss of this right to come in early, without a supervisor present, was a by-product of the Respondent\u2019s antiunion activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1433-6\">Substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports these findings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1433-7\">The Company argues that, if a prima facie case of violation has been established, its showing of a legitimate business reason for the change in the early in-early out practice shifted the burden to the NLRB, citing <em>inter alia, NLRB v. Florida Steel Corp., </em>586 F.2d 436 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>NLRB v. Rich\u2019s of Plymouth, Inc., </em>578 F.2d 880 (1st Cir. 1978); <em>NLRB v. Patrick Plaza Dodge, Inc., </em>522 F.2d 804 (4th Cir. 1975); <em>Famet, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>490 F.2d 293 (9th Cir. 1973); and <em>NLRB v. Freeman Co., </em>471 F.2d 708 (8th Cir. 1972). However, this argument overlooks that, while there may have been a legitimate business reason for Boyd to issue his directive, no such showing was made for Claibourn\u2019s enlarging the directive to change the early in-early out practice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See NLRB v. Okla-Inn, </em>488 F.2d 498, 507 (10th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-12\">In view of the foregoing, we hold that substantial evidence in the record as a whole supports the NLRB\u2019s finding that the Company violated sections 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by changing the early in-early out practice involving the Company\u2019s six test technicians because of their union activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-13\">Enforcement ordered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1429-11\">.

These are four of the other section 8(a)(1) violations found by the NLRB which are not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1430-10\">. Claibourn testified that the practice had continued from as early as 1966.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">. Claibourn also testified that he did not know what the conversations between the test technicians and expediters and dispatchers were about.

Even if bad faith on the part of the employer is not established, a violation may be found if the effect of management\u2019s actions is necessarily coercive. <em>Federation of Union Representatives </em>v. <em>NLRB, </em>339 F.2d 126, 129 (2d Cir. 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1432-9\">. The ALJ commented that, during his testimony, Bums was \u201cin most instances straight forward,\u201d but was \u201cevasive\u201d when answering the question (on cross-examination) whether he had any idea what was being discussed between the test technicians and the expediters and dispatchers. However, Bums was not in the chain of supervisory command over the engineering division, and it was Boyd who issued the original directive to Drake and Claib-oum. Moreover, the NLRB declined to adopt the ALJ\u2019s finding that the technicians were in fact talking with nonunion expediters and dispatchers about union activities, saying that \u201cThe record does not substantiate such a finding.\u201d This court has stated that mere suspicions of unlawful motivation are not sufficient to constitute substantial evidence. <em>NLRB v. Meinholdt Mfg., Inc., </em>451 F.2d 737 (10th Cir. 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1433-8\">. Obviously Boyd\u2019s directive to have Workman spend 100 percent of <em>his </em>time supervising the technicians would not preclude the practice of permitting a technician to come in early and to work, unsupervised, during the early period.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1433-9\">. The dissenting member of the NLRB panel was persuaded that antiunion motivation was \u201cessentially factually precluded\u201d by the fact that \u201cboth Bums and supervisors of the test technicians above the second-level supervisory position testified without contradiction that they had not previously been aware that the test technicians enjoyed the early in-early out privilege.\u201d This overlooks the role of the first and second level supervisors, Claibourn and Workman, in enlarging Bums\u2019 directive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1433-23\">. We note that the NLRB\u2019s order includes reestablishment of the early in-early out practice and making Bates whole for lost time and wages because of the unlawful change in that practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
