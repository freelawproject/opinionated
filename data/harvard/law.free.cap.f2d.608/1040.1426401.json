The trial court based its decision on the failure of the plaintiff to produce evidence \u201cas to the standard of care generally practiced by other physicians in this community or in the community in which these defendant physicians practice in similar situations,\u201d and on the further ground that \u201cthere has been no evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to show that the defendant doctors negligently failed to follow such a standard.\u201d The court then determined that in the absence of adequate evidence to establish a claim against the doctors, the hospital and clinic with which they were associated could not be found negligent on the record before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-8\">Because we find that the defendant doctors themselves, called on behalf of the plaintiff, sufficiently established the standard of care applicable to the conduct which the plaintiff challenges in his action, and that the record discloses sufficient objective evidence from which a jury could find that such standard was not complied with, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s action was based on his contention, to use laymen\u2019s language, that at a time when he was being treated for serious arterial insufficiency in his left foot the defendant doctors or other doctors and hospital personnel administered a drug which was designed to reduce or cut down the blood supply to all parts of his body. He claims that both the literature concerning the drug used and the pharmacopoeia warned against use in such circumstances, and the doctors\u2019 statement that \u201cthe standard in this community\u201d is \u201cthat normally you don\u2019t prescribe a drug to someone who has a condition which is a contraindication\u201d met all of the requirements for submission of the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-11\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-12\">The evidence which we find was sufficient to withstand a directed verdict was produced entirely from examination and cross-examination of the defendant doctors and from the hospital and clinic records. Briefly, it will be outlined as follows: Hemingway entered the Ochsner Clinic on January 1, 1973, having been referred by the Veterans Administration. He came under the care of Dr. William Davis and Dr. McKinnon for gastrointestinal disorders. He was subjected to the usual tests and was found to be suffering from a disease of the pancreas. On January 25, Dr. McKinnon performed an 95% pancreatectomy, chole-cystectomy, and splenectomy. Because plaintiff continued to suffer symptoms of pancreatitis, on April 12, 1973, Dr. McKin-non performed further complete pancrea-tectomy. One of the side effects of these operations is that the patient becomes a diabetic, suffering from diabetes mellitus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-13\">After the operation, Hemingway began outpatient treatment under the care of Dr. Paul Murison, an Ochsner Foundation endocrinologist for treatment of his diabetes mellitus. He was first seen by Dr. Murison in February 1973. Dr. Murison was asked \u201cwhether or not diabetes had anything to do with vascular disease,\u201d \u201cdoes one relate to the other?\u201d He said \u201cdiabetics are more prone to develop problems with vascular.\u201d Then the further question; \u201cmore prone than . . .?;\u201d He stated \u201can average person.\u201d Subsequently, during further questioning he qualified his answer by stating \u201ccertain time levels. Early in diabetes the disease is not a major problem, but after many years it becomes an increasingly important problem.\u201d Dr. Murison also testified that while in the hospital on January 3, some 20 days before the first operation, Hemingway had complained of a migraine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>headache and had been given a Cafergot suppository and that at that time he had shown no adverse reaction to this dosage. It was undisputed that Cafergot contains the pharmacological properties of ergota-mine which is used for the purpose of constricting blood vessels. Prolonged or excessive administration of the ergot alkaloids can cause vascular insufficiency and gangrene of the extremities. The literature which accompanies Cafergot and the pharmacy textbook introduced in evidence state that Cafergot is contraindicated for patients when suffering from certain types of vascular disease.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1127-4\">Dr. Murison testified as to the meaning of the words \u201cperipheral vascular disease\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-5\">Q: Would you explain to them what peripheral vascular disease is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-6\">A: First of all, before we get to the symptoms, peripheral vascular diseases are a group of diseases in which there are problems dealing with the circulation in the extremities, the peripheral areas of the hands and the feet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-7\">Q: By peripheral, you mean the hands or the feet, is that right, the ends of the extremities, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-9\">Q: What do you say with regard to those, the vascular disease?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-10\">A: That is what peripheral vascular disease is. You asked me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-11\">Q: I am sorry, I just want to hear the first part of your answer again. I didn\u2019t catch it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-12\">THE WITNESS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-13\">Would you give me the answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-14\">(The court reporter read the answer.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL0\">BY MR. TSCHIRN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-15\">Q: Dealing with circulation in the peripheral areas, would that be a layman\u2019s way of saying it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-18\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-19\">Q: So, dealing with circulation in hands or feet, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-21\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-22\">Q: That is what peripheral vascular disease is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-24\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-25\">How many times are you going over that, Counsel? That is four times, now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-26\">BY MR. TSCHIRN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-27\">Q: Is that correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-28\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1127-29\">Following this testimony, the medical witness testified that physicians originally obtain familiarity with the administration and prescribing of drugs in medical school and by keeping in constant awareness \u201cthrough the medical literature, through meetings.\u201d The identified text \u201cPharmacological Basis of Therapeutics\u201d is one of the textbooks with which he said he was familiar. The following evidence was then introduced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-30\">Q: The drug Cafergot: First of all, let me ask you this. Do doctors or should doctors normally deviate or change from what the pharmacy textbooks tell them what to do as far as prescribing drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-31\">Should a doctor on his own just change from that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-32\">A: It should not be done unless there are very compelling reasons why it might be necessary or needed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-33\">Q: So, the answer, first of all, it should not be done, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1127-34\">A: That covers too much. There are certain rare instances in which you may deviate from for the good of the patient, from the restrictions that are put upon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>Q: Now is that pretty much the standard in this community, that physicians should adhere, as far as prescribing and the administration of drugs \u2014 adhere to what the pharmacy textbooks tell them to do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-4\">A: They should be acquainted with what the pharmacy textbooks say and should follow that as closely as the patient\u2019s special condition warrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-5\">Q: So, that is the standard, then, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-6\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-7\">Q: And is it correct, sir, that the doctors should not deviate from that unless there is such special circumstances that the doctor feels is compelling to deviate from it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-9\">Thereafter, in response to the question: \u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact that normally you don\u2019t prescribe a drug to someone who has a condition which is a contraindication\u201d the witness answered: \u201cTrue\u201d and to the question: \u201cAnd that is a standard in this community, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d the doctor answered: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-10\">Towards the end of May, after he became a diabetic, Cafergot was again prescribed for Hemingway\u2019s migraine headache. This was followed by a further use of Cafergot on June 9. On June 10, plaintiff\u2019s foot began hurting and he went to the Ochsner Hospital emergency room. At that time, he reported that in handling his motorcycle, it had fallen and injured his left foot. The Ochsner Foundation Hospital \u201cNotes and Consultant\u2019s Reports\u201d of June 16 state: \u201cOn 6/10/73 patient was injured while riding a motorcycle [this is incorrect the motorcycle fell while he was handling it] the bike fell across his left leg and foot and incurred only minor injury, seen here, X-rays negative and sent home. Left foot began swelling two days ago and became swollen and ecchymotic. Pain, swelling, and discoloration have increased.\u201d On the same sheet under the heading \u201cExam\u201d there appears the entry \u201cEXT \u2014 left foot cold and blue. No pulses in left foot.\u201d At the bottom of the page under the words \u201cImp [elsewhere used on the records to indicate \u201cimpressions\u201d] appears the entry \u201cacute arterial insufficiency \u2014 left foot\u201d. On June 17, it appeared that the condition of the left foot had deteriorated and Dr. John Ochsner recommended a procedure known as an arteriogram. This procedure involved the insertion of a catheter into a main artery and the introduction of a dye which permitted the medical personnel to see the flow of blood in the affected area. The arteriogram was performed and it showed \u201cdiffuse vasospasm with potency to foot. . . . \u201d On the following day, Dr. Hutchinson made an entry \u201cfoot is more eschemic in appearance in spite of efforts at vasodilatation. Dr. Ochsner suggested the possibility of venus occlusion which may be predominant problem. Sympathectomy may be of some benefit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AuS_\">Thereupon, Dr. Ochsner performed a left lumbar sympathectomy which, as the witnesses testified, was for the purpose of increasing the blood supply to the affected foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1128-15\">Thereafter during the next five or six days the plaintiff\u2019s foot improved in appearance and he was released to return home. At the bottom of the sheet following the entries as to the operation, there appear the following entries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-16\">Op. Note: Pre Op <em>Dx </em>\u2014 Chronic arterial insufficiency</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6F\">Left Foot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-17\">Post \u2014 Op. Same</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-18\">Procedural \u2014 left lumbar sympathectomy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-19\">Surgeon \u2014 J. Ochsner</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-20\">Assist \u2014 Ancalmo, Gofer, Manson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-21\">To R Room good condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-22\">J. Manson</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1128-23\">[emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1128-24\">By July 7, 1973, plaintiff\u2019s foot had turned cold again and was blue in color. He returned to the emergency room and Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>Ancalmo, who had assisted with the sympa-thectomy, admitted him with the following physician\u2019s report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-5\">Post pancreatectomy for chronic pan-creatitis. Developed a cold left foot four weeks ago, sympathectomy [without] gross results. Returns with same problem \u2014 poss. Buerger\u2019s disease. Admit to Dr. J. Ochsner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-6\">As indicated above, the literature with respect to Cafergot states that it is contraindicated in the case of a person who has Buerger\u2019s disease. Subsequently, at the trial, Dr. Ochsner testified that at the time Mr. Hemingway appeared on July 7, he knew that the patient was not suffering from Buerger\u2019s disease, in spite of the possibility noted by the receiving doctor. The physicians performed a continuous epidural block which relieved the plaintiff from the severe pain he was suffering and introduced medications designed to dilate the plaintiff\u2019s blood vessels in order to promote circulation in his lower leg and foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-23\">On the morning of July 9, two days later, plaintiff woke up with a migraine headache. At <em>9:30 </em>a. m., Dr. Moseley ordered Cafergot for the plaintiff. It was administered. A short while thereafter, Hemingway was visited by Dr. Ochsner who later testified that: \u201cThis foot was well and then suddenly it turned bad under our eyes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>This condition was slowly remedied by the same intra-arterial injections that had previously been given to dilate the vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">The plaintiff introduced a prescription over Dr. Murison\u2019s signature dated June 9 which provided for Cafergot, P \u2014 B suppositories, 12 of them, one rectally as needed for pain. The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-5\">Q: At least someone at Ochsner knew, on June 9th, before you had him in there on June 16th \u2014 someone knew he was on Cafergot, didn\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZL\">A: Yes, lots of people knew he was on Cafergot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-6\">Q: I mean at Ochsner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-8\">Q: Lots of people knew it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1130-9\">A: I assume. He had it two or three times before.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1130-10\">The recital of facts above is all undisputed, except for the fact that Dr. Murison and Dr. Ochsner undertook at the trial to qualify from time to time the statements attributed to them. We give the facts most favorable to the plaintiff, because we are required to do so in considering whether there was sufficient evidence for the case to be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-11\">In addition to the foregoing facts, there was a serious dispute about statements by Drs. Ochsner and Murison to Hemingway\u2019s mother and wife.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mrs. Hemingway, Sr. testified that on July 9, she was at the hospital and her son had a severe migraine (this is the day on which Dr. Moseley had prescribed Cafergot for the migraine). She testified that his foot changed color and got cold and she got in touch with Dr. Ochsner who then had him taken \u201cto the operating room downstairs.\u201d At that time, she met with Dr. John Ochsner and she testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auy\">He said to me \u201cyour son has an artery infection or disease\u201d which he called Buerger\u2019s which I didn\u2019t understand and I asked him what that meant, and he said it meant that the arteries were going into the foot, as they neared the foot at the ankle had collapsed and that no blood could get into the foot and that this was possible \u2014 possibility that it could happen to other parts of his body, his other leg or his arms and I asked him, I said: \u201cWell, does this have to do with his big operation and all that? Would this cause this?\u201d and he said: \u201cNo, this is a separate thing, a separate disease,\u201d and he said: \u201cIt is necessary that we schedule an amputation tomorrow morning at 6 o\u2019clock.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ak6-dedup-0\">Hemingway\u2019s wife testified that she was present at the time of this conversation and stated that her recollection was the same as testified to by Mrs. Hemingway, Sr. Dr. Ochsner testified that he had not said Hemingway had Buerger\u2019s disease and he had not said he planned to amputate the foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-18\">Finally, it should be noted that the admission slip on June 16 contains the entry: \u201cPX: acute arterial insufficiency left foot\u201d and the discharge summary, following discharge on June 23, contained the entry: \u201cAcute arterial insufficiency [undecipherable, but possibly etiology unknown].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-19\">II. PRELIMINARY LEGAL QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-20\">In addition to the contention about the administering of Cafergot at a time when the doctors were attempting to clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>up arterial insufficiency in his left foot, Hemingway makes a further more serious contention relating to the sympathectomy. He contends that he was not advised by Dr. Ochsner of any side effects of the sympa-thectomy. Dr. Ochsner testified that there are no side effects. Hemingway sought to introduce at the trial a text called \u201cMedical \u2014Surgical Nursing\u201d written by two registered nurses. This text listed potential results from a sympathectomy. One of these results listed by these writers was \u201closs of ejaculation in the male.\u201d Upon objection, the court ruled that the plaintiff had failed to establish the degree of recognition required for the introduction of such a text. This ruling was correct under Rule 803(18) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which require that for a party to rely upon a learned treatise it must be established as a reliable authority by the testimony or admission of a witness or by other expert testimony or by judicial notice. There was no testimony that recognized this document as a reliable authority and the trial court correctly ruled that it could not be recognized by judicial notice, since it had been written by registered nurses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Respecting his claim of loss of sexual powers, the appellant contends that since the proof showed that these had been unimpaired prior to the sympathectomy but had been almost totally lost thereafter, he should have prevailed under the doctrine res ipsa loquitur. The trial court properly declined to accept this contention, since there were many medical frailties affecting the plaintiff. <em>Hayward v. Echols, </em>362 F.2d 791 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">We must therefore conclude that there was no proof at the trial that would have permitted the jury to have found in favor of the plaintiff as to this particular complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">III. THE DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"AAs8\">The parties do not disagree as to the standard to be applied by the trial court in determining whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant submitting the case to the jury. The principles enunciated in <em>Boeing v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir. 1969) are too well known to require restatement here. The trial court directed the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of the defendants here on the two grounds already noted above: 1) as to the claim against the doctors, the court found that there was a failure on the part of the plaintiff to produce evidence \u201cas to the standard of care generally practiced by other physicians in this community or in the community in which these defendant physicians practice in similar situations\u201d and \u201cthere has been no evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to show that the defendant doctors negligently failed to follow such a standard.\u201d 2) As to the foundation and hospital defendants, the court decided that in the absence of adequate evidence to establish a claim against the doctors, the hospital and foundation with which they were associated could not be found negligent on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">We deal first with the proof of what is known generally as the \u201clocality rule\u201d by which the performance of doctors has traditionally been measured under the Louisiana law. The trial court cited <em>Hayward v. Echols, </em>362 F.2d 791 as a principal basis of its determination. Both parties at the trial and in this court are in agreement that the plaintiff in a malpractice case would carry the burden of establishing that the doctor failed to meet the standard which may be expressed as it was by this court in <em>Mills v. Levy, </em>537 F.2d 1331 (5th Cir.) at 1332:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-12\">[Pjhysicians and surgeons are not negligent if they exercise that degree of skill and care which is usually possessed and exercised by practitioners of their profession in the same locality or community.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5_C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>The language of this Court in <em>Hayward </em>must have caused the trial court here to conclude that in order to establish both the standard and the deviation therefrom in a Louisiana case there must be positive, affirmative evidence as to the abstract standard, produced independently by the plaintiff, together with testimony at the trial of a qualified physician that the defendant failed to measure up to such standards. This conclusion may have come from the language in our <em>Hayward </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-4\">Where, as here, no surgeon or other expert in the field of neurosurgery testified that Dr. Echols had proceeded negligently in making the final diagnosis or in the performance of the operation, or that the operation was not proper in every respect, plaintiff is not entitled to recover for malpractice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">362 F.2d at 797.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">Of course, in using such language in <em>Hayward, </em>this court dealt with the record before it. The record here is something entirely different. As shown by our recitation of the facts, the defendant doctors clearly established the community standard touching on the prescribing of medication that constricted the blood vessels at a time when the jury could infer that the defendants had knowledge that the patient was suffering from a disease evidenced by too greatly constricted blood vessels. This is clear from the testimony, quoted above, to the effect that the community standard was that a physician would not, except under exceptional circumstances, administer a drug when it was contraindicated by a disease from which the patient was suffering. Here it is clear that the jury could infer that there was ample knowledge on the part of the appropriate persons in both hospital and clinic that Hemingway was threatened by, and actually suffering from, peripheral vascular insufficiency, which Dr. Murison testified would amount to \u201cperipheral vascular disease.\u201d The jury could also infer that at the time the sympathectomy was performed by Dr. Ochsner that procedure was thought to be required because of a condition caused by prescription by other doctors of a vascular constricting medication. Moreover, the jury could, of course, have believed the testimony of the mother and wife of the plaintiff who testified that on an occasion before the last Cafergot was prescribed for Hemingway, the surgeon had stated to them that the patient was suffering from Buerger\u2019s disease, which was clearly a contraindication for the use of such medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">So far as the responsibility of the hospital and foundation are concerned, there was further proof in the hospital and clinic records from which the jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>infer that at the time that the patient was being treated for lack of blood supply to his left foot, he was being given medication which further constricted the blood supply generally. Our attention has been called to the recent Louisiana case of <em>Bryant v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>365 So.2d 537 (La.App.1978) which holds that the liability of a hospital to a patient depends upon proof of ordinary negligence or as the court in <em>Bryant </em>stated from the Louisiana Supreme Court decision in <em>Hunt v. Bogalusa Community Medical Center, </em>303 So.2d 745 (Sup.Ct.La.1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-5\">A hospital is bound to exercise the requisite amount of care toward a patient that the particular patient\u2019s condition may require. It is the hospital\u2019s duty to protect a patient from dangers that may result from the patient\u2019s physical and mental incapacities as well as from external circumstances peculiarly within the hospital\u2019s control. A determination of whether a hospital has breached the duty of care it owes to a particular patient depends upon the circumstances and the facts of that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">303 So.2d 745, 747.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">The <em>Bryant </em>court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-8\">The standard of care enunciated above does not require the establishment of a \u201ccommunity standard\u201d in order to make a determination of negligence of hospitals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aey-dedup-0\">365 So.2d at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">The trial court placed its decision to direct a verdict in favor of the hospital and clinic upon its assumption \u201cthat the plaintiff would visit liability on the defendant Ochsner Clinic and the defendant Foundation Hospital through the alleged negligence of the doctor defendants here.\u201d To the extent that the trial court relied upon the failure to establish sufficient evidence of the doctors\u2019 liability under the \u201ccommunity standard,\u201d it would be improper for the court to hold the plaintiff to the strict proof against the hospital and clinic that is required as against the doctors. However, the court further stated \u201cnor has there been any evidence of any other negligence [besides that of the doctors] which could be attributable to the defendant Ochsner Clinic and defendant Ochsner Foundation which would warrant us denying the motion for a directed verdict.\u201d What we have stated above with respect to the error in directing the verdict against the doctors, of course, applies with greater force against the other defendants in light of the fact that the plaintiff is not required to prove either the existence of or Hie content of a \u201ccommunity standard\u201d to establish liability of the hospital and foundation. There was more than sufficient evidence from which the jury could have inferred negligent conduct by these two defendants as well as by the doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-11\">The judgment is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1127-16\">.

Dr. Ochsner testified to the occurrences beginning with the morning of July 9 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"api-dedup-0\">A: Then he asked to take some of his medication, that he had a migraine headache, and he specifically called one \u2014 or one of the residents, namely Dr. Moseley, and Dr. Moseley asked him what he took and he said he took Cafergot, had taken it for many years, so Dr. Moseley gave him the Cafergot suppository.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-9\">Q: Dr. Moseley, is he a resident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-10\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-11\">Q: Who is he employed by, foundation or the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-12\">A: He is employed by the foundation, which is the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-13\">Q: Which is the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-14\">A: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-15\">Q: So, Dr. Moseley, who is a doctor \u2014 then, of course, Dr. Moseley knew what his condition was at that time, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqs\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-16\">Q: He knew that you all had given him an epidural block and he knew you all had given him injections into the muscle to deaden the leg and to relax the muscle to let the blood flow so he wouldn\u2019t have a contracted or squeezed in blood vessel, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-17\">A: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-18\">Q: Yet he allowed him to take Cafergot at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-19\">A: Correct. He had taken it on many occasions before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-20\">Q: Before he became a diabetic?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-21\">A: And after he became a diabetic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFD\">Q: On two occasions that we know of he ended up in the hospital with a darkened foot\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-25\">THE COURT:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-26\">Counsel, you are arguing your case.

At that time he is on the road to recovery and his foot looking good and warmness back and pain is gone and everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adj-dedup-0\">What happened after he took the Cafergot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE1\">A: A few hours later it began to get blue again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-32\">Q: Turned blue again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1129-33\">A: Yes, sir. That is when they came and told us the foot is getting blue again, and it was at that time that we said, well, something\u2019s got to be amiss here because this foot was well and then suddenly it turned bad under our eyes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1129-34\">We went back and they said the only thing he\u2019s gotten is Cafergot. So then we automatically made the assumption that this man is\u2014 had an ergotrate intoxication from one or three reasons.

His mother and father lived in Atlanta and talked on the telephone to Dr. Ochsner on the eve of the operation performed for the sympa-thectomy on June 17, at which time the father testified that Dr. Ochsner called him on the telephone and \u201csaid that Ronnie\u2019s foot, his left foot, was in very bad shape and that he recommended a sympathectomy, that he be operated on, because if he didn\u2019t, he was going to lose the foot and maybe part of the leg\u201d.

Significantly, the Louisiana Code dealing with this subject matter has been amended and given retroactive effect, as it relates to medical or surgical specialists. La.R.S. 9:2794 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-13\">(A) In a malpractice action based on the negligence of a physician licensed under R.S. 37:1261 et seq. or a dentist licensed under R.S. 37:751 et seq., the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AI7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>(1) The degree of knowledge or skill possessed or the degree of care ordinarily exercised by physicians or dentists practicing in the same community or locality to that in which the defendant practices; <em>and where the defendant practices in a particular specialty and where the alleged acts of medical negligence raise issues peculiar to the particular medical specialty involved, then the plaintiff has the burden of proving the degree of care ordinarily practiced by physicians or dentists within the involved medical specialty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-8\">(2) That the defendant either lacked this degree of knowledge or skill or failed to use reasonable care and diligence, along with his best judgment in the application of that skill, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-9\">(3) That as a proximate result of this lack of knowledge or skill or the failure to exercise this degree of care the plaintiff suffered injuries that would not otherwise have been incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-12\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-13\">In <em>Ardoin v. Hartford Accident Indemnity Co., </em>360 So.2d 1331 (La. 1978), the court indicated that this section had been modified, in effect, to permit the proof of the standard applicable to medical specialists without limiting the proof to those who are familiar with the performance within the particular locality or community.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-14\">Although some of the defendants here were specialists, it is unimportant for us to consider this section of the Louisiana Code because the actions complained of were not actions that require the services of a specialist. Moreover, as indicated by the Louisiana Supreme Court, the purpose of the legislation was to make easier, not more difficult, the proof necessary to establish the standard of performance of the professional duty of the physician. Here, the plaintiff met the more difficult \u201clocality rule.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
