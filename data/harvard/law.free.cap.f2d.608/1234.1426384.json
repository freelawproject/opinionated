Turrentine, United States District Judge, Southern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1320-7\">WALLACE, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1320-8\">Huey\u2019s suit alleging securities laws violations was dismissed for failure to prosecute and he appeals. He also seeks review of the district court\u2019s failure to certify the suit as a class action. We conclude that under the circumstances of this case the refusal to certify the class is not reviewable. Though we believe the district judge arrived at the proper result on the issue involved, the circumstances of this case require us to vacate the order of dismissal and remand the case for entry of a new order and for such further consideration, if any, as the district judge concludes is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-10\">The district judge denied Huey\u2019s motion for class certification May 31, 1977. On June 14, Huey\u2019s counsel filed an affidavit stating that the case could not proceed to trial because the cost of trial would exceed the amount of Huey\u2019s individual claim. On June 27, Huey sought certification of the class action question for appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), which was denied. The next day Huey\u2019s case was called for trial. Huey made no appearance and the court ordered the matter dismissed for want of prosecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1320-16\">In a written order filed June 30, however, the district court ordered the \u201ccause . dismissed <em>without prejudice, </em>for want of prosecution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Huey filed a notice of appeal July 1. Teledyne filed a motion for correction of the order July 13. The appeal was docketed July 19. In an order filed July 29 the district court ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-17\">That the judgment rendered by this Court dated June 28, 1977 and entered on the Court\u2019s docket on June 30, 1977 is amended to read as follows to conform to the Court\u2019s ruling of June 28, 1977:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-18\">The above-entitled cause having been called for trial on June 28, 1977 at 9:00 A.M. and no appearance having been made by counsel for the plaintiff,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-19\">IT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the above-entitled cause is hereby dismissed with prejudice, for want of prosecution; defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss their counterclaims are granted, such counterclaims to be dismissed without prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1320-20\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-21\">We first determine whether the district court properly dismissed Huey\u2019s action with prejudice for failure to prosecute. This requires two inquiries: whether the district court could properly change its written dismissal of the action without prejudice to a dismissal with prejudice, and, if so, whether the court abused its discretion in so dismissing the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-22\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1320-23\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-24\">Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, such mistakes may be so corrected before the appeal is docketed in the appellate court, and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of the appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azdt\">Teledyne presented its motion in the district court as one to amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e). Huey argues that the motion was untimely and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to alter the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-5\">We believe the district court\u2019s action is properly characterized as a correction of an error in the order of dismissal pursuant to Rule 60(a). The June 28 ruling from the bench dismissed the action \u201cfor want of prosecution\u201d without qualification. Rule 41(b) specifies that such a dismissal, unless otherwise specified, operates as an adjudication upon the merits, and thus is one with prejudice. The district court\u2019s July 29 order indicated that it was made to conform to its earlier ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">This does not end our analysis. Rule 60(a) specifies that after an appeal has been docketed, leave of the appellate court is required for a correction. This appeal was docketed on July 19, before the district court\u2019s order correcting the dismissal. The district court did not seek our leave. We thus must decide whether Rule 60(a) precludes our giving effect to the correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">It appears to us that because the district court failed to seek leave to correct its June 30 order, it was powerless to do so. <em>See </em>6A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice T 60.08[2] at 4071 (2d ed. 1974). Thus, the July 29 correction was technically invalid. We have held, however, that when a district court clearly intends to dismiss a petition, but omits to do so, and the omission falls within Rule 60(a), remand to effectuate that intent is a matter of \u201cmere form.\u201d <em>Crosby v. Pacific S.S. Lines, Ltd., </em>133 F.2d 470, 474 (9th Cir. 1943). <em>See also Hamilton v. Stillwell Van &amp; Storage Co., </em>343 F.2d 453, 455 (3d Cir. 1965) (per curiam); <em>Brown v. Moore, </em>247 F.2d 711, 714 n. 2 (3d Cir. 1957), <em>cert. denied, </em>355 U.S. 882, 78 S.Ct. 148, 2 L.Ed.2d 112 (1957). <em>See generally </em>11 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2856 at 156 &amp; n. 66 (1973). It is evident that the same principle should apply when the district court has attempted to correct its error. <em>See DeVilliers v. Atlas Corp., </em>360 F.2d 292, 295-96 (10th Cir. 1966). Further, in this case we see no reason why we would have denied such leave to correct had it been properly sought. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we consider the action to have been dismissed with prejudice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that the circumstances of this case require a remand, however, so that the district court can enter a valid order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-11\">We next consider whether the district court properly dismissed Huey\u2019s action with prejudice for failure to prosecute. We have read Rule 41(b) \u201cto require prosecution with \u2018reasonable diligence\u2019 if a plaintiff is to avoid dismissal.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Air West, Inc., </em>542 F.2d 522, 524 (9th Cir. 1976). We need determine only whether the dismissal with prejudice constituted an abuse of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>district court\u2019s discretion. <em>States S.S. Co. v. Philippine Air Lines, </em>426 F.2d 803, 804 (9th Cir. 1970). This inquiry \u201cof necessity, depends upon the facts of each case,\u201d <em>id., </em>but we have also said that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion should not be disturbed unless there is \u2018a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>Anderson v. Air West, Inc., supra, </em>542 F.2d at 524 (quoting <em>In re Josephson, </em>218 F.2d 174, 182 (1st Cir. 1954)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">We see no abuse of discretion in this case either at the time of the June 28 ruling or the July 29 correction. Huey\u2019s counsel\u2019s affidavit had stated that Huey could not proceed to trial. Thus, when Huey\u2019s counsel failed to appear for trial, the district court could properly conclude that Huey did not plan to go forward with his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-5\">We recognize that we have required the \u201creasonable exploration of possible and meaningful alternatives\u201d to a Rule 41(b) dismissal with prejudice. <em>Anderson v. Air West, Inc., supra, </em>542 F.2d at 525; <em>Von Poppenheim v. Portland Boxing &amp; Wrestling Comm\u2019n, </em>442 F.2d 1047, 1054 (9th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1039, 92 S.Ct. 715, 30 L.Ed.2d 731 (1972). Huey argues that the trial court failed to explore such alternatives. He suggests as one alternative the certification of the class action question pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The district court did consider the section 1292(b) question. Further, in Huey\u2019s written opposition to Teledyne\u2019s 59(e) motion to amend the judgment he did not mention any alternatives but merely objected that the district court lacked jurisdiction to correct the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-6\">In reliance on our former death knell rule for testing the finality of denials of class certification, <em>see Hooley v. Red Carpet Corp. of America, </em>549 F.2d 643 (9th Cir. 1977), Huey now also urges that as part of the inquiry into \u201creasonable alternatives\u201d the district judge should have considered whether other members of the class could go forward, and, alternatively, should have provided time for Huey to seek out such a class member. We reject the argument that the consideration of meaningful alternatives requires the district court, on its own motion, to conduct an inquiry into the possibility of the existence of such other members. Further, the record shows that in this case Huey did seek a continuance based in part on anticipation of a denial of class certification; that continuance was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">On this record, specification of dismissal without prejudice was possible but not required. \u201cThere is no requirement that every single alternate remedy be examined by the court before the sanction of dismissal is appropriate.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Air West, Inc., supra, </em>542 F.2d at 525. The dismissal with prejudice was within the district court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1322-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-11\">Finally, we consider whether we may review the district court\u2019s refusal to certify Huey\u2019s suit as a class action in view of our decision that the dismissal was a proper exercise of his discretion. The question is, in essence, whether the policy against piecemeal appeals recently expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), governs the circumstances of this case. We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-12\">In <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>plaintiffs appealed the district court\u2019s order decertifying a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>class for purposes of a class action as a final judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, claiming in part that the decertification sounded the \u201cdeath knell\u201d of their action. The Court concluded that the decertification order was not an appealable final order, holding that \u201cthe fact that an interlocutory order may induce a party to abandon his claim before final judgment is not a sufficient reason for considering it a \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477, 98 S.Ct. at 2462 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">The policy against piecemeal appeals applies to this case even though a final judgment has been entered. Just as the policy against piecemeal appeals precludes the appeal of an order denying class certification \u2014 even where that may sound the \u201cdeath knell\u201d of an action \u2014 so it precludes, review of that order from a proper dismissal for failure to prosecute which results from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">Three circuits considered a similar question before the decision in <em>Coopers &amp; Ly-brand </em>but reached different results. None of these cases involved a claim that the interlocutory ruling prevented prosecution; apparently the parties simply refused to go forward. In <em>Sullivan v. Pacific Indem. Co., </em>566 F.2d 444 (3d Cir. 1977), plaintiffs refused to present any evidence at trial after their motion for class certification was denied. The court dismissed the action for failure to prosecute. On appeal the Third Circuit denied review of the class certification order, viewing \u201cappellants\u2019 strategy as an attempt to avoid this court\u2019s firm position against interlocutory appeals of class certification determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445. In <em>Hughley v. Eaton Corp., </em>572 F.2d 556 (6th Cir. 1978), the district court had dismissed, though without prejudice, plaintiffs\u2019 action for want of prosecution. The Sixth Circuit stated that \u201cplaintiffs\u2019 counsel provoked the court to dismiss the action and . the failure to appear at the trial date was the result of a conscious choice by plaintiffs to suffer the consequence of dismissal rather than to proceed to trial in the posture of the case as it then stood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 557. The court concluded that the dismissal was not an abuse of discretion and refused to review any preceding rulings, holding that \u201cthe sufferance of a dismissal of a cause without prejudice is not to be employed as an avenue for reaching issues which are not subject to interlocutory appeal as of right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Allied Air Freight, Inc. v. Pan Am. World Airways, Inc., </em>393 F.2d 441 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 846, 89 S.Ct. 131, 21 L.Ed.2d 117 (1968), the Second Circuit came to a different conclusion and reviewed an interlocutory stay order following a dismissal without prejudice. Appellant did \u201cnot deny that the reason that no action was taken . was to obtain review of the interlocutory order granting the stay.\u201d Id. at 444. The court rejected the argument that \u201cto consider the merits of this interlocutory order in this case would encourage all would-be appellants from interlocutory orders to do nothing.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-10\">As did the courts in <em>Sullivan </em>and <em>Hugh-ley, </em>we decline to review the interlocutory order before us under the circumstances of this case. We agree with the court\u2019s statement in <em>Sullivan:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-11\">\u201cIf a litigant could refuse to proceed whenever a trial judge ruled against him, wait for the court to enter a dismissal for failure to prosecute, and then obtain review of the judge\u2019s interlocutory decision, the policy against piecemeal litigation and review would be severely weakened. This procedural technique would in effect provide a means to avoid the finality rule embodied in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. To review the district court\u2019s refusal . under the facts of this case is to invite the inundation of appellate dockets with requests for review of interlocutory orders and to undermine the ability of trial judges to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">566 F.2d at 445-46 (quoting <em>Marshall v. Sielaff, </em>492 F.2d 917, 919 (3d Cir. 1974)).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>We are aware, of course, that our holding may force to trial some small claims to assure that the denial of class certification will be reviewed as part of a \u201cfinal decision.\u201d We are also aware that we have said that \u201c[a]ll interlocutory rulings [merge] in the final judgment and are reviewable on the appeal therefrom.\u201d <em>Sackett v. Beaman, </em>399 F.2d 884, 889 n. 6 (9th Cir. 1968). Thus, ordinarily, \u201can order denying class certification is subject to effective review after final judgment at the behest of the named plaintiff or intervening class members.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, supra, </em>437 U.S. at 469, 98 S.Ct. at 2458. We have earlier reviewed such an order following a dismissal for failure to obey an order of the court, <em>Fendler </em>v. <em>Westgate-California Corp., </em>527 F.2d 1168 (9th Cir. 1975) (per curiam), but the parties cite, and we have found, no authority indicating that we have done so where a ruling on an interlocutory order in effect caused a failure to prosecute. These circumstances warrant a limited exception to the merger rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">We recognize that we must balance conflicting interests. The hardship in refusing review of the denial of class certification after a dismissal allegedly caused by that denial and the forcing of some small claims to trial must be measured against the incentive for dilatory failure to prosecute in the district court that would otherwise result. We,conclude that the balance should be struck to discourage piecemeal appeals. Where the record shows that the denial of class certification caused the failure to prosecute, that ruling does not merge in the final judgment for purposes of appellate review, at least where, as here, the resulting dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">Because we here make an exception to a previously stated rule, and because we would remand in any case for technical correction of the order of dismissal, the circumstances of this case warrant vacation of the June 28 and 30 and the July 29 rulings and return of this case to the district court. If the parties so move, the district court may reconsider the dismissal. Thus the district judge may choose either to enter a new order of dismissal or to take whatever other action he believes appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1320-14\">. The transcript for June 28, 1977, shows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-15\">THE COURT: Is there anybody here for the plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-25\">MR. SMITH: We were advised, Your Hon- or \u2014 although we weren\u2019t told that he wouldn\u2019t be here, we were told that he was not going to go forward with his case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1320-26\">THE COURT: The plaintiff not appearing, the matter is dismissed for want of prosecution.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">. Though Teledyne claims on appeal that Rule 60(a) was the applicable rule, its motion before the district court, pursuant to Rule 59(e), stated that in the June 28 ruling the court \u201cdismissed the plaintiffs action, <em>without prejudice, </em>for want of prosecution\u201d (emphasis added) and asked the court to specify dismissal with prejudice. Nonetheless, \u201c[a]n appellee may urge any matter appearing in the record to support a judgment,\u201d <em>Waterman S.S. Corp. v. Gay Cottons, </em>414 F.2d 724, 735 (9th Cir. 1969), and we conclude Rule 60(a), which allows the correction of errors on the court\u2019s initiative, provides such a ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1321-12\">. We stated in <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. City of Seattle, Wash., </em>281 F.2d 896 (9th Cir. 1960), <em>overruled on other grounds, Ruby v. Secretary of United States Navy, </em>365 F.2d 385, 388 (9th Cir. 1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U.S. 1011, 87 S.Ct. 1358, 18 L.Ed.2d 442 (1967), that \u201cnowhere in [Rules 60 and 73] is there given any authority for the District Court to modify its order from which the appeal was taken.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 899. The alteration in that case was not the correction of an error in the order. Thus, we do not read \u201cmodify\u201d as used in that case to have referred to such corrections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1322-7\">. Huey also argues that \u201c[i]f there are satisfactory excuses [for plaintiffs inability to proceed] the case should not be dismissed.\u201d We think the \u201creasonable alternative\u201d inquiry assures that such excuses will be considered where appropriate. Further, though Huey claims that \u201ceconomic unfeasibility\u201d due to the denial of class certification is such an excuse, the ultimate inquiry centers not on an excuse\u2019s acceptability but on what alternative action by the district court will remedy the problem. Huey argues that the dismissal with prejudice was unjust in light of his inability to proceed, but we observe that a plaintiff can avoid the delay that necessarily precedes a dismissal for failure to prosecute and possibly avert a dismissal with prejudice by seeking a voluntary dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">. The court in <em>Sullivan </em>dismissed the appeal \u201cfor lack of an appealable order.\u201d 566 F.2d at 446. In <em>Sullivan, </em>however, the order of dismissal was not challenged. <em>Id. </em>at 445. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1240\">*1240</page-number>contrast, Huey challenges not only the denial of class certification, but also the correction of the order of dismissal and the dismissal itself, although the challenges to the dismissal grow out of the hardship resulting from the denial of class certification. In these circumstances we deem the order of dismissal appealable but do not review the denial of class certification.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
