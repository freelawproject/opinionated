Specifically, Homa was charged in count 1 of the indictment with the unlawful possession of seven AN-M14 TH incendiary hand grenades; in count 2 with the unlawful possession of eighteen AN-M14 TH3 incendiary hand grenades; and in count 3 with the unlawful possession of twelve WP/M34 hand and rifle grenades.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-16\">Homa waived trial by jury, and stipulated that he knowingly possessed the thirty-seven grenades described in the indictment, and stipulated further that none of the grenades was registered in the National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. The only issue remaining was whether the grenades in question constituted a \u201cfirearm\u201d as that term is defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845. The trial court, at the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case, granted Homa\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. However, the trial court adjudged Homa guilty on count 3 of the indictment, and it is from that judgment that Homa prosecutes the present appeal. The trial court\u2019s findings, conclusions and order appear as <em>United States v. Homa, </em>441 F.Supp. 330 (D.Colo.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d) provides that it is unlawful for any person to possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871 sets forth the penalty for such unlawful possession. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845 is the definitions section of the statute. One of the definitions of the term \u201cfirearm\u201d is the term \u201cdestructive device.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a). The term \u201cdestructive device\u201d is itself defined as including any explosive or incendiary grenade. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(f). However, that same sub-section further provides that the term \u201cdestructive device\u201d shall <em>not </em>include any device \u201cwhich is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Under the foregoing statutes, then, it is unlawful to possess an unregistered \u201cfirearm.\u201d A \u201cfirearm,\u201d by statute, means, <em>inter alia, </em>any \u201cdestructive device.\u201d A \u201cdestructive device,\u201d in turn, means any \u201cexplosive, incendiary . . grenade.\u201d It is undisputed that the WP/M34 (white phosphorous) hand and rifle grenade with which we are here concerned is an explosive and incendiary grenade, and hence under the statute is a destructive device and therefore a firearm within the statutory definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">However, as above noted, the section of the statute defining the term \u201cdestructive device\u201d contains several exceptions, one of which is that a device \u201cwhich is neither designed nor redesigned for use as a weapon\u201d is not a destructive device. In this latter regard the trial judge not only found that the WP/M34 grenade was an explosive and incendiary grenade, as that phrase is used in the statute, but he also found that this particular white phosphorous grenade was in fact designed for use as a weapon, and hence did not come within the exception referred to above. The main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge\u2019s finding that the WP/M34 grenade was designed for use as a weapon is supported by the record, or on the contrary is clearly erroneous. Our perusal of the record indicates that such finding is not clearly erroneous and is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">It is defendant\u2019s theory that the WP/M34 hand and rifle grenade is <em>not </em>designed for use as a weapon, and, on the contrary, is designed to be used for smoke signaling and screening purposes. Admittedly, some evidence was introduced to support such theory of the case. However, the Government called two witnesses in its case-in-chief, namely witnesses Norton and Gleason, who testified that the primary use of the WP/M34 grenade was to inflict casualties. Based on the testimony of Norton and Gleason the trial judge found that the WP/M34 grenade was capable of producing human injuries, not by fragmentation, but by the dispersion of 5000\u00b0 Fahrenheit white phosphorous particles which burn into human flesh, inflicting extremely painful burns. Without further belaboring the matter, the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the WP/M34 grenade did not come within the statutory exception that a destructive device does not include a device not designed for use as a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">Homa also attacks the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted, contending that it is vague, violates the due process and <em>ex post facto </em>provisions of the Constitution, and the like. In our view, Homa\u2019s constitutional argument is unavailing. We simply do not perceive the constitutional infirmities about which Homa complains. For illustrative cases in accord with our conclusion, see <em>United States v. Freed, </em>401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971); <em>United States v. Markley, </em>567 F.2d 523 (1st Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 951, 98 S.Ct. 1578, 55 L.Ed.2d 801 (1978); and <em>United States v. Ross, </em>458 F.2d 1144 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 868, 93 S.Ct. 167, 34 L.Ed.2d 118 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">The Government requests an advisory opinion, or at the least a suggestion from us, on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling that the Government, as a part of its case-in-chief, must negate the statutory exception referred to above. This particular matter is not technically before us. It has not been fully briefed. For these reasons, as well as others, we decline to thus opine.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
