They alleged that such discrimination violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e et seq., and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). The district courts dismissed the complaints as failing to state claims under either statute. Plaintiffs below appealed. Because of the similarity of issues involved, this court consolidated the appeals at the request of counsel for appellants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">I. <em>Statement of the Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-14\">A. <em>Strailey v. Happy Times Nursery School, Inc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-15\">Appellant Strailey, a male, was fired by the Happy Times Nursery School after two years\u2019 service as a teacher. He alleged that he was fired because he wore a small gold ear-loop to school prior to the commencement of the school year. He filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) which the EEOC rejected because of an alleged lack of jurisdiction over claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation. He then filed suit on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief. The district court dismissed the complaint as failing to state a claim under either Title VII or \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-16\">B. <em>DeSantis v. Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-17\">DeSantis, Boyle, and Simard, all males, claimed that Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. (PT&amp;T) impermissibly discriminated against them because of their homosexuality. DeSantis alleged that he was not hired when a PT&amp;T supervisor concluded that he was a homosexual. According to appellants\u2019 brief, \u201cBOYLE was continually har-rassed by his co-workers and had to quit to preserve his health after only three months because his supervisors did nothing to alleviate this condition.\u201d Finally, \u201cSIMARD was forced to quit under similar conditions after almost four years of employment with PT&amp;T, but he was harrassed by his supervisors [as well] . . . . In addition, his personnel file has been marked as not eligible for rehire, and his applications for employment were rejected by PT&amp;T in 1974 and 1976.\u201d Appellants DeSantis, Boyle, and Simard also alleged that PT&amp;T officials have publicly stated that they would not hire homosexuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-19\">These plaintiffs also filed charges with the EEOC, also rejected by the EEOC for lack of jurisdiction. They then filed suit on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief under Title VII and \u00a7 1985(3). They also prayed that the district court issue mandamus commanding the EEOC to process charges based on sexual orientation. The district court dismissed their complaint. It held that the court lacked jurisdiction to compel the EEOC to alter its interpretation of Title VII. It also held that appellants had not stated viable claims under either Title VII or \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">C. Lundin v. <em>Pacific Telephone &amp; Telegraph</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Lundin and Buckley, both females, were operators with PT&amp;T. They filed suit in federal court alleging that PT&amp;T discriminated against them because of their known lesbian relationship and eventually fired them. They also alleged that they endured numerous insults by PT&amp;T employees because of their relationship. Finally, Lundin alleged that the union that represented her as a PT&amp;T operator failed adequately to represent her interests and failed adequately to present her grievance regarding her treatment. Appellants sought monetary and injunctive relief. The district court dismissed their suit as not stating a claim upon which relief could be granted. It also refused leave to amend their complaint to add a claim under \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">II. <em>Title VII Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Appellants argue first that the district courts erred in holding that Title VII does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. They claim that in prohibiting certain employment discrimination on the basis of \u201csex,\u201d Congress meant to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. They add that in a trial they could establish that discrimination against homosexuals disproportionately effects men and that this disproportionate impact and correlation between discrimination on the basis of sexual preference and discrimination on the basis of \u201csex\u201d requires that sexual preference be considered a subcategory of the \u201csex\u201d category of Title VII. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">A. <em>Congressional Intent in Prohibiting \u201cSex\u201d Discrimination</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEs0\">In <em>Holloway v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>566 F.2d 659 (9th Cir. 1977), plaintiff argued that her employer had discriminated against her because she was undergoing a sex transformation and that this discrimination violated Title VII\u2019s prohibition on sex discrimination. This court rejected that claim, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">The cases interpreting Title VII sex discrimination provisions agree that they were intended to place women on an equal footing with men. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-12\">Giving the statute its plain meaning, this court concludes that Congress had only the traditional notions of \u201csex\u201d in mind. Later legislative activity makes this narrow definition even more evident. Several bills have been introduced to <em>amend </em>the Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination against \u201csexual preference.\u201d None have [sic ] been enacted into law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-13\">Congress has not shown any intent other than to restrict the term \u201csex\u201d to its traditional meaning. Therefore, this court will not expand Title VII\u2019s application in the absence of Congressional mandate. The manifest purpose of Title VII\u2019s prohibition against sex discrimination in employment is to ensure that men and women are treated equally, absent a bona fide relationship between the qualifications for the job and the person\u2019s sex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae_\"><em>Id. </em>at 662-63 (footnotes omitted); <em>see Baker </em>v. <em>California Land Title Co., </em>507 F.2d 895, 896 &amp; n.2 (9th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1046, 95 S.Ct. 2664, 45 L.Ed.2d 699 (1975); <em>Rosenfeld v. Southern Pacific Co., </em>444 F.2d 1219, 1225 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Following <em>Holloway, </em>we conclude that Title VII\u2019s prohibition of \u201csex\u201d discrimination applies only to discrimination on the basis of gender<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>judicially extended to include sexual preference such as homosexuality.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Smith v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>569 F.2d 325, 326-27 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>Holloway, </em>566 F.2d at 662-63; <em>Voyles v. Ralph K. Davies Medical Center, </em>403 F.Supp. 456, 456-57 (N.D.Cal.1975), <em>aff\u2019d without published opinion, </em>570 F.2d 354 (9th Cir. 1978).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">B. <em>Disproportionate Impact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Appellants argue that recent decisions dealing with disproportionate impact require that discrimination against homosexuals fall within the purview of Title VII. They contend that these recent decisions, like <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971), establish that any employment criterion that affects one sex more than the other violates Title VII. They quote from <em>Griggs:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">What is required by Congress [under Title VII] is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">401 U.S. at 431, 91 S.Ct. at 853. They claim that in a trial they could prove that discrimination against homosexuals disproportionately affects men both because of the greater incidence of homosexuality in the male population and because of the greater likelihood of an employer\u2019s discovering male homosexuals compared to female homosexuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-13\">Assuming that appellants can otherwise satisfy the requirement of <em>Griggs, </em>we do not believe that <em>Griggs </em>can be applied to extend Title VII protection to homosexuals. In finding that the disproportionate impact of educational tests on blacks violated Title VII, the Supreme Court in <em>Griggs </em>sought to effectuate a major congressional purpose in enacting Title VII: protection of blacks from employment discrimination. For as the Supreme Court noted in <em>Philbrook v. Goldgett, </em>421 U.S. 707, 95 S.Ct. 1893, 44 L.Ed.2d 525 (1975), in construing a statute, \u201c[o]ur objective . . . is to ascertain the congressional intent and give effect to the legislative will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 713, 95 S.Ct. at 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-15\">The <em>Holloway </em>court noted that in passing Title VII Congress did not intend to protect sexual orientation and has repeatedly refused to extend such protection. <em>See </em>part IIA <em>supra. </em>Appellants now ask us to employ the disproportionate impact decisions as an artifice to \u201cbootstrap\u201d Title VII protection for homosexuals under the guise of protecting men generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">This we are not free to do. Adoption of this bootstrap device would frustrate congressional objectives as explicated in <em>Holloway, </em>not effectuate congressional goals as in <em>Griggs. </em>It would achieve by judicial \u201cconstruction\u201d what Congress did not do and has consistently refused to do on many occasions. It would violate the rule that our duty in construing a statute is to \u201cascertain . . . and give effect to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>legislative will.\u201d <em>Philbrook, </em>421 U.S. at 713, 95 S.Ct. at 1898. We conclude that the <em>Griggs </em>disproportionate impact theory may not be applied to extend Title VII protection to homosexuals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">C. <em>Differences in Employment Criteria</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Appellants next contend that recent decisions have held that an employer generally may not use different employment criteria for men and women. They claim that if a male employee prefers males as sexual partners, he will be treated differently from a female who prefers male partners. They conclude that the employer thus uses different employment criteria for men and women and violates the Supreme Court\u2019s warning in <em>Phillips v. Martin-Marietta Corp., </em>400 U.S. 542, 91 S.Ct. 496, 27 L.Ed.2d 613 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">The Court of Appeals therefore erred in reading this section as permitting one hiring policy for women and another for men .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 544, 91 S.Ct. at 497.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">We must again reject appellants\u2019 efforts to \u201cbootstrap\u201d Title VII protection for homosexuals. While we do not express approval of an employment policy that differentiates according to sexual preference, we note that whether dealing with men or women the employer is using the same criterion: it will not hire or promote a person who prefers sexual partners of the same sex. Thus this policy does not involve different decisional criteria for the sexes.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">D. <em>Interference with Association</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">Appellants argue that the EEOC has held that discrimination against an employee because of the race of the employee\u2019s friends may constitute discrimination based on race in violation of Title VII. <em>See </em>EEOC Dec. No. 71-1902, [1972] Empl.Prac.Guide (CCH) 16281; EEOC Dec. No. 71-969, [1972] Empl.Prac.Guide (CCH) 16193. They contend that analogously discrimination because of the sex of the employees\u2019 sexual partner should constitute discrimination based on sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Appellants, however, have not alleged that appellees have policies of discriminating against employees because of the gender of their friends. That is, they do not claim that the appellees will terminate anyone with a male (or female) friend. They claim instead that the appellees discriminate against employees who have a certain type of <em>relationship </em>\u2014 i. e., homosexual relationship \u2014 with certain friends. As noted earlier, that relationship is not protected by Title VII. <em>See </em>part IIA <em>supra. </em>Thus, assuming that it would violate Title VII for an employer to discriminate against employees because of the gender of their friends, appellants\u2019 claims do not fall within this purported rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">E. <em>Effeminacy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Appellant Strailey contends that he was terminated by the Happy Times Nursery School because that school felt that it was inappropriate for a male teacher to wear an earring to school. He claims that the school\u2019s reliance on a stereotype \u2014 that a male should have a virile rather than an effeminate appearance \u2014 violates Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">In <em>Holloway </em>this court noted that Congress intended Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination in employment to prevent discrimination because of gender, not because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of sexual orientation or preference. <em>See </em>part IIA <em>supra. </em>Recently the Fifth Circuit similarly read the legislative history of Title VII and concluded that Title VII thus does not protect against discrimination because of effeminacy. <em>Smith v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., </em>569 F.2d at 326-27.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree and hold that discrimination because of effeminacy, like discrimination because of homosexuality (part IIA supra) or transsexualism <em>(Holloway), </em>does not fall within the purview of Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">E. <em>Conclusion as to Title VII Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"ajm-dedup-0\">Having determined that appellants\u2019 allegations do not implicate Title VII\u2019s prohibition on sex discrimination, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissals of the Title VII claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">III. <em>\u00a7 1985(3) Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The district courts dismissed the male appellants\u2019 claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3). The district court also refused to allow the women appellants to amend their complaint to state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Section 1985(3)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">If two or more persons . . . conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws ... in any case of conspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged therein do, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived of having and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages, occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any one or more of the conspirators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">Appellants argue that the concerted actions of various agents of their employers and others, to effectuate the discriminatory policy of the employers constituted a conspiracy in violation of \u00a7 1985(3). They conclude that regardless of this court\u2019s holding as to Title VII, they can assert a viable \u00a7 1985(3) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-15\">The forerunner of \u00a7 1985(3) was enacted as part of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. Act of April 20,1871, ch. 22, \u00a7 2,17 Stat. 13, 13-14. It was intended to provide special federal assistance to southern blacks and their allies in protecting their rights under the fourteenth amendment and other reconstruction legislation against the Ku Klux Klan and others organized to thwart reconstruction efforts. <em>See </em>Cong.Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 426 (remarks of Rep. McKee); <em>id. </em>at 438-39 (remarks of Rep. Cobb); J. Franklin, Reconstruction: After the Civil War 166-68 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">A century later the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1985(3) applied only when there is \u201csome racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). Because <em>Griffin </em>dealt with allegations by blacks of a conspiracy to deprive them of their civil rights, the Supreme Court did not decide \u201cwhether a conspiracy motivated by invidiously discriminatory intent other than ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>cial bias would be actionable\u201d under \u00a7 1985(3). <em>Id. </em>at 102 n.9, 91 S.Ct. at 1798, n.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">In <em>Life Insurance Co. of North America v. Reichardt, </em>591 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1979), this court held that plaintiffs alleging a conspiracy to deprive women of equal rights could invoke \u00a7 1985(3). 591 F.2d at 502. Appellants here claim that since <em>Reichardt </em>moved beyond the narrow historical perspective of 1871, homosexuals (and all groups) can now claim the special protection of \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We disagree. While \u00a7 1985(3) has been liberated from the now anachronistic historical circumstances of reconstruction America, we may not uproot \u00a7 1985(3) from the principle underlying its adoption: the Governmental determination that some groups require and warrant special federal assistance in protecting their civil rights. This underlying principle must continue to determine the coverage of \u00a7 1985(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In contradistinction to southern blacks of 1871, the blacks of <em>Griffin, </em>and the women of <em>Reichardt, </em>it cannot be said that homosexuals have been afforded special federal assistance in protecting their civil rights. The courts have not designated homosexuals a \u201csuspect\u201d or \u201cquasi-suspect\u201d classification so as to require more exacting scrutiny of classifications involving homosexuals. <em>Cf. Doe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>403 F.Supp. 1199, 1202 (E.D.Va.1975) (three judge court) (constitutionality of Virginia sodomy law upheld against due process and other challenges under legitimate interest and rational relationship tests), <em>aff\u2019d mem., 425 </em>U.S. 901, 96 S.Ct. 1489, 47 L.Ed.2d 751 (1976). And as noted in part II <em>supra, </em>Congress did not \u2014 and has consistently refused to \u2014 include homosexuals as a group within the special protection of Title VII. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">We conclude that homosexuals are not a \u201cclass\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1985(3). The district courts therefore properly rejected appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1985(3) claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-8\">.

However, we will refer to the provision as \u00a7 1985(3) in conformity with standard practice in order to avoid confusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b417-9\">. Given our conclusion, there would be no purpose in allowing the women plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint to add a \u00a7 1985(3) claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b417-10\">SNEED, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"apk-dedup-0\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">I concur in the majority\u2019s opinion save subpart B of Part II thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">I respectfully dissent from subpart B which holds that male homosexuals have not stated a Title VII claim under the disproportionate impact theories of <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Co., </em>401 U.S. 424, 91 S.Ct. 849, 28 L.Ed.2d 158 (1971). My position is not foreclosed by our holding, with which I agree, that Title VII does not afford protection to homosexuals, male or female. The male appellants\u2019 complaint, as I understand it, is based on the contention that the use of homosexuality as a disqualification for employment, which for <em>Griggs\u2019 </em>purposes must be treated as a facially neutral criterion, impacts disproportionately on <em>males </em>because of the greater visibility of male homosexuals and a higher incidence of homosexuality among males than females.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">To establish such a claim will be difficult because the male appellants must prove that as a result of the appellee\u2019s practices there exists discrimination against males <em>qua </em>males. That is, to establish a prima facie case under <em>Griggs </em>it will not be sufficient to show that appellees have employed a disproportionately large number of female <em>homosexuals </em>and a disproportionately small number of male <em>homosexuals. </em>Rather it will be necessary to establish that the use. of homosexuality as a bar to employment disproportionately impacts on <em>males, </em>a class that enjoys Title VII protection. Such a showing perhaps could be made were male homosexuals a very large proportion of the total applicable male population.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">My point of difference with the majority is merely that the male appellants in their <em>Griggs </em>claim are not using that case \u201cas an artifice to \u2018bootstrap\u2019 Title VII protection for homosexuals under the guise of protecting men generally.\u201d (p. 2011). Their claim, if established properly, would in fact protect males generally. I would permit them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>to try to make their case and not dismiss it on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">With respect to the appellants\u2019 section 1985(3) claims (Part III of the majority opinion), I should like to observe that the appellants fail because discrimination against homosexuals does not rest on the class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus required by section 1985(3), as interpreted by <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, </em>403 U.S. 88, 91 S.Ct. 1790, 29 L.Ed.2d 338 (1971). Many groups, quite satisfactorily subject to identification, are not within the ambit of section 1985(3)\u2019s protection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This section is not a writ by which the judiciary can provide comfort and succor to all groups, large and small, who feel social disapproval from time to time. Like many others, homosexuals do not enjoy section 1985(3) protection.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\">. <em>See, e. g., McLellan v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co., </em>545 F.2d 919, 928-29, 931-33 (5th Cir. 1977) (en banc) (bankrupts); <em>Lessman v. McCormick, </em>591 F.2d 605 (10th Cir. 1979) (debtors). <em>McLellan </em>at 928-29 mentions blacklisted employees, doctors who testified against their brethren in malpractice cases, protestors on university campuses, newspaper dealers, policemen, and others as classes to which section 1985(3) has been held not to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The reasoning of the <em>McLellan </em>decision is particularly persuasive in this context. The <em>McLellan </em>court noted: (1) that the legislative history of the Act provides no suggestion that Congress had been concerned about discrimination against insolvents, 545 F.2d at 932; (2) that acknowledging that the protection afforded by the civil rights acts is not static does not suffice to bring bankrupts within the scope of the Act when Congress had specifically refused to prohibit discrimination against bankrupts and when the Supreme Court had refused to characterize the right to file a bankruptcy petition as a fundamental right, <em>id. </em>at 932-33. The court declined to enlarge the ambit of \u00a7 1985 to include bankrupts, stating that it did not believe that Congress had intended to protect every class over which it had power to legislate.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">There is no indication that Congress was concerned about discrimination against homosexuals when it passed the Ku Klux Klan Act; subsequently, Congress has, on several occasions, specifically declined to protect homosexuals from employment discrimination, <em>see Holloway v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>566 F.2d 659, 662 &amp; n.6 (9th Cir. 1977); and the Supreme Court, on at least one occasion, declined to characterize consensual homosexual behavior as a fundamental right, <em>Doe v. Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney, </em>403 F.Supp. 1199 (E.D.Va. 1975), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>425 U.S. 901, 96 S.Ct. 1489, 47 L.Ed.2d 751 (1976) (constitutionality of Virginia sodomy law upheld in declaratory judgment action against due process, freedom of expression, and privacy attacks). I therefore find little difficulty differentiating homosexuals from other groups, such as women, or various political groups, for whom class protection under \u00a7 1985 has, in some Circuits, been found to exist. <em>See, e. g., Life Insurance Co. of North America v. Reichardt, </em>591 F.2d 499 (9th Cir. 1979) (women); <em>Means v. Wilson, </em>522 F.2d 833 (8th Cir. 1975), cert. <em>denied, </em>424 U.S. 958, 96 S.Ct. 1436, 47 L.Ed.2d 364 (1976) (political opponents); <em>Cameron v. Brock, </em>473 F.2d 608 (6th Cir. 1973) (supporters of political candidate). Homosexuals do not comprise a group which federal statutory or constitutional law deems in need of protection from group harassment, hence, homosexuals do not constitute a protected class for purposes of \u00a7 1985.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
