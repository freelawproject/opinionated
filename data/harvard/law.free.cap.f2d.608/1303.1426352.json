WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1388-11\">The Board found that petitioner violated Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act (the Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) and (3), by the coercive conduct of a supervisor and by the discriminatory discharges of two warehousemen. The Board\u2019s decision reversed that of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-12\">The company petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s decision, and the Board filed a cross-application for enforcement of its order requiring the employer to cease and desist unfair labor practices and to reinstate the discharged employees with back pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court\u2019s jurisdiction derives from Section 10(e) and (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) and (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-14\">We hold that the conduct of the supervisor is not attributable to the employer and that both discharges were for legitimate business reasons. We reverse the decision of the Board and deny enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-16\">Petitioner, Butler-Johnson Corporation, located in Sacramento, is a wholesale distributor of building and flooring materials. Its president is Dan Ford. In 1975, Ford named Joe Secco the \u201cinternal operations manager\u201d in charge of office sales and accounting personnel, warehousemen, and truck drivers. Ford also named Jim Secco (Joe\u2019s cousin) the \u201cday warehouse foreman,\u201d and Robert Mozingo the \u201cnight warehouse foreman.\u201d Including the two Seccos and Mozingo, Ford had 21 employees in Sacramento in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-17\">None of petitioner\u2019s employees was unionized until January 1976, when a majority of the company\u2019s three truck drivers and seven warehousemen voted to be represented by a local of the Teamsters Union. The election followed a number of secret employee meetings late in 1975 that had been organized by Mozingo and night warehouseman Curt Nelson. Jim Secco attended at least one of the meetings. During the pre-election period, Secco lobbied against the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-18\">In February and March 1976, Secco continued to express his anti-union views to his fellow employees during informal conversations in the warehouse. In one of those conversations he told Nelson and Mozingo that Ford would eventually \u201cphase out\u201d the employees responsible for the union campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-19\">In March 1976, Ford terminated Nelson after being advised by his insurance broker that Nelson\u2019s insurance coverage would be unduly expensive because his driver\u2019s license had been suspended. The risk of not insuring Nelson was considerable, for his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>warehouse job required him to drive forklifts and trucks on company premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">In August 1976, Ford discharged Mozingo after learning of an argument between Mozingo and Jim Secco. During the argument, witnessed by several other employees, Mozingo yelled loudly, made derogatory comments about the company and Ford, and kicked a box of formica. The preceding May, after a similar outburst by Mozin-go, Ford had warned Mozingo that such behavior would not be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">The union and Mozingo filed charges against petitioner with the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the discharges and Secco\u2019s remarks were violations of Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ decided that, because Secco was not a supervisor, his conduct was not attributable to petitioner. The ALJ also decided that neither discharge was retaliatory. The Board reversed the ALJ, finding that Secco was a supervisor and that the discharges were unlawfully motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"a3b-dedup-0\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">This court will enforce an order of the NLRB if the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and if it applied the law correctly. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) (1976). <em>Los Angeles Marine Hardware Co. v. NLRB, </em>602 F.2d 1302, 1305 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">Although the standard of review does not change when the Board\u2019s decision is contrary to that of the ALJ, the weighing of the evidence can be affected by the incongruity. When credibility is at issue or when findings of motive or purpose depend entirely upon credibility, the decision of the ALJ will be given special weight. Moreover, even when there is independent evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision, the Board\u2019s findings of fact will be scrutinized more critically if they contradict those of the ALJ. <em>Loomis Courier Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 595 </em>F.2d 491, 495-96 (9th Cir. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">\n<em>The Section 8(a)(1) Violation: Jim Secco\u2019s Conduct.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">Jim Secco\u2019s remarks constitute a Section 8(a)(1) violation only if they were (1) threatening and (2) attributable to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-15\">This court has said that an employer\u2019s right of free speech is not restricted by the Act so long as the employer\u2019s statements about unionism or a specific union \u201cdo not contain a \u2018threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u2019 \u201d <em>NLRB v. General Tel. Directory, </em>602 F.2d 912, 915 (9th Cir. 1979), quoting <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 618-19, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). Because Secco\u2019s statement that Ford would fire employees instrumental in bringing the union to the company contains a clear \u201cthreat of reprisal\u201d for union activities, the controlling question is whether the statement can be attributed to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-16\">The Board determined that Secco\u2019s comments were attributable to his employer because he was a \u201csupervisor\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>Board\u2019s conclusion that Secco is a supervisor has support in the record,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> he was a supervisor only in the most technical sense of Section 2(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">The small work force of warehousemen and truck drivers was already subject to active supervision by Ford and Joe Secco. Jim Secco had no authority to hire, promote, or discharge employees or even to recommend such action. Moreover, as \u201cday warehouse foreman,\u201d he was in charge of only three other warehousemen. Much of his day was spent doing the same work as the other warehousemen which work, for the most part, was repetitive and routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">Secco voted as an employee in the union election and his vote was not challenged by the union or the company. His relationships with other employees were casual and generally friendly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Secco\u2019s position as a low-level supervisor is not conclusive of petitioner\u2019s liability. His comments are attributable to petitioner only if the employees who heard them had \u201cjust cause\u201d to believe petitioner authorized them. <em>NLRB v. Texas Independent Oil Co., </em>232 F.2d 447, 450 (9th Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">As this court has previously observed, statements by low-level, marginal supervisors \u201care more likely to express individual views and less likely to influence the employee\u2019s decision than statements by high-level officials which bear the imprint of company policy.\u201d <em>Hecla Min. Co. v. NLRB, </em>564 F.2d 309, 315 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\">There is no evidence that petitioner authorized Jim Secco\u2019s comments. Furthermore, because Secco voted in the union election and the other employees knew that his anti-union animus was personal,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they did not have \u201cjust cause\u201d to believe Secco made his threatening remarks about the union on behalf of management. Therefore, petitioner should not be held accountable for those remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">\n<em>The Section 8(a)(3) and (1) Violations: The Discharges.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-14\">The Board, reversing the ALJ, found that Curt Nelson and Robert Mozingo were fired for unionizing company employees. Petitioner contends that the discharges were the result of legitimate business considerations. This court has said that \u201c[a] \u00a7 8(a)(3) violation requires normally that the Board make an affirmative showing that the employer\u2019s discriminatory conduct was motivated by an antiunion purpose.\u201d <em>Los Angeles Marine Hardware Co., supra, </em>at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-15\">\n<em>Nelson\u2019s Discharge.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-16\">The Board found that the firing was related to Nelson\u2019s union activity because (1) the employer did not fire Nelson when his driver\u2019s license was suspended in November 1974; (2) moving trucks was not an essential part of the warehouseman position; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>Nelson\u2019s replacement had a severe vision impairment; and (4) Jim Secco had said that Ford would cleverly terminate employees involved in the union organizing, and Nelson had been an active union organizer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">When the record is viewed as a whole, considerable other evidence comes to light. The record makes clear that petitioner did not contrive the insurance problem. The insurer discovered that Nelson\u2019s license had been suspended when it made a routine check of the employees\u2019 driving records pri- or to writing a new company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">When Ford was informed that the policy would exclude Nelson, he inquired about the possibility of an additional policy to cover Nelson. Ford learned that such a policy would cost considerably more than insurance for other employees and would limit Nelson to driving a single vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">Nelson had been a truck driver for petitioner before his license was suspended. He was the night warehouseman who was best able to move the trucks into and out of loading position, and he spent 20 to 30 minutes each night doing such driving. The possibility of an accident while Nelson moved the trucks on company premises was not remote. In October 1975 he had collided with an automobile while backing a truck from the yard into the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-8\">The Board found that the warehouseman position in general did not require driving. Ford testified, however, that he wanted all-night warehousemen to be able to move the trucks around. Moreover, the warehouse-men needed to drive forklifts, and Ford\u2019s insurance broker had warned that the one-vehicle insurance exclusion might include forklifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-9\">The Board also emphasized the fact that Nelson\u2019s replacement could not drive a truck because of his poor vision. Petitioner did not discover the extent of that handicap until the man began working. As soon as it was discovered, the replacement was fired. The man hired to replace him was an experienced truck driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-10\">There is no evidence that Ford, at the time he discharged Nelson, even knew of Nelson\u2019s role in organizing company employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">The AU found that there was insufficient evidence to infer a discriminatory motive in Nelson\u2019s discharge. This finding of no motive is entitled to added weight. <em>Loomis, supra. </em>In light of this finding and the evidence just discussed, we hold that the Board\u2019s conclusion that petitioner violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) by firing Nelson is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">\n<em>Mozingo\u2019s Discharge.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-13\">The Board concluded that Mozingo\u2019s discharge was an unfair labor practice because (1) Mozingo\u2019s hot-tempered personality and argumentative conduct had not concerned Ford prior to the union election; (2) Ford had torn up written probationary warnings given to Mozingo in May; (3) Mozingo\u2019s discharge did not conform to the company\u2019s policy of placing an employee on probation for up to six months; and (4) Secco had said Ford would cleverly terminate employees involved in union organizing, and Ford knew of Mozingo\u2019s strong advocacy for the union. As with Nelson, however, there is significant additional evidence in the record concerning the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-14\">There is evidence that at least one other employee was discharged without a probationary warning. More importantly, there is evidence that Mozingo had been warned orally about his temper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-15\">In May, Ford had given him written warnings about three incidents of misconduct, one of which was an emotional outburst directed at Jim Secco. When Mozin-go explained these incidents, Ford tore up the warning letter but orally stated that he would not tolerate continued outbursts. It was just such an outburst, again directed at Jim Secco and witnessed by other employees, that led to Mozingo\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-16\">Although Mozingo personally had told Ford that he supported the union, there is no other evidence that Ford fired Mozingo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>because of his pro-union sentiments. As pointed out by petitioner, had Ford been looking for a pretext to fire Mozingo, he could have done so in May after the three incidents. Again, we must give added weight to the ALJ\u2019s finding that there was no discriminatory motive behind Mozingo\u2019s discharge. <em>Loomis, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">This case is similar to one recently decided by the Eighth Circuit. In <em>Stein Seal Co. v. NLRB, </em>605 F.2d 703 (3rd Cir. 1979), an employee was discharged after arguing persistently with supervisors and the company president about a denied pay raise. Although the Board found that the employee had been discharged because of his union activities, the court disagreed. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avil-dedup-0\">The fact that one has been a union activist does not grant him immunity for that type of insubordination which would not be tolerated from others. The president of a company is not required by the National Labor Relations Act to remain silent in his office when supervisors report commotion in the plant where company policies are being challenged or thwarted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXXH\">605 F.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">We hold that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion that Mozingo\u2019s discharge was motivated by an anti-union purpose.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">We reverse the Board\u2019s decision and deny enforcement of its order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1388-20\">. The Board\u2019s order is reported at 237 N.L.R.B. No. 95 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">. Section 8(a)(1) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cto interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees\u201d who are exercising the rights guaranteed by Section 7 of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (1976). Section 7 guarantees employees the right to self-organize, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively, to engage in other activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or mutual aid or protection, and to refrain from any of these activities. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">Section 8(a)(3) provides in relevant part that it is an unfair labor practice for an employer \u201cby discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1389-19\">. Section 2(11) defines as a supervisor</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-20\">any individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such action, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(11) (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">. The enumerated functions in Section 2(11) are to be read in the disjunctive, and the existence of any of them, regardless of the frequency of their performance, is sufficient to confer supervisory status. <em>NLRB v. St. Francis Hospital of Lynwood, </em>601 F.2d 404, 420 (9th Cir. 1979). The record reveals that Secco exercised independent judgment in the performance of his duties at least once: when Mozingo was ill, <em>Secco </em>personally reassigned employees so that one of them could cover for Mozingo. This court will defer to the Board in Section 2(11) decisions if the Board\u2019s decision \u201chas \u2018warrant in the record\u2019 and a reasonable basis in law.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Doctors\u2019 Hospital of Modesto, Inc., </em>489 F.2d 772, 776 (9th Cir. 1973), quoting <em>NLRB v. Hearst Publications, Inc., </em>322 U.S. 111, 131, 64 S.Ct. 851, 861, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1390-18\">. Secco and Mozingo argued frequently. These arguments apparently stemmed from personality differences and were exacerbated by the differing opinions of the two men about the value of the union.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1390-19\">. In response to a question about what was said during the employees\u2019 frequent informal conversations about the union, Nelson testified</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-20\">It was more or less the same context. It was myself or Bob Mozingo supporting the union and Jim Secco taking the non-union point of view and telling us that he had been in the union before and it never did him any good.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">. Because we conclude that Mozingo\u2019s discharge was not the result of anti-union animus, we shall not consider the question whether Mozingo was a supervisor and therefore excluded from the protections of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
