The district court rejected this claim, holding that the record demonstrated that Palum-bo\u2019s counsel professionally and competently presented the deficiency issue. After considering both of Palumbo\u2019s contentions, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-22\">Palumbo and six codefendants were charged in a five count indictment with conspiracy to possess Percodan with intent to distribute and conspiracy to distribute Percodan in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846(a) (1976),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and with distribution of Percodan in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A jury found Palumbo guilty of conspiracy, but acquitted him on the four substantive counts. The trial judge sentenced him to fifteen years in prison, followed by three years of special parole. Palumbo appealed the judgment of conviction, and a panel of this Court affirmed by judgment order. <em>United States v. Palumbo, </em>568 F.2d 771 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 926, 98 S.Ct. 2819, 56 L.Ed.2d 768 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">At trial and on appeal, Palumbo\u2019s counsel contended that the indictment incorrectly alleged that Percodan was a Schedule II substance. After attempting to establish that the chemical composition of Percodan placed it in the Schedule III category,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pa-lumbo argued that trial for possession and conspiracy to possess Percodan would amount to an unconstitutional amendment of the indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defense asserted that Palumbo, in effect, would be tried for possession of a Schedule III substance, but indicted for a different crime \u2014 possession of a Schedule II substance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After listening to a chemist employed by the Drug Enforcement Administration testify that Percodan contains oxycodone, a Schedule II substance,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the district judge held, as a matter of law, that Percodan was a Schedule II narcotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">On his direct appeal, Palumbo challenged the district court\u2019s determination and again asserted that the trial judge had unconstitutionally amended the indictment by instructing the jury that Percodan was a Schedule II substance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Court rejected Palumbo\u2019s contention and affirmed the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">Palumbo claims on the present appeal, as he did in the \u00a7 2255 hearing in the district court, that the indictment was deficient because it incorrectly stated that Percodan is a Schedule II substance. As we have just indicated, the question whether Percodan is a Schedule II narcotic was adjudicated at Palumbo\u2019s trial and by a panel of this Court on his direct appeal. Because Palumbo has received a full hearing by the federal courts on this legal issue, we hold that, on the facts present here, the district court did not err in declining to consider again the question in the \u00a7 2255 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-15\">The Supreme Court has recognized two purposes underlying federal habeas corpus review.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> First, \u201c[t]he provision of federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>collateral remedies rests . . . fundamentally upon a recognition that adequate protection of constitutional rights relating to the criminal trial process requires the continuing availability of a mechanism for relief.\u201d <em>Kaufman v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 217, 226, 89 S.Ct. 1068, 1074, 22 L.Ed.2d 227 (1969). Second, federal collateral review affords persons in custody \u201c[t]he opportunity to assert federal rights in a federal forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe right then is not merely to a federal forum but to full and fair consideration of constitutional claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 89 S.Ct. at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Palumbo has had a full and fair hearing in two federal tribunals \u2014 the district court and the court of appeals \u2014 of his Fifth Amendment claim that the proof introduced at trial varied substantially from the terms of the indictment. The record and briefs from his original appeal demonstrate that his attorney vigorously argued his constitutional claim. A panel of this Court heard and decided his contentions. Palum-bo has already received the benefit of federal judicial review of his constitutional claims. To permit relitigation here of the issues previously decided by this Court, therefore, would not further the purposes of \u00a7 2255 and would result in wasteful duplication of the federal judicial review process.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Accordingly, we hold that, in the absence of newly discovered evidence that could not reasonably have been presented at the original trial,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a change in applicable law,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> incompetent prior representation by counsel,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or other circumstances indicating that an accused did not receive full and fair consideration of his federal constitutional and statutory claims, a \u00a7 2255 petitioner may not relitigate issues that were adjudicated at his original trial and on direct appeal.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because none of the four exceptions is present here, we conclude that the district court did not err in declining to address once again Palumbo\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim in the \u00a7 2255 proceeding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-16\">Palumbo\u2019s second contention is that he should be released from custody and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>granted a new trial because he did not receive effective assistance of counsel at his original trial and on his direct appeal. He maintains here that his attorney failed to argue that the proof varied substantially from the terms of the indictment because Percodan is, in fact, a Schedule III substance, while the indictment alleged conspiracy and possession of a Schedule II substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">We have reviewed both the trial transcript as well as the briefs submitted by Palumbo on his direct appeal and agree with the district court that Palumbo received competent and professional legal assistance. His attorney attempted to establish that the presence of oxycodone does not make Percodan a Schedule II substance and asserted that the proof of possession of Percodan therefore varied from the terms of the indictment.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In our view, Palumbo\u2019s counsel at his original trial and on appeal argued this issue vigorously, professionally, and, indeed, in much the same manner as did his attorney on this appeal. Because we conclude that Palumbo\u2019s original counsel exercised \u201cthe customary skill and knowledge which normally prevaile[d] at the same time and place\u201d of his original trial and appeal<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> \u2014 the standard for measuring effective assistance of counsel claims \u2014 the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-9\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1976) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-10\">A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-11\">A motion for such relief may be made at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-12\">Unless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the United States attorney, grant a prompt hearing thereon, determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.
