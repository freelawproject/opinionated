Elster appealed on October 26, 1977, asserting jurisdiction in this court under the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine and the collateral order doctrine articulated in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). In February 1978, defendants moved to dismiss the appeal arguing that the district court\u2019s order was not final, thus was not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978), decided June 21, 1978, the Supreme Court rejected Elster\u2019s jurisdictional contentions and held that \u201corders relating to class certification are not independently appealable under \u00a7 1291 prior to judgment.\u201d 437 U.S. at 470, 98 S.Ct. at 2458.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In the wake of <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>El-ster urges that we treat his appeal as a petition for mandamus. <em>See Leesona Corp. v. Cotwool Manufacturing Corp., </em>308 F.2d 895 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>Arrowhead Co. v. The Aimee Lykes, </em>193 F.2d 83 (2d Cir. 1951). He seeks the writ of mandamus to compel the trial court to conduct a hearing in making a class determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Elster cites our holding in <em>Satterwhite v. City of Greenville, </em>578 F.2d 987, 993 n.7 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc), to support his contention that a hearing was mandatory. He convincingly reasons that if a hearing had been held he would have then been afforded the opportunity to amend and tailor his complaint to eliminate the district court\u2019s valid objections to class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Elster retains the opportunity to amend his pleading, however, upon return of the case to the district court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires\u201d; this mandate is to be heeded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuS\"><em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 230, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). He may then renew his motion for class certification. The district court has a continuing power under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(c)(1). Its certification decision \u201cis not irreversible and may be altered or amended at a later date.\u201d 7A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1785, at 137 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-14\">We perceive no basis for concluding that following this decision the district court will not handle these matters properly as they are presented to it. A writ of mandamus is clearly unnecessary at this stage, and we decline to decide the circumstances, if any, under which its issuance might be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-15\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
