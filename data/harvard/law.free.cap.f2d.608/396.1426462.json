Here, after having been convicted of a narcotics offense, Bledsoe was released to state authorities on parole. While at liberty in this status, he was charged with having committed the offense of robbery. He was acquitted of the charge after a full trial in the appropriate Washington court. Not satisfied with the result of that trial, however, the parole authorities revoked Bledsoe\u2019s parole, finding \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that he had committed the offense of which he had been acquitted in the criminal trial. To the concurring judges, this simply does not seem fair. It should be mentioned, too, that it did not seem fair to District Judge Neill, before whom Bled-soe\u2019s Petition for Habeas relief was presented. Judge Neill, in a well reasoned opinion, took an approach opposite to that taken by this court in <em>Standlee. </em>Because of <em>Standlee, </em>however, Judge Neill was compelled to withdraw his original opinion and revoke his original decision that Bledsoe was entitled to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
