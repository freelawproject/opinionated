Avasthi sued the United States for personal injuries under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 <em>et seq. </em>(FTCA). The government answered that the claim was barred because Avasthi\u2019s exclusive remedy is the Federal Employees Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8108 <em>et seq. </em>(FECA). FECA applies to injuries sustained \u201cwhile in the performance of [an employee\u2019s] duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 8102(a). Following a bench trial on the merits, the district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-15\">The issues in this case bring it squarely within the reasoning of <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>451 F.2d 963 (5th Cir. 1971). There we followed the third circuit in holding that an injured employee may not bring an action against the United States under FTCA when there is a \u201csubstantial question as to whether or not the injury occurred in the performance of the employee\u2019s duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 965. The employee must first seek and be denied relief under FECA unless his injuries do not present any substantial question of compensability under that act. <em>Somma v. United States, </em>283 F.2d 149, 150-51 (3d Cir. 1960). The policy behind FECA is similar to that of state workmen\u2019s compensation laws, which is to provide injured employees with more immediate and less expensive relief than a common law tort action. <em>United States v. Demko, </em>385 U.S. 149, 151, 87 S.Ct. 282, 17 L.Ed.2d 258 (1966). The remedy provided by FECA, like that of most comparable statutes, is exclusive of any other remedy including FTCA. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-16\">Avasthi wants no part of FECA. He has not applied for compensation and does not now seek it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He insists that he was seriously injured and incurred permanent partial disability as the proximate consequence of defendant\u2019s negligence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>reasons that under FTCA he is entitled to damages that greatly exceed any potential award of FECA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">Avasthi\u2019s argument based on the comparative statutory benefits is irrelevant to the question controlling his claim. We are required to determine which of two mutually exclusive statutes applies to this claim. This determination must rest on the statutory language and congressional purpose. Its effect will extend to other employees injured under similar circumstances, regardless of the sympathetic appeal of their causes or their preferences for one statute. The central question is whether there was at least a substantial question that Avas-thi\u2019s injury occurred \u201cin the performance of his duty.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">Avasthi was employed by the Federal Aviation Administration as an air traffic controller trainee at FAA\u2019s Air Traffic Control Center in Hampton, Georgia. He was injured when he slipped and fell at the Center building on outside steps while walking to his automobile. His accident occurred at the end of his assigned work shift at 11:42 P.M. on January 12, 1975. The Center building is separated from the parking lot by a walkway, an access drive, and then two short flights of steps.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parking lot is a private Center lot for employees and persons having business there. The parking lot and Center building are surrounded by a chain link fence of eight feet height with barbed wire on top, and the lot has a guard at the gate at all times. Avasthi\u2019s path down the outside stairs where his injury occurred was the only available route to his automobile in the Center parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">The government urges here as in <em>Bailey </em>that we adopt an application of the so-called \u201cpremises rule\u201d that would automatically extend FECA coverage to federal employees going to and from work and while on federal property. The argument is futile. We are bound by the <em>Bailey </em>court\u2019s rejection of that absolute rule. 451 F.2d at 966-67. <em>Bailey </em>instead commits us to follow the tenth circuit\u2019s approach in <em>United States v. Browning, </em>359 F.2d 937 (10th Cir. 1966), which requires consideration of a number of factors, including the premises rule, in deciding whether an injury is com-pensable, <em>id. </em>at 940. <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>451 F.2d at 966. Seizing on a concept articulated in <em>O\u2019Leary v. Brown-Pacific-Maxon, Inc., </em>340 U.S. 504, 71 S.Ct. 470, 95 L.Ed. 483 (1951), this court held that, although Mrs. Bailey was still on government property when injured, she was not within the \u201czone of special danger\u201d incident to her employment, <em>id. </em>at 507, 71 S.Ct. 470, and thus was not within FECA coverage. <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>451 F.2d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-9\">The facts in <em>Bailey, </em>however, are markedly different from those now before us. Mrs. Bailey had driven away from her job site in her private automobile and was injured at a traffic light after she had driven more than a block down the main street of Fort Polk, a public street open to all persons authorized to be on the base. The court noted that she was not involved in any activity connected with her work and was not subject to her employer\u2019s supervision. It regarded the government\u2019s ownership of the street as a mere \u201cfortuitous circumstance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1145-10\">Avasthi was in a significantly different posture while entering and leaving his place of duty. He was clearly within whatever \u201czone of special danger\u201d the conditions of his employment created while he was descending steps that were part of the Center facility and had to be used to reach the Center\u2019s parking lot. His injury would appear to be compensable under FECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-11\">It is not necessary, however, for us to reach an ultimate determination of the government\u2019s FECA liability. It is sufficient that a substantial question exists about FECA coverage. Resolution of the coverage question has been entrusted to the Secretary of Labor. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>Such a question clearly exists in the case before us. We therefore conclude that the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">. Avasthi\u2019s supervisor routinely filed an application for FECA benefits on Avasthi\u2019s behalf. Certain medical expenses which were incurred for Avasthi\u2019s treatment have consequently been paid from FECA funds. Our result was reached independent of any consideration as to the effect, if any, that such payments may have on an FTCA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1145-12\">. Plaintiff asserts that prior to the time his fall occurred, the light at the steps had been out for three or four weeks.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
