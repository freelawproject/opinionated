The employees have petitioned this court for review of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s decision that they are not eligible for assistance. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2322.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-28\">The worker adjustment assistance program is but one facet of the Trade Act of 1974. A comprehensive piece of legislation, the Trade Act was intended \u201cto foster the economic growth of and full employment in the United States and to strengthen economic relations between the United States and foreign countries through open and nondiscriminatory world trade,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(1), as well as \u201cto provide adequate procedures to safeguard American industry and labor against unfair or injurious import competition, and to assist industries, firms, workers, and communities to adjust to changes in international trade flows,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(4). Through this Act, Congress gave the President broad authority to negotiate trade agreements that would reduce or eliminate tariffs and other barriers to international trade. At the same time, recognizing that increased imports could burden some domestic industries, Congress provided adjustment assistance for workers, firms, and communities injured by import <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>competition. <em>UAW v. Marshall, </em>189 U.S.App.D.C. 232, 233, 584 F.2d 390, 391 (D.C.Cir. 1978). A group of workers can qualify for benefits including compensation, employment services, training, and job search and relocation allowances, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2291-98, if the Secretary of Labor determines that three requirements are met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\">(1) that a significant number or proportion of the workers in such workers\u2019 firm or appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">(2) that sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">(3) that increases of imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such workers\u2019 firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof contributed importantly to such total or partial separation, or threat thereof, and to such decline in sales or production.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272. <em>See Usery v. Whitin Machine Works, Inc., </em>554 F.2d 498, 500 (1st Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">It is the third eligibility requirement that concerns us here. In concluding that the Pan Am workers were ineligible for adjustment assistance, the Secretary determined that they performed a variety of passenger, cargo, mechanical, administrative and managerial tasks in the operation of Pan Am flights from Boston to London and that Pan Am was not involved in the production of an \u201carticle\u201d within the meaning of section 222(3) of the Trade Act, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3). 43 Fed.Reg. 59,176 (1978). This determination was in keeping with the Secretary\u2019s earlier decision, in similar proceedings brought in 1975 by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters on behalf of 691 Pan Am workers laid off in 1974, that Pan Am workers did not qualify for adjustment assistance because the air transportation services Pan Am provided were not \u201carticles.\u201d 40 Fed.Reg. 54,639 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Although judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s 1975 decision was apparently not sought, the Boston Pan Am workers terminated in 1978 are asking that this court overturn the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the third eligibility requirement and declare them eligible for adjustment assistance. In the brief filed on their behalf by their Teamsters Union shop steward, the workers contend that they lost their jobs to foreign competition. They explain that in July, 1977, the United States and Britain signed an agreement, known as the Bermuda II agreement, which contained a stipulation that only two United States cities would be allowed to have service to London provided by two United States airlines. Subsequently, New York and Los Angeles were given this \u201cdual designation.\u201d On April 19, 1978, the Civil Aeronautics Board named Trans World Airlines as the single American airline to provide service from Boston to London and stripped Pan Am of its Detroit-Boston-London route. Pan Am withdrew from Boston after other operations from the city proved unprofitable. British Airways dramatically increased its share of the Boston-London market.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Concerning the Secretary\u2019s conclusion that Pan Am workers are ineligible for adjustment assistance because they do not produce \u201carticles,\u201d the Boston workers simply contend that a service can be considered a product, and that the product Pan Am sells (\u201cparticular seat on a particular flight to a particular destination\u201d) should be considered an \u201carticle.\u201d On this point we also have the benefit of a detailed memorandum filed during the 1975 proceedings by a Teamsters attorney, who argued that the term \u201carticle\u201d is expansive enough to include services and that extending benefits to service workers would be within the remedial intent of the Trade Act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">We have found no judicial decisions concerning the eligibility of workers in service industries for adjustment assistance. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>deciding whether the workers\u2019 interpretation of the Act has any force, we focus first on the words of the statute itself. <em>E. g., Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 197, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976); <em>Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, </em>591 F.2d 121, 128 (1st. Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Baird v. Pratt, </em>441 U.S. 952, 99 S.Ct. 2181-82, 60 L.Ed.2d 1057 (1979). To interpret air transportation services as \u201carticles produced\u201d within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3) is to strain severely, if not fracture, the statutory language. Although in advertising lingo, Pan Am might be said to sell a \u201cproduct,\u201d we do not think air transportation service is a \u201cproduct\u201d or an \u201carticle\u201d in the ordinary sense of these words. <em>Cf. Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corp. v. United States Consumer Product Safety Commission, </em>574 F.2d 178, 180 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 881, 99 S.Ct. 218, 58 L.Ed.2d 193 (1978) (term \u201carticle\u201d said to denote \u201cany material thing\u201d). <em>See generally Burns v. Alcala, </em>420 U.S. 575, 580-81, 95 S.Ct. 1180, 43 L.Ed.2d 469 (1975). Nor are we aware of any special commercial meaning of these terms that would include services. <em>See generally Trans-Atlantic Co. v. United States, </em>471 F.2d 1397, 1398 (C.C.P.A.1973); 2A C. Sands, <em>Statutes and Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47.31 (4th ed. 1973). Nevertheless, we recognize that the Customs Court has said the term \u201carticle\u201d is vague and varies according to context, <em>Close and Stewart v. United States, </em>268 F.Supp. 466, 468-69 (Cust.Ct.1967), and that one dictionary definition of the word \u201carticle\u201d (\u201ca thing of a particular class or kind, as distinct from a thing of another class or kind,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1976)), is broad enough to permit argument that services are included.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">When read in the context of the entire Trade Act, however, it becomes clear that the term \u201carticle\u201d was plainly meant to refer to a tangible thing and not to a service. Although the Trade Act does not contain a definition of the word \u201carticle,\u201d the definitions sections contained in the Act\u2019s \u201cGeneral Provisions is persuasive. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2481. There it is stated that, \u201cfor the purposes of this Act,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">[a]n imported article is \u201cdirectly competitive with\u201d a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing, and a domestic article is \u201cdirectly competitive with\u201d an imported article at an earlier or later stage of processing, if the importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect of importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2481(5). A product of a country or area is defined as an article which is the growth, produce, or manufacture of such country or area. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2481(8). Finally, the term \u201ccommerce\u201d is said to include services associated with international trade. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2481(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Other sections of the Trade Act confirm that the term \u201carticle\u201d was used in a somewhat restrictive sense to refer to a thing and that the terms \u201ccommerce,\u201d \u201ctrade,\u201d and \u201cservices\u201d were used when Congress meant to refer to services. On one hand, throughout the Act, an article is referred to as something that can be the subject of a duty. <em>E. g., </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2119, 2132, 2135, 2151, 2436, 2461, 2463. In one section, an article is spoken of as something that can be placed in a warehouse. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(g). On the other hand, in a section authorizing the President to negotiate trade agreements with an eye toward reducing barriers to international trade, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112, \u201cinternational trade\u201d is defined to include trade in both goods and services. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(g). Another section empowers the President to withdraw trade agreement concessions, impose duties or other import restrictions on foreign goods, and impose fees and restrictions on foreign services, once he determines that a foreign country\u2019s tariffs and other import restrictions or its export subsidies and other policies unfairly burden United States c\u00f3m-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>merce; \u201ccommerce\u201d being defined to include services associated with international trade. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(a). Another provision, which allows the President to enter into bilateral commercial agreements extending non-discriminatory (most favored nation) treatment to products of countries formerly denied such treatment, specifies that these agreements may be renewed if a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2435.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">All of this leads to the conclusion that the term \u201carticle\u201d as used throughout the Trade Act, was not meant to include services, and supports the Secretary\u2019s determination in this case that services of the type rendered by Pan Am were not \u201carticles\u201d within the meaning of the worker adjustment assistance eligibility requirement set forth in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272(3). There is a presumption that the same words used in different parts of an act have the same meaning. <em>E. g., Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States, </em>286 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nunez, </em>573 F.2d 769, 771 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>436 U.S. 930, 98 S.Ct. 2828, 56 L.Ed.2d 774 (1978); <em>Hotel Equities Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>546 F.2d 725, 728 (7th Cir. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Only if the workers could overcome this presumption by showing that the term \u201carticle\u201d was intended to be used in a more expansive sense in the adjustment assistance provisions of the act, <em>see, e. g., Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States, supra, </em>286 U.S. at 433, 52 S.Ct. 607; <em>Hotel Equities Corp. v. Commissioner, supra, </em>at 728, or could demonstrate that an interpretation of the act denying them adjustment assistance would be plainly at variance with the policy of the legislation, <em>United States v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., </em>310 U.S. 534, 543-44, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940); <em>Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, supra, </em>591 F.2d at 128, would we be persuaded to depart from the apparently plain meaning of the statute, which is ordinarily controlling, <em>see Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 184 n. 29, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1978). The workers\u2019 arguments do not convince us.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The workers emphasize that one of the express purposes of the act is \u201cto assist . workers ... to adjust to changes in international trade flows,\u201d 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2102(4), and that one of the act\u2019s principal House sponsors, Representative Ullman, said in calling up the conference report that the adjustment assistance program was intended to protect workers and industries that have been \u201cadversely affected by trade.\u201d 120 Cong.Rec. 41,796-97 (1974). Since the word \u201ctrade\u201d was used during the legislative process to include trade in services, S.Rep.No.93-1298, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 45 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 7186, 7217, and so used in the Trade Act itself, 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2112(g)(3), the Pan Am workers claim that employees of service industries were meant to be eligible for adjustment assistance. However, when placed alongside the more restrictive language used in the adjustment assistance provisions themselves, these references to \u201ctrade\u201d are not compelling evidence that Congress intended to cover service industry employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">The workers also point out that, in enacting the Trade Act, Congress found that the original worker adjustment assistance program created by the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Pub.L.No. 87-794, 76 Stat. 872 (current version begins at 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801) had been ineffective and replaced it with a new, streamlined program having more liberal eligibility requirements to be administered by the Labor Department. S.Rep.No.93-1298, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 131 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 7186, 7273; H.R.No.93-571, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 52-53 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is true that the Trade Act eliminated the Trade Expansion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>Act requirement that workers seeking adjustment assistance show (1) a causal link between increased imports and trade agreement concessions, and (2) that increased imports were a \u201cmajor cause\u201d of separation; the second requirement was replaced with one mandating a lesser showing that increased imports \u201ccontributed importantly\u201d to the separations. <em>Compare </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2272 <em>with </em>Pub.L.No. 87-794, \u00a7 301, 76 Stat. 883 (repealed 1975). However, like the Trade Act, the Trade Expansion Act speaks in terms of assisting workers whose jobs were threatened or lost because of increased imports of \u201can <em>article </em>like or directly competitive with an <em>article produced </em>by such workers\u2019 firm, or an appropriate subdivision thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). There is no indication that, in liberalizing adjustment assistance eligibility requirements in the Trade Act, Congress meant to adopt an expansive interpretation of \u201carticle\u201d and to extend coverage to employees of service industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Pan Am employees further point out that the Trade Act of 1974 was enacted nearly contemporaneously with the International Air Transportation Fair Competitive Practices Act of 1974, Pub.L. 93-623, 88 Stat. 2102 (1975) (codified in and amending scattered sections of 22, 49 U.S.C.). The fact that Congress legislated in one act against unfair practices that had hampered United States airlines does not, however, demonstrate that United States airline employees injured by foreign competition are entitled to adjustment assistance under another act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Finally, the Pan Am workers contend that the Trade Act\u2019s adjustment assistance provisions are to be construed liberally because that part of the Trade Act is remedial in nature. We agree with this general proposition and sympathize with the plight of the workers in this case, but we are not free to rewrite the adjustment assistance provisions to include them. <em>See United Shoe Workers of America, AFL-CIO v. Bedell, </em>165 U.S.App.D.C. 113, 127, 506 F.2d 174, 187 (D.C. Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">\n<em>The decision of the Secretary of Labor is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-12\"> We treat this memorandum, which is included in the Appendix, as part of appellant\u2019s argument in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">. <em>Close and Stewart v. United States, </em>268 F.Supp. 466, 468 (Cust.Ct.1967) referred to this definition, but did not suggest the term \u201carti-ele\u201d is broad enough to encompass services. <em>See also United States v. A. Johnson and Co., Inc., </em>588 F.2d 297, 300 (C.C.P.A.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-6\">.

The Senate report accompanying the bill that became the Trade Act of 1974 also manifests Congress\u2019 concern about discrimination against the United States transportation service industries and its desire that this be the subject of negotiation and other Presidential action. S.Rep.No.93-1298, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 74, 102, 114, 165, 208 (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>[1974] U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News, pp. 7186, 7224, 7259, 7303, 7340.
