They appeal, asserting several procedural violations. We affirm their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-26\">On May 18, 1978, Captain Fred Long of the United States Customs Service received information from a confidential source to the effect that an illegal offloading of marijuana would occur at the Marquesas Shrimp Company in Key West, Florida early the next morning. The property was then, placed under surveillance. At about 3:30 a. m., a van and pick-up truck drove to the: grounds and parked near the pier. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>around 4:15 a. m., a sea vessel approached the pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Large bales were unloaded from the boat onto the motor vehicles. As the motor vehicles left the company property, they were stopped by Customs officers. These officers noticed the odor of marijuana, discovered marijuana in the vehicle and arrested the two drivers who are defendants here, Michael Diezel and Geraldo Ruiz. At about that time, the commotion caused some of those who had been loading bales to run into a nearby warehouse where they too were arrested by Customs officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">All of the defendants were read their <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish and English. One of the defendants, William Fuller, asked one of the officers to retrieve his shirt from the sea vessel, describing the location of the shirt. It was found where he said and a search of the vessel led to the discovery of more marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Before trial, Fuller moved to suppress his statement about the shirt. That motion was denied after Fuller\u2019s lawyer refused to proceed after arguing that the burden of proof lay on the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">All three defendants in this appeal moved to suppress the introduction of the physical evidence on the grounds that it was unconstitutionally obtained. The trial court denied that motion also.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-18\">At a joint jury trial of 13 defendants, all were convicted of both counts of the indictment. After the convictions, the court ruled on earlier defense motions for acquittal and granted them, except for the three defendants in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">The defendants here argue first that the Customs officials had no authority to search the vehicles or vessels because their jurisdiction is limited to situations where a border crossing has taken place. In the suppression hearing, Customs Officer Gregory V. Welch testified that he did not know if the ship had come from outside the country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">It is true that Customs officers are not like state or local police who are general guardians of the public peace. <em>See United States v. Diamond, </em>471 F.2d 771 (9th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>412 U.S. 932, 93 S.Ct. 2751, 37 L.Ed.2d 161 (1973). The powers of the Customs Service to arrest and search are defined by federal statute and are usually limited to violations of the Customs laws. See for example 19 U.S.C. 482<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 1581(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>However, in the area of drug enforcement, Congress has entrusted broader powers to the Customs Service. As part of the Narcotic Control Act of 1956, Congress gave Customs agents the power to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-5\">(2) make arrests without warrant for violations of any law of the United States relating to narcotic drugs ... or marihuana . . . where the violation is committed in the presence of the person making the arrest or where such person has reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing such violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIN\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607. This statute embodies the notion that Customs officials have specified arrest powers in matters dealing with narcotic drug or marijuana violations. Since the arrest and searches here clearly involved such drugs, the Customs officers had statutory jurisdiction to arrest and search. We therefore reject this portion of the defendants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The defendants argue next that the trial judge\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress Fuller\u2019s statement because the lawyer refused to proceed was improper because the burden of proving the voluntariness of a confession rests with the prosecution. They also argue that the trial court was obligated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to hold a \u201cvolun-tariness hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">We reject both of these arguments. First, while the pre-trial burden of proof concerning the voluntariness of a confession rests with the government, the burden is on the movant to make specific factual allegations of illegality. As this Court said in <em>United States v. Evans, </em>572 F.2d 455, 486 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied </em>439 U.S. 870, 99 5. Ct. 200, 58 L.Ed.2d 182 (1978), \u201cThe burden is on the movant to make specific factual allegations of illegality, to produce evidence, and to persuade the court that the evidence should be suppressed.\u201d <em>See also United States v. De La Fuente, </em>548 F.2d 528, 533-34 (5th Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 2640, 53 L.Ed.2d 249 (1976); 434 U.S. 904 (1977); <em>United States v. Crocker, </em>510 F.2d 1129, 1135 (10th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-16\">Second, under 18 U.S.C. 3501(d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> no \u201cvoluntariness hearing\u201d is required for a statement which was not the result of interrogation or which was made when the suspect was not in custody. Here, where the defendant Fuller asked officers to get his shirt from on board the ship, his statement was clearly volunteered and not in response to interrogation. It therefore falls within the statutory exception to the requirement of a hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-17\"> Finally, the defendants allege that it was reversible error for the prosecution to reveal the fact that all the defendants were read their <em>Miranda </em>rights but that a conversation was held only with Fuller. They argue that such a disclosure is a reference to the fact that no other defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>made any post-arrest statements and was therefore an impermissible prosecutorial comment on Diezel\u2019s and Ruiz\u2019s post-arrest silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">We disagree. The standards set forth in <em>United States, v. Edwards, </em>576 F.2d 1152, 1154 (5th Cir. 1978), provide a bifurcated test for determining whether or not prose-cutorial statements are a reference to a defendant\u2019s silence. That case held that such statements were such a reference when: (1) the manifest intention of the prosecution was to draw attention to the defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence; or (2) the jury could infer \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d that it was a comment on the defendant\u2019s silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-20\">Neither of those factors exists here. The reference to Diezel\u2019s and Ruiz\u2019s silence came only after the prosecution had asked a Customs agent, who had spoken with Fuller, whether he had a conversation with any of the defendants. The agent mistakenly answered \u201cno,\u201d which forced the prosecutor to then ask specifically about the conversation with Fuller.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, it was clear that it was not the intention of the prosecutor to draw attention to the other defendants\u2019 silence or that the jury would have inferred it as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-33\">Having disposed of these contentions, we AFFIRM the holding of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">.
