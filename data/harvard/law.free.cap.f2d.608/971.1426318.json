In March, 1974, the district court, with the concurrence of counsel for all parties, preliminarily defined the class as black females who have applied for and have been dis-criminatorily denied employment because of their race or sex and black female employees who have been discriminatorily denied employment opportunities because of their race or sex. At that time, the district court did not exercise its discretionary authority to order notification to unnamed class members. Subsequently, on December 4, 1974, attorneys for the named plaintiffs issued a letter, without court authorization, to present and former black employees of Bloomsburg Mills which advised them of the pending litigation and invited them to meetings to gather information for the suit. Bloomsburg Mills obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent the meetings and to prohibit the plaintiffs from initiating communication with any unnamed class members. After a hearing, the district court entered an order on February 27, 1975, which denied the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to redefine the class and prohibited counsel-initiated communications with any potential or actual class members not a party to the action. At the same time the court issued an order to provide notice of the action to class members. The plaintiffs sought modification of the order restricting communications, but their motion was denied on October 10, 1978. The plaintiffs then sought a writ of mandamus in this Court to direct the district court to allow plaintiff and counsel-initiated communication with class members and black males. We denied the petition for mandamus. No. 78-1722 (4th Cir., Nov. 22, 1978). The plaintiffs now seek to appeal from the district court\u2019s order restricting communication under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Bloomsburg Mills has moved for dismissal on the ground that this Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal. We conclude that the district court\u2019s order is not appealable and accordingly grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-11\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this Court has jurisdiction of appeals from all \u201cfinal\u201d decisions of the district court. While the plaintiffs do not assert that the district court\u2019s order is final in the sense that it terminates the litigation, they do claim that the order is appealable under the \u201ccollateral order\u201d doctrine enunciated in <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). That doctrine creates an exception to the rule of finality and permits appeals from orders \u201ctoo important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226. Before an order may be treated as \u201cfinal\u201d and appealable under <em>Cohen, </em>it must possess three characteristics: \u201c(1) it must be separable from, and collateral to, the main cause of action; (2) the right involved must be too important to be denied review; and (3) the question presented must be such that, if review is postponed until final termination of the case, the claimed right will be irreparably lost.\u201d <em>United States v. Lansdown, </em>460 F.2d 164, 170-71 (4th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-12\">Although the district court\u2019s order may meet the first two requirements, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>conclude that the plaintiffs will not irreparably lose any of their rights if we do not permit this appeal. The district court\u2019s order merely regulates the conduct of the litigation. The scope and conduct of discovery are within the sound discretion of the district court. <em>N. C. Ass\u2019n of Black Lawyers v. N. C. Bd. of Exam., </em>538 F.2d 547 (4th Cir. 1976). The district court may modify its order as the litigation proceeds. Any possible harm to the class members is speculative at best. Therefore, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order is not appeal-able under the collateral order exception to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) permits appeals from certain interlocutory orders of the district court which grant, deny, or modify injunctions. In determining whether or not an order is appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1), the courts do not look to the terminology of the order but to its substantial effect. Words of restraint in an order which is only a step in an action does not render the order appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). <em>Virginia National Bank v. Commonwealth of Va., </em>448 F.2d 425 (4th Cir. 1971). In <em>Switzerland Cheese Ass\u2019n v. E. Home\u2019s Market, </em>385 U.S. 23, 87 S.Ct. 193, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966), the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[ojrders that in no way touch on the merits of the claim . . . are not in our view \u2018interlocutory\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 87 S.Ct. at 195. The district court\u2019s order in the instant appeal regulates the conduct of discovery. The order is merely a step in the litigation process and is in no way directed to the merits of the underlying action. Therefore, the order is not appealable under \u00a7 1292(aXl).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Switzerland Cheese Ass\u2019n, </em>noted Judge Clark\u2019s dissent in <em>Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Dixon Textile Corp., </em>280 F.2d 800, 805-06 (2d Cir. 1960), where he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1057-9\">\u201cA district judge\u2019s orders advancing a case to trial ought not to be critically examined and re-examined by the cumbersome method of appeal before he has approached the stage of adjudication <em>. . </em>I believe this is an intolerable burden for us, an improper and uncertain interference with trial court discretion, and a confusing invitation to indiscriminate appeals in the future \u2014 all contrary to settled federal law against piecemeal appeals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1057-12\">385 U.S. at 25 n.3, 87 S.Ct. at 195 n.3. We approve of this language and conclude that accepting the instant appeal would violate the integrity of congressional policy against piecemeal appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-13\">Accordingly, we grant the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
