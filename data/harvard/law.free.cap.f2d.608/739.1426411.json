According to the government\u2019s evidence, Jackson launched the scheme by suggesting to a prison acquaintance that appellant, Jackson\u2019s former tax attorney, could \u201claunder\u201d the profits of crime. Jackson arranged a meeting between Jackson\u2019s prison acquaintance (now an FBI informer), FBI agents posing as organized crime figures, and appellant. Appellant described a scheme in which he and Jackson would receive the tainted money, commingle it with trust accounts appellant claimed to manage, invest the commingled funds in commodities transactions, and return half the illegal monies to the agents\u2019 nominees through sham salaries and commissions which would appear to come from legitimate trading in commodities. Negotiations among appellant, Jackson, and the agents continued over the next five months, and culminated in a meeting in San Francisco at which the agents handed appellant a suitcase containing one million dollars in funds to be \u201claundered.\u201d After appellant had accepted the money, the agents announced their true identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-13\">Appellant\u2019s principal defense was that he had no intention to carry out the scheme but intended to expose it to IRS and collect an informer\u2019s reward.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-14\">Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict because the scheme was so ludicrous and transparently impractical that a reasonable jury would necessarily entertain doubt as to his intent in dealing with the agents. We have examined the record and conclude there was more than adequate evidence from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant meant to implement the \u201claundering\u201d scheme as best he could.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-15\">Appellant complains because the trial court refused to give the standard entrapment instruction. There was no evidence that appellant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy was induced by government agents. Jackson, not anyone associated with the government, involved appellant in the scheme. Jackson might have claimed entrapment; appellant could not. <em>United States v. Jenkins, </em>470 F.2d 1061, 1063 (9th Cir. 1972). There was no basis in the evidence for appellant\u2019s suggestion that Jackson was an \u201cunwitting agent\u201d of the FBI who \u201censnared\u201d appellant to participate in the scheme. The evidence clearly estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>lished that Jackson acted as a principal lawbreaker, and not as an agent of law enforcement, in inducing appellant to conspire.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">At oral argument, appellant advanced the additional theory that the jury could have believed appellant intended initially to turn his coconspirators in to the authorities and succumbed to the criminal intent to carry out the conspiracy only after being prodded by the agents and tempted by a half share in the proffered million dollars. There was no evidence before the jury to support this theory. Neither appellant nor any other witness intimated that appellant\u2019s mental state changed as the conspiracy unfolded; to the contrary, appellant consistently maintained he did not intend at any time to consummate the conspiracy, while the government as consistently contended appellant planned to go through with the scheme from the start.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The trial court correctly determined that no genuine entrapment issue was presented for jury resolution. <em>See United States v. Glaeser, </em>550 F.2d 483, 487 (9th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">The jury returned a verdict on the third day of deliberations. The judge who took the verdict ordered a poll. The fourth juror polled responded, weeping, \u201cI voted yes [i. e., guilty] to man but no to God\u201d and that she \u201cwishfed] to say not guilty.\u201d The judge halted the poll and, after a careful charge, sent the jury back for further deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Appellant contends that \u201creturning the jury for further deliberation was inherently coercive.\u201d The trial court acted within the bounds of its discretion in directing further deliberations rather than discharging the jury. Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(d). The judge could well have concluded that further deliberation might clarify the undecided jur- or\u2019s state of mind and produce either a clear verdict or clear disagreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">After an additional hour of deliberation, the jury returned a second guilty verdict. The trial judge agreed to and did poll each juror separately in chambers, but declined appellant\u2019s request to ask in addition \u201cwhether there was, in fact, any undue influence\u201d exerted on the weeping juror. The requested inquiry into the jury\u2019s internal deliberations would have been improper. Fed.R.Evid. 606(b). To the extent <em>Cook v. United States, </em>379 F.2d 966 (5th Cir. 1967), survives adoption of Rule 606(b), it is not to the contrary. Unlike the ambiguous verdict in <em>Cook, </em>the final verdict here was not indefinite or qualified on its face; each juror, including the previously undecided juror, told the judge in the privacy of chambers that he agreed with the guilty vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
