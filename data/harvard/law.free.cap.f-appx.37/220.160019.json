Snipes appeals the District Court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adverse grant of summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 action. Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Jolly v. Knudsen, </em>205 F.3d 1094, 1096 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Snipes claimed that Clarinda Correctional Facility Dr. Ann Mueller and Nurse D. Murray were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical need: rectal bleeding from internal hemorrhoids. He alleged that Dr. Mueller had failed to recommend surgery, and that Dr. Mueller and Nurse Murray had denied him feminine maxi-pads to control his bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Assuming that Snipes\u2019s hemorrhoid condition constituted a serious medical need, the medical records and expert opinion he submitted fell far short of creating a triable issue on whether Dr. Mueller and Nurse Murray ignored an acute or escalating condition. <em>See Jolly, </em>205 F.3d at 1096 (holding that an inmate must show that he suffered from serious medical need, which prison officials knew of and deliberately ignored; mere disagreement with treatment decisions does not rise to level of constitutional violation); <em>Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1243 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-12\">.
