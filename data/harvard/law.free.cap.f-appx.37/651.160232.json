On May 22, 2001, the district court ordered the Government to respond to the motion. The Government responded on August 15, 2001. Although we find that mandamus relief is not warranted because the delay is not unreasonable, we deny the petition without prejudice to Simpson\u2019s right to refile if the district court does not act expeditiously. We also deny Simpson\u2019s motion to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
