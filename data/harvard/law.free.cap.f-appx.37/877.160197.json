Evans appeals his conviction pursuant to guilty plea and his 121-month sentence for importation of crystal methamphetamine, a.k.a. \u201cice,\u201d in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Evans\u2019 counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no meritorious issues for review, and a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. Evans has not filed a supplemental pro se brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">Counsel has identified, and properly rejected, one potential issue for review on direct appeal: the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice. The district court did not err in applying the enhancement to Evans, who absconded from supervision and as a result failed to appear at a hearing on his alleged violations of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Draper, </em>996 F.2d 982, 986 (9th Cir.1993) (affirming obstruction enhancement for defendant who absconded after having agreed to terms of pretrial release).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-17\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988) discloses no issues for review. Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b925-33\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
