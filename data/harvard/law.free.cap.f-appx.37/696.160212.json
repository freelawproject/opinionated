He was sentenced to 170 months imprisonment. On appeal, he maintains that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for the firearms charge. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>This court must affirm the conviction if there is substantial evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, to support the verdict. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence is substantial, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government and inquires whether there is evidence sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). In evaluating the sufficiency <em>of </em>the evidence, this court does not review witness credibility and assumes the fact finder resolved all contradictions in the evidence in the Government\u2019s favor. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). The fact finder, not the reviewing court, weighs the credibility of the evidence and resolves any conflicts in the evidence presented, and if the evidence supports different reasonable interpretations, the jury decides which to believe. <em>United States v. Murphy, </em>35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">We have reviewed the record and we find sufficient evidence to support Broadway\u2019s firearm conviction. Accordingly, we affirm Broadway\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
