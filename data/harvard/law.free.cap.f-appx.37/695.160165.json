The district court sentenced him to 97 months imprisonment. On appeal, Petitfrere argues his sentencing was flawed in four respects. He first claims the court erred in enhancing his offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guideline </em>\u00a7 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice. We review a district court\u2019s finding of fact that a defendant engaged in conduct that obstructed justice for clear error. <em>See United States v. Self, </em>132 F.3d 1039, 1041 (4th Cir.1997). We find that the court correctly concluded that Petitfrere made false statements that obstructed the investigation of the scope of his own relevant conduct as well as obstructing the investigation of other potential co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-25\">Next, Petitfrere objects to the court\u2019s refusal to lower his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. We review the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant does not warrant credit for accep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>tance of responsibility for clear error. <em>See United States v. White, </em>875 F.2d 427, 431 (4th Cir.1989). Given the finding that Petitfrere obstructed justice by refusing to admit to the entire extent of his relevant conduct, we find the district court did not clearly err in refusing to lower Petitfrere\u2019s offense level of acceptance of responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Petitfrere also challenges the court\u2019s enhancement of his offense level under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) based on his possession of a firearm during his offense. A finding that a defendant\u2019s offense level should be increased under USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001). We find the district court correctly determined that it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Finally, Petitfrere claims he should have received a sentence reduction under the \u201csafety valve\u201d provision of USSG \u00a7 5C1.2. Based on our rulings above, we find that Petitfrere does not meet the criteria necessary to warrant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 5G1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Accordingly we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
