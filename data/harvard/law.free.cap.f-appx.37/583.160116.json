Romine pleaded guilty to a two-count Information charging him with securities fraud in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78\u00a1j(b) and 78ff and 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5 and filing a false tax return in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1). The District Court sentenced Romine to 27 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release, assessed a $150 fine, and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $500,000 to UBS PaineWebber, Inc. (\u201cPaineWebber\u201d) and Van Dyk Health Care, Inc. (\u201cVan Dyk\u201d). Romine appeals that portion of his sentence ordering him to pay restitution, although he does not contest the amount of restitution ordered if restitution otherwise appropriate. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Romine argues that the District Court incorrectly determined that PaineWebber and Van Dyk were \u201csubstitute victims\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3663A and 3664. His argument fails. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a), a criminal defendant is required to pay restitution to the victim of his or her crime. Where a victim receives compensation from insurance \u201cor any other source\u201d for the loss, restitution shall be paid to the person who compensated the victim. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(l). That is precisely what we have here. The victims of Romine\u2019s crimes have been fully compensated by PaineWebber and Van Dyk. As such, Romine is required to pay restitution to those companies.</p>\n<p id=\"A8A\">Romine counters that PaineWebber and Van Dyk are joint tortfeasors by virtue of a civil settlement with the victims and, thus, ineligible to receive restitution. In support of his argument, Romine relies on <em>United States v. Shepard, </em>269 F.3d 884 (7th Cir.2001), and urges us to adopt the Seventh Circuit\u2019s analysis. We find Shepard wholly inapposite. In <em>Shepard, </em>the Seventh Circuit discussed only the amount of restitution due a third-party payer and not the underlying obligation to pay restitution under \u00a7 3664(j)(l); indeed, <em>Shepard </em>does not even mention that section of the Act much less any notion of \u201csubstitute victim.\u201d 269 F.3d at 885. Because <em>Shepard </em>does not stand for the proposition that the language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(j)(l) bars restitution to a person who is or may be a joint tortfeasor, and our research has disclosed no case which does, Paine Webber and Van Dyk are permissible \u201cother source[s]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3664(j)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">In a final attack on the District Court\u2019s restitution order, Romine contends that the $500,000 loss constitutes consequential damages. Romine, however, stipulated in his plea agreement that the victims\u2019 direct loss equaled between $350,000 and $500,000. This amount, and more, was paid to the victims by PaineWebber and Van Dyk. The fact that Romine must now pay $500,000 to the companies and not to the individual victims does not transform this direct loss into consequential damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">In sum, the District Court properly ordered Romine to pay restitution to PaineWebber and Van Dyk. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
