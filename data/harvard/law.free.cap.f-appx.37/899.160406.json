We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>98 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>F.3d 510, 512 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">Edwards contends that Amendment 591 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines entitles her to a sentence reduction, because her sentence was enhanced based upon uncharged conduct. However, Amendment 591 by its terms does not affect the court\u2019s ability to apply sentence enhancements based on uncharged relevant conduct; it only affects the selection of base offense level guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Amendment 591 (2000). Edwards does not contend that her base offense level was incorrect. Accordingly, the district court properly denied her motion. <em>See Townsend, </em>98 F.3d at 513.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b947-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b947-10\">. We reject the government\u2019s contention that Edwards\u2019 Notice of Appeal was untimely. <em>See Houston v.

We also reject the government's contention that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <em>See United States v. Lowe, </em>136 F.3d 1231 (9th Cir.1998) (making a distinction between appeals that raise a legal question and those questioning the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b948-18\">.
