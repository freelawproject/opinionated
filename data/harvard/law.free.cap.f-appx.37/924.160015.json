The counts arose out of his employment with Gecko Holdings, Inc. (Gecko), a fraudulent telephone-marketing business. Defendant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that the district court improperly instructed the jury on co-schemer liability. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-17\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to allow a rational fact-finder to determine that Defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, </em>228 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.2000) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-18\">There was evidence that Defendant made extensive misrepresentations to victims regarding Gecko, including that a non-existent Gecko manager had been involved in a successful Internet IPO; that he himself had been involved in that previous IPO; that his own father had invested funds in Gecko; that Goldman Sachs was interested in Gecko; and that Gecko was likely to go public at $8 or $9 a share. Also, Defendant received commission on fraudulent sales made under the name \u201cBob Johnson\u201d and that he successfully defrauded other victims under the name \u201cMike Egan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b972-19\">We also reject Defendant\u2019s arguments concerning the co-schemer liability instruction for the reasons stated in <em>United States v. Stapleton, </em>293 F.3d 1111, filed this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b972-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
