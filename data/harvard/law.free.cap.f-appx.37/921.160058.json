We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">We agree with Ayers that the district court erred when it refused to allow a half-day continuance so that Ayers\u2019 mental health expert could testify. <em>See United States v. Zamora-Hemandez, </em>222 F.3d 1046, 1049 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1200, 121 S.Ct. 1208, 149 L.Ed.2d 122 (2001); <em>United States v. Flynt, </em>756 F.2d 1352, 1358-59 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>764 F.2d 675 (9th Cir.1985); <em>see also Smith v. Ford Motor Co., </em>215 F.3d 713, 722 (7th Cir.2000). It also erred when it excluded all testimony from witnesses who had seen Ayers\u2019 behavior at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles in the weeks following the offense. <em>See United States v. Ives, </em>609 F.2d 930, 932-33 (9th Cir.1979). Moreover, it erred when it answered a jury question by stating that there was no evidence of Ayers\u2019 mental capacity for the jury to consider. In fact, his behavior at and after the offense could be considered. <em>See United States v. McIver, </em>186 F.3d 1119, 1130 (9th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Hartfield, </em>513 F.2d 254, 260 (9th Cir.1975) <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Sneezer, </em>900 F.2d 177 (9th Cir.1990). The concatenation of all of these errors deprived Ayers of his only defense \u2014 lack of mental capacity to form the specific intent required for conviction of the offense in question. Thus, reversal of his conviction is required.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Thomas v. Hubbard, </em>273 F.3d 1164, 1179-80 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v.
