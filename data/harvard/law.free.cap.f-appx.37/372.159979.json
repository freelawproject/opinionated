We deny a COA and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">On March 12, 1997, Woodruff was convicted in Wyoming state court of first degree sexual assault and attempted first degree sexual assault. He does not appear to have appealed those convictions. On June 15, 2000, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus based on the premise that he \u201cis presently denied his right to access the court,\u201d and that he \u201chas this right pursuant to Wyoming Constitution Art. 158 and the 14th and 5th amendment due process clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d (R. Doc. 1 at 1.) The district court dismissed the petition, reasoning that it was untimely because it was filed more than a year after his convictions became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, prisoners challenging the validity of their convictions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 generally have one year from the date on which their convictions become final to petition for federal habeas corpus relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). A conviction becomes final \u201cby the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, prisoners may file a habeas petition one year from \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">In dismissing the petition as time-barred, the district court applied the period of limitation set forth in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A), without giving consideration to the alternate period set forth in \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). It seems to us that the latter is a better fit. Woodruff seeks relief, not the on the basis of errors in his prosecution, but on the ground that his indigent status prevents him from meaningful access to the courts (e.g., he claims to be unable to pay filing fees and is prevented from making photocopies and using a typewriter). In addition, he takes issue with the actions of several courts\u2014 from the Wyoming district court to the United States Supreme Court \u2014 in a civil case where \u2018Woodruff claimed he wishe[d] to challenge his conviction on grounds he was refused counsel at trial and to challenge the conditions of confinement.\u201d (R. Doc. 1 at 2.) In one of his objections, Woodruff clarifies that his \u201chabeas corpus petition isn\u2019t challenging trial or sentencing errors of the court who convicted him.\u201d (R. Doc. 7 at 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">Nevertheless, we decline to issue a COA because the substantive claims for which Woodruff seeks habeas relief \u2014 i.e., early release \u2014 are not cognizable under the federal habeas corpus statutes. Under our precedent, \u201ccondition of confinement\u201d suits by state inmates are civil rights suits properly brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See McIntosh v. United States Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 811-12 (10th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s application for a COA is therefore DENIED, and this matter is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-8\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir.
