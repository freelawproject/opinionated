The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> departed upward, finding that Gareia-Zuniga\u2019s criminal history was underrepresented, and sentenced him to 68 months imprisonment and 2 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief arguing that the district court erred in departing upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-21\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by departing upward. <em>See United States v. Levi, </em>229 F.3d 677, 679 (8th Cir.2000). It properly considered Garcia-Zuniga\u2019s past charged and uncharged conduct, as outlined in the unobjected-to presentence report. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3; <em>Levi </em>229 F.3d at 679; <em>United States v. Beatty, </em>9 F.3d 686, 690 (8th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Davila, </em>964 F.2d 778, 784-85 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 964, 113 S.Ct. 438, 121 L.Ed.2d 358 (1992). Further, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-22\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-19\">.
