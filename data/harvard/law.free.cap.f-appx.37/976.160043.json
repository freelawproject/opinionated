We deny Shoemake\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-19\">On April 7, 1994, Shoemake pled guilty to two counts of unlawful delivery of amphetamine within one-thousand feet of a school. He received two five-year deferred sentences, but on September 15, 1995, the deferred sentences were accelerated due to a parole violation. Shoemake did not seek to withdraw his plea or appeal to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, so his conviction became final ten days after his sentencing at the acceleration hearing. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. tit. 22, Ch. 18, App., Rule 4.1 (1986) (current version at Rule 4.2). His conviction thus became final on September 25, 1995. Shoemake did not file an application for post-conviction relief in state court until April 28, 2000. The application was denied, and that decision was affirmed on appeal on August 8, 2000. Shoemake filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on April 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-22\">This Court may issue a COA only if an applicant \u201chas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Meeting this standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>issues presented were \u2018adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u2019 \u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 478, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quoting <em>Barefoot v. Estelle, </em>468 U.S. 880, 893 n. 4, 103 S.Ct. 3383, 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983)). We review the legal conclusions of a district court in a habeas proceeding de novo. <em>Martin v. Kaiser, </em>907 F.2d 931, 933 (10th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-5\">Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), a state prisoner generally has one year from the date his conviction becomes final to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) (\u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d). Because Shoemake\u2019s conviction became final before April 24, 1996 \u2014 the effective date of AEDPA \u2014 he had until April 23, 1997, to file his habeas petition. <em>See Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 977 (10th Cir.1998). Although the AEDPA period of limitation is tolled during the time in which a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), Shoe-make\u2019s state post-conviction actions cannot toll the period of limitation because they were filed well after the April 23, 1997 date on which his habeas petition was due.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">The district court correctly determined that Shoemake\u2019s habeas petition was time-barred. Shoemake\u2019s application for a COA is DENIED. His motion to proceed in forma pauperis is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-16\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
