Having carefully reviewed the record, <em>see Ferrari v. Teachers Ins. &amp; Annuity Ass\u2019n, </em>278 F.3d 801, 805, 807 (8th Cir.2002) (standard of review), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-17\">After being on medical leave from her nursing job since September 1999, Gerdes applied for long-term disability benefits under her ERISA plan (Plan) in January 2000 based on carpal tunnel syndrome and osteoarthritis of her knee. The Plan provided that an individual is disabled when UNUM determines she is \u201climited from performing the material substantial duties of [her] regular occupation\u201d and has \u201ca 20% or more loss in [her] indexed monthly earnings\u201d because of her sickness or injury; \u201cregular occupation\u201d is the job the claimant was \u201croutinely performing\u201d when she became disabled. Gerdes submitted general statements from two treating physicians, Drs. Judy Ash and Joseph Yao; the doctors also completed functional-capacity checklists. Based on the functional-capacity findings, vocational rehabilitation specialist Kelli Hicks identified several sedentary nursing jobs that Gerdes could perform. UNUM Provident Corporation (UNUM) denied her application and subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">Initially, we reject Gerdes\u2019s argument that the District Court should have applied a less-deferential standard of review, <em>see Ferrari, </em>278 F.3d at 806 (applying abuse-of-discretion standard of review when no material and probative evidence presented that plan administrator had conflict of interest or committed procedural errors that caused serious breach of duty to applicant). Gerdes points to UNUM\u2019s use of in-house medical consultants to review her claim, but this is of no consequence because UNUM\u2019s finding that Gerdes was capable of performing sedentary work not requiring repetitive hand use was essentially consistent with the limitations noted by Drs. Ash and Yao; thus, contrary to Gerdes\u2019s contention, an independent medical examination was not required. <em>Compare Layes v. Mead Corp., </em>132 F.3d 1246, 1251 (8th Cir.1998) (rejecting need for independent medical examination where applicant\u2019s medical evidence facially insufficient to support finding of disability), <em>with Woo v. Deluxe Corp., </em>144 F.3d 1157, 1161 (1998) (holding that administrator erred in refusing independent medical examination where treating physician determined applicant was disabled and where there was evidence of an uncommon disease).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>As to the decision itself, we reject Gerdes\u2019s argument that substantial evidence did not support UNUM\u2019s finding as to her ability to perform sedentary work. Specifically, the functional-capacity assessments of Drs. Ash and Yao, and the findings of one of the medical reviewers, provide the requisite substantial evidence. <em>See Donaho v. FMC Corp., </em>74 F.3d 894, 900 (8th Cir.1996). We also reject Gerdes\u2019s challenge to the vocational analysis, given her failure to submit to UNUM any evidence to counter the opinion of vocational rehabilitation specialist Hicks about nursing jobs Gerdes could perform within her limitations. <em>See Layes, </em>132 F.3d at 1251 (considering, under abuse-of-discretion standard, only evidence before plan administrator when claim was denied). Finally, we note Gerdes\u2019s state-law claims are preempted by ERISA. <em>See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 56-57, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-18\">. The Honorable Stephen M.
