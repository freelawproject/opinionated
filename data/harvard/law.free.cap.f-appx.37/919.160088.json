Villamar appeals from the district court\u2019s order, which affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissal of her adversary complaint for failure to state a claim under Bankruptcy Rule 7012(b) and award of sanctions. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-10\">I. Issue Preclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-11\">Villamar is precluded from relitigating the issue of whether the lien was discharged in bankruptcy. The doctrine of issue preclusion prevents relitigation of all \u201cissues of fact or law that were actually litigated and necessarily decided\u201d in a pri- or proceeding. <em>Segal v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>606 F.2d 842, 845 (9th Cir.1979). Issue preclusion applies if: (1) Villamar was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the same issue in the prior action; (2) the issue was actually litigated and decided against Villamar in a final decision; and (3) the issue was necessary to support the judgment. <em>Clark v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co., </em>966 F.2d 1318, 1320 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Robi v. Five Platters, Inc., </em>838 F.2d 318, 322 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-14\">Here, each of the requisites for issue preclusion are met. Villamar brought a motion that directly put at issue whether Hersh\u2019s lien was a judicial hen or a nonavoidable security interest. The bankruptcy court considered \u201cwhether the lien of [Hersh] is a judicial lien or a security interest,\u201d and concluded that the lien was, in fact, a consensual security interest. It also determined that Hersh\u2019s lien was nonavoidable, and denied Villamar\u2019s motion. Villamar did not seek reconsideration before the bankruptcy court or appeal from its decision that Hersh had a consensual and binding security interest in her home. Issue preclusion was available, and neither the bankruptcy court nor the district abused its discretion in applying the doctrine. <em>Miller v. County of Santa Cruz, </em>39 F.3d 1030, 1032 (9th Cir.1994) (Whether issue preclusion is available is reviewed de novo, the application of issue preclusion is left to the district court\u2019s discretion.).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-15\">II. Post-discharge Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">Villamar also argues that Hersh has violated the bankruptcy discharge by attempting to renew his lien through state court procedures. However, because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>bankruptcy court found that the lien was not discharged by the bankruptcy, it follows that Hersh is free to maintain actions <em>in rem </em>in furtherance of the lien. The bankruptcy discharge, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a), \u201coperates as an injunction against ... the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover, or offset any [discharged] debt as a personal liability of the debtor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim \u2014 namely, an action against the debtor <em>in person-am </em>\u2014 while leaving intact another \u2014 namely, an action against the debtor <em>in rem.\u201d Johnson v. Home State </em>Bank, 501 U.S. 78, 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150, 115 L.Ed.2d 66 (1991). \u201c[A] discharge in bankruptcy prevents the [creditor] from taking any action to collect the debt as a personal liability of the debt- or .... however, [the debtors\u2019] property remains hable for a debt secured by a valid lien.\u201d <em>In re Isom, </em>901 F.2d 744, 745 (9th Cir.1990) (citations omitted). Because Hersh\u2019s post-discharge conduct in attempting to renew his hen through state court procedures constituted <em>in rem </em>actions, Hersh did not violate the bankruptcy discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">III. Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">Nor did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion by imposing sanctions for the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with bringing the motion to dismiss and presenting the sanctions motion, <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., </em>496 U.S. 384, 405, 110 S.Ct. 2447, 110 L.Ed.2d 359 (1990), as the district court correctly found. The purpose of Bankruptcy Rule 9011, which mirrors Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, is \u201cto deter baseless filings in district court[s].\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell, </em>496 U.S. at 393, 110 S.Ct. 2447; <em>In re Grantham Bros., </em>922 F.2d 1438, 1441 (9th Cir.1991). An argument contained in a motion is baseless or frivolous under Rule 9011 if it is unreasonable when viewed from the perspective of a competent attorney admitted to practice before the district court. <em>U.S. v. Stringfellow, </em>911 F.2d 225, 226 (9th Cir.1990). Villamar\u2019s argument was both precluded by the bankruptcy court\u2019s prior determination and foreclosed, as stated by the district court, by a \u201cfundamental principle of bankruptcy law, uniformly applied for more than one hundred years ... that consensual hens ... pass through bankruptcy unaffected by the discharge.\u201d <em>Long v. Bullard, </em>117 U.S. 617, 6 S.Ct. 917, 29 L.Ed. 1004 (1886) (\u201c[T]he discharge of [debtor] in bankruptcy did not release the hen of the mortgage.\u201d). There was no reasonable basis in law or fact for the adversary complaint. As the bankruptcy court correctly explained to Villamar\u2019s attorney \u2014 even as Villamar continued to maintain her position \u2014 the argument was both precluded and foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b968-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
