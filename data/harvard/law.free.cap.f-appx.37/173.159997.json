The parties have waived oral argument, and the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The Commissioner determined that Rudd had been disabled since April 14, 1992, primarily due to acute viremia and degenerative disc disease. That decision is not directly at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In 1996, Rudd was notified that his benefits had been overpaid. He challenged this calculation, and an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) determined that his benefits were properly offset by $20,371, due to retroactive worker\u2019s compensation benefits that he had received. This opinion became the final decision of the Commissioner on February 25, 2000, when the appeals council declined further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Rudd filed a timely complaint in the federal court. The district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over his objections, and dismissed the case on April 4, 2001. It is from this judgment that he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Rudd\u2019s current argument involves an issue of pure statutory interpretation. Thus, we must determine whether the Commissioner employed the proper legal standards in offsetting his disability benefits. <em>See Garcia v. Secretary of Health and Human Servs., </em>46 F.3d 552, 555 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">In particular, Rudd argues that the Commissioner misinterpreted 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a), which provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">If for any month prior to the month in which an individual attains the age of 65\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">(1) such individual is entitled to benefits under section 423 of this title, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">(2) such individual is <em>entitled for such month </em>to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">(A) periodic benefits on account of his or her total or partial disability (whether or not permanent) under a workmen\u2019s compensation law or plan of the United States or a State ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiL\">the total of his benefits under section 423 of this title for such month and of any benefits under section 402 of this title for such month based on his wages and self-employment income shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the sum of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\">(3) such total of benefits under sections 423 and 402 of this title for such month, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-15\">(4) such <em>periodic benefits payable (and actually paid) for such month </em>to such individual under such laws or plans, exceeds the higher of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-16\">(5) 80 per centum of his \u201caverage current earnings\u201d, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-17\">(6) the total of such individual\u2019s disability insurance benefits under section 423 of this title for such month and of any monthly insurance benefits under section 402 of this title for such month based on his wages and self-employment income, prior to reduction under this section ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">Rudd primarily argues that an offset was not authorized under \u00a7 424a(a)(4) for the months prior to August 5, 1996, because he was not \u201centitled to\u201d or \u201cactually paid\u201d worker\u2019s compensation until that time. However, there is nothing in the disputed statute which limits the offset to worker\u2019s compensation benefits that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>actually paid <em>during </em>any particular month. Instead, the statute merely requires that the claimant be paid these types of benefits <em>\u201cfor </em>such month.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 424a(a)(4) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Rudd has now been \u201cactually paid\u201d $61,606.75 in retroactive worker\u2019s compensation benefits for the months prior to August 5, 1996. It is clear that he was also \u201centitled to\u201d worker\u2019s compensation for those months. Thus, the Commissioner employed the proper legal standard when he applied a \u00a7 404a(a) offset in Rudd\u2019s case, as the offset was consistent with the plain language of the statute. <em>See Shabazz v. Bowen, </em>912 F.2d 532, 533 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Rudd now argues that his interpretation of the statute is consistent with the underlying legislative policy of preventing overlapping payments as well as the administrative regulations that implement the offset provision. We need not reach these arguments because the proper application of \u00a7 424a(a) is clear from the plain language of the statute. <em>See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Garcia, </em>46 F.3d at 555-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
