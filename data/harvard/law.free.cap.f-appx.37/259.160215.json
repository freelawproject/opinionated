Klontz claims the court erred in ruling that he was ineligible to apply for relief from removal, and that the immigration judge and district court both denied him due process. We affirm the district court and hold that Klontz was not denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>A. <em>Eligibility to Apply for Relief from Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Klontz relies on <em>INS v. St. </em>Cyr<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in arguing that he is still eligible to apply for relief from removal because he was eligible to do so at the time he pled guilty. As an initial matter, we reject the Government\u2019s argument that Klontz should exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking relief in federal court. Prudential exhaustion is not necessary in this situation because resolution of the issue requires no agency expertise and is not a matter of agency discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, the issue at hand is a legal question that does not require the agency to develop the factual record.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Klontz did not need to raise this claim to the administrative agency before presenting it in federal court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Klontz cannot rely on <em>St. Cyr </em>to claim eligibility to apply for relief from removal because he was not eligible to apply for such relief at the time he pled guilty. At the time Klontz pled guilty, Congress had already enacted the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> AEDPA precluded eligibility to apply for relief from removal for aliens who had been convicted of at least two crimes of moral turpitude if the alien had committed those crimes within five years after entry and if the court could impose sentences of at least one year imprisonment for each crime.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Later that year, after Klontz\u2019s guilty plea, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Within that Act, Congress eliminated the requirement that the alien must have committed the crimes of moral turpitude within five years of entry and made that particular provision retroactive to the date of AEDPA\u2019s enactment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, because Klontz pled guilty to two crimes of moral turpitude, for each of which he could have been sentenced to more than one year imprisonment, he was ineligible to apply for relief from removal at the time he pled guilty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Klontz is currently ineligible to apply for relief from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>removal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">B. <em>Due Process Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Klontz claims that he did not receive due process because the immigration judge and district judge did not conduct evidentiary hearings before depriving him of a liberty interest. Klontz\u2019s claim fails because he had sufficient hearings before both judges. The immigration judge and district judge each allowed Klontz an opportunity to submit evidence and to argue his claims. In addition, Klontz did not object to either hearing at the time. The fact that Klontz had no evidence to present does not negate the sufficiency of the proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Klontz\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b308-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">. 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\">. <em>McKart v.
