On appeal, Lewis challenges the district court\u2019s sentencing findings and asserts that the Government withheld evidence and that there are errors in the presentence report. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-24\">The district court\u2019s application of sentencing guidelines is reviewed for clear error as to factual determinations; legal questions are subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Blake, </em>81 F.3d 498, 503 (4th Cir.1996). Lewis contends that the wrong sentencing guideline was selected to determine his sentence. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that a violation of the omnibus section of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7212(a) that does not involve the use of force or a weapon is sentenced in accordance with U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2T1.1 (2000), with reference to the tax table under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T4.1. Accordingly, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-25\">Lewis further asserts that the district court\u2019s calculation of his tax loss was erroneous. The district court\u2019s factual deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>mination of the tax loss is reviewed for clear error. <em>Blake, </em>81 F.3d at 503. The district court\u2019s finding was supported by the testimony of Agent Chardoes of the Internal Revenue Service, who was involved in the audit of Lewis\u2019s tax returns, and Lewis has failed to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s reliance on this testimony was clearly erroneous. Thus, we reject Lewis\u2019s challenge to the computation of his tax loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">In Lewis\u2019s pro se brief, he contends in a conclusory manner that there may be new evidence that was not revealed by the Government and that there were errors in the presentence report. These claims are unsupported by Lewis\u2019s pro se brief, counsel\u2019s brief, or the record. Thus, we find these issues meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Lewis\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the chent requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because, despite the fact that the facts and legal contentions are inadequately presented in the materials before the court, argument wifi not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
