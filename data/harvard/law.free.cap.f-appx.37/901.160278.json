Parks argues that overtime must be compensated at time and a half, under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(a)(1). Locating asserts its system satisfies the \u201cFluctuating Workweek\u201d requirements of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114, such that its payment of a straight hourly wage for overtime is simply a generous overtime premium under that system. Because \u201call the facts indicate that an employee is being paid for his overtime hours at a rate no greater than that which he receives for nonovertime hours,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114(c), we reverse and remand with a direction to enter summary judgment in the employees\u2019 favor on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">The undisputed evidence indicates that Locating\u2019s employees were paid a straight hourly wage, not a fixed salary covering all hours worked. Locating\u2019s attempts to re-characterize the scheme as one that satisfied the Fluctuating Workweek are unavailing. An agreement to compensate a minimum of forty hours is not the same as an agreement to pay a fixed salary for all hours worked, nor can extra overtime payments cure a basic failure to meet the requirements of \u00a7 778.114. <em>Brennan v. Valley Towing Co., </em>515 F.2d 100, 103, 106 (9th Cir.1975). Also, any agreement to pay a fixed salary for all hours worked requires a \u201cclear mutual understanding of the parties,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 778.114(a), not present here. As in <em>Brennan, </em>\u2018While appellees\u2019 position is imaginative, it ignores the established principle that the \u2018regular rate\u2019 is not a hypothetical construction but an \u2018actual fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105 (quoting <em>149 Madison Ave. Corp. v. Asselta, </em>331 U.S. 199, 204, 67 S.Ct. 1178, 91 L.Ed. 1432 (1947)).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">Further, as Locating apparently admits, compensatory time off is not an alternative to adequate overtime pay. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207(o)(l). Thus, Parks is also entitled to prevail in challenging the use of compensatory time off in lieu of overtime for the emergency locating work.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-20\">REVERSED and REMANDED for entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>TROTT, Circuit Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">For the reasons given by Judge Zilly, I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b949-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
