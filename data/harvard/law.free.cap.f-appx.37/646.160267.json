The district court\u2019s final judgment was entered on the docket on September 25, 2001. Robinson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on January 9, 2002. Because Robinson failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
