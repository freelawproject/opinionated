We review for an abuse of discretion an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). <em>Gracie v. Gracie, </em>217 F.3d 1060, 1071-72 (9th Cir.2000). Findings of fact underlying an award of attorneys\u2019 fees are reviewed for clear error. <em>Smith v. Jackson, </em>84 F.3d 1213, 1221 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-23\">Pursuant to the Lanham Act, attorneys\u2019 fees may be granted to the prevailing party in \u201cexceptional cases\u201d of trademark infringement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a). The Lanham Act does not define the term \u201cexceptional,\u201d but we have awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in infringement cases where the infringement was \u201cmalicious, fraudulent, deliberate, or willful.\u201d <em>Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Baccarat Clothing Co., </em>692 F.2d 1272, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>1276 (9th Cir.1982). Here, the district court expressly found this an \u201cexceptional case\u201d of trademark infringement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-4\">[T]he evidence confirms that the defendant acted <em>deliberately </em>to and <em>intended to harm </em>the plaintiff by using its mark. The evidence in this case is especially egregious because not only did the defendant incorporate its organization under the plaintiffs trademark and continue to use the mark after notice of violation, but the defendant <em>harassed </em>the plaintiff by sending letters to the plaintiffs members and appearing at naturopathic conferences and other venues using the plaintiffs trademark. Therefore this court finds that there are exceptional circumstances ... warranting reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment; this was an exceptional case of infringement permitting the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. Undoubtedly, the Infringer knew of National AANP and its use of the AANP and AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF NATUROPATHIC PHYSICIANS trademarks, but nonetheless, incorporated itself under that name when National AANP\u2019s corporate license in Oregon inadvertently lapsed. The Infringer conducted a self-congratulatory campaign touting its takeover of the \u201cAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians\u201d corporate name. On letterhead purportedly from the \u201cAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians,\u201d the Infringer mailed to many naturopaths a solicitation describing the formation of a \u201cnew, more responsible association.\u201d That solicitation included an invitation to the \u201cannual convention at the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas.\u201d The Infringer also began lobbying state legislatures using the corporate name, the \u201cAmerican Association of Naturopathic Physicians.\u201d This evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that the Infringer deliberately and maliciously infringed National AANP\u2019s trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">It was not clear error for the district court to conclude the Infringer, rather than a rogue band of miscreants, deliberately and maliciously infringed National AANP\u2019s trademarks. Accordingly, we affirm the award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">We further conclude that this appeal is wholly without merit and therefore award National AANP its reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. Costs shall be taxed to the Infringer pursuant to Circuit Rule 39(a)(2). This matter is referred to the Appellate Commissioner to determine the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees to be awarded and to calculate the appropriate amount of post-judgment interest due to the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED to the Appellate Commissioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b941-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
