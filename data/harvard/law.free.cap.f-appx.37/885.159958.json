We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Zapata contends that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a special condition of supervised release forbidding his association with gang members. The government responds that Zapata waived his right to appeal his sentence pursuant to a written plea agreement. We agree with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Zapata\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal must be enforced since (1) his sentence was well below the maximum agreed upon under the written plea agreement; and (2) he does not challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of his guilty plea or waiver of appeal. <em>See United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.)(enforeing a defendant\u2019s waiver of appeal since (1) the waiver intended to encompass the issue raised; and (2) the defendant waived the issue whether the waiver was knowingly and voluntary), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 272, 151 L.Ed.2d 199 (2001); <em>see also United States v. Bolinger, </em>940 F.2d 478, 480 (9th Cir.1991) (enforcing a defendant\u2019s appeal waiver since the defendant was sentenced below the maximum sentence provided for in the written plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b933-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
