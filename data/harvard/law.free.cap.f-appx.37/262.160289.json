Granite conditionally cross-appeals the dismissal of its claim for punitive damages. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. We thus dismiss Granite\u2019s cross-appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">Because the facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties, we restate them only as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-16\">1. <em>Endorsement No. 5</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-17\">The first issue is whether the trial court correctly determined as a matter of law, for purposes of Granite\u2019s bad faith claim, that Endorsement No. 5 was ambiguous and created a duty for Aetna to defend Granite in the underlying \u201cSmoke Tree litigation\u201d <em>(\u201cSmoke Tree\u201d).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Our answer is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-18\">The court reviews grants of summary judgment de novo. <em>Clicks Billiards, Inc. v. Sixshooters, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 1252, 1257 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cThe meaning and interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>HS </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number><em>Servs., Inc. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>109 F.3d 642, 644 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">There are two distinct but related ways to trigger a duty to defend. \u201cAn insurer has a duty to defend when the policy is ambiguous and the insured would reasonably expect the insurer to defend him or her against the suit based on the nature and kind of risk covered by the policy, <em>or </em>when the underlying suit potentially seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>18 Cal.4th 857, 77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265, 273 (Cal.1998) (emphasis added); <em>see also Montrose Chem. Carp, of Cal. v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153, 1160 (Cal.1993). The district court correctly granted Granite\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment regarding Endorsement No. 5 under the first test.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The endorsement is ambiguous. The ambiguity was not susceptible of resolution after \u201cinterpreting the ambiguous provisions in the sense the promisor (i.e., the insurer) believed the promisee understood them at the time of formation.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Robert S., </em>26 Cal.4th 758, 110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889, 893 (Cal.2001) (citation omitted). The issue remained disputed after the district court considered extrinsic evidence of intent. The ambiguity was therefore correctly resolved against Aetna and in favor of coverage. <em>See id.; see also Smith Kandal Real Estate v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>67 Cal.App.4th 406, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 52, 56 (Ct.App.1998) (\u201cIf an exclusion ambiguously lends itself to two or more reasonable constructions, the ambiguity will be resolved against the insurer and in favor of coverage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">A trial on the meaning of Endorsement No. 5 was not required because the dispute of fact was not material. The question at summary judgment was whether Endorsement No. 5 was ambiguous so as to have triggered a duty to defend. That is, even given a dispute of fact about the ultimate meaning of Endorsement No. 5, there was no dispute that the language was ambiguous. The very fact that there was an ambiguity regarding coverage (construed in favor of Granite) triggered Aetna\u2019s duties. The ultimate question for trial was whether Aetna had acted in bad faith by failing to defend previously. The court determined only that Aetna should have defended; it left for a jury the question whether the failure to defend was in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">Likewise, because the insurer\u2019s duties were established, the district court properly determined that its ruling (that <em>Smoke Tree </em>was not excluded) had answered the reimbursement question. <em>See AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>51 Cal.3d 807, 274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253, 1264 (Cal. 1990) (In Bank); <em>see also Consol. Am. Ins. Co. v. Mike Soper Marine Servs., </em>951 F.2d 186, 188 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201c[I]n order to protect the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage in a situation where the insurer controls the language of the policy, if possible, the contract is construed in accordance with its objective of providing <em>indemnity for losses </em>to which the insurance relates.\u201d) (citing <em>Reserve Ins. Co. v. Pisciotta, </em>30 Cal.3d 800, 180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764, 768 (Cal.1982)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">2. <em>Summary Adjudication of Aetna\u2019s Prior Coverage Defenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Aetna argues that the trial court violated California\u2019s \u201clitigation privilege,\u201d set forth in Cal. Civ.Code. \u00a7 47(b), by considering Aetna\u2019s pleadings as evidence of bad faith when it granted Granite\u2019s motion for summary adjudication regarding Aetna\u2019s prior coverage defenses in the \u201cMeadow Brook litigation\u201d <em>(\u201cMeadow Brook\u201d). See Cal. Physicians\u2019 Serv. v. Superior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number><em>Court, </em>9 Cal.App.4th 1321, 12 Cal.Rptr.2d 95, 97-98 $ n. 4 (Ct.App.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The court reviews grants of \u201csummary adjudication\u201d motions de novo. <em>Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery, </em>150 F.3d 1042, 1046 (9th Cir.1998) (reviewing a partial summary judgment motion adjudicating liability).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">We reject Aetna\u2019s arguments. Even if the district court did consider some pleadings, they were not the sole basis for Granite\u2019s bad faith claim. The facts that Granite sought to establish \u2014 -(1) Aetna had previously lost in <em>Meadow Brook </em>the \u201cside agreement\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d arguments, and (2) Aetna later reasserted the arguments against Granite \u2014 could easily be gleaned almost entirely from the denial letters themselves.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The denial letters, along with the ADR opinion deciding the appeal in <em>Meadow Brook, </em>which the district court also considered, contained all the necessary information. The district court did not even need to consider Aetna\u2019s pleadings. Furthermore, Granite\u2019s bad faith theory was also heavily based upon an allegedly inadequate and biased investigation, separate from Aetna\u2019s reassertion of the judicially-discredited defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Moreover, the pleadings became relevant to Granite\u2019s bad faith claim to the extent Aetna claimed it did not rely on the judicially-rejected defenses in declining coverage. The district court thus did not err in allowing pleadings as impeachment evidence. <em>See Oren Royal Oaks Venture v. Greenberg, Bernhard, Weiss &amp; Karma, Inc., </em>42 Cal.3d 1157, 232 Cal.Rptr. 567, 728 P.2d 1202, 1208 (Cal.1986) (\u201cIt is quite clear that section [47(b)(2) ] has never been thought to bar the <em>evidentiary </em>use of every \u2018statement or publication\u2019 made in the course of a judicial proceeding.... [Wjhile section [47(b)(2) ] bars certain tort causes of action which are predicated on a judicial statement or publication itself, the section does not create an evidentiary privilege for such statements.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Likewise, we reject Aetna\u2019s argument regarding footnote 2a in the ADR appellate panel\u2019s opinion in <em>Meadow Brook. </em>Granite did not use the ADR panel\u2019s opinion to give automatic preclusive effect in <em>Smoke Tree. </em>Rather, Granite\u2019s argument was that Aetna forced it to re-litigate the coverage issues even though other jurists had twice ruled against Aetna. The jury was allowed to consider Aetna\u2019s argument that footnote 2a made it reasonable for it to deny coverage in <em>Smoke Tree, </em>but the jury rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">3. <em>Bad Faith</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">Aetna attacks several jury instructions on bad faith. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s formulation of civil jury instructions for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Guebara v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>237 F.3d 987, 992 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cWhen the alleged error is in the formulation of the instructions, the instructions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>are to be considered as a whole and an abuse of discretion standard is applied to determine if they are misleading or inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A district court has broad discretion in tailoring jury instructions so long as the instructions fairly and adequately cover the issues presented, correctly state the law, and are not misleading. <em>Kendalls-Jackson Winery, </em>150 F.3d at 1051.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in giving an instruction stating that \u201c[i]n the insurance context, ambiguities in the language of policies are generally resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d The instruction is a correct statement of California law. <em>See, e.g., Safeco, </em>110 Cal. Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d at 893. It was relevant to Granite\u2019s bad faith theory, which argued in part that Aetna ignored this general legal principle in denying coverage. The context was also clear; the instruction was given after explaining other ambiguity principles \u2014 which Aetna had proposed \u2014 applicable to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion in failing to give the other bad faith instructions proffered by Aetna. These instructions were superfluous. The bad faith instructions that the court did give adequately stated Aetna\u2019s theory that it acted reasonably in denying coverage based upon an ambiguous provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Aetna also claims there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. We must uphold a jury\u2019s verdict if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist., </em>251 F.3d 1222, 1227 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cSubstantial evidence is evidence adequate to support the jury\u2019s conclusion, even it if is possible to draw a contrary conclusion from the same evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence are jury issues and generally are not subject to appellate review. <em>Three Boys Music Corp. v. Bolton, </em>212 F.3d 477, 482 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">Ample evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Aetna\u2019s failure to defend was unreasonable. <em>See Gruenberg v. Aetna Ins. Co., </em>9 Cal.3d 566, 108 Cal.Rptr. 480, 510 P.2d 1032, 1036 (Cal.1973) (In Bank). Granite\u2019s theory was that Aetna\u2019s investigation was tailored toward denying the <em>Smoke Tree </em>claim, rather than toward determining whether Aetna should defend. Granite had evidence that Aetna did not investigate the effect the sale of Smoke Tree had on Endorsement No. 5, failed to contact Granite to seek to understand Granite\u2019s position on the exclusion, and conducted no independent review of the underwriting files. <em>See, e.g., Egan v. Mut. of Omaha Ins. Co., </em>24 Cal.3d 809, 169 Cal.Rptr. 691, 620 P.2d 141, 145 (Cal.1979) (In Bank). Granite also had evidence that Aetna\u2019s claims adjuster violated internal Aetna procedures for denying claims by denying the claim without the involvement of the local manager, the Aetna legal department, or the home office. The declination letter apparently was not signed, reviewed, or approved by the adjuster\u2019s manager. The adjuster also apparently did not sufficiently document her handling or evaluation of the claim. Although Aetna contended that she acted in accordance with Aetna\u2019s policies, this presented a factual issue for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Further, Granite had evidence that Aetna ignored well-settled principles of insurance law, such as construing ambiguities in favor of coverage and construing exclusions narrowly. Given that Endorsement No. 5 was ambiguous (and Granite\u2019s argument that there was no genuine dispute about it), then certainly there was a possibility it would be construed in favor of coverage triggering at least a duty to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>fend. This is evidence of an unreasonable denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">4. <em>The \u201cGenuine Dispute\u201d Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Next, Aetna invokes the \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d doctrine and contends that it cannot be liable for bad faith as a matter of law because it relied upon an ambiguous policy provision. <em>See, e.g., Guebara, </em>237 F.3d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">The \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d doctrine does not insulate Aetna here for several reasons. First, even given the dispute about Endorsement No. 5, the ultimate question was whether the failure to defend was unreasonable under all the circumstances. Granite pointed to other factors besides the Endorsement No. 5 ambiguity to indicate an unreasonable denial. (And the trial court essentially found that there was <em>no </em>\u201cgenuine dispute\u201d about coverage.) Granite\u2019s theory was that if Aetna had properly investigated, it would have realized (or should have realized) that there was an obvious ambiguity that triggered at least a duty to defend under a reservation of rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Second, Granite\u2019s position was not based solely upon the \u201cunreasonableness\u201d of Aetna\u2019s reading of Endorsement No. 5. Rather, its position was that Aetna was liable for bad faith for, among other reasons, raising judicially rejected defenses (the \u201cside agreement\u201d and the \u201cpremium\u201d arguments). Even if there were a \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d regarding Endorsement No. 5, there was no \u201cgenuine dispute\u201d regarding the \u201cside agreement\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d arguments after the superior court\u2019s decision in <em>Meadow Brook </em>and especially after the ADR appellate opinion. And, as stated earlier, Aetna\u2019s reliance on footnote 2a of the opinion at least raised a jury question.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">5. <em>Attorney\u2019s Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">Aetna posits that <em>Brandt v. Superior Court, </em>37 Cal.3d 813, 210 Cal.Rptr. 211, 693 P.2d 796 (Cal.1985) (In Bank), entitled Granite only to fees incurred in obtaining coverage under the \u201cwrap up\u201d policies. Aetna contends that fees incurred in pursuing coverage under the \u201cbank\u201d and \u201cmulti-family\u201d policies would not be recoverable because Granite never established that it was entitled to benefits under those other types of policies. Aetna had offered instructions limiting <em>Brandt </em>fees to the \u201cwrap up\u201d policies only.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">It is true that Granite established a right to coverage only under the \u201cwrap up\u201d policies (the court found no coverage under the bank policies and Granite dropped its claim under the multi-family policies). Nevertheless, when Granite began this litigation, it was an insured under 12 separate Aetna CGL policies (4 of which were \u201cwrap up\u201d policies) in the three different categories. Granite had tendered the defense under all 12 policies. It had a good faith basis for coverage under all three types. It had no way of knowing which would succeed. Under <em>Brandt, </em>all fees incurred in pursuing all three types were \u201cproximately [caused by] the insurer\u2019s bad faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800 (internal quotation marks omitted). All those fees \u201cwould not have been incurred but for the insurer\u2019s tortious conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">The law given to the jury was not wrong. Aetna has cited no authority requiring the court or jury to allocate fees between policies if recovery was ultimately based only on one type of policy. The court\u2019s instructions as given enabled Aetna to argue its allocation theory to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Appeal No. 00-16589 is AFFIRMED. Appeal No. 00-16680 is DISMISSED as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>moot.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-19\">. When the district court determined that Aetna had a duty to defend, there no longer was a suit to defend against because <em>Smoke Tree </em>settled in March of 1997. The question is whether Aetna's <em>prior </em>failures to defend were wrong and ultimately in bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. We need not reach whether Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(d) is a proper vehicle to adjudicate specific facts because, even assuming arguendo that there was error, it was harmless. Other procedural means, such as a motion specifically under Rules 56(a), (b), or (c); a pretrial motion in limine; Fed.R.Civ.P. 16; or a general motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(a), would have allowed such \"partial summary adjudication.\u201d <em>Cf. Robi v. Five Platters, Inc., </em>918 F.2d 1439, 1441 (9th Cir.1990) (authorizing a partial summary judgment motion under Rule 56(c) as a method of establishing collateral estoppel or res judicata, even if such a ruling would not necessarily dispose of an entire claim). At this point, after trial, it would be pointless to remand to re-adjudicate the same question under a different rule.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b314-14\">.
