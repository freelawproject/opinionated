She was charged, pursuant to a sealed indictment, with conspiracy to launder money and related offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 (a)(1)(B)\u00a9 and (a)(2)(B)\u00ae. On June 28, 2001, the District Court (Eugene H. Nickerson, J.) found that Hebroni was a serious flight risk because, <em>inter alia, </em>she had no ties to the United States, faced serious criminal charges with a possible sentence of between 188 and 235 months of imprisonment, and would not be extraditable if she fled the United States. After considering defendant\u2019s proposed bail package, the District Court found it inadequate, concluded that there were no conditions that would reasonably assure defendant\u2019s appearance at trial, and denied Hebroni\u2019s motion for bail pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The case was later transferred to Judge Weinstein, who held two hearings on Hebroni\u2019s application for bail on November 20, 2001 and December 12, 2001. On December 12, 2001, the District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for bail, in part on the grounds that Hebroni\u2019s physical condition had deteriorated and that detention had made defendant\u2019s preparation for trial more difficult. The decision was appealed to this Court, which found that the grounds upon which the District Court based its decision were not considerations that justified release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142. In addition, we noted that \u201cHebroni is charged with running a money laundering operation of such a scale that the United States Sentencing Guidelines will likely call for a sentence far exceeding the time she has already spent in detention; she lacks any ties to the United States; she has significant ties to other countries; it is questionable whether the United States could extradite her if she flees; and the money designated to secure her appearance is already subject to forfeiture.\u201d After observing that \u201c[t]he government\u2019s arguments have substantial force,\u201d we vacated the order for bail and remanded it to the District Court with instructions for it to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142 \u201cwhether any combination of conditions would reasonably assure Hebroni\u2019s appearance as required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">On remand, the District Court held two evidentiary hearings, one on February 8, 2002 and the other on February 11, 2002. In an order dated February 12, 2002, the District Court granted Hebroni\u2019s motion for bail pending trial. The District Court accepted the bail package, originally rejected by Judge Nickerson as inadequate, and amended it so that it no longer required the posting of guards at Hebroni\u2019s home. Any guards posted at Hebroni\u2019s home would be at the Government\u2019s own expense. It also required Hebroni to secure the bond with additional collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">After considering the arguments of both sides contained in their detailed, comprehensive briefs and presented in thorough fashion at oral argument, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s decision, after remand, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>to grant Hebroni\u2019s motion for bail pending trial, subject to the conditions of the bail package before it, was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Shakur, </em>817 F.2d 189, 195 (2d Cir.1987). For the reasons stated by the Government, we find no basis to believe that the conditions of release imposed by the District Court would reasonably assure the defendant\u2019s appearance for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Accordingly, the order of the District Court is REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
