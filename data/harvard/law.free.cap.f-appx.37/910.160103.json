His attorney has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a brief stating that counsel cannot identify any nonfrivolous issues for review. Because our independent review of the record and the briefs on appeal pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 82-83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that Dominguez-Delgado knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>143 F.3d 1266, 1270-72 (9th Cir.1998) (enforcing waiver of right to appeal where waiver is knowing and voluntary and sentence is in accordance with plea agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b958-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
