Fisher seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001) petition. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-24\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on December 6, 2001. Fisher\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on January 9, 2002.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Fisher failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny leave to proceed in forma pauperis, deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Fisher\u2019s motion requesting an evidentiary hearing, release from prison, a new bond hearing, a new trial and a dismissal of the charges. We dispense with oral argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b664-16\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date appearing on Fisher's notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been given to prison officials for mailing. <em>See </em>Fed.
