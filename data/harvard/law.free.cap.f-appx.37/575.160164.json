Co. v. 203-211 West 145th Street Realty Corp., </em>No. 99 Civ 8880 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">In a recent New York Court of Appeals decision, <em>In re Brandon, </em>769 N.E.2d 810, 743 N.Y.S.2d 53, 97 N.Y.2d 491 (2002), the New York Court addressed whether an insurance company may be permitted to disclaim coverage of a policy holder. The Court held that, where a timely notice of claim has been provided, insurers relying on late notice of legal action should be required to demonstrate prejudice. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand the cause to the District Court for further consideration in light of <em>In re Brandon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the District Court is hereby VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
