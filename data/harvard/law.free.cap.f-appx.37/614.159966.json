We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Savage-Bey\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. </em>Director, <em>Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Savage-Bey\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on January 17, 2002. Because Savage-Bey failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b663-10\"> In his informal brief, Savage-Bey states that he also seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s January 15, 2002, order denying his motion for reconsideration and his motion to reopen the time to file an appeal. Although Savage-Bey\u2019s informal brief could be construed as a notice of appeal, <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 248, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992), the brief was filed beyond the applicable thirty-day appeal period. Fed. R.App. 4(a)(1). Thus, we do not have jurisdiction to review the order and express no opinion as to its validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
