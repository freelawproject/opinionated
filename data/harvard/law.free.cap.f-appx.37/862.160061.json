The district court granted Ramirez\u2019s motion to suppress the confession, because it found that the government had not carried its burden of proving that Ramirez had knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. This is the government\u2019s interlocutory appeal of the district court\u2019s suppression order. We have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">At the suppression hearing, the district court heard sharply conflicting testimony as to whether Ramirez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights had been fully respected. The district court found that the government had not carried its burden of proving that Ramirez\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver had been knowing and voluntary. <em>See Colorado v. </em>Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 167, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986). In view of the conflicting testimony, this finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Andaverde, </em>64 F.3d 1305, 1313 (9th Cir.1995) (whether defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was knowing and intelligent is question of fact subject to dear-error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Contrary to the government\u2019s main argument, nothing in the district court\u2019s ruling suggests that it misunderstood the standard for a valid <em>Miranda </em>waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">The government waived any objection to the evidentiary hearing by failing to object in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
