Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>Nos. CR-96-820; CA-99-4093-6-13AK (D.S.C. filed Jan. 9, 2002; entered Jan. 10, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-11\"> Baker's appeal is limited to the January 10, 2002, order denying his motion for reconsideration and for a certificate of appealability. Baker\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal from the July 30, 2001, order and judgment denying his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
