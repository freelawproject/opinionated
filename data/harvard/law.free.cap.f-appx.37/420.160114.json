We deny Jackson\u2019s application for a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In the petition, which was mailed to the district court on September 4, 2000, Jackson does not attack the drug and firearms convictions for which he is imprisoned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, Jackson contends, \u201cThe Oklahoma Truth in Sentencing Act [ (\u201cAct\u201d) ], enacted in 1997, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause by eliminating early release and pre-parole programs for which [he] was eligible and that would have reduced his effective term of confinement.\u201d (R. Doc. 1 at 6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">The applicable limitation period is set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1), which states, \u201cA 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d In this case, the limitation period ran from \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Resolution of this case turns on whether the factual predicate of Jackson\u2019s claim could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence prior to September 4, 1999. Jackson claims that he did not become aware of the effects of the Act until October 1998, when he discovered that his parole consideration date had been delayed until March 1999. Jackson was denied parole on March 25, 1999. Based on these allegations, the district court correctly concluded that the petition was time-barred because the factual predicate for the ex post facto claim was discovered before September 4, 1999 \u2014 more than one year before the habeas application was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Jackson further contends that he was not aware of his right to pursue his ex post facto claim until he obtained copies of various court opinions after March 2000. Although equitable tolling of the limitation period is appropriate in exceptional circumstances, we have held that ignorance of the law does not excuse untimely filing. <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1194, 121 S.Ct. 1195, 149 L.Ed.2d 110 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">We GRANT Jackson\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, DENY the application for a COA, and DISMISS this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The Court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-15\">. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed these convictions on July 2, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-16\">. Jackson does not allege facts to suggest that the limitation period should be tolled for the time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review was pending. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
