When the district court rendered its decision, however, that court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Edelman v. Lynchburg College, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1145, 152 L.Ed.2d 188 (2002) (upholding regulation permitting verification of a timely filed charge after the time for filing has expired). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings under <em>Edelman. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
