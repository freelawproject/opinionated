Separately, Storli\u2019s attorney, Matthew J. Sisler, appeals from the district court\u2019s orders imposing monetary sanctions against him pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and the court\u2019s inherent authority. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">Storli argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in the Flathead Defendants\u2019 favor on their qualified immunity defense to his Fourth Amendment claim. Under <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), we first determine whether \u201cthe facts alleged [by the plaintiff] show ... the [officers\u2019] conduct violated a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201. Here, the Flathead Defendants observed a confidential informant, Lance Vitt, enter Storli\u2019s residence with $140 in marked bills and exit with a small quantity of methamphetamine and $40 of the original cash. From those observations, the officers could have readily deduced that Storli sold the narcotics to Vitt, thereby giving rise to probable cause to charge him, <em>see Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, </em>92 F.3d 1486, 1498 (9th Cir.1996), and, necessarily, a viable qualified immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">Next, Storli argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on Stork\u2019s claim that Vitt violated the Fourth Amendment during the sting operation. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact regarding Vitt\u2019s actions, ak of which appear to have been entirely appropriate within the context of his role as a confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-15\">Stork further argues that the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law on his claim that Wade Rademacher acted negligently by faikng to intervene timely to prevent his partner, Greg Burns, from injuring Stork during a confrontation. Under Montana law, a law enforcement officer does not have a legal duty to a member of the general pubkc unless a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exists between the individuals, such as when an officer has a suspect within his custody. <em>See Nelson v. Driscoll, </em>295 Mont. 363, 983 P.2d 972, 977-79 (Mont.1999). Here, the record indicates that Stork was never within Rademacher\u2019s control during the course of Stork\u2019s brief encounter with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>Burns, which lasted no longer than a few seconds. Rademacher, therefore, did not have a duty to protect Storli, nor could he reasonably have done so within such a short time period. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting judgment as a matter of law on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Storli argues that the district court abused its discretion by submitting a special verdict form to the jury that contained questions about both excessive force and Burns\u2019 qualified immunity defense. He also complains about the order of the questions. He did not, however, raise these arguments in the district court, and we therefore decline to consider them. <em>See Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">As for the sanctions orders entered against Sisler, he first argues that the district court erred in fading to conduct an oral hearing on the various sanctions motions pending against him. We have held, however, that the district court need only ensure that an attorney who is potentially subject to a sanctions order has an opportunity to respond in writing to the allegations lodged against him. <em>See Pacific Harbor Capital, Inc. v. Carnival Air Lines, Inc., </em>210 F.3d 1112, 1118 (9th Cir.2000). Here, Sisler filed several responses to the sanctions motions and therefore availed himself of his due process right to challenge the defendants\u2019 various contentions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Sisler also argues that the district court erred in imposing sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 because his purported misconduct did not \u201cmultiply\u201d the proceedings as is required to support sanctions under that statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion because several of its factual findings, including those concerning Sisler\u2019s intransigence about preparing the joint pretrial order and his disregard of the district court\u2019s rules regarding trial exhibits (findings which were not clearly erroneous), support a determination that Sisler unduly multiplied the proceedings through his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Sisler further argues that his repeated pattern of misconduct was mere negligence on his part, which is insufficient to sustain sanctions under either \u00a7 1927 or the district court\u2019s inherent authority. We disagree. The district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Sisler\u2019s conduct was reckless and undertaken in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b923-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\">. Sisler also argues that the district court violated his due process rights because it sanctioned him based on the Kalispell Defendants' motion that, purportedly, lacked adequate citations to the trial record. This argument lacks merit. The Kalispell Defendants\u2019 motion was specific enough to permit Sisler to be on notice as to those instances of misconduct for which the defendants sought sanctions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-12\">. To the extent that Sisler argues that the district court's decision to \"fine\u201d him $10,000 for his misconduct was improper because the order lacked a concomitant multiplicity finding, we note that the court need not make such a finding for purposes of its inherent authority to regulate attorney misconduct. <em>See generally Fink v. Gomez, </em>239 F.3d 989, 991-92 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
