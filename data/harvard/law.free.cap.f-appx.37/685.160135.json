Newport News raises several errors related to the determination that Vinson was entitled to disability benefits for the period during which he returned to his employ as a welder despite his injury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-22\">This Court will reverse an order of the BRB only if the award is predicated on an error of law or a factual determination supported by only a scintilla of evidence. <em>See Gilchrist v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>135 F.3d 915, 918 (4th Cir.1998); <em>See v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, </em>36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.1994). Newport News challenges both the legal ground for Vinson\u2019s award and the evidentiary basis supporting it. We find both of these assignments of error to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-23\">The BRB properly found Vinson\u2019s return to work after his injury did not preclude a disability award as a matter of law. This Court has noted the statutory standard for disability \u201cturns on the claimant\u2019s <em>capacity </em>for work, not actual employment.\u201d <em>See Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Tann, </em>841 F.2d 540, 543 (4th Cir.1988) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, if a claimant continues employment after an injury only through \u201cex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>traordinary effort to keep working\u201d and despite the attendant \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d and substantial risk of further injury, he may nevertheless qualify for a disability award. <em>Haughton Elevator Co. v. Lewis, </em>572 F.2d 447, 451 (1978) (Winter, J., concurring). Because a disability award under the LHWCA is predicated on an employee\u2019s diminished capacity for work due to injury rather than actual wage-loss, we find this objection to be meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Nor was there an insufficient evidentiary basis to support the application of <em>Haughton Elevator </em>to Vinson\u2019s situation. The BRB and the administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) noted Vinson\u2019s subjective assessment of the pain he endured while working after his injury was supported by medical reports. Additionally, Newport News presented no evidence to refute Vinson\u2019s allegations of pain. Furthermore, the ALJ and the BRB identified and reconciled the dispute in the record as to whether Vinson\u2019s responsibilities during his post-injury return to work required efforts outside his medical restrictions, which included limited use of stairs. Testimony at Vinson\u2019s hearing indicated he was obliged to use stairs more than minimally while at work, and his supervisor acknowledged Vinson could not perform his regular duties as a welder under those restrictions. Accordingly, we find there was a sufficient evidentiary basis to support Vinson\u2019s disability award during the period in question in accordance with <em>Haughton Elevator.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AL3\">In light of the foregoing, we affirm Vinson\u2019s award.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense wjth oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process,</p>\n<p id=\"Afy\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b734-6\"> Newport News has waived review of the ALJ\u2019s award of disability benefits covering the period during which Vinson honored his union's labor strike. By failing to challenge this portion of Vinson\u2019s award before the BRB, Newport News has waived further review of this issue. <em>See Parker v. Motor Boat Sales, </em>314 U.S. 244, 250-51, 62 S.Ct. 221, 86 L.Ed. 184 (1941); <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Director, Office of Worker\u2019s Compensation Programs, </em>97 F.3d 815, 819 (5th Cir.1996); <em>General Dynamics Corp. v. Sacchetti, </em>681 F.2d 37, 40 (1st Cir.1982). Furthermore, Newport News\u2019 contention that it did challenge this portion of Vinson's award before the BRB but that the BRB failed to consider it is not properly before this Court, as it was raised for the first time in its reply brief. <em>See Cavallo v. Star Enter., </em>100 F.3d 1150, 1152 n. 2 (4th Cir. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
