We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-15\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Zimmerman v. City of Oakland, </em>255 F.3d 734, 737 (9th Cir.2001). The district court properly determined that Williams\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims fail because she did not allege that she was denied appointed counsel on the basis of her disability. <em>See Weinreich v. Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, </em>114 F.3d 976, 978 (9th Cir.1997). The district court properly determined that Williams\u2019s 14th Amendment claim was fatally flawed because a court is not considered a \u201cperson\u201d under the law. <em>See Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness, Inc. v. Zolin, </em>812 F.2d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir.1987). For these reasons, the district court properly determined that amendment of Williams\u2019s complaint would be futile. <em>See Cato v. United States, </em>70 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-19\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Williams in forma pauperis status after determining she could afford to pay its filing fee. <em>See O\u2019Loughlin v. Doe, </em>920 F.2d 614, 616-17 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-20\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appointed counsel because Williams did not show exceptional circumstances. <em>See Bums v. County of King, </em>883 F.2d 819, 823 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-21\">Williams\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b376-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
