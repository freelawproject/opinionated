Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief challenging the harshness of Jarmon\u2019s 70-month prison sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-18\">We will not entertain counsel\u2019s argument because Jarmon entered into a plea agreement wherein he specifically agreed to the prison sentence he received. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1995) (defendant who voluntarily exposes himself to specific sentence may not challenge that punishment on appeal). Further, Jarmon\u2019s sentence was within the applicable and unobjected-to Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Woodrum, </em>959 F.2d 100, 101 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (sentence is not reviewable merely because it is at top of properly calculated Guidelines range).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-19\">Having reviewed the record independently pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-20\">Accordingly, we affirm, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-22\">.
