Because Petitioner has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Petitioner was convicted after a jury trial of one count of possession of a firearm after former conviction of a felony, one count of eluding a police officer, one count of reckless driving, and two counts of failure to stop at a stop sign. The court sentenced Petitioner to thirty-five years on the possession of a firearm count, to be served consecutively with the remaining counts. In his petition, Petitioner seeks relief only on the possession of a firearm conviction. Petitioner sought a direct appeal of his conviction to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) which affirmed the conviction in a summary opinion. Petitioner did not seek post-conviction relief in Oklahoma, however, the State concedes that he has exhausted his state court remedies. R. Doc. 7 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">In his original petition before the United States District Court, Petitioner raised three grounds for relief: (1) the OCCA violated his due process and equal protection rights with its summary opinion that failed to address whether the statute under which he was charged, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 1283(A), applied to his conduct; (2) the evidence was insufficient to prove he was guilty under \u00a7 1283(A); and (3) the state trial court allowed the State to present irrelevant and prejudicial evidence. After referral of the matter from the district court and receipt of the State\u2019s response, the magistrate judge issued a thorough Report and Recommendation, recommending dismissal of the petition. R. Doc. 12. After Petitioner filed an objection to the magistrate\u2019s Report and Recommendation and the State filed a response, the district court adopted the Report and Recommendation and denied the petition. R. Doc. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-13\">In this appeal, Petitioner raises two issues: (1) that in light of his asserted \u201cactual and factual innocence\u201d of the firearm possession statute, both the Oklahoma trial court and the OCCA should have ensured jurisdiction over his case; and (2) that the federal district court failed to address his \u201cactual and factual innocence claim.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 16. Petitioner\u2019s first issue is at bottom an attack on the state courts\u2019 construction of the firearm possession statute, a construction to which we are bound in habeas review. <em>See Dennis v. Poppel, </em>222 F.3d 1245, 1257 (10th Cir. 2000) (citing <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 368, 103 S.Ct. 673, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983)). As to Petitioner\u2019s second contention, we agree with the magistrate\u2019s Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>port and Recommendation concluding that the State presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to support his conviction and that the OCCA\u2019s resolution of this issue is not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); R. Doc. 12 at 5-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA, his appellate brief, the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation, and the appellate record, and conclude that he has faded to demonstrate that the issues raised are debatable among jurists, that a court could resolve the issues differently, or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>See Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). As such, Petitioner has failed to make the \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d required for a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Accordingly, for substantially the reasons set forth by the magistrate judge, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and IFP and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b405-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
