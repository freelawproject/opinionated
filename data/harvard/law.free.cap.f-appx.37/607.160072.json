Davis argues his sentence of 328 months imprisonment violates <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We affirm Davis\u2019 conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-25\">Because Davis failed to raise an <em>Apprendi </em>claim in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). In order to demonstrate plain error, Davis must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732. If Davis can satisfy these requirements, we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error \u201cunless the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. Young, </em>470 U.S. 1, 105 S.Ct. 1038, 84 L.Ed.2d 1 (1985)). Davis\u2019 indictment did not allege a threshold drug quantity; therefore, he could only be properly sentenced to 240 months imprisonment. 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). We find Davis\u2019 sentence of 328 months imprisonment is error, and the error was plain. We need not decide, however, whether the error affected Davis\u2019 substantial rights. Where the evidence is overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted as to the error, we will decline to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>it. <em>See United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1781, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2002). We have reviewed the record and conclude the evidence of drug quantity, as derived from the stipulation in Davis\u2019 plea agreement, was overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted. Accordingly, because the drug quantity attributable to Davis was sufficient to invoke the enhanced sentencing provisions of \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), we decline to correct his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">We affirm Davis\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
