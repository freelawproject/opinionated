His appeal has been referred to a panel of this court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, the panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed in this case. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Siggers alleged that the defendants had violated his rights while he was incarcerated in an Ohio prison. He primarily alleged that several guards had retaliated against him by harassing him and by using pepper spray to force his submission to a haircut. The district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over Siggers\u2019s objections, and granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on August 31, 2001. It is from this judgment that Siggers now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">We review an award of summary judgment de novo. <em>Copeland v. Machulis, </em>57 F.3d 476, 478 (6th Cir.1995). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u201c[Wjhenever prison officials stand accused of using excessive physical force in violation of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, the core judicial inquiry is ... whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6-7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). The plaintiff is not required to show a serious injury, although the extent of his injuries may be considered in determining whether the use of force was wanton and unnecessary. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Other factors include \u201cthe need for application of force, the relationship between that need and the amount of force used, the threat \u2018reasonably perceived by the responsible officials,\u2019 and \u2018any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">An examination of these factors supports the district court\u2019s decision. First, Siggers has not shown that he sustained a serious injury. Second, the application of force was needed, as Siggers refused to obey the defendants\u2019 orders to stand up and to leave a strip cage. Third, the amount of force used was reasonably related to that need. Fourth, the defendants reasonably perceived that Siggers\u2019s refusal to leave the cage presented a threat to prison security. Finally, the defendants tempered the severity of their response by allowing Siggers to shower and to see a nurse after he was sprayed and by following the nurse\u2019s advice to place him in a cell with open ventilation.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">Siggers now argues that the use of force was unconstitutional because the Rules Infraction Board had not authorized a forced haircut under Ohio Admin. Code \u00a7 5120-9-25(H). This argument is unpersuasive because an inmate may not refuse a direct order merely because he disagrees with a guard\u2019s interpretation of a prison regulation. Indeed, the regulations arguably support the defendants\u2019 use of force, as Siggers\u2019s refusal to obey their direct orders to exit the cage was a Class II rule violation, which is considered an immediate and direct threat to the security of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>institution. <em>See </em>Ohio Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7 5120-9-06(B) <em>and </em>(E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Siggers alleged that the defendants retaliated against him because he \u201chad words\u201d with one of them in May of 1998. However, his excessive force claim is based on an incident that occurred almost a year later, on April 11, 1999. Thus, Siggers\u2019s retaliation claim is unavailing, as his conclusory assertions do not show a sufficient causal nexus between the 1998 argument and the alleged assault. <em>See Smith v. Campbell, </em>250 F.3d 1032, 1037-39 (6th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Siggers also alleged that the defendants subjected him to insults and racial slurs. It appears that this claim was abandoned in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Nevertheless, we note that mere insults are generally not actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>See Ivey v. Wilson, 832 </em>F.2d 950, 955 (6th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Siggers argues that he was not allowed sufficient discovery before summary judgment was entered against him. This argument fails because he did not file an affida-. vit with the district court which clearly demonstrated why additional discovery was needed. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f); Cacevic <em>v. City of Hazel Park, </em>226 F.3d 483, 488-89 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Finally, Siggers argues that the magistrate judge was biased because he denied his request for counsel. There is, however, no real indication of bias and Siggers did not have a constitutional right to counsel in this case. <em>See Lavado v. Keohane, </em>992 F.2d 601, 605-06 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Accordingly, all pending motions are denied and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
