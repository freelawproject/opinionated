Gordon Liddy, reaches this court for the second time. Wells\u2019s defamation claims are based on statements Liddy made alleging that Wells was involved with a call-girl ring while working as a secretary at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in 1972. The district court initially granted Liddy\u2019s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Wells, an involuntary public figure, could not prove that Liddy acted with actual malice. Wells appealed and this court held that under the evidence presented, a rational trier of fact could conclude that Liddy acted with actual malice. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>186 F.3d 505, 542-44 (4th Cir. 1999). This court further held that Wells was a private individual, and therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>that while a showing of actual malice was required to recover punitive and presumed damages, she needed only to prove that Liddy was negligent in making the statements to recover compensatory damages. On remand the district court held a trial, but the jury was unable to render a verdict. Based upon the trial record, the district court granted Liddy\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law, holding that no reasonable jury could find that Liddy was negligent in making the allegedly false statements. Because we determine that the evidence does not preclude Wells from proving that Liddy failed to take reasonable steps in assessing the veracity of his statements, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Recognizing the importance of the historical background in this case, we begin by briefly recounting the chronology of events that underlie the present dispute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From February of 1972 until July of 1972, Wells was employed at the DNC offices in Washington, D.C., located at that time in the Watergate complex. Wells worked as the secretary to Spencer Oliver, Executive Director of the Association of State Democratic Chairmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In the early morning hours of June 17, 1972, Frank Wills, a security guard, summoned the police because a door at the Watergate had been suspiciously taped so that it would not lock. Upon their arrival, the police arrested five men, and the inquiry into the now infamous Watergate break-in began. The initial focus of the investigation targeted the five would-be burglars and two of their co-conspirators, namely E. Howard Hunt, then White House aide, and Liddy, then counsel for the Committee to Reelect the President. All seven were indicted by a federal grand jury on September 15, 1972. Liddy was charged with multiple counts of burglary, conspiracy, and interception of wire and oral communications. Liddy, refusing to plead guilty or cooperate with the prosecution, was tried, convicted, and served fifty-two months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">James McCord, one of the five burglars, pled guilty to a variety of burglary, conspiracy, and wiretapping charges but then claimed that he was pressured to plead guilty and lie during the district court proceedings. McCord\u2019s allegations implicated high-level administration officials. As subsequent investigations unfolded, the White House\u2019s effort to cover up its involvement led to the imprisonment of several high-ranking White House officials and ultimately to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in August of 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-14\">Since his release in 1977, Liddy has engaged in public commentary through a successful radio talk show, an autobiography, and as a frequent speaker on the lecture circuit. During several public appearances, Liddy presented an alternative theory behind the Watergate break-in.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This alternative theory, which is described in a 1991 book by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin titled <em>Silent Coup: The Removal of a President, </em>alleges that John Dean had personally ordered the Watergate break-in to protect his own reputation and the reputation of his now-wife Maureen Biner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Len Colodny <em>&amp; </em>Robert Gettlin, <em>Silent Coup: The Removal of a President, </em>131\u2014 33,147-48 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Biner was allegedly a close friend of Erica L. \u201cHeidi\u201d Rikan, who operated a call-girl operation at the Columbia Plaza apartments, near the Watergate complex. The <em>Silent Coup </em>theory of the break-in asserts that Phillip Mackin Bailley, an attorney, used his connections with the DNC to promote Rikan\u2019s prostitution ring. According to Colodny and Gettlin, when Oliver was not in the office, his phone, which was the target of the first Watergate break-in, was used to arrange meetings between visitors to the DNC and Rikan\u2019s call girls. Bailley was arrested and indicted for various crimes, including violations of the Mann Act, and as a result, his address books were seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">According to <em>Silent Coup, </em>Dean, upon hearing of Bailley\u2019s arrest, called the Assistant United States Attorney investigating the case and summoned him to the White House. During this meeting, Dean supposedly stated that he thought the Democrats had leaked the story about the prostitution ring. Dean photocopied Bailley\u2019s address book to compare it with a list of White House Staff. Biner\u2019s name, as well as an alias of her good friend Rikan, were found in Barney\u2019s address book.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">The implication, therefore, is that Dean ordered the second and ill-fated Watergate break-in to determine whether the Democrats had information Unking Biner to the Bailley/Rikan call-girl ring and, if they did, whether they intended to use that information to embarrass him and the White House. The authors of <em>Silent Coup, </em>noting that one of the Watergate burglars was found to be carrying a key to Wells\u2019s desk, prompt its readers to contemplate the following unanswered question: <em>\u201cWhy </em>would a Watergate burglar have a key to Wells\u2019s desk in his possession, and what items of possible interest to a Watergate burglar were maintained in WeUs\u2019s locked desk drawer?\u201d Colodny &amp; Gettlin, <em>supra, </em>at 159 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Beginning in 1988, Liddy had extensive conversations with Colodny regarding the <em>Silent Coup </em>theory, and by 1991, Liddy had reached the conclusion that the theory was vahd. As a result, in 1991, Liddy endorsed the theory in a special paperback edition of his autobiography titled <em>Will. </em>On June 3, 1991, Liddy met with Bailley to discuss Bailley\u2019s involvement with the Rikan prostitution ring. During that meeting Bailley described to Liddy how the DNC procured prostitution services for some of its visitors. According to Bailley, photographs of Rikan\u2019s call girls were kept in a desk in the Oliver/WeUs/Governors area and various personnel at the DNC would display the photographs to DNC visitors and would then arrange meetings with the visitor\u2019s call girl of choice. Bailley also stated that DNC employees were paid a commission on their referrals. Liddy began routinely to incorporate the <em>Silent Coup </em>theory of the Watergate break-in, including his discussion with Bailley, into his pubhc speeches. This case on appeal concerns two occasions on which Liddy espoused the <em>Silent Coup </em>theory. First, on April 2, 1996, Liddy delivered a speech at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia (the JMU speech). During the JMU speech, Liddy, in response to a question, made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">[Sjome members of the DNC were using the call girl ring as an asset to entertain visiting firemen. And to that end they had a manila envelope that you could open or close by wrapping a string around a wafer. And in that envelope were twelve photographs of an assortment of these girls and then one group photograph of them. And what you see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>is what you get. It was kept, he said, in that desk of Ida Maxine Wells. Thus, the camera [and] all the rest of it. And what they were doing is as these people would be looking at the brochure, if you want to call it that, and making the telephone call to arrange the assignation that was being wiretapped, recorded and photographed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">(J.A. at 53-54.) Second, Liddy gave a similar speech while on a Mediterranean cruise (the cruise ship speech) in August 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">On April 1, 1997, Wells filed a defamation action against Liddy, asserting that Liddy defamed her by stating on several occasions that she acted as a procurer of prostitutes for men who visited the DNC.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The complaint sought one million dollars for injury to reputation and standing in the community, one million dollars for mental suffering, humiliation, and embarrassment, and three million dollars in punitive damages. Liddy filed an Answer and Affirmative Defenses on April 28,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Following discovery, Liddy filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted in Liddy\u2019s favor on April 13, 1998. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>1 F.Supp.2d 532 (D.Md.1998). This court reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and remanded the case for trial. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>186 F.3d 505 (4th Cir.1999). Specifically, we determined that Virginia law, rather than Louisiana law, applied to the allegations surrounding Liddy\u2019s JMU speech, and maritime law applied to the cruise ship speech.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 522, 524. Moreover, we held that the cruise ship speech, in addition to the JMU speech, was capable of conveying a defamatory meaning. <em>See id. </em>at 523 &amp; 527. On the claims regarding the Don &amp; Mike show and the Accuracy in Media web site, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s application of Louisiana law and its conclusion that neither is capable of having a defamatory meaning. <em>See id. </em>at 527-30. This court then determined that Wells is a private individual, not an involuntary public figure, and therefore need not prove actual malice to recover compensatory damages. <em>See id. </em>at 531-542. Moreover, concerning Wells\u2019s claim that Liddy acted with actual malice, which must be proven to recover punitive and presumed damages, this court determined that Wells had raised a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See id. </em>at 542-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">Upon remand, a jury trial commenced on January 16, 2001. The jury, however, failed to render a verdict. The district court excused the jury and entered an order granting Liddy\u2019s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on February 6, 2001. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>135 F.Supp.2d 668 (D.Md.2001). Specifically, the district court held that \u201cno \u2018reasonable jury\u2019 could have found in favor of plaintiff Ida Maxwell Wells against defendant G. Gordon Liddy on the issue of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Liddy had been negligent in making the allegedly defamatory remarks upon which Wells\u2019s suit was based.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Wells again appeals to this court, alleging that (1) the district court erred in entering judgment as a matter of law on the issue of Liddy\u2019s negligence; (2) the district court erred in making numerous evidentiary rulings; (3) the district court erred in ruling that Liddy did not waive attorney-client and work-product privileges; and (4) the district court erred in denying Wells\u2019s unopposed motion to file her second amended complaint. We will review each challenge in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We review the district court\u2019s entry of judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>See United States v. Vanhorn, </em>20 F.3d 104, 109 (4th Cir.1994), Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when \u201ca party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.... \u201d Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 50(a)(1). In other words, we must determine \u201cwhether, without weighing the evidence or considering the credibility of witnesses, there can be but one conclusion as to the verdict that reasonable jurors could have reached.\u201d <em>Vanhorn, </em>20 F.3d at 109 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, when making our determination, we must view the evidence, and make all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>See Price v. City of Charlotte, </em>93 F.3d 1241, 1249 (4th Cir. 1996) (\u2018While our review of this motion is plenary, it is also circumscribed because we must review the evidence in the light most favorable to [the nonmoving party].\u201d) (quoting <em>Singer v. Dungan, </em>45 F.3d 823, 827 (4th Cir.1995)). We are also obligated to apply the \u201csubstantive evidentiary standard of proof that would apply at the trial on the merits.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">Under Virginia law, to recover actual or compensatory damages in a defamation action Wells, a private individual, must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Liddy was at least negligent in making each statement, that is, that he \u201ceither knew it to be false, or believing it to be true, lacked reasonable grounds for such belief, or acted negligently in failing to ascertain the facts on which the publication was based.\u201d <em>See Gazette, Inc. v. Harris, </em>229 Va. 1, 325 S.E.2d 713, 725 (1985).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, to survive Liddy\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, there must be sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Liddy either knew that he was making a false statement, or that he lacked reasonable grounds for believing his statements were true or acted negligently in failing to ascertain the facts upon which his statements were based. Because we find that sufficient evidence exists, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">As we noted during the first appeal, Bailley's statements are clearly the only direct evidence that Wells personally had a role in the alleged prostitution-related activities conducted out of the DNC. <em>See Wells, </em>186 F.3d at 542-44. It is also well established in the record that Bailley is an unreliable source. <em>See id. </em>at 542 (\u201cBailley, who is a disbarred attorney and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>convicted felon with a long history of substance abuse and mental illness, had changed his story about the prostitution ring several times and was not a reliable source.\u201d). The issue, therefore, as the district court points out, is \u201cwhether Liddy reasonably assessed the veracity of what Bailley told him about the pictures allegedly in Wells\u2019s desk.\u201d <em>Wells v. Liddy, </em>135 F.Supp.2d 668, 670 (D.Md.2001) (\u201cLiddy was required to examine Bailley\u2019s statements with caution and weigh them with great care.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The district court concluded that Wells had not produced sufficient evidence to establish that Liddy failed to fulfill his obligation to assess the veracity of Bailley\u2019s statements. <em>See id. </em>Determining that Liddy was aware of facts that reasonably corroborated what Bailley had said, the district court concluded that Liddy had tested Bailley\u2019s statements sufficiently by independent investigation. <em>See id. </em>at 671. Specifically, the district court determined that the following evidence, all known to Liddy, sufficiently corroborated Bailley\u2019s statements about Wells\u2019s involvement in call-girl activities, preventing Wells from meeting her burden of proof: (1) Eugenio Martinez, a Watergate burglar, was apprehended with a key to Wells\u2019s desk and at trial Wells provided no other explanation for why the burglars would target her desk; (2) Carl Shoffier, an arresting officer, testified in another case that one of the burglars\u2019 cameras was found on Wells\u2019s desk; (3) conversations of a sexual nature had been intercepted by the tap on Oliver\u2019s phone; (4) the conventional theory explaining the reasons for the Watergate break-ins long has been subject to question because of the type of equipment used and the ineffectiveness of such an operation; (5) deposition testimony from another case stating that an informant implicated Oliver in the call-girl ring and one of the FBI Agents identified a coded name in Bailley\u2019s address book as a secretary or administrative aide in the DNC office; (6) Bailley\u2019s sister said that Wells had a relationship with Bailley; (7) Officer Shoffier stated that Wells, acting as if she were very surprised and shocked to learn that the burglars placed photography equipment on her desk, exclaimed, \u201cMy God, they haven\u2019t gone in there\u201d; and (8) Wells wrote a contemporaneous letter to a close personal friend that could be read as implicating her in \u201cquestionable activities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 671-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">These eight pieces of corroborating evidence are very similar to the following seven pieces of corroborating evidence upon which the district court based its original grant of summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">(1) although Bailley changed his story several times, he consistently stated that a DNC secretary was involved in the call-girl ring; (2) in 1976 public reports circulated that intimate phone calls were occurring on DNC phones that led to unconfirmed rumors that the phones were being used in a call-girl ring; (3) the FBI found a tap on Oliver\u2019s phone; (4) Martinez possessed a key to Wells\u2019s desk; (5) it is entirely unclear why anyone would want to break into Wells\u2019s desk; (6) Bailley\u2019s sister said that Wells had a relationship with Bailley; and (7) there were rumors circulating among DNC staffers after the Watergate break-in regarding a call-girl ring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-9\"><em>Wells, </em>186 F.3d at 542. As we noted in the first appeal, this evidence tends to corrob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>orate the call-girl theory generally, but it fails specifically to corroborate Bailley\u2019s statements concerning Wells\u2019s personal participation in the call-girl ring. In other words, the eight pieces of evidence listed above would not prevent a reasonable jury from inferring that Liddy\u2019s sole source of information on Wells\u2019s personal involvement in procuring prostitutes for visitors to the DNC was Bailley, who Liddy admits is not a credible source.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 543. A reasonable jury could conclude further that sole reliance on such an unreliable source violates Virginia\u2019s negligence standard, because it suggests that Liddy lacked reasonable grounds to believe that his statements were true.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Ingles v. Dively, </em>246 Va. 244, 435 S.E.2d 641, 645 (1993) (citing <em>Gazette, Inc., </em>325 S.E.2d at 724-25).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We conclude that the evidence enumerated by the district court does not support judgment as a matter of law because it falls to prove, as a matter of law, that Liddy\u2019s actions were prudent. In other words, the question of whether Liddy was negligent presents a genuine issue of material fact for a jury to resolve and, therefore, the district court erred in granting judgment as a matter of law in Liddy\u2019s favor. Consequently, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">Although we have determined that remand is appropriate, in light of the protracted litigation in this case, the likelihood that many of the same issues will be revisited on remand, and the potential need for further discovery, we review the remaining three contentions Wells makes on appeal. With regard to Wells\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, while a majority are unfounded and do not warrant further discussion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>two are meritorious and will be reviewed briefly below. We review the district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence under the narrow abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Hassouneh, </em>199 F.3d 175, 182 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Wells argues that the district court erred by excluding evidence tending to show that Liddy\u2019s reliance on the publication of <em>Silent Coup </em>was disingenuous. Specifically, Wells sought to introduce disposition testimony by Roy Gainsburg, president of St. Martin\u2019s Press and Thomas McCormack, chairman of the board of St. Martin\u2019s Press. Gainsburg testified that if St. Martin\u2019s Press had knowledge that a book contained an important untrue statement of fact that would be damaging to someone, the book would not be publishable. He also stated, however, that in his view, St. Martin\u2019s Press did not have an \u201cobligation to insure that the facts in every book that it published were true.\u201d (Exh. at 184-85.) Both Gainsburg and McCormack testified to having no knowledge of Bailley\u2019s mental condition. Wells claims that from this evidence, which Liddy had in his possession when he made the statements at issue, a jury could conclude that Liddy\u2019s reliance on the book was unreasonable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Liddy\u2019s knowledge that the publisher of <em>Silent Coup </em>disavowed all responsibility for verifying the accuracy of the book and had no knowledge of Bailley\u2019s mental condition is relevant to Liddy\u2019s state of mind when he relied on the book in making his allegedly defamatory statements. Choosing simply to ignore such evidence might, along with other facts, suggest negligence or actual malice. The district court, in excluding the evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 401, concluded that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t prove anything.\u201d (J.A. at 3123). Because the district court\u2019s basis for excluding the deposition testimony of Gainsburg and McCormack was legally incorrect, we find that it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Wells also challenges two portions of Jeannine Bailley Ball\u2019s testimony, which were admitted for their relevance on the issue of truth-falsity in addition to the issue of Liddy\u2019s state of mind. In 1972, Ball was serving as a secretary to her brother, Phillip Bailley. She testified that early in 1972, someone identifying herself as Maxie Wells called Bailley and that Wells\u2019s name appeared in her brother\u2019s address book, which served as a record of his calls. Wells argues that admission of this evidence violates Federal Rule of Evidence 901(a), contending that self-identification is not enough to authenticate the call. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">Rule 901 provides that \u201c[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 901(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>The burden to authenticate evidence under Rule 901 is not a high one. <em>See </em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 901.02[3] (2d ed. 2001) (\u201cGenerally speaking, the proponent of a proffered exhibit needs only to make a prima facie showing that the exhibit is what the proponent claims it to be.\u201d). Once this requisite prima facie showing has been met, if the evidence satisfies all other rules of admissibility, the \u201cResolution of whether evidence is authentic calls for a factual determination by the jury.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Branch, </em>970 F.2d 1368, 1370 (4th Cir.1992); Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 901.02[3] (2d ed. 2001) (\u201c[I]ssues the opponent has raised about flaws in the authentication ... go to the weight of the evidence instead of its admissibility.\u201d). Before the evidence is admitted for consideration by the jury, how-' ever, \u201cthe district court must determine whether its proponent has offered a satisfactory foundation from which the jury could reasonably find that the evidence is authentic.\u201d <em>Branch, </em>970 F.2d at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Rule 901(b), as an illustration, explains that \u201c[t]elephone conversations, by evidence that a call was made to the number assigned at the time by the telephone company to a particular person or business, if ... in the case of a person, circumstances, including self-identification, show the person answering to be the one called\u201d may be considered identified or authenticated. Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(6). From this illustration, it is clear \u201cthat the mere announcement of identity <em>by a person who has placed a telephone call </em>does not suffice to make it admissible against the person so identified.\u201d <em>See United States v. Benjamin, </em>328 F.2d 854, 864 n. 3 (2d Cir.1964) (citing 7 Wigmore, Evidence 617 (3d ed.1940) (emphasis in original)). Instead, Rule 901 requires evidence to support the claim that the self-identifying caller is indeed who he says he is. For example, \u201ctelephone conversation may be shown to have emanated from a particular person by virtue of its disclosing knowledge of facts known peculiarly to him.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. R.Evid. 901 advisory committee notes ex. (4). In other words, \u201cthe content of the conversation combined with the caller\u2019s self-identification\u201d can sufficiently support a finding that the caller is who she says she is. <em>United States v. Console, </em>13 F.3d 641, 661 (3d Cir.1993). Because the caller identifying herself as Wells provided no other information that could verify her identity, the testimony lacks sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find in favor of authenticity or identification. The district court, therefore, abused its discretion by admitting this portion of Ball\u2019s testimony on the issue of truth-falsity.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Wells next contends that the district court erred by ruling that Liddy had not waived his attorney-client and work-product privileges. Wells argues that Liddy waived his attorney-client privilege by disclosing confidential communications and that he waived the work-product privilege by making testimonial use of work product.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The district court, while acknowledging that Liddy had disclosed confidential communications and made testimonial use of work-product, determined that Lidd/s actions did not constitute a \u201cclassic waiver.\u201d (J.A. at 490-91.) Because Lidd/s \u201caffirmative use\u201d of privileged material did not constitute a classic waiver, the district court reasoned, discovery of privileged material was limited to items that Liddy saw and relied upon to demonstrate his state of mind. (J.A. at 489-93; <em>id. </em>at 491 (\u201cAnything factual communicated to Mr. Liddy has to be disclosed.\u201d).) We review the district court\u2019s application of the law of privilege de novo. <em>See Hawkins v. Stables, </em>148 F.3d 379, 382 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u201cThe attorney-client privilege is the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981). By protecting confidential communications between attorneys and their clients, the attorney-client privilege \u201ceneourage[s] full and frank communication ... and thereby promote[s] broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The attorney-client privilege, however, is not absolute. <em>See Hawkins, </em>148 F.3d at 384 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Under Virginia law,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the attorney-client \u201cprivilege may be expressly waived by the client, or a waiver may be implied from the client\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Edwards, </em>235 Va. 499, 370 S.E.2d 296, 301 (1988) (citing <em>Grant v. Harris, </em>116 Va. 642, 82 S.E. 718 (1914)). When \u201cdeciding whether the privilege has been waived by implication regard must be had to the double elements that are predicated in every waiver, i.e., not only the element of implied intention, but also the element of fairness and constancy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">There is always also the objective consideration that when his conduct touches a certain point of disclosure, fairness requires that his privilege shall cease whether he intended that result or not. He cannot be allowed, after disclosing as much as he pleases, to withhold the remainder. He may elect to withhold or to disclose, but after a certain point his election must remain final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-9\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). Consequently, when disclosure to a third party waives the privilege, the waiver applies \u201c \u2018not only to the transmitted data but also as to the details underlying that information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Cote, </em>456 F.2d 142, 145 (8th Cir.1972)). In other words, \u201c[a] client\u2019s ... testimony as to a <em>part of any communication </em>to the attorney is a waiver as to the whole of that communication, on the analogy of the principle of completeness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). The Supreme Court of Virginia has provided the following guidance for determining what constitutes the \u201cunderlying details\u201d of a communication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">\u201cThe details underlying the published data are the communications relating the data, the document, if any, to be published containing the data, all preliminary drafts of the document, and any attorne/s notes containing material necessary to the preparation of the [communication]. Copies of other documents, the contents of which were necessary to the preparation of the [communication], will also lose the privilege.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aa\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. (Under Seal), </em>748 F.2d 871, 875 n. 7 (4th Cir.1984), <em>va</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>cated as moot on other grounds, </em>757 F.2d 600 (4th Cir.1985)). The Supreme Court of Virginia also advised that \u201c[i]f any of the non-privileged documents contain client communications not directly related to the published data, those communications, if otherwise privileged, must be removed by the reviewing court before the document may be produced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>(Under Seal), </em>748 F.2d at 895 n. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The privilege derived from \u201c[t]he work-product doctrine is closely related to the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302. Rather than protecting communications, however, the work-product privilege protects the attorney\u2019s trial preparations and allows him to \u201cassemble information, sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts, prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference.\u201d <em>See Hickman v. Taylor, </em>329 U.S. 495, 510-11, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947) (\u201cNot even the most liberal of discovery theories can justify unwarranted inquiries into the files and the mental impressions of an attorney.\u201d); <em>United States v. Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 238, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975) (\u201c[T]he work-product doctrine shelters the mental processes of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his Ghent\u2019s case.\u201d). Like the attorney-client privilege, the work-product privilege may be waived. <em>See Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 239, 95 S.Ct. 2160 (\u201cThe privilege derived from the work-product doctrine is not absolute. Like other qualified privileges, it may be waived.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Unlike the attorney-client privilege, however, the work-product privilege is not waived by mere disclosure but instead by making \u201ctestimonial use\u201d of the protected material. <em>See Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 240 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. 2160; <em>FEC v. Christian Coalition, </em>178 F.R.D. 61, 76 (E.D.Va.1998) (\u201c[Wjhile the mere showing of a voluntary disclosure to a third person will generahy suffice to show waiver of the attorney-client privilege, it should not suffice in itself for waiver of the work product privilege.\u201d). When a party makes testimonial use of work product, \u201cthe normal rules of evidence come into play with respect to cross-examination and production of documents.\u201d <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 240 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Liddy, as the proponent of the attorney-client and work-product privileges, has the burden of establishing that he has not waived them. <em>Edwards, </em>370 S.E.2d at 301 (\u201cThe proponent has the burden to establish that the attorney-client relationship existed, that the communications under consideration are privileged, and that the privilege was not waived.\u201d). Liddy has not met this burden in the instances outlined by Wells in her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">To support his motion for summary judgment, for instance, Liddy disclosed confidential communications between him and his lawyers and thereby waived his attorney-client privilege. Specifically, in the Supplemental Declaration of G. Gordon Liddy in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Liddy made the following declarations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-10\">Throughout this six-year period of consistent communication with my counsel, counsel has expressed confidence in the <em>Silent Coup </em>thesis in general and the DNC/call-girl ring connection in particular. During these telephone conversations counsel in words of substance conveyed to me that the investigation and discovery in the case significantly underscores and reinforces the <em>Silent Coup </em>thesis. In fact, counsel has stated to me that the DNC/call-girl/John Dean connection, is particularly bolstered by information uncovered about Louis Russell, who was associated with the Colum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>bia Plaza call-girl ring and who was at the Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurant at the time of the June 17, 1972 break-in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">At my November 7, 1997 deposition, I testified that sometime in 1996, my counsel advised me not to rely on Phillip Bailley as my sole source for information I discuss with listeners and audiences. I was given this instruction after Mr. Bailley\u2019s counsel had circulated a letter stating words of substance that Bailley\u2019s mental condition had deteriorated to the point that he would not be able to give reliable deposition testimony. Ms. Wells [sic] counsel did not ask me what information was the focus of counsel\u2019s instruction. This instruction had nothing to do with Ms. Wells\u2019 role in Watergate, because there is abundant evidence corroborating her connection with the call-girl ring servicing the DNC. In view of Mr. Bailley\u2019s counsel\u2019s 1996 letter concerning Bailley\u2019s deteriorating mental condition, my counsel advised that I should not rely on Bailley for the unpublished and uncorroborated information attributed to him in the Stanford proposal about a number of individuals not identified in <em>Silent Coup.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">(Exh. at 358-60.) Once Liddy decided to reveal these confidential communications, his decision to disclose became final. He may not reattach the privilege now that the issues in the case have \u201cshifted.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Fairness, and Virginia\u2019s law of privileges, requires complete disclosure of the confidential communications and the details underlying those communications, that is, all preliminary drafts and material, including notes, underlying the communication. <em>Edwards, </em>370 S.E.2d at 301. Because of the disclosures described above, Liddy has waived his privilege to the communications regarding his counsel\u2019s \u201cconfidence in the <em>Silent Coup </em>thesis in general and the DNC/call-girl ring connection in particular\u201d and counsel\u2019s advice \u201cnot to rely on Phillip Bailley,\u201d as well as the details underlying these communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">With regard to waiver of work-product, Liddy clearly made testimonial use of several privileged documents. The foremost example is the June 11, 1992 letter that Liddy\u2019s lawyers sent to counsel for St. Martin\u2019s Press providing a detailed analysis of investigation into the <em>Silent Coup </em>theory of the Watergate break-ins. At trial, Liddy testified that he had received a copy of this letter and relied on the information.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This constituted testimonial use of the letter and any claim to a work-product privilege was waived. Two other instances of testimonial use of work product occurred when Liddy was deposed. First, he stated that he learned of rumors regarding the dismissal of Oliver and Wells from his counsel. Second, the source for his knowledge of Wells dating Baldwin was also his counsel. For all these instances where Liddy made \u201ctestimonial use\u201d of work product,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the privilege is waived and the rules of discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>and evidence are therefore applicable. <em>See Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 240 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">On the issue of attorney-client and work-product privileges, we reverse the district court\u2019s ruling that there was no waiver and remand to allow discovery on the confidential communications that Liddy has disclosed and their underlying details, as well as work-product of which Liddy has made \u201ctestimonial use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Finally, Wells argues that the district court erred by denying her motion to amend her complaint. On December 29, 1999, over a year before trial, Wells sought permission to amend her complaint to include allegations that Liddy \u201cengaged in a scheme or plan that contained fraudulent activities, including fraudulent conveyances of real estate and other properties and interests.\u201d (J.A. at 967.) Specifically, Wells alleged that Liddy transferred significant assets to his wife in an attempt to protect those assets from a potential judgment against him. On October 12, 2000, the district court entered an order denying the motion. The order stated that \u201c[ujpon consideration of the memoranda submitted in connection with the various pending motions filed by plaintiff and the correspondence from counsel pertaining to those motions, it is ... ordered [that] Plaintiffs motion for leave to file second amended complaint is denied.\u201d (J.A. at 992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a) applies when a party who has already pleaded in a case seeks to amend her pleadings. Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). Rule 15(a) provides that \u201ca party may amend the party\u2019s pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a responsive pleading is served.... Otherwise a party may amend the party\u2019s pleading only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The Supreme Court has demanded that, \u201c[i]n the absence of any apparent or declared reason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \u2018freely given.\u2019\u201d <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962). In application of this mandate, the district court is \u201cin a better position than we are to determine whether the motion for leave to amend was unduly delayed and whether granting the motion would result in undue prejudice.\u201d <em>In re Jeffrey Bigelow Design Group, Inc., </em>956 F.2d 479, 483 (4th Cir. 1992). We therefore review the district court\u2019s denial to grant leave to amend the complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lone Star Steakhouse &amp; Saloon, Inc. v. Alpha of Virginia, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 922, 941 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Wells argues that the district court abused its discretion by not giving a reason for its decision. <em>See Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962) (\u201cOf course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the District Court, but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the Federal Rules.\u201d). Wells quotes the \u201ccurt\u201d language of the district court\u2019s October 12, 2000 order and argues that <em>\u201cnobody </em>suggested a reason for denying Wells\u2019s motion.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 62.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>On August 18, 2000, Liddy\u2019s attorneys wrote a letter to the district court in response to a letter written by Wells\u2019s attorney on August 7, 2000. This letter argued that \u201cthere is no reason to address this issue now, or for Wells to raise it \u2014 other than to harass Mr. and Mrs. Liddy. This plainly is not a jury issue. As such, Wells\u2019s attempt to raise this issue is premature and the Court need not address it now, if ever.\u201d (J.A. at 3543.) The letter also pointed out that denying the motion \u201cwould not prejudice Wells\u2019s right to pursue relief in the future.\u201d (J.A. at 3543.) This letter clearly constitutes part of the \u201ccorrespondence from counsel\u201d upon which the district court relied in rendering its October 12, 2000 ruling. (J.A. at 992.) We conclude that the reasons underlying the district court\u2019s denial of Wells\u2019s motion were apparent and \u201cas long as its reasons are apparent, a district court\u2019s failure to articulate grounds for denying a plaintiffs leave to amend does not amount to an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hosp. v. American National Red Cross, </em>101 F.3d 1005, 1010 (4th Cir. 1996). Moreover, we conclude that those reasons fit within the scope of the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>6 Charles Alan Wright et al., <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1487 (2d ed.1990) (explaining that if the district court determines \u201cthat the issues raised by the amendment are remote from the other issues in the case and might confuse or mislead the jury, leave to amend well may be denied\u201d). The district court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in denying Wells\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">In conclusion, we hold that a reasonable jury relying on the evidence in the record could find that Liddy was at least negligent in making the allegedly defamatory statements, and we therefore reverse the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of Liddy. We affirm the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings with the exception of its exclusion of deposition testimony from Gainsburg and McCormack and its inclusion of evidence that someone calling Phillip Bailley identified herself as Maxie Wells. We reverse the district court on the issue of Liddy\u2019s attorney client and work-product privileges, finding an implied waiver due to Liddy\u2019s disclosures of confidential information. Finally, we conclude that the reasons justifying the district court\u2019s denial of Wells\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint are apparent and proper, and, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for discovery of the formerly privileg\u00e9d materials described above and a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\">. These past events that are more completely recounted in our earlier opinion. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>186 F.3d 505, 513-518 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-10\">. The conventional theory is that the motive behind the Watergate break-in was to replace a malfunctioning listening device that had been installed in an earlier break-in at the DNC. <em>See, e.g. </em>Karlyn Barker &amp; Walter Pincus, <em>Watergate Revisited, </em>Wash. Post, June 14, 1992, at Al.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-8\">. Initially, in addition to the JMU speech and the cruise ship speech, Wells alleged that Liddy made defamatory statements that were quoted on the Accuracy in Media web site, broadcast on the Don &amp; Mike radio show, and broadcast on the Hardball television show. The defamation claims based on the statements made on the Don &amp; Mike show and appearing in the Accuracy in Media web site were dismissed by the district court on summary judgment and we affirmed. <em>See \"Wells, </em>186 F.3d at 527-31. Wells voluntarily dismissed the Hardball claim prior to the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. <em>See Wells v. Liddy, </em>1 F.Supp.2d 532, 534 n. 1 (D.Md. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b106-13\">. The parties, however, have since stipulated to the application of Virginia law to both of Liddy\u2019s statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b107-8\">. Recovery of presumed or punitive damages for defamation under Virginia law requires a finding of actual malice, that is, clear and convincing evidence that Liddy made the statements with \"knowledge of [their] falsity or reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d <em>Gazette, Inc., </em>325 S.E.2d at 724.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b108-5\">. The district court also noted that a third party was present at Liddy\u2019s interview of Bailley, demonstrating that Liddy and Bailley were not engaged in casual conversation, and that Liddy relied on the judgment of a well-known author, James Hougan, who also determined that Bailley was telling the truth. <em>See Wells, </em>135 F.Supp. at 670-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b109-6\">. Likewise, that Liddy obtained the information from Bailley in a formal interview and that Hougan also relied on Bailley do not corroborate Wells's alleged role. <em>See Wells, </em>135 F.Supp. at 670-71.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b109-7\">. Indeed, we have already held that sole reliance on such an unreliable source creates a genuine issue of material fact with regard to the higher standard, that is, whether Liddy acted with actual malice. <em>See Wells, </em>186 F.3d at 544 (\"The inference that Bailley was Liddy's only source directly connecting Wells to prostitution activity combined with Liddy\u2019s acknowledgment that he knew Bailley was not reliable is sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Liddy acted with actual malice.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b109-8\">. Wells divides her assignments of error regarding evidentiary rulings into four categories. Our general analysis of the merit of each category is as follows. First, the district court carefully explained various considerations weighing against the introduction of evidence probative to Liddy\u2019s state of mind and was within its discretion when it excluded or placed reasonable limits on the introduction of such evidence. <em>Cf., e.g., Benedi v. McNeil-P.P.C., Inc., </em>66 F.3d 1378, 1385 (4th Cir. 1995) (describing the district court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence of notice under Rule 403 and instruct the jury regarding such evidence). Second, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting testimony on the call-girl theory. This evidence was probative of Liddy\u2019s state of mind when he made the JMU and cruise ship speeches. Moreover, because state-of-mind evidence is not introduced to prove the truth of its content, the best evidence rule does not apply. <em>See </em>Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 1002.05[1] (2d ed. 2001) (\"The rule is inapplicable when content is not at issue.\u201d). Third, the district court properly admitted evidence on the issue of truth-falsity. Evidence that a prostitution ring was operating at the Columbia Plaza is only one piece of circumstantial evidence that Liddy presents in an attempt to draw the conclusion that Wells was connected with the prostitution ring. It is a well-settled principle that \"circumstantial evidence is no less probative than direct evidence.\u201d <em>Stamper v. Muncie, </em>944 F.2d 170, 174 (4th Cir.1991) (\"[Cjircumstances altogether inconclusive, if separately considered, may, by their number and joint operation, especially when corrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>rated by moral coincidences, be sufficient to constitute conclusive proof.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). Fourth, the district court properly admitted into evidence the letter Wells wrote to a close friend on September 13, 1972, just prior to her appearance before the grand jury that indicted Liddy. In this letter, written at the time Wells was working at the DNC, she expresses concerns about being implicated in immoral and possibly illegal activities. Liddy\u2019s statements concerned Wells's involvement in an illegal prostitution ring while working at the DNC office. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting this letter as evidence of Liddy\u2019s state of mind when he made the cruise ship speech. Liddy found out about the letter after he made the JMU speech but before he made the cruise ship speech. <em>See Wells, </em>135 F.Supp.2d at 673.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">. The district court properly defined the jury\u2019s role in judging authentication by explaining to the jury that it must determine whether callers who identified themselves were telling the truth about who they were. The district court must, however, determine whether there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find in favor of authenticity before submitting this issue to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b111-10\">. We previously reviewed and affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of Wells\u2019s June 25, 1997 Motion to Compel. <em>See Wells, </em>186 F.3d at 518 n. 12. That motion was based on Liddy\u2019s alleged failure to produce a privilege log and therefore law of the case does not apply to the issue now before us: whether Liddy waived the attorney-client and work-product privileges through disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. The Federal Rules of Evidence provide that \"in civil actions and proceedings, with respect to an element of a claim or defense as to which State law supplies the rule of decision, the privilege of a witness, person, government, State, or political subdivision thereof shall be determined in accordance with State law.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b114-6\">. When asked by the court if he had used privileged material as a sword, Liddy\u2019s counsel replied, \"Yes, I did. [But] we were involved in an actual malice proceeding at the time. That has shifted. We are not going to do that at trial.\u201d (J.A. at 485.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b114-7\">.

General statements Liddy made about correspondence with counsel, such as that he \"received a lot of materials [and] communications in the mail from counsel ...\u201d (J.A. for No. 98-1962 at 1144), do not constitute \"testimonial use\u201d and therefore do not constitute a general waiver of all work product ever sent to Liddy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
