R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-20\">Johnathan Harmon, a state court prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his <em>habeas corpus </em>petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We deny Mr. Harmon a certificate of appealability, dismiss his appeal, and grant his motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-21\">A jury convicted Mr. Harmon of possession of cocaine after a former felony conviction in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, \u00a7 2-402. In accordance with a jury recommendation, the state court sentenced Mr. Harmon to twelve years imprisonment. On appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Mr. Harmon\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-22\">Thereafter, Mr. Harmon filed a <em>pro se </em>application for state post-conviction relief in federal district court claiming: (1) the trial court improperly refused to suppress evidence of cocaine base seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (2) there was insufficient evidence to prove knowing and intentional possession of cocaine; and (3) the trial court plainly erred when it gave jury instructions modifying the first element of the charged offense from the conjunctive knowing <em>and </em>intentional to the disjunctive knowing <em>or </em>intentional. The district court referred the petition to a magistrate judge, who issued a lengthy Report and Recommendation. The magis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>trate judge analyzed Mr. Harmon\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, concluding he had a full and fair opportunity to litigate it in state court. The magistrate judge reviewed the evidence presented at trial and concluded the record supported the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019 determination of sufficient evidence. And, the magistrate judge carefully reviewed the trial court\u2019s jury instructions and concluded they neither misstated the applicable law nor rendered Mr. Harmon\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair. Accordingly, the magistrate judge recommended denying habeas relief. After reviewing the entire record, the magistrate judge\u2019s report, and Mr. Harmon\u2019s objections to the report, the district judge concurred and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Mr. Harmon requests we issue a certificate of appealability on the three issues raised in his district court habeas petition. To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, Mr. Harmon must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. 2253(c)(2). Because the district court rejected his claims on the merits, Mr. Harmon must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of [his] constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Upon review of Mr. Harmon\u2019s briefs and contentions, the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and the entire record on appeal, we conclude that the district court\u2019s resolution of Mr. Harmon\u2019s petition is not fairly debatable among reasonable jurists.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Mr. Harmon requests a certificate of appealability on (1) whether trial errors and prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial and due process rights and resulted in an excessive sentence, and (2) whether the district court\u2019s acceptance of the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation was clearly erroneous. \u201cBecause we will generally not consider issues raised on appeal that were not first presented to the district court,\u201d we do not address these issues. <em>Rhine v. Boone, </em>182 F.3d 1153, 1154 (10th Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1084, 120 S.Ct. 808, 145 L.Ed.2d 681 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">For this reason, Mr. Harmon\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability is denied and his appeal is DISMISSED. Mr. Harmon\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b458-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
