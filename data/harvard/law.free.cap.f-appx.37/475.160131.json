Among other issues, Charm challenges his trial attorney\u2019s conceding Charm\u2019s guilt during first-stage opening argument. Because defense counsel was not constitutionally ineffective in doing so, we affirm the district court\u2019s denying Charm relief on this, and his remaining claims for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">\n<em>I. FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Fourteen-year-old Brandy Hill had traveled to Lawton, Oklahoma, to spend several weeks with her father during her summer vacation. On July 20, 1993, Charm and his sixteen-year-old cousin, Ronald Jessie, visited Michael Hill, the girl\u2019s father. Charm and Hill were described as drinking buddies.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-16\">As Charm and Jessie drove away from the Hill residence that afternoon, they spied Brandy walking down the street. The two men lured her into their car. Jessie then wrapped a piece of cloth around Brandy Hill\u2019s neck. The men drove the victim to a field. There, both Charm and Jessie each twice raped the girl. Afterwards, Jessie tried to choke her to death with the piece of cloth. He could not kill her, however. Charm then tried, still without success. Finally, Jessie retrieved a sledgehammer from the car\u2019s trunk and hit the girl twice in the head. Charm then hit her several more times. The two men left Brandy Hill\u2019s body there in the field, where it was discovered several days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">Jurors convicted Charm of first-degree malice-aforethought murder, kidnapping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and first-degree rape. They sentenced Charm to fifty-four and one hundred twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, respectively, on the kidnapping and rape convictions, which were enhanced in light of Charm\u2019s nine prior felony convictions. After finding the existence of the three charged aggravating factors \u2014 Charm had killed the victim to avoid arrest or prosecution for kidnapping and raping her, the killing was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, and Charm was a continuing threat to society \u2014 the jury sentenced Charm to death on the murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Charm\u2019s convictions and sentences on direct appeal, and denied him post-conviction relief. <em>See Charm v. State, </em>924 P.2d 754 (Okla.Crim.App.1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>520 U.S. 1200, 117 S.Ct. 1560, 137 L.Ed.2d 707 (1997); <em>Charm v. State, </em>953 P.2d 47 (Okla.Crim.App.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\n<em>II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Charm will be entitled to federal habeas relief only if he can establish that the state courts\u2019 resolution of his claims was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established\u201d Supreme Court precedent, or was \u201cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We presume correct any state-court factual finding, absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2254(e)(1). If the state courts did not address the merits of a habeas claim, however, we will review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo, </em>and that court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>See, e.g., Romano v. Gibson, </em>278 F.3d 1145, 1150 (10th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>III. ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\"><em>A. Ineffective representation. </em>Charm contends his trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective when, during the trial\u2019s first-stage opening argument, counsel conceded Charm\u2019s guilt. In addition, Charm argues that his appellate attorney was ineffective for failing to challenge, on direct appeal, this deficient trial representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">\n<em>1. Trial representation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\"><em>a. Procedural default. </em>The State initially asserts that Charm procedurally defaulted his ineffective-trial-counsel claim. Charm did not challenge trial counsel\u2019s first-stage representation on direct appeal. Therefore, when Charm first raised the issue, in his state post-conviction proceeding, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals held that, because Charm could have raised this issue on direct appeal but did not, he had procedurally defaulted this claim. <em>See Charm, </em>953 P.2d at 49-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-11\">A federal court will not review a habeas claim that the petitioner has defaulted in state court, based upon an adequate state procedural bar independent of federal law, unless the petitioner can show cause and prejudice excusing his default, or that the federal court\u2019s failure to consider the claim will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. <em>See, e.g., Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 729-30, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). Charm seems to argue, however, that the state bar at issue here is not adequate because, under Oklahoma procedural rules, he could not have sufficiently developed the direct-appeal record to present this ineffective-trial-counsel claim. <em>Cf., e.g., Sallahdin v. Gibson, </em>275 F.3d 1211, 1234-35 (10th Cir.2002) (noting, in dicta, that Oklahoma\u2019s procedural bar, precluding post-conviction review of ineffective-trial-counsel claim not raised on direct appeal, was not adequate where claim could not have been resolved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>solely on trial record). Here, it does not appear that Oklahoma procedural bar is adequate because trial counsel\u2019s strategy was explored in post-trial proceedings. Because the state appellate court did not address this claim\u2019s merit, however, we review the district court\u2019s decision denying habeas relief <em>de novo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and any factual findings only for clear error. <em>See Romano, </em>278 F.3d at 1150; <em>see also Fisher v. Gibson, </em>282 F.3d 1283, 1290 (10th Cir. 2002) (discussing review standards applicable to this court\u2019s pre-AEDPA review of ineffective-assistance claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>b. Merits.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">During his first-stage opening argument, defense counsel made the following statements suggesting Charm\u2019s guilt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdY\">this is a case that is about a horrible human event. There is no question about that, and that\u2019s what the evidence will show. We\u2019re not disagreeing with the prosecutor in terms of what the evidence will show. In fact, I\u2019ll tell you now that we will tell you before I conclude this opening statement that we believe after the prosecutor presents the evidence there will be a basis there for you to find Kenneth Charm guilty of first degree murder. I will tell you that now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">I also tell you there will be a basis there in the evidence to find him guilty of kidnapping and rape....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">We will not present evidence that ... makes Kenneth Charm not guilty....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">... We believe that the evidence will show, again, at the close of the State\u2019s case as I told you when I started that there is a basis for you to find Mr. Charm guilty of these three offenses. And then we will ask you to spare his life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Trial tr., vol. 3 at 652, 659, 661. Charm asserts several challenges to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\"><em>i. Trial counsel abandoned his adversarial role, resulting in per se ineffective representation. </em>A criminal defendant is deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to effective representation \u201cif counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, mak[ing] the adversary process itself presumptively unreliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). \u201c[A]n attorney who adopts and acts upon a belief that his client should be convicted \u2018fail[s] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government\u2019s adversary.\u2019\u201d <em>Osborn v. Shillinger, </em>861 F.2d 612, 625 (10th Cir.1988) (quoting <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 666, 104 S.Ct. 2039).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-15\">A defense attorney who abandons his duty of loyalty to his client and effectively joins the state in an effort to attain a conviction or death sentence suffers from an obvious conflict of interest, and thereby fails to provide effective assistance. Usually, when a defendant claims ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney\u2019s performance was inadequate, he must show both constitutionally deficient performance and that he was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s errors. In the event of an actual conflict of interest occasioned by abandonment, [however,] prejudice is presumed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>Davis v. Executive Dir. of Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>100 F.3d 750, 756-57 (10th Cir.1996) (citations, further quotation omitted); <em>see also Osborn, </em>861 F.2d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Here, defense counsel did not abandon his \u201c \u2018overarching duty to advocate the defendant\u2019s cause.\u2019\u201d <em>Osborn, </em>861 F.2d at 628 (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). Rather, defense counsel was faced with overwhelming evidence establishing Charm\u2019s guilt, including foremost Charm\u2019s own videotaped confession describing in detail his participation in these horrific crimes. <em>See Hale v. Gibson, </em>227 F.3d 1298, 1323 (10th Cir.2000) (holding counsel did not abandon defendant when, during first-stage closing, counsel stated there was no doubt defendant was involved in capital crime, in light of overwhelming evidence indicating so, but further arguing defendant might not have been only participant), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 957, 121 S.Ct. 2608, 150 L.Ed.2d 764 (2001); <em>see also Davis, </em>100 F.3d at 758-59. And defense counsel did pursue pretrial motions on Charm\u2019s behalf, cross-examined the State\u2019s witnesses, made evidentiary objections at trial and asserted in Charm\u2019s defense the minimal evidence available indicating that Charm might have been intoxicated at the time of the crimes. <em>See Cooks v. Ward, </em>165 F.3d 1283, 1296 (10th Cir.1998) (holding counsel\u2019s performance did not so deny defendant representation such that prejudice should be presumed, where defense counsel did conduct limited cross-examination, made evidentiary objections and gave closing argument). To be entitled to relief under <em>Cronic, </em>\u201cthe attorney\u2019s failure must[, instead,] be complete.\u201d <em>Bell v. Cone, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 S.Ct. 1843, 1851, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, -(2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Trial counsel\u2019s apparent strategy was to maintain credibility with the jury during the first stage so that he could strongly pursue a sentence less than death during the penalty phase. <em>See </em>Trial tr., vol. 5 at 1470 (defense counsel\u2019s second-stage closing argument). And counsel did fully assert a case in mitigation during the trial\u2019s capital-sentencing stage. Defense counsel, thus, did not act \u201cwith reckless disregard for his client\u2019s best interests,\u201d nor did he intentionally \u201cweaken his client\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Osborn, </em>861 F.2d at 629. After examining the entire record, see <em>Houchin v. Zavaras, </em>107 F.3d 1465, 1471 (10th Cir.1997), therefore, we cannot conclude that defense counsel abandoned Charm, \u201csuch that the adversarial process was undermined,\u201d <em>Davis, </em>100 F.3d at 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\"><em>ii. Trial counsel was ineffective in pleading Charm guilty without his consent. </em>Charm further argues that defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective for essentially pleading Charm guilty without his consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following an evidentiary hearing, however, the federal district court found that Charm had, in fact, consented to trial counsel\u2019s strategy of conceding, at the beginning of trial, that the State would present sufficient evidence for jurors to convict Charm. <em>See </em>District ct. mem. op. at 16-17. In doing so, the district court relied on defense counsel\u2019s testimony, finding Charm\u2019s contrary testimony not credible. <em>See id. </em>These factual findings were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>not clearly erroneous. <em>See, e.g., Bryan v. Gibson, </em>276 F.3d 1163, 1174, 1175 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">Furthermore, the pretrial proceedings in this case bolster the district court\u2019s factual finding that Charm consented to trial counsel\u2019s strategy. <em>Cf. Lobosco v. Thomas, </em>928 F.2d 1054, 1057 (11th Cir.1991) (discussing facts that buttressed, but were not necessary to, district court\u2019s finding that petitioner had consented to defense counsel\u2019s conceding petitioner\u2019s guilt). Following his arrest, Charm confessed. <em>See id. </em>And, during a pretrial motions hearing, Charm sought the court\u2019s permission not to attend trial, stating \u201c[tjhere is no doubt in my mind on my guilt or innocence, and I didn\u2019t come up here to ... plea[d] or nothing. But ... I wish not to be present.... [WJithin my heart and within the Lord\u2019s heart I feel that I am guilty of all but ...\u201d Sept. 15, 1994 motions hr\u2019g tr. at 19-20.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">... I feel that I am guilty of all charges but one.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But ... I wish not to be present in the court. I will stand up on top of this building and tell the jury when we pick[ ] the jury the same thing before the trial ever gets picked. You can chain me to a chair, put duct tape to my mouth but I want them to know this before any of that court procedure goes on. I have asked my attorney to come to the D.A. to inform him of ... my guilt of two charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 20. When the trial court offered to let Charm plead guilty to two of the three charges, however, Charm declined. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Again, immediately prior to jury selection, Charm told the trial judge that \u201cI admitted to my guilt of the crime just like I will ... in front of the jury. I admitted my guilt so I don\u2019t see no-for-for, uh, this madness.\u201d Trial tr., vol. 1 at 18. Again, the trial court offered to let Charm plead guilty, to which Charm did not respond. <em>See id. </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">Furthermore, at the federal evidentiary hearing, Charm\u2019s defense attorney testified that Charm had confessed to counsel his participation in these crimes and asserted to defense counsel that \u201che did not want to fight the case.\u201d Nov. 2, 1999 hr\u2019g tr. at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">The district court\u2019s factual finding, therefore, that Charm had consented to defense counsel\u2019s strategy was not clearly erroneous and now precludes habeas relief on this ineffective-trial-counsel claim. <em>Cf. United States v. Jones, </em>287 F.3d 325, 330-31 (5th Cir.2002) (denying relief on similar claim in part because defendant had consented to defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy); <em>Lobosco, </em>928 F.2d at 1057 (denying habeas relief where record established that defendant knew and agreed with trial counsel\u2019s strategy to admit guilt and then try to avoid death sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\"><em>Hi. Trial counsel\u2019s unreasonable first-stage strategy prejudiced Charm\u2019s defense. </em>Charm also argues that his trial attorney\u2019s first-stage representation was constitutionally ineffective under <em>Strickland. Strickland </em>requires that Charm establish both that trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that any deficiency prejudiced Charm\u2019s defense. <em>See </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">For deficient performance, Charm must show that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\u2019s performance must be highly deferential.... A fair as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>sessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. There is, then, \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Charm, therefore, \u201cmust overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(further quotation omitted). \u201c[Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">In this case, defense counsel\u2019s strategy was to acknowledge, at the beginning of trial, that the State would present sufficient evidence for the jury to convict Charm, in order to maintain credibility with the jury for the second stage, where defense counsel hoped to save Charm\u2019s life. The question presented here, then, is whether this strategy was reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 481, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). \u201cFor counsel\u2019s actions to rise to the level of constitutional ineffectiveness, [this] strategic decision[ ] must have been completely unreasonable, not merely wrong, so that [it] bear[s] no relationship to a possible defense strategy.\u201d <em>Fox v. Ward, </em>200 F.3d 1286, 1296 (10th Cir.2000) (further quotations omitted). Under the circumstances of this case, defense counsel\u2019s strategy was reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Hale, </em>227 F.3d at 1323 (holding counsel\u2019s conceding petitioner had some involvement in kidnapping and murder was reasonable strategy in light of overwhelming evidence against petitioner, where defense counsel further argued that others may also have been involved); <em>Trice v. Ward, </em>196 F.3d 1151, 1161-62 (10th Cir.1999) (holding defense counsel\u2019s strategy of admitting defendant raped victim and, instead arguing defendant did not have specific intent to commit first-degree murder, was reasonable, in light of defendant\u2019s confession to rape, which was corroborated by physical evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The State\u2019s evidence overwhelmingly established Charm\u2019s guilt. Most damning was Charm\u2019s own videotaped confession, which defense counsel had tried unsuccessfully to suppress. Moreover, in his opening argument, defense counsel did not specifically assert that Charm was guilty, but only that the State would present evidence upon which the jury could convict him.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Additionally, by not letting Charm plead guilty, defense counsel insured that a jury, rather than the trial judge, would make the capital sentencing decision. <em>See </em>Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.10. Trial counsel believed that, under the circumstances, if Charm had, instead, pled guilty, the trial judge would certainly have imposed a death sentence. <em>See </em>Nov. 2, 1999 hr\u2019g tr. at 39^0. Charm does not assert any reason to think this belief was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Even if we could deem this strategy unreasonable, defense counsel\u2019s concession did not prejudice Charm\u2019s defense. To establish prejudice, Charm must show that, in light of the totality of the evidence, \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We cannot reach that conclusion here. The State\u2019s evidence establishing Charm\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. Charm confessed, on videotape and in great detail, to committing these crimes. And the State\u2019s other evidence directly corroborated many of the details of Charm\u2019s confession. Further, any evidence indicating Charm was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>intoxicated at the time he kidnapped, raped, and murdered the victim was very minimal. Even if defense counsel had not begun the trial by acknowledging that the State\u2019s evidence would be sufficient for jurors to convict Charm, there is no reasonable probability jurors would have had a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. <em>See, e.g., Hale, </em>227 F.3d at 1322-23; <em>Cooks, </em>165 F.3d at 1293; <em>cf. Anderson v. Calderon, </em>232 F.3d 1053, 1090 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 580, 151 L.Ed.2d 451 (2001), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized, Osband v. Woodford, </em>290 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Clozza v. Murray, </em>913 F.2d 1092, 1098, 1100-01 (4th Cir.1990); <em>Messer v. Kemp, </em>760 F.2d 1080, 1090-91 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>2. Appellate representation. </em>Charm further asserts that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge, on direct appeal, trial counsel\u2019s first-stage opening argument conceding Charm\u2019s guilt. Direct-appeal counsel will be constitutionally ineffective if she was objectively unreasonable in failing to raise the meffective-trial-representation claim and if there is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unreasonable failure\u201d to raise this claim, Charm \u201cwould have prevailed on his [direct] appeal.\u201d <em>Smith v. Robbins, </em>528 U.S. 259, 285, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) (applying Strickland). The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals did address this claim\u2019s merit, denying relief. <em>See Charm, </em>953 P.2d at 49-50. In doing so, however, the state appellate court did not apply this legal standard. <em>See id. </em>We, therefore, review this claim <em>de novo, </em>applying <em>Strickland. See Romano, </em>278 F.3d at 1150. <em>See generally Revilla v. Gibson, </em>283 F.3d 1203, 1220 n. 14 (10th Cir.2002) (reviewing ineffective-assistance claim <em>de novo </em>where state appellate court applied incorrect legal standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">\u201cIn order to properly address th[is] issue[ ], we must look to the merits of the omitted issue.\u201d <em>Hain v. Gibson, </em>287 F.3d 1224, 1231 (10th Cir.2002) (farther quotation omitted). In light of the preceding discussion concluding Charm\u2019s underlying ineffective-trial-counsel claim lacks merit, however, there is no reasonable probability that, had appellate counsel raised this claim, Charm would have prevailed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\"><em>B. Lesser-included-ojfense instruction. Beck v. Alabama, </em>447 U.S. 625, 100 S.Ct. 2382, 65 L.Ed.2d 392 (1980), provides that a death sentence may not \u201cconstitutionally be imposed after a jury verdict of guilt of a capital offense, when the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 627, 100 S.Ct. 2382 (further quotation omitted). Charm contends that, in his case, the trial court violated <em>Beck </em>and, thus, deprived him of due process, by failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of first-degree manslaughter. Applying <em>Beck, </em>the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals held that there was insufficient evidence to warrant instructing the jury on first-degree manslaughter. <em>See Charm, </em>924 P.2d at 759-60. That decision was reasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The relevant inquiry here is \u201cwhether the evidence presented at trial would permit a rational jury to find [Charm] guilty\u201d of first-degree manslaughter \u201cand acquit him of first-degree murder.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Gibson, </em>262 F.3d 1036, 1050 (10th Cir. 2001) (further quotation omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Oklahoma law, in relevant part, defines first-degree manslaughter as a homicide \u201cperpetrated without a design to effect death, and in a heat of passion, but in a cruel and unusual manner, or by means of a dangerous weapon; unless it is committed under such circumstances as constitute excusable or justifiable homicide.\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 711(2). \u201cThe elements of heat of passion are 1) adequate provocation; 2) a passion or emotion such as fear, terror, anger, rage or resentment; 3)[the] homicide occurred while the passion still existed and before a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool; and 4) a causal connection between the provocation, passion and homicide.\u201d <em>Hogan, </em>197 F.3d at 1308 (further quotation omitted) (citing Oklahoma cases). On the other hand, under applicable Oklahoma law, \u201c[a] person commits murder in the first degree when that person unlawfully and with malice aforethought causes the death of another human being. Malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a human being, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.\u201d Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 701.7(A) (Supp.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The record here is simply devoid of any evidence indicating any adequate provocation specifically, or heat of passion generally, producing Brandy Hill\u2019s death. The evidence, therefore, did not warrant a first-degree-manslaughter instruction. The state appellate court, thus, reasonably denied Charm relief on this <em>Beck </em>claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\"><em>C. Was there sufficient evidence to support the aggravating factors? </em>Charm argues there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding the existence of the three charged aggravating factors. In this habeas proceeding, the relevant question presented is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the [presence of the aggravating factor] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Fields v. Gibson, </em>277 F.3d 1203, 1220 (10th Cir.2002) (applying <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)) (further quotation omitted); <em>see also Lewis v. Jeffers, </em>497 U.S. 764, 780-83, 110 S.Ct. 3092, 111 L.Ed.2d 606 (1990). The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, however, in addressing these claims, applied a different legal standard, considering instead only whether there was \u201ccompetent\u201d evidence to support the aggravators. <em>Charm, </em>924 P.2d at 770. We will, therefore, review these claims <em>de novo, </em>applying <em>Jackson. See Romano, </em>278 F.3d at 1150; <em>see also Fields, </em>277 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>1220 (noting that, prior to AEDPA, this court reviewed similar claim <em>de </em>novo).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><em>1. Continuing threat. </em>Under Oklahoma law, the continuing-threat aggravator may be established solely on the basis of the callous nature of the crime itself. <em>See, e.g., Sallahdin, </em>275 F.3d at 1232. Here, then, the facts of the kidnapping, rape and murder alone are sufficient to support this aggravating factor. <em>See, e.g., James v. Gibson, </em>211 F.3d. 543, 559 (10th Cir.2000). In addition, however, the defense\u2019s own psychologist testified that Charm was a continuing threat to society. <em>See </em>Trial tr., vol. 5 at 1311. The State\u2019s psychologist, too, asserted that Charm\u2019s personal insecurity made it possible that he would become aggressive or assaultive. And while his nine prior felonies had generally been nonviolent, Charm had received prison disciplinary reports for fighting, threatening to kill another inmate and possessing a homemade weapon. <em>See, e.g., James, </em>211 F.3d at 559 (determining evidence was sufficient to support jury\u2019s finding this aggravator, relying in part on threats defendant made while in custody and his possession of homemade weapons while in prison). In addition, during his confession, Charm threatened to kill his wife. And he had previously threatened to kill a former work supervisor. Furthermore, a few days after this kidnapping, rape and murder, Charm robbed a convenience store by pretending to have a weapon and threatening to kill the clerk. The record, therefore, was sufficient for a rational jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Charm was a continuing threat to society.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\"><em>2. Avoid arrest or prosecution. </em>The jury found that Charm killed the victim to avoid arrest or prosecution. \u201cUnder Oklahoma law,\u201d the avoid-arrest aggravating factor \u201cfocuses on the defendant\u2019s intent, which can be proven either through his own statements or circumstantial evidence, and additionally requires proof of a predicate crime, other than the murder, for which the defendant seeks to avoid arrest or prosecution.\u201d <em>Romano, </em>278 F.3d at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Here, the kidnapping and rape supply the necessary predicate crimes. Further, the victim knew both her attackers. <em>See, e.g., Romano v. Gibson, </em>239 F.3d 1156, 1179 (10th Cir.) (determining evidence was sufficient for jury to find this aggravator, where defendant told acquaintance he would have to kill victim after robbing him, because victim knew and could identify petitioner), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 S.Ct. 624, 151 L.Ed.2d 545 (2001). Additionally, according to Charm\u2019s own confession, after the rapes, Jessie had asked Charm what they were going to do with the victim. It was only then that Jessie began choking her. Because Jessie was unable to Mil her, however, Charm then tried to choke her to death. According to Charm, \u201cshe wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d Trial tr., vol. 3 at 847. Finally, after stating that somebody was going to come, Jessie retrieved the sledgehammer from the car\u2019s trunk and Mt the victim in the head several times with it. After noting that \u201cshe was still moving,\u201d Charm remarked, \u201c \u2018[m]an, we\u2019re going to go to jail,\u2019 \u201d and then he hit her, too, to \u201cmake sure she was dead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 847, 863-64. <em>See LaFevers v. Gibson, </em>182 F.3d 705, 723 (10th Cir.1999) (determining evidence was sufficient for jury to find this aggravating factor under similar circumstances). The two men then hid the victim\u2019s body and returned to Michael Hill\u2019s home to establish an alibi. This evidence was more than sufficient for a rational trier of fact to find this aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\"><em>3. Especially heinous, atrocious or cruel. </em>\u201cA murder is especially heinous, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>atrocious or cruel under Oklahoma law if it is preceded by torture or serious physical abuse. Torture includes the infliction of either great physical anguish or extreme mental cruelty, while physical abuse requires evidence of conscious physical suffering.\u201d <em>Toles v. Gibson, </em>269 F.3d 1167, 1183 (10th Cir.2001) (further quotation omitted). Here, again, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find this aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt. Charm and Jessie abducted the victim, wrapping a piece of cloth around her neck. According to Charm\u2019s own confession, the victim kept pleading with them, asking them over and over again to please take her home and not hurt her. <em>See Jones v. Gibson, </em>206 F.3d 946, 953 (10th Cir.2000) (noting that under Oklahoma law, victim\u2019s uncertainty as to her fate will suffice to establish mental anguish or torture). In addition, according to the medical examiner, the victim sustained physical injuries during the kidnapping and rapes, including scratches or a bruise over her right eye and on her right cheek, neck, abdomen and chest, and her left wrist, front and back, as well as her left elbow and arm. <em>See Moore v. Gibson, </em>195 F.3d 1152, 1177 (10th Cir. 1999) (determining evidence was sufficient to support jury\u2019s finding that murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel under similar circumstances). The injuries to her left wrist were consistent with defensive wounds. <em>See Fox, </em>200 F.3d at 1299 (determining evidence was sufficient to support this aggravating factor where, among other things, victim suffered defensive wounds). Additionally, trauma to her vaginal area corroborated the confessed rapes. Charm also confessed that the victim continued pleading during the rapes, asking that they not hurt her. <em>See id. </em>(testimony that victim cried out and begged for his life during attack supports finding victim endured conscious physical suffering). After the rapes, both Charm and Jessie each attempted, unsuccessfully, to strangle the victim. Finally, they each hit her several times over the head with a sledgehammer. While it is unclear when, between the strangulation and the bludgeoning, the victim finally lost consciousness, the preceding events were more than sufficient to establish both torture and conscious physical suffering during the attack. <em>See, e.g., Hooks, </em>184 F.3d at 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>TV. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the denial of habeas relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b525-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-10\">. The district court ultimately concluded Charm had procedurally defaulted this ineffective-trial-counsel claim. Nonetheless, that court also addressed this claim\u2019s merit in considering Charm\u2019s argument that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge, on direct appeal, trial counsel's representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-5\">. Clearly established Supreme Court authority does require the trial court, when a defendant enters a guilty plea, to determine whether the defendant is doing so knowingly and voluntarily. <em>See, e.g., Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242-44, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). Nonetheless, Charm does not specifically argue to this court that the trial court was required to do so under the circumstances here. Nor did Charm assert such a claim in state court. Charm, instead, confines his argument here to challenging only trial counsel's representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b529-9\">. During his second-stage testimony, Charm asserted that he was guilty of murder and he did not understand the legal requirements for kidnapping. <em>See </em>Trial tr., vol. 5 at 1397. It appears, then, that he believed he was not guilty of rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">. Charm never requested that the trial court instruct the jury on first-degree manslaughter. Rather, at trial, he unsuccessfully sought instructions on second-degree-depraved-mind murder and first-degree felony murder. This court has held that a petitioner will not be entitled to habeas relief under <em>Beck </em>if he did not request the specific lesser-included-offense instruction at trial. <em>See Hooks v. Ward, </em>184 F.3d 1206, 1234-35 (10th Cir.1999). In <em>Hooks, </em>however, this court was reviewing that <em>Beck </em>claim <em>de novo. See id. </em>at 1223. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>on the other hand, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals did address, in the first instance, whether there was sufficient evidence to support giving the unrequested first-degree-manslaughter instruction. Because our focus, under AEDPA, is the reasonableness of the state court's decision, <em>see Valdez v. Ward, </em>219 F.3d 1222, 1242-43 (10th Cir.2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 979, 121 S.Ct. 1618, 149 L.Ed.2d 481 (2001), here we will also consider whether the evidence supported a first-degree-manslaughter instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">. This court has not yet decided whether this inquiry presents a legal issue, reviewed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), or a factual question reviewed instead under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2) and (e)(1). <em>See, e.g., Hogan v. Gibson, </em>197 F.3d 1297, 1306 (10th Cir. 1999). We need not resolve that issue here, either, because Charm would not be entitled to habeas relief under either standard. <em>See, e.g., Valdez, </em>219 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
