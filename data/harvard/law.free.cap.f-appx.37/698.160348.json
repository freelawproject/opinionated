On September 21, 2001, Mercado filed a \u201cNunc Pro Tunc\u201d motion seeking jail credit on his federal sentence for the time spent in state custody on the related conviction. The district court denied the motion on the merits, and Mercado appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">We view Mercado\u2019s motion as a request for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994) filed in the wrong district court (Mercado is incarcerated in Jesup, Georgia) and without exhausting the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 administrative remedies. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mercado\u2019s motion, but we modify the district court\u2019s order to reflect a dismissal without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, rather than a dismissal based on the merits. We expressly decline to address the merit or lack thereof of Mercado\u2019s motion, so that Mercado remains free to file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the proper court after exhausting his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
