R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Clifford Shepherd appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil rights complaint he brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Shepherd\u2019s complaint contained an allegation that his incarceration in a privately run correctional facility is a violation of New Mexico law. He further alleged that he was deprived of the rights granted him by that state law without due process. Shepherd also alleged that as a result of defendants\u2019 actions, he has no access to a law library or a typewriter. Finally, Shepherd asserted that defendants retaliated against him for filing a \u00a7 2241 habeas petition. Shepherd sought monetary damages for these alleged constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The district court concluded that Shepherd had failed to state claims upon which relief may be granted and dismissed his complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) and Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 49-50, 119 S.Ct. 977, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999) (\u201cTo state a claim for relief in an action brought under \u00a7 1983, [plaintiffs] must establish that they were deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state law.\u201d). A district court may dismiss <em>sua sponte </em>a <em>pro se </em>complaint for failure to state a claim when it is \u201cpatently obvious that the plaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing him an opportunity to amend his complaint would be futile.\u201d <em>See McKinney v. Okla. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>925 F.2d 363, 365 (10th Cir.1991) (quotation and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We have reviewed the record, appellant\u2019s brief, and the applicable law and affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Shepherd\u2019s complaint for substantially the reasons stated by the district court with the following amplification. Shepherd claims that New Mexico law creates a liberty interest in the place of his incarceration. <em>See </em>N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 31-20-2. We have reviewed the New Mexico statute upon which Shepherd bases his claim and conclude that it does not create the liberty interest he asserts. Accordingly, Shepherd\u2019s constitutional due process claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">This court AFFIRMS the district court order dismissing Shepherd\u2019s complaint. Shepherd\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is GRANTED. Shepherd, however, is reminded that despite this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal, he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in full. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b388-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
