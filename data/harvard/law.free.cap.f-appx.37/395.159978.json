R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">James Byron Waeckerle, a state prisoner appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals a district court order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. Our jurisdiction arises pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Mr. Waeckerle is currently incarcerated for workers\u2019 compensation fraud and obtaining money by false pretenses. In this \u00a7 1983 action Mr. Waeckerle alleges Stacy M. Mahone, an Oklahoma parole officer, conducted a flawed presentence investigation which \u201cshowfed] willful indifference to [Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s] Constitutional rights.\u201d Officer Mahone\u2019s presentence investigation report incorrectly identified a prior misdemeanor check fraud conviction as a felony. At the sentencing judge\u2019s request, Officer Mahone promptly filed an amended presentence investigation report correcting the mistake. Although Mr. Waeckerle concedes the mistake did not affect the sentencing judge\u2019s decision, he believes Clinton Lewis, a parol investigator, later recommended against granting parole because of the error. Thus, Mr. Waeckerle contends the presentence investigation error caused his incarceration to extended \u201cfor a longer period of time than was contemplated\u201d by the sentencing judge. Mr. Waeckerle, a sixty-five-year old white insurance professional, also generally alleges racial discrimination. Mr. Waeckerle seeks $1,150,000.00 in compensation for his allegedly unjust confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The district court dismissed Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s action without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under Rule 12(b)(6). In a well reasoned order, the district court explained Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s arguments \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction, sentence, or parole determination,\u201d and therefore his \u201cexclusive remedy is habeas corpus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Mr. Waeckerle now argues the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action. We review de novo a district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Durre v. Dempsey, </em>869 F.2d 543, 545 (10th Cir. 1989). \u201cDismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is appropriate only if plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle plaintiff to relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c[i]n reviewing the district court\u2019s dismissal, we accept as true plaintiffs allegations, which will be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Mr. Waeckerle proceeds pro se, we liberally construe his pleadings. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">The Supreme Court has held \u201chabeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinement and seeks immediate or speedier release, even though such a claim may come within the literal terms of \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). When a state prisoner seeks damages under \u00a7 1983, we \u201cmust consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>of [the prisoner\u2019s] conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. Moreover, <em>Heck </em>\u201capplies to proceedings that call into question the fact or duration of parole or probation.\u201d <em>Crow v. Penry, </em>102 F.3d 1086, 1087 (10th Cir. 1996). <em>See also Schafer v. Moore, </em>46 F.3d 43, 44-45 (8th Cir.1995) (holding <em>Heck </em>requirement applies to \u00a7 1983 actions challenging denial of parole).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim necessarily implies the invalidity of his parole denial. He alleges Parol Investigator Clinton unjustly recommended denying parole based on errors within the presentence investigation report and racial discrimination. Thus, Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s \u201ccivil claim for damages amounts to a collateral attack on his parole [denial] and subsequent incarceration.\u201d <em>Crow, </em>102 F.3d at 1087. Because <em>Heck </em>does not allow Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit to proceed, his sole recourse is through habeas corpus. The district court correctly dismissed the action since Mr. Waeckerle has not demonstrated his conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. Therefore we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order dismissing Mr. Waeckerle\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">We remind Mr. Waeckerle he must exhaust available state remedies before raising a habeas corpus claim in federal court. We also remind Mr. Waeckerle he is responsible to continue making partial payments until the entire balance of the appellate filing fee is paid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
