We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">(1) We have jurisdiction over this appeal, even though our prior remand<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was on a limited issue, and the district court did not enter a new judgment after it made findings and answered the question raised by that remand. <em>See Sutton v. Earles, </em>26 F.3d 903, 906 n. 1 (9th Cir.1994); <em>see also Nat\u2019l Distrib. Agency v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>117 F.3d 432, 433 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Montes v. United States, </em>37 F.3d 1347, 1350 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">(2) The district court properly placed the burden on Mullens to persuade it that he was not able to pay the monetary sanctions that had been awarded against him. <em>See Gaskell v. Weir, </em>10 F.3d 626, 629 (9th Cir.1993) (sanctioned party \u201cknows best\u201d his situation and has the burden \u201cto produce probative evidence of his inability to pay the sanctions\u201d); <em>see also View Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. Robotic Vision Sys., Inc., </em>208 F.3d 981, 988 (Fed.Cir.2000); <em>White v. Gen. Motors Corp., Inc., </em>908 F.2d 675, 685 (10th Cir.1990); <em>cf. NLRB v. Trans Ocean Export Packing, Inc. </em>473 F.2d 612, 616 (9th Cir.1973) (person failing to comply with court order must demonstrate inability to comply \u201c \u2018categorically and in detail\u2019 \u201d in order to avoid contempt finding (citation omitted)). Mullens asserts that we should allocate the burden differently because <em>Gaskell </em>involved Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 and this case involves Central District of California Local Rule 27. However, both rules deal with sanctions against offending parties. <em>See Willy v. Coastal Corp., </em>503 U.S. 131, 139, 112 S.Ct. 1076, 1081, 117 L.Ed.2d 280 (1992); <em>Zambrano v. City of Tustin, </em>885 F.2d 1473, 1481 (9th Cir.1989). We see no justification for allo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>eating the burden of persuasion differently-</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Having correctly placed the burden on Mullens, the district court did not clearly err when it determined that Mullens had not carried that burden.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Primus Auto. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Batarse, </em>115 F.3d 644, 648, 649 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b950-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-25\">. <em>See Gallagher v. Mullens, </em>No. 98-55278, 1999 WL 1044334, at <em>*1 </em>(9th Cir. Nov. 17, 1999) (unpublished disposition).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b951-13\">. We reject Mullens\u2019 argument that simply because Gallagher did not comply with Central District of California Local Rule 7.16, the district court lacked the power to reconsider its prior order. That rule does affect a party\u2019s right to seek reconsideration. <em>See Big Bear Lodging Ass\u2019n v. Snow Summit, Inc., </em>182 F.3d 1096, 1106 n. 8 (9th Cir.1999). It does not affect the district court\u2019s own inherent power to reconsider. <em>See City of Los Angeles, Harbor Div. v. Santa Monica BayKeeper, </em>254 F.3d 882, 885 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
