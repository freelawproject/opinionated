His only claim of error is his assertion that that state is an unconstitutional violation of the limits placed upon Congress under the Commerce Clause. We have, however, previously rejected this argument and upheld the validity of 922(j)(l). See, <em>U.S. v. Singletary, </em>268 F.3d 196 (3d Cir.2001). Accordingly, we will reject appellant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of that statute and affirm his conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
