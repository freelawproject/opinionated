(\u201cCon Edison\u201d), filed suit against defendant on March 30, 1998, alleging discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), and various state and local anti-discrimination codes. Plaintiff, who is epileptic, alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that she had been terminated in retaliation for engaging in conduct that was protected under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the ADA. She also alleged that actions of the defendant caused a stroke that she tragically suffered on January 16, 1996, which has left her unable to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">On appeal, Franklin argues that the district court (1) improperly granted defendant judgment as a matter of law before trial on her retaliatory termination claim; and (2) erred in excluding (a) expert testimony that work-related stress had caused her stroke and (b) testimony from her treating psychologist regarding her emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of judgment as a matter of law <em>de novo. Lovejoy-Wilson v. NOCO Motor Fuel, Inc., </em>263 F.3d 208, 212 (2d Cir.2001); <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). To establish a prima facie case of retaliatory termination under the ADA, the plaintiff must establish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">(1) the employee was engaged in an activity protected by the ADA, (2) the employer was aware of that activity, (3) an employment action adverse to the plaintiff occurred, and (4) there existed a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\"><em>Sarno v. Douglas Elliman-Gibbons &amp; Ives, Inc., </em>183 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.1999); <em>see also Lovejoy-Wilson, </em>263 F.3d at 223. Plaintiff has failed to provide any credible and competent evidence that her termination was motivated by the fact that she engaged in activities protected under the ADA. Because plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge, judgment as a matter of law on plaintiffs termination claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">We reject plaintiffs claim that the district court abused its discretion in excluding the testimony of her expert, Dr. Paul Rosch, who was to testify that work-related stress caused plaintiffs stroke. Under Da<em>ubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993), the district court is charged with the \u201ctask of ensuring that an expert\u2019s testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence under <em>Dauberb </em>for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, </em>526 U.S. 137, 152, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). A decision to exclude scientific evidence is not an abuse of discretion unless it is \u201cmanifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., </em>61 F.3d 1038, 1042 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">In this case, after an extensive hearing, the district court concluded that Dr. Rosch\u2019s opinion testimony was unreliable and that it did not \u201cfit\u201d with the facts of plaintiffs case. Specifically, the district court found that (1) Dr. Rosch is not an expert on strokes; (2) there are no peer-reviewed articles that establish the link between stress and stroke as Dr. Rosch sought to apply it in this case; (3) Dr. Rosch\u2019s methodology was suspect because he did not interview or examine plaintiff or learn anything about her medical history; (4) his theory was not generally accepted in the medical community; (5) his opinion was arrived at solely for the purposes of litigation; and (6) even if stress had caused plaintiffs stroke, there was no scientific basis for his conclusion that plaintiffs stroke was caused by Con Edison\u2019s alleged discriminatory treatment because Dr. Rosch did not (and could not) isolate work-related stress from the many other sources of stress in plaintiffs life. The district court\u2019s conclusions are reasonable and supported by the record; there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">Likewise, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs treating psychologist Dr. Bessie Duncan. During trial, the district court determined, upon her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>review of Dr. Duncan\u2019s deposition and report, that Dr. Duncan\u2019s diagnosis of plaintiff was \u201cinextricably limited to Ms. Franklin\u2019s stroke, and ... she has no informational basis upon which to base a prestroke evaluation.\u201d Having concluded that Dr. Duncan\u2019s diagnosis and opinions about plaintiffs ailments were intertwined with her knowledge of the fact plaintiff had suffered a stroke, the district court further concluded that to permit Dr. Duncan to testify would undermine the district court\u2019s previous <em>Daubert </em>ruling and preclude Con Edison from conducting meaningful cross-examination. The district court\u2019s determination was reasonable; there was no abuse of discretion. <em>See Silverstein v. Chase, </em>260 F.3d 142, 145 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We have carefully considered plaintiffs remaining arguments and conclude that they are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
