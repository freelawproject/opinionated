R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-22\">Defendant Troy Osborn pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B), and was sentenced to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, a special assessment of $100.00 and a f\u00edne of $7,500.00. Osborn contends the district court applied an incorrect sentencing guideline in calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-23\">The government contends that Osborn waived the right to appeal his sentence pursuant to his plea agreement. In his plea agreement, Osborn waived the right to appeal any sentence imposed by the court within the applicable sentencing guideline range, as determined by the court, but reserved the right to appeal an upward departure from the sentencing guideline range or an illegal sentence. <em>See </em>Aplt.App. at 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-24\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of the statutory right to appeal his sentence is generally enforceable.\u201d <em>Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number><em>ed States v. Black, </em>201 F.3d 1296, 1300 (10th Cir.2000) (quotation and alteration omitted). Appellate waivers are subject to certain exceptions, including where the district court relied on an impermissible factor such as race, where ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the negotiation of the waiver renders the waiver invalid, where the sentence exceeds the statutory maximum, or where the waiver is otherwise unlawful. <em>See id. </em>at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Osborn appears to contend that the district court\u2019s alleged application of an improper sentencing guideline amounts to an illegal sentence. Notably, however, Osborn\u2019s plea agreement explicitly grants the district court the discretionary power to determine the applicable guideline. Further, the sentence imposed by the district court does not fall within the definition of an illegal sentence. <em>See United States v. Neary, </em>183 F.3d 1196, 1198 (10th Cir.1999) (defining facially illegal sentences \u201cas those sentences based on race, gender, or other considerations contravening clearly established public policy\u201d), and <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>106 F.3d 1514, 1515 (10th Cir.1997) (defining an illegal sentence as \u201cone which is ambiguous with respect to the time and manner in which it is to be served, is internally contradictory, omits a term required to be imposed by statute, is uncertain as to the substance of the sentence, or is a sentence which the judgment of conviction did not authorize\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">We have examined the sentencing transcript, the plea agreement, and the entire record on appeal. Osborn does not contend that the plea agreement was not entered knowingly and voluntarily. The sentence imposed was not an illegal sentence, and the district court did not depart from the guideline it determined was applicable. <em>See United States v. Angevine, </em>No. 01-6097, 281 F.3d 1130, 2002 WL 254138, at *5 (10th Cir. Feb. 22, 2002). Consequently, Osborn waived his right to bring this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of <em>orders </em>and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
