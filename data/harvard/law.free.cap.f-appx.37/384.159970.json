R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Appellant Christopher Hill is before this court seeking a certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA) and requesting in forma pauperis status. Until Hill obtains a COA, he cannot appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">After a jury trial, Hill was convicted in Oklahoma state court of one count of illegal trafficking in controlled dangerous substances (crack cocaine) and sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment and a f\u00edne of $25,000. On direct appeal, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals rejected Hill\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and affirmed the judgment and sentence of the trial court. Hill then filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, reasserting his insufficient evidence argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In a thorough report and recommendation, the magistrate judge reviewed the trial evidence, then analyzed Hill\u2019s application under the standard set out in \u00a7 2254(d). The magistrate judge recommended denial of the petition, in that the asserted claim had been adjudicated on the merits and the state court adjudication had not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\"><em>Id.; see also Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 379-91, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (discussing and explaining the double-pronged \u00a7 2254(d) standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">When Hill failed to file objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation within the allotted time, the district court adopted the report and recommendation, denied the petition for habeas corpus, and entered judgment in favor of respondent. In his application for a COA, Hill asserts that he did not object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation because he did not receive a copy of it through the prison mail system. While this court has a firm waiver rule, under which the failure to make timely objection to the magistrate\u2019s findings or recommendation waives appellate review of both legal and factual issues, we need not apply the rule when the interests of justice dictate otherwise. <em>See Moore v. United States, </em>950 F.2d 656, 659 (10th Cir.1991). We believe the interests-of-justice exception is applicable here, and, accordingly, we turn to an evaluation of the issues raised in Hill\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">Hill is not entitled to a COA unless he can make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Where, as here, the district court rejected the asserted constitutional claims on the merits, Hill \u201cmust demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong\u201d or that the questions presented deserve further proceedings. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 483-84, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). This court has reviewed Hill\u2019s combined request for a COA, motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>appellate brief; the magistrate judge\u2019s order; and the entire record before us (including the transcript of Hill\u2019s jury trial). That review demonstrates that the issues raised in Hill\u2019s \u00a7 2254 habeas petition are not debatable among jurists of reason, subject to a different resolution on appeal, or deserving of further proceedings. Hill\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED for substantially those reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s order dated January 16, 2001. The motion to proceed in forma pauperis is also DENIED, and this appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
