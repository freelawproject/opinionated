See Fed. RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted -without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Michael Cook, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s decision dismissing his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In doing so, Mr. Cook seeks a certificate of appealability to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. We deny Mr. Cook\u2019s application for a certificate of appealability and dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">A jury convicted Mr. Cook of \u201cpossessing with intent to distribute more than 1500 grams of methamphetamine and aiding and abetting in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and possessing a firearm and ammunition as a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>1999 WL 1244476, at *1 (10th Cir. Dec.20,1999). He was sentenced to 293 months imprisonment and five years of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>On direct appeal, Mr. Cook\u2019s sole argument was the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 4. We affirmed the conviction. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Cook then sought habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 arguing, among other things, his sentence violated his due process rights as described in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>Cook v. United States, </em>2001 WL 950795, at *1 (D.Kan. Aug.6, 2001). The district court found Mr. Cook\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>argument was barred because it had not been raised at trial or on direct appeal. <em>Id., </em>at *1-2. Moreover, the district court concluded, even if the <em>Apprendi </em>argument was not barred, the rule in <em>Apprendi </em>would not apply retroactively to Mr. Cook\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">In requesting a certificate of appealability, Mr. Cook renews his <em>Apprendi </em>argument. Specifically Mr. Cook argues he was sentenced for drug quantities that were not charged in the indictment or submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-15\">Because Mr. Cook did not raise the <em>Apprendi </em>argument at trial or on appeal, <em>see Cook, </em>1999 WL 1244476, at *1; <em>United States v. Cook, </em>1999 WL 155964, at *3 (D.Kan. Jan.4, 1999), he \u201cis barred from raising the issue in a \u00a7 2255 motion, unless he can show cause for his procedural default and actual prejudice resulting from the alleged errors, or can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice will oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>cur if his claim is not addressed.\u201d <em>United States v. Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1067 (10th Cir.1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 1164, 119 S.Ct. 1079, 143 L.Ed.2d 81 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Mr. Cook\u2019s petition does not reveal the \u201ccause\u201d or reason he faded to raise his <em>Apprendi </em>argument at trial or on direct appeal. Thus, like the district court, we assume the sole reason Mr. Cook did not raise the argument was <em>Apprendi </em>had not been decided yet. <em>Cook, </em>2001 WL 950795, at *1. The Supreme Court has held \u201ccause\u201d is not satisfied if the petitioner\u2019s sole argument is \u201c \u2018that a claim was \u201cunacceptable to that particular court at that particular time.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 614, 623, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (quoting <em>Engle v. Isaac, </em>456 U.S. 107, 130 n. 35, 102 S.Ct. 1558, 71 L.Ed.2d 783 (1982)). As Mr. Cook acknowledges in his petition, support for his claim could be found in <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), which had been decided at the time of his trial. Thus, Mr. Cook has not established cause sufficient to excuse his procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Similarly, Mr. Cook\u2019s petition does not assert a \u201cfundamental miscarriage\u201d of justice will occur unless we address his claim. Mr. Cook never argues he is actually innocent. <em>See United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir.1996) (holding \u201cbecause [petitioner] has not made a colorable showing of factual innocence, he cannot establish a fundamental miscarriage of justice\u201d). Consequently, his <em>Apprendi </em>argument is barred and we need not address the merits of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">For these reasons, we deny Mr. Cook\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
