Rose fell and was injured while shopping at a Wal-Mart store and brought this negligence action against the parent company. The case was tried to a jury which returned a verdict in Rose\u2019s favor. After judgment was entered, Wal-Mart filed a motion to set aside the verdict and grant it judgment as a matter of law or grant a new trial on a number of grounds. The presiding magistrate judge decided to hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion and heard from several witnesses, after which the court ordered a new trial in the interests of justice. The case went to trial again, and this time the jury verdict was in favor of Wal-Mart. Rose appeals, arguing that the court failed to comply with procedural rules and abused its discretion in granting a new trial. The decision whether to grant a motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Walzer v. St Joseph State Hosp., </em>231 F.3d 1108, 1111 (8th Cir.2000). Upon examination of the record and the transcript, we cannot say that the court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial represented an abuse of its discretion. We therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
