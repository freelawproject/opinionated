Specifically, defendant objects to the district court\u2019s application of the two-level \u201cvulnerable victim\u201d enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, and the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. For the following reasons, we find defendant\u2019s arguments unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-21\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant\u2019s sentence may be enhanced by two levels if the defendant \u201cknew or should have known\u201d that the victim is one who is \u201cunusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to the criminal conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.1, cmt. n. 2. We review a district court\u2019s finding that a victim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201cparticularly susceptible\u201d for clear error. <em>See United States v. Patasnik, </em>89 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir.1996). We may only reverse if we are left with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). In the case at hand, there is no reason to believe that the district court committed clear error. The primary victim here, Janice Griffin, is a middle-aged woman in rural northern New York, who, at the time she met defendant, was struggling to make enough money to pay for her health insurance and medication for diabetes. Ms. Griffin placed a personal ad in a Vermont newspaper seeking a \u201cmaster/slave\u201d relationship with a man. The record discloses that defendant answered this ad and exploited Griffin\u2019s desire for a submissive/dominant relationship by persuading her to invest in several fictitious business ventures. Griffin turned over to defendant $9,000 of her retirement savings and approximately $18,000 in cash and cash advances on her credit cards. These transfers, made at defendant\u2019s suggestion and with his assurance of profit, occurred <em>after </em>Griffin had lost her job in March, 2000 (a fact she disclosed to defendant). As a result of defendant\u2019s exploitation, Griffin lost her savings and was forced to declare bankruptcy. The totality of the circumstances of this case clearly support the district court\u2019s determination that Griffin was \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to defendant\u2019s criminal conduct. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Borst, </em>62 F.3d 43, 47 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that a vulnerable victim enhancement is \u201cparticularly appropriate when ... the success of the defendant\u2019s criminal scheme depended on the victim\u2019s financial desperation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">As for the issue of acceptance of responsibility, \u201c[bjecause the sentencing court is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, its determination is entitled to great deference on review and will not be disturbed unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Defeo, </em>36 F.3d 272, 277 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotations and citations omitted). In this case, defendant wrote Ms. Griffin and her relatives numerous letters, both before and after he entered his guilty plea, in which he disclaimed any intent to defraud Ms. Griffin and suggested that others were responsible for the loss of her money. <em>See, e.g., </em>Letter from Sal Denobrega to Janice Griffin of June 14, 2001, at 1-2 (stating <em>\u201cI was not out to defraud you </em>\u201d and claiming Merchants Bank was at fault) (emphasis in original). These letters belie defendant\u2019s assurance to the district court that he fully accepted responsibility for his offenses; standing alone, such statements provide sufficient foundation for the district court\u2019s denial of the acceptance of responsibility credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We have considered all of the defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
