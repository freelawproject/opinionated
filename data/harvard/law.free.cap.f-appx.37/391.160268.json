RApp. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Petitioner Johnny O. Archuleta, a state prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. Because he has failed to make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request for a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Archuleta was convicted by a jury in state court of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, aggravated burglary, intimidation of a witness, tampering with evidence, and felon in possession of a firearm, and was sentenced to life imprisonment plus 24j\u00a3 years. His convictions were affirmed in his direct appeal on May 8, 1995. He sought state post-conviction relief on March 13, 1997, alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel. State habeas relief was denied on March 17, 2000, and certiorari was denied on June 5, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-17\">In his \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, Archuleta alleged he was denied effective assistance of counsel and he was denied due process because the state court denied his habeas petition \u201cwithout a meaningful hearing.\u201d In its report and recommendation, the magistrate court found that petitioner had \u201cnot outlined an alternative trial strategy or shown that counsel\u2019s approach to the case was objectively unreasonable,\u201d and that the evidence Archuleta sought to present at a hearing \u201cwas expert testimony regarding his trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective performance.\u201d Record, Doc. 15 at 5. The district court considered Archuleta\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>adopted the findings and the recommended disposition of the magistrate court, and dismissed the habeas action.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On appeal, Archuleta contends (1) the district court erred in finding he failed to show ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (2) the court erred in ruling he was not entitled to a \u201cfull and fair state court hearing on the factual issues\u201d raised in his state habeas petition; (3) the court erred in not reviewing the record; and (4) the court erred in not appointing counsel. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\"><em>Ineffective assistance of counsel </em>claim\u2014 \u201cReviewing courts should avoid hindsight and second-guessing, and extend deference to counsel\u2019s tactical judgments.\u201d <em>Osborn v. Shillinger, </em>861 F.2d 612, 625 (10th Cir.1988). The state court denied Archuleta\u2019s habeas ineffective assistance claim after concluding it was merely a challenge to counsel\u2019s trial strategy. The magistrate court agreed and found that Archuleta had not shown that counsel\u2019s approach was \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d when counsel sought to rebut the state\u2019s theory that Archuleta acted out of jealousy and thereby \u201copened the door\u201d to permit admission of Archuleta\u2019s prior conviction. Record, Doc. 15 at 5. We agree that counsel\u2019s defense strategy did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\"><em>Full and fair state hearing </em>claim\u2014 Questions of state procedural law do not give rise to federal habeas claims. <em>See Beavers v. Saffle, </em>216 F.3d 918, 922 (10th Cir.2000). Further, as the magistrate noted, the evidence Archuleta sought to present at the hearing was expert testimony regarding his trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective performance. The New Mexico Supreme Court has recently rejected such testimony, stating it is \u201csuperfluous for expert witnesses to advise a court, whether it is the district court or an appellate court, about the proper application of existing law to the established historical facts and about the ultimate issue of trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d <em>Lytle v. Jordan, </em>130 N.M. 198, 22 P.3d 666, 679-80 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\"><em>Failure to examine record and failure to appoint counsel </em>claims\u2014 Archuleta has failed to explain how an examination of the state record would entitle him to federal habeas relief. Further, he does not have a Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel in a federal habeas proceeding. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Finley, </em>481 U.S. 551, 555, 107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability is DENIED and the appeal is DISMISSED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
