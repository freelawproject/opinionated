Shadur, Senior District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b304-4\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Kenneth Hendershott (\u201cHendershott\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. He contends that he suffered Sixth Amendment and due process violations stemming from an asserted conflict of interest with his trial attorney. Because the state court rulings at issue were neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, we affirm (see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Despite the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hendershott\u2019s conflict-of-interest claim was not procedurally defaulted (ER 243-44), there is substantial ground for finding such default. Although Hendershott did raise that claim in his original pro se petition for state post-conviction relief (\u201cPCR\u201d), he likely waived the claim by failing to reassert it in his amended PCR petition (Or.Rev.Stat.l38.550(3)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And Palmateer\u2019s failure to object to the federal magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the claim was not procedurally defaulted or to cross-appeal when the district court adopted that finding does not amount to a waiver of the argument that Hendershott waived the conflict claim <em>(see Jones v. Wood, </em>207 F.3d 557, 562 n. 2 (9th Cir. 2000)). While failure to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation waives all objections to findings of fact, objections to legal conclusions (such as whether a claim was procedurally defaulted) are not similarly waived. But whether Hendershott has avoided procedural default has no ultimate bearing on the outcome of this appeal, for his claims fail on the merits anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">To establish that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated, Hendershott must show that \u201can actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance\u201d <em>(Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)). Hendershott\u2019s cited authorities are readily distinguishable from this case and have not convinced us that his having written to the state bar association about perceived problems with his appointed lawyer\u2019s handling of his case creates an actual conflict of interest (cf., e.g., <em>United States v. Moore, </em>159 F.3d 1154, 1158 (9th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">But even if we were to assume the existence of an actual conflict, Hendershott\u2019s failure to make the required adverse-effect showing is dispositive. To clear that \u201csubstantial hurdle\u201d <em>(Maiden v. Bunnell, </em>35 F.3d 477, 481 (9th Cir.1994)), a claimant must show \u201cthat some effect on counsel\u2019s handling of particular aspects of the trial was \u2018likely' \u201d <em>(United States v. Christakis, </em>238 F.3d 1164, 1170 (9th Cir. 2001), quoting earlier caselaw). Here Hendershott\u2019s attempts to show adverse effect are foreclosed by the state PCR court\u2019s extensive findings of fact, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>given deference unless based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented \u2014 as they are not in this instance <em>(Ainsworth v. Woodford, </em>268 F.3d 868, 873 (9th Cir.2001)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Further, the record does not support Hendershott\u2019s alternative claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because an irreconcilable conflict resulted in the complete breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. An on-the-record hearing conducted by the state court adequately determined that Hendershott\u2019s trial lawyer\u2019s representation comported with constitutional standards (see <em>Schell v. Witek, </em>218 F.3d 1017, 1026 (9th Cir.2000), holding that the ultimate question in reviewing denial of a Section 2254 petition was not whether the state court erred in handling a substitution motion, but rather whether any error actually resulted in representation that fell short of Sixth Amendment standards). So even if Hendershott were correct in urging that his claim should more properly be analyzed under <em>Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 484, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) than under <em>Cuyler, </em>he would still fail because the state court, through the on-the-record hearing, satisfied its obligation \u201ceither to appoint separate counsel or to take adequate steps to ascertain whether the risk was too remote to warrant separate counsel\u201d <em>(id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Finally, we decline to review the evidentiary hearing claim asserted in Hendershott\u2019s pro se supplemental brief to this Court because he did not ask the district court to certify that issue for appeal and the issue is not in fact specified in the certificate of appealability <em>(Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam)). Although \u201cdue process violation\u201d is a certified issue, the due process violation on which Hendershott was found to have made a substantial showing related to the asserted conflict of interest and not to improper destruction of evidence (ER 265-66, 269).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\">.
