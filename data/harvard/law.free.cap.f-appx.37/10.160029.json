Munson, Judge) convicting him under the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7401, <em>et seq., </em>and sentencing him to forty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. The jury found Hunter guilty of six counts of violating various provisions promulgated pursuant to the Clean Air Act\u2019s National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants; in particular, of failing to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s work-practice standards for the handling, stripping, and disposal of asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">Hunter raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the Clean Air Act requires proof that he had specific knowledge of the regulations that he violated. Second, Hunter challenges the enhancement of his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.2(b)(4), which directs the district court to increase a defendant\u2019s base-offense level by four if he or she committed the offense \u201cwithout a permit or in violation of a permit.\u201d Relying on <em>United States v. Weintraub, </em>96 F.Supp.2d 135 (D.Conn.2000), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>273 F.3d 139 (2d Cir.2001), Hunter contends that \u00a7 2Q1.2(b)(4) applies only to permits required by either a federal statute or a state regulatory scheme to which a federal statute has expressly delegated authority. Because the Clean Air Act neither requires a permit for asbestos removal nor expressly delegates authority to the states for this purpose, Hunter argues that \u00a7 2Q1.2(b)(4) should not have been applied to enhance his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">As defense counsel conceded at oral argument, our recent decision in <em>United States v. Weintraub, </em>273 F.3d 139 (2d Cir. 2001), resolves Hunter\u2019s first argument in the government\u2019s favor. In <em>Weintraub, </em>we held that the government satisfies the knowledge element for purposes of a conviction under the Clean Air Act if it proves that \u201cthe defendant knew that the substance involved in the alleged violations was asbestos.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. Hunter does not dispute that the government introduced evidence sufficient to establish that he knew \u201cthe substance involved in the alleged violations was asbestos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-16\">Hunter failed to raise his second ground for appeal \u2014 that the enhancement prescribed by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Q1.2(b)(4) applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>only to permit schemes sanctioned by federal law \u2014 in the district court. Issues not raised in the district court are generally deemed to be forfeited on appeal. We will consider them only upon a showing that the district court committed \u201cplain error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>United States v. Keppler, </em>2 F.3d 21, 23-24 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">For an error to be \u201cplain,\u201d it must \u201c[d]eviat[e] from a legal rule\u201d that was \u201cclear under current law,\u201d in a manner that affected the defendant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-33, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Even if we find plain error, we will notice it only where it \u201c \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (quoting <em>United States v. Atkinson, </em>297 U.S. 157, 160, 56 S.Ct. 391, 80 L.Ed. 555 (1936)).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The sentencing issue raised by Hunter is a matter of first impression in this Circuit. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court\u2019s enhancement of Hunter\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 2Q1.2(b)(4) \u201c[d]eviate[d] from a legal rule,\u201d that rule cannot be said to have been \u201cclear under current law.\u201d The error, if any, was not plain, and we decline to address it in the first instance on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">While we retain discretion to review novel or complex sentencing issues that were not properly preserved in the trial court, <em>see United States v. Kingdom, </em>157 F.3d 133, 135-36 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Margiotti, </em>85 F.3d 100, 104 (2d Cir.1996), we do not find that the circumstances here merit the exercise of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
