Familiarity with the district court opinion, including the fastidious account of the dozen relevant contracts and the defined terms used, is presumed. <em>AGV Prod., Inc. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., </em>115 F.Supp.2d 378 (S.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The only federal question in this case is whether, assuming Orion\u2019s right of first negotiation survived the various transfers of sequel rights that took place prior to Orion\u2019s bankruptcy, Orion\u2019s right of first negotiation survived the bankruptcy. Other issues briefed by the parties \u2014 whether Orion\u2019s right of first negotiation survived the various transfers of sequel rights that took place prior to Orion\u2019s bankruptcy, and whether this right survived the transfer of sequel rights that took place subsequent to Orion\u2019s bankruptcy \u2014 need not be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">AGV concedes that, under the Orion Plan, \u201cthe Distribution Agreements were novated together with [Orion\u2019s] rights of first negotiation,\u201d which was contained in the Distribution Agreements. <em>Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief </em>at 12. However, AGV argues that it is not bound by these novated Distribution Agreements because of the following language contained in the Orion Plan: \u201cThe only parties to such reformed and novated contract shall be the holder of such Postconfirmation Participation Claim and the particular Debtor that was a party to the contract so reformed and novated.\u201d <em>Orion Plan </em>\u00a7 5.05(a)(ii). AGV argues that, since neither AGV nor Carolco was a Postconfirmation Participation Claim Holder, neither of them could be a \u201cparty to\u201d the novated Distribution Agreements; therefore, AGV argues, neither of them could be \u201cbound by\u201d these novated Distribution Agreements. There is a large flaw in AGV\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Assuming arguendo that (as a matter of state law) the right of first negotiation survived until the Orion Plan was consummated, [i] this right is embodied in the Distribution Agreements; [ii] the \u201cparties to\u201d the Distribution Agreements are Orion and a Postconfirmation Participation Claim Holder (Hemdale and/or Interlink); and [in] AGV, as the ultimate successor of Hemdale, is either \u201cbound by\u201d by these agreements, or not \u2014 a question, however, that does not turn on whether AGV is, was, or could have been a \u201cparty to\u201d the Distribution Agreements. The Orion Plan does not suggest that only Postconfirmation Participant Claim Holders are \u201cbound by\u201d the novated agreements; it merely provides that only Postconfirmation Participant Claim Holders are \u201cparties to\u201d the novated agreements. Since neither AGV nor Carolco was ever a \u201cparty to\u201d the Distribution Agreements \u2014 even prior to bankruptcy \u2014 the Orion Plan did not alter either\u2019s position vis-a-vis the Distribution Agreements. They were each \u201cbound by\u201d the Distribution Agreements, or not, as a matter of state law; but all that matters for purposes of this appeal is that this question is unaffected by the terms of the Plan. AGV\u2019s argument that taking the sequel rights \u201csubject to\u201d the Distribution Agreements was insufficient to render it \u201cbound by\u201d the Distribution Agreements is a matter of state contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">We therefore conclude that, assuming Orion\u2019s right of first negotiation survived the various transfers of sequel rights that took place prior to Orion\u2019s bankruptcy, it survived bankruptcy. Because the sole claims arising under federal law were on that basis soundly rejected by the district court prior to trial, the district court acted well within its discretion in dismissing the state law claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Purgess v. Sharrock, </em>33 F.3d 134, 138 (2d Cir.1994); <em>Castellano v. Board of Trustees, </em>937 F.2d 752, 758 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Because the state law claims were dismissed (rather than decided) and because the federal question does not turn on any of the state law issues, we decline to review the district court\u2019s conclusion that Orion\u2019s right of first negotiation survived to bankruptcy, or the fact finding on which this conclusion is based. AGV is therefore free to pursue any state law claims it may have in state court, without prejudice, including any state law claim it may have that Orion\u2019s right of first negotiation did not survive the various transfers of sequel rights that took place prior to Orion\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
