In order to do that, she had the burden of submitting evidence \u201cestablishing \u2018substantial grounds for believing that [she] would be in danger of being subjected to torture\u201d \u2019 in Ethiopia. <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1284 (9th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). On the record before it, the BIA determined that she had failed so to do.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We are not able to say that the BIA\u2019s decision constituted reversible error. <em>See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 423-25, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 1445-16, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 817, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 990 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-22\">(2) Belayneh also asserts that the reopening procedure established by the regulations for those whose matters are otherwise administratively final<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> violates due process and equal protection. However, it is clear that the reopening procedure does afford a fair opportunity to proceed on a Convention Against Torture claim. <em>See Landon v. Plasencia, </em>459 U.S. 21, 34-35, 103 S.Ct. 321, 330, 74 L.Ed.2d 21 (1982); <em>Padilla-Agustin v. INS, </em>21 F.3d 970, 974-75 (9th Cir.1994) <em>overruled on other grounds by Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Moreover, there is nothing suspect about a classification scheme that distinguishes between those who are already subject to a final administrative order and those who are still in the midst of an initial proceeding. Thus, that classification need only have a rational basis. <em>See Dillingham v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number><em>INS, </em>267 F.3d 996, 1005 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Hooks v. Clark County Sch. Dist., </em>228 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir.2000). We see no irrationality in the distinction between final cases and those which are still in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b966-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-19\">.
