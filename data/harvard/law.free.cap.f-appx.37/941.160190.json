We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo the denial of a section 2255 motion, <em>Sanchez v. United States, </em>50 F.3d 1448, 1451 (9th Cir.1995), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-22\">Dowdy contends that his conviction and sentence violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because his sentence was enhanced based on factors of the Armed Career Criminal Act which were not alleged in the indictment. Dowdy\u2019s contentions have been foreclosed by this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>282 F.3d 664, 667-71 (9th Cir.2002) (denying a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion because <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on initial collateral review).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-23\">In light of <em>Sanchez-Cervantes, </em>we need not address the merits of Dowdy\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b989-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
