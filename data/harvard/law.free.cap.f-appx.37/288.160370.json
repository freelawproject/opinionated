R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">Plaintiffs Cathy Burgess, Elum Burgess, and Shela Burgess (\u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal from district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of their pro se civil rights complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. We determine, first, that Plaintiffs have alleged or attempted to allege facts which suggest that they could state claims of disability discrimination in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and they accordingly must be given an opportunity to amend their complaint. We also conclude, however, that certain claims against certain defendants are deficient in ways that cannot be cured by amendment, and we therefore affirm the dismissal of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">The district court dismissed Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without giving them an opportunity to amend and without providing notice of any deficiencies. Under these circumstances, the critical inquiry here is not whether the complaint was deficient, but whether there was any deficiency that could not be remedied by amendment. <em>See Schneider v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>151 F.3d 1194, 1197 (9th Cir.1998). Indeed, in <em>Noll v. Carlson, </em>809 F.2d 1446, 1448 (9th Cir.1987), we held that a district court must not only give a pro se plaintiff leave to amend before dismissing the complaint with prejudice, but also notice of the deficiencies in his complaint to \u201censure that the pro se litigant can use the opportunity to amend effectively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">Although their complaint is confusing and inartful, it is nevertheless clear that Plaintiffs\u2019 core claim is one of disability discrimination in violation of the ADA and \u00a7 1983, and that they have attempted to allege the basic factual outline necessary to support it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is irrelevant here, where Plaintiffs have not been given notice and leave to amend, whether their complaint pleads insufficient facts to establish the essential elements of their claims, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>cause it is not \u201cabsolutely clear\u201d that Plaintiffs could not cure this deficiency by amendment. <em>Noll, </em>809 F.2d at 1448. We therefore conclude that, under these circumstances, the district court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint without giving notice of its deficiencies and leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">We also conclude that the district court erred in ruling that it would be futile to give Plaintiffs leave to amend because the complaint could not be amended to state a claim \u201c \u2018without contradicting any of the allegations of the original complaint\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Reddy v. Litton Indus., Inc., </em>912 F.2d 291, 296 (9th Cir.1990)) (alteration omitted). The district court concluded that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the individual County Defendants \u201ctook action against them based on [the] perception that Ms. Burgess is disabled rather than based on any conduct that endangered Elum and Shela,\u201d that the County had \u201can official policy and practice of initiating child dependency proceedings based on a perception that a parent has a disability rather than on a belief that a child is at risk,\u201d and that the 300(b) petition \u201callow[s] the County to seek jurisdiction over a child based on a conclusory allegation that the parent is disabled,\u201d were directly contradicted by the fact that Carmichael made allegations regarding Ms. Burgess\u2019s conduct in the 300(b) petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">There is no incurable inconsistency, however, unless, contrary to the core allegations in the complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we infer that Defendants were <em>actually </em>motivated by \u201cconduct-based concerns.\u201d Because Plaintiffs are entitled to \u201cthe benefit of any doubt,\u201d <em>Karim-Panahi </em>839 F.2d at 623, and because the district court could have reasonably interpreted Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint as alleging that Defendants\u2019 conduct-based concerns were pretextual, the district court erred in adopting an unfavorable and overly narrow interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">With regard to some of the claims against certain defendants, however, there are deficiencies that cannot be cured by amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">A. NO ADA LIABILITY AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Larry Carmichael, Ellen Hartke, and Roger Lum (collectively \u201cthe Individual Defendants\u201d) for claims for violations of the ADA. Plaintiffs may sue only a \u201cpublic entity\u201d for such violations, not government officials in their individual capacities. <em>See Vinson v. Thomas, </em>288 F.3d 1145, 1155-56 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Alsbrook v. City of Maumelle, </em>184 F.3d 999, 1005 n. 8, 1011-12 (8th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">B. NO \u00a7 1983 LIABILITY AGAINST STATE ACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of any claims Plaintiffs seek to raise against the State of California Health and Welfare Agencies and the Judicial Council of California (collectively \u201cthe State Defendants\u201d) and the Alameda County Courts in Hayward and San Leandro (\u201cCounty Courts\u201d) under \u00a7 1983. States and state agencies are not \u201cpersons\u201d subject to \u00a7 1983 liability. <em>Groten v. California, </em>251 F.3d 844, 851 (9th Cir.2001). Neither are county courts in California, which we have recognized are \u201carms of the state,\u201d and therefore equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>lent to state agencies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 70, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (holding that \u201c \u2018arms of the State\u2019 for Eleventh Amendment purposes\u201d are not liable under \u00a7 1983); <em>Greater Los Angeles Council on Deafness, Inc. v. Zolin, </em>812 F.2d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that state courts are arms of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">C. NO LIABILITY FOR STATE DEFENDANTS\u2019 MERE DRAFTING OF 300(B) FORM</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In addition, we affirm the dismissal with prejudice of Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claims against the State Defendants to the extent that they are. based on the State Defendants\u2019 responsibility for drafting the form used to initiate child dependency proceedings, because the form does not, as a matter of law, violate the ADA. To the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint can be amended to state a claim based on allegations that the State Defendants are responsible for some discriminatory use of the form, the district court erred in not giving Plaintiffs notice of the deficiencies of their complaint and leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">D. ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY BAR TO SOME \u00a7 1983 CLAIMS AGAINST THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We also affirm the dismissal without prejudice of Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 damages claims against Carmichael, Hartke, and Lum to the extent that those claims are predicated on actions that these individuals took \u201cin performing quasi-prosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuit of child dependency proceedings,\u201d actions which we have held are entitled to quasi-prosecutorial immunity. <em>Meyers, </em>812 F.2d at 1157; <em>accord Mabe, </em>237 F.3d at 1109; <em>Coverdell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. &amp; Health Servs., </em>834 F.2d 758, 762-64 (9th Cir.1987) (discussing Meyers). To the extent that Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint can be amended to state a claim based on alleged conduct that is not \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,\u201d <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976), the district court erred in not giving Plaintiffs notice of the deficiencies of their complaint and leave to amend.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, quasi-prosecutorial immunity cannot bar either the claims against the institutional defendants, <em>see Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &amp; Coordination Unit, </em>507 U.S. 163, 166, 113 S.Ct. 1160, 122 L.Ed.2d 517 (1993), or the claims for injunctive and declaratory relief that Plaintiffs could allege in an amended complaint, <em>see Gobel v. Maricopa County, </em>867 F.2d 1201, 1203 n. 6 (9th Cir.1989), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Merritt v. County of Los Angeles, </em>875 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">We reject all the remaining arguments that Defendants advance in support of affirming the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>A. INABILITY OF MS. BURGESS TO PROCEED PRO SE ON HER CHILDREN\u2019S BEHALF</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">The County Defendants argue that the panel should affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal because our ruling in <em>Johns v. County of San Diego, </em>114 F.3d 874 (9th Cir.1997), provides that Ms. Burgess may not proceed on behalf of her children without a lawyer. Although <em>Johns </em>does so hold, <em>id. </em>at 876-77, dismissal with prejudice is not the appropriate response because the Burgess children should not be prejudiced by Ms. Burgess\u2019s failure to retain a lawyer, <em>see id. </em>at 877 (\u201c \u2018[T]he infant is always the ward of every court wherein his rights or property are brought into jeopardy, and is entitled to the most jealous care that no injustice be done to him.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Osei-Afriyie v. Med. Coll, </em>937 F.2d 876, 883 (3d Cir.1991))).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">B. SUIT AS AN IMPROPER COLLATERAL ATTACK ON A STATE COURT JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">We also reject the County Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiffs improperly seek review of a state court judgment in federal court in violation of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See generally Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923). <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not apply here because there is no support for the County Defendants\u2019 contention that Plaintiffs \u201cin essence ... ask[ ] this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the California Superior Court.\u201d Indeed, Ms. Burgess prevailed in the particular state court proceeding at issue here because the state court dismissed the 300(b) petition without prejudice. Furthermore, Plaintiffs\u2019 core factual allegations primarily address general policies and practices of the County Courts, not the disposition of Ms. Burgess\u2019s particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">For similar reasons, the abstention arguments that County Defendants raise are inapposite. Because the child dependency proceeding was resolved in Ms. Burgess\u2019s favor, there is no longer a \u201cpending state actionf] in which [Plaintiffs] could bring [their] constitutional claims.\u201d <em>Coats v. Woods, </em>819 F.2d 236, 237 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">C. ELEVENTH AMENDMENT IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Eleventh Amendment Immunity does not bar Plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Title II with respect to any Defendant because we have held that Congress validly abrogated the States\u2019 sovereign immunity in passing Title II of the ADA. <em>Hason v. Med. Bd., </em>279 F.3d 1167, 1170-71 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Board of Alabama v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001), did not overrule Ninth Circuit precedent holding that Congress had validly abrogated sovereign immunity in passing Title II).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-12\">We also reject Plaintiffs\u2019 alternative argument for outright reversal \u2014 that the district court may have relied on extrinsic evidence presented in two requests for judicial notice. This argument has no merit because the district court did not grant the requests and Plaintiffs admit that there is no indication that the district court in fact relied on any evidence presented in the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-14\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal with prejudice of 1) Plaintiffs\u2019 ADA claims against the Individual Defendants \u2014 Carmi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>chael, Hartke, and Lum; 2) their \u00a7 1983 claims against the State Defendants and the County Courts; 3) their ADA claims against the State Defendants to the extent that they are predicated on the State Defendants\u2019 actions in drafting the form used to initiate child dependency proceedings; and 4) their \u00a7 1983 claims against Carmichael, Hartke, and Lum, to the extent that they are predicated on actions taken by these individuals in performing quasi-prosecutorial functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">With respect to the remaining claims, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal and REMAND to the district with instructions 1) to give Ms. Burgess an opportunity to retain counsel for her children; and 2) to notify Plaintiffs of the deficiencies in their complaint and give them leave to amend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED. Parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b339-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-12\">. The Judicial Council argues that the ADA does not apply to child dependency proceedings. The cases that it cites, however, support only the proposition that the ADA does not preempt these proceedings and may not be used as a defense in them. See, <em>e.g., Catherine P. v. Ngoc P. (In re Anthony P.), </em>84 Cal.App.4th 1112, 101 Cal.Rptr.2d 423, 425-26 (Ct.App.2000). Indeed, many of these cases recognize that a \" 'separate cause of action [may lie] under the ADA based on the County's actions or inactions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Raymond C. (In re Torrance P.), </em>187 Wis.2d 10, 522 N.W.2d 243, 246 (Wis.Ct.App.1994)); <em>accord In re B.K.F., </em>704 So.2d 314, 318 (La.Ct.App.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. Plaintiffs also alleged that \u201cthe real reason for the filing of the petition was because Carmichael wished to use his position to maliciously prosecute Cathy based on a disability,\u201d and that Carmichael \"lied, and misused codes and labels\u201d and \"willfully misrepresented the facts of the case to the Courts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b341-9\">. The argument that CPS and individual CPS employees are arms of the state is foreclosed by <em>Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dep\u2019t of Soc.

Servs., </em>237 F.3d 1101, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2001), which indicate that county social services agencies in California are subject to suit under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\">. \"Investigatory or administrative functions, [for example], generate only qualified immunity,\u201d <em>Morley </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>175 F.3d 756, 759 (9th Cir. 1999), as does all other conduct that is \"not that of an advocate.\u201d <em>Meyers, </em>812 F.2d at 1157.
