The district court dismissed the plaintiff employee\u2019s challenge to the denial of the benefits, concluding that as a matter of law the administrative record failed to show that the decision to deny benefits was arbitrary and capricious. We have reached the same conclusion upon <em>de novo </em>review of the record, and the judgment entered by the district court will therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-17\">The plaintiff, Regina Wages, began working for defendant Sandler O\u2019Neill &amp; Partners as a servicing sales coordinator in January of 1992. Sandler O\u2019Neill provides its employees coverage under a group disability insurance policy issued by its co-defendant in this matter, Continental Casualty Company/CNA Insurance Company. The coverage qualifies as an employee welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001, <em>et seq. </em>Sandler O\u2019Neill is the designated plan administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-18\">In October of 1996 the plaintiff visited her primary care physician, Dr. William F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Craven, complaining of pain and fatigue. Dr. Craven referred her to Dr. Cathy M. Chapman, a rheumatologist, who examined the plaintiff for the first time on October 28,1996. Dr. Chapman concluded that the plaintiff \u201cvery likely\u201d had fibromyalgia, a syndrome of unknown origin that is characterized by chronic fatigue and muscle pain. The plaintiff returned to Dr. Chapman for follow-up on consultations November 27, 1996, and January 14, 1997. After the latter visit, Dr. Chapman wrote a letter to Sandler O\u2019Neill recommending that the plaintiff be granted two months of medical leave. The plaintiff has performed no work for Sandler O\u2019Neill since January 15, 1997, and her alleged disability is claimed to date from that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Between January 15 and June 26, 1997, the plaintiff saw Dr. Chapman four more times. It appears that she also had at least seven appointments with Dr. Craven. The plaintiff kept appointments with both doctors on June 26, the day she submitted her claim for permanent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Upon receipt of the plaintiffs claim Sandler O\u2019Neill referred the case to Jim Lin-sky, the insurance company\u2019s disability specialist. Mr. Linsky interviewed the plaintiff regarding her condition on July 3, 1997. Under the Continental policy, the plaintiff had 90 days in which to submit \u201cwritten proof\u2019 of her disability. On July 12, 1997, she submitted a chronic pain questionnaire and a statement of daily activities. She supplemented this with office notes from her visits to Drs. Craven and Chapman.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">On July 21, 1997, Dr. Chapman wrote a letter to the nurse case manager at Continental who was in charge of the plaintiffs claim. Dr. Chapman expressed herself in the letter as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">\u201cIt has been my experience that patients with fibromyalgia are convinced that they cannot return to work. This patient [the plaintiff], of note, has responded only minimally to any treatment options, which is typical. There are no objective abnormalities to justify her limitation or inability to work. I feel that in this case, disability has to be determined based on the criteria through her insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The nurse case manager subsequently recommended against granting benefits. By letter dated August 21, 1997, Continental denied the plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The plaintiff sought reconsideration of the denial. In this connection Dr. Craven wrote a letter on the plaintiffs behalf detailing his reasons for believing that she had fibromyalgia. He also forwarded the results of the plaintiffs lab work to show that he had excluded other possible ailments. Dr. Craven\u2019s letter \u2014 dated October 21, 1997 \u2014 noted that his examination of the plaintiff disclosed 12 of 18 possible \u201ctender points\u201d that are generally indicators of fibromyalgia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also stated that the plaintiffs \u201cprimary symptom\u201d was fatigue, not pain. Dr. Craven argued that the lack of \u201cobjective abnormalities\u201d in the plaintiffs physical examination was characteristic of patients with fibromyalgia and did not mean that she was able to perform the duties of her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">In a letter of October 31, 1997, Continental advised the plaintiff that her claim was being forwarded to the insurer\u2019s Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>peals Committee. After examining Dr. Chapman\u2019s office notes, test results and communications with Dr. Craven, in addition to the evidence provided by the plaintiff previously, the Appeals Committee decided that the decision to deny the claim was correct. The Committee so informed the plaintiff by letter dated January 23, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">On March 3, 1998, the plaintiff requested an additional appeal. Although not required to do so, Continental allowed her to submit additional medical evidence. This evidence consisted of a report on the results of a battery of tests she had taken at a sleep disorder clinic on August 20, 1997; a report of a psychological examination performed by Dr. Michael Guinle on October 3, 1997; an April 15, 1998, letter from Dr. Craven; and an April 29, 1998, letter from Dr. Chapman. Dr. Craven\u2019s letter, which was quite detailed, re-emphasized that the symptoms of fibromyalgia were necessarily subjective, but said that the condition nonetheless prevented the plaintiff from performing even her \u201clight to sedentary\u201d job duties. Dr. Chapman\u2019s letter, while less elaborate, stated that she \u201c[did] not feel that [the plaintiff] can do high cognitive work, even if sedentary\u201d and that \u201c[t]he diagnosis of fibromyalgia is the clinical diagnosis with the finding of tender points on physical examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">After taking this newly proffered evidence into account, Continental\u2019s Appeals Committee remained of the view that the plaintiff had not demonstrated the necessary lack of functional capacity. The Committee pointed to Dr. Guinle\u2019s psychological examination as \u201c[t]he only attempt at providing information concerning functionality\u201d and found that report \u201cindicate[d] a level of capacity that should not preclude her performance at her regular occupation.\u201d The Committee denied the plaintiffs appeal for the final time in a letter dated July 15, 1998. In a letter sent three weeks later, the Committee refused to entertain additional appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The plaintiff was awarded Social Security disability benefits on June 23, 1999. Soon thereafter she brought the present action in a Tennessee chancery court. The defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, where in due course they moved for summary judgment. The district court granted the motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\">\u201c[A] denial of benefits challenged under \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). When a plan does confer such discretionary authority, we review benefit decisions under an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard. <em>Yeager v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>88 F.3d 376, 380 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">In the case before us, the summary plan description explicitly states that the plan administrator and other plan fiduciaries \u201chave discretionary authority to interpret the terms of the Plan and to determine eligibility for and entitlement to benefits .... \u201d Before the district court granted summary judgment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the parties agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>that the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard of review was the one to be used. On appeal, the plaintiff contends for the first time that the plan language conferring discretion does not extend to decisions made by Continental. This court resolves issues not raised below only if \u201cthe proper resolution is beyond any doubt, or where injustice might otherwise result.\u201d <em>Enertech Electrical, Inc. v. Mahoning County Commissioners, </em>85 F.3d 257, 261 (6th Cir. 1996). Since it appears that Continental qualifies as a fiduciary under the terms of ERISA in any case, see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A), we have no hesitancy about holding the plaintiff to her earlier concession that \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d review is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The plaintiff also alleges that since Continental both funded the plan and made decisions on whether to grant benefits, it faced an impermissible conflict of interest. A conflict of interest, if present, does not \u201calter the standard of review.\u201d <em>Peruzzi v. Summa Medical Plan, </em>137 F.3d 431, 433 (6th Cir.1998), but a reviewing court is required to take the conflict into account in determining whether a decision is \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>University Hospitals, </em>202 F.3d at 846; see <em>Firestone, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. 948. This requirement applies, however, only where there is \u201csignificant evidence\u201d that the insurer was motivated by self-interest. <em>Peruzzi, </em>137 F.3d at 433. We are aware of no such evidence here. See <em>Perlman v. Swiss Bank Corp. Comprehensive Disability Protection Plan, </em>195 F.3d 975, 981 (7th Cir.1999)(noting that \u201cit is unsound for the judiciary automatically to impute\u201d a corporate fiduciary\u2019s short-term self-interest to the individuals making claims determinations on its behalf).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In applying the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard, we must consider only the facts known to the decision-maker at the time of the decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Yeager, </em>88 F.3d at 381. And we must uphold the decision if we conclude that it was \u201crational in light of the plan\u2019s provisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, a decision is not arbitrary and capricious when \u201cit is possible to offer a reasoned explanation [for it], based on the evidence.\u201d <em>Killian v. Heathsource Provident Administrators, Inc., </em>152 F.3d 514, 520 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The insurance plan at issue in the case at bar provides for \u201ctotal disability\u201d benefits only when an insured employee is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax\">\u201c(1) continuously unable to perform the substantial and material duties of the Insured Employee\u2019s regular occupation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">(2) under the regular care of a licensed physician other than the Insured Employee; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">(3) not gainfully employed in any occupation for which the Insured Employee is or becomes qualified by education, training or experience.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The policy also requires a claimant to provide Continental \u201cwritten proof of loss,\u201d which leaves no room for doubt that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>she was \u201cunable to perform the substantial and material duties\u201d of her job. We may reverse Continental\u2019s decision only if we find it irrational in light of these provisions of the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">After what appears to have been a thorough examination of the administrative record, Continental concluded that Ms. Wages had not shown that she lacked the functional capacity to perform her admittedly sedentary job. Although both Dr. Craven and Dr. Chapman wrote letters indicating that her fibromyalgia precluded even the lightest work, neither doctor quantified the plaintiffs functional limitations in terms of the number of hours she could sit or stand comfortably, or the like. Even as late as June 26,1997 \u2014 the date on which the plaintiff submitted her claim for permanent disability \u2014 Dr. Chapman\u2019s office notes indicate that the plaintiff was \u201cbeing followed for a relatively mild fibromyalgia type syndrome.\u201d Dr. Chapman\u2019s subsequent letter to Continental\u2019s nurse case manager failed to recommend that the company grant total disability benefits, and it implied that the plaintiff might be physically able to return to work. Dr. Guinle, who was the only doctor to timely fill out a functional capacity report, indicated that the plaintiff was mentally capable of functioning in her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Although we might not reach the same conclusion Continental did if we were deciding Ms. Wages\u2019 claim as a matter of first impression, the administrative record is not devoid of support for Continental\u2019s decision. The insurance company\u2019s decision was rational, in our view, and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Accordingly, the judgment in which the district court declined to second-guess the denial of benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">. In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology created two criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia: A history of widespread pain and pain in 11 of 18 tender point sites on digital palpation. See F. Wolfe, H.A. Smythe, M.B. Yunus, R.M. Bennett, C. Bombardier, D.L. Goldenberg, P. Tugwell, S.M. Campbell, M. Abeles, P. Clark, <em>et al., The American College of Rheumatology 1990 Criteria for the Classification of Fibromyalgia: Report of the Multicenter Criteria Committee, </em>33 Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism 160-72 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\">. We have said that \"the concept of summary judgment is inapposite to the adjudication of an ERISA action.\u201d <em>Wilkins v. Baptist Healthcare System, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 609, 619 (6th Cir.1998)(Gilman, J., concurring in the judgment and delivering the opinion of the court on the summary judgment issue). A number of lower courts in this circuit have according<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>ly begun treating motions for summary judgment in ERISA cases as motions for entry of judgment. See, e.g., <em>In re Campbell, </em>116 F.Supp.2d 937, 940 (M.D.Tenn.2000), <em>Saravolatz v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, </em>51 F.Supp.2d 806, 808-09 (E.D.Mich.1999). As long as the district court applied the proper standard of review, however, \"reliance on summary judgment standards does not warrant reversal. ...\u201d <em>University Hospitals of Cleveland v. Emerson Electric Co., </em>202 F.3d 839, 845 n. 2 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\">. Notably, this excludes the residual functional capacity questionnaire completed by Dr. Chapman on August 12, 1998, nearly a month after the plaintiffs second appeal was denied. The inclusion of the questionnaire in the \"administrative record\u201d portion of the joint appendix was presumably an oversight.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
