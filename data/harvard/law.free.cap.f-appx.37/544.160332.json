The cotut has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b592-15\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that appellant\u2019s sentence be affirmed. Prior to imposing sentence, the district court considered and rejected appellant\u2019s arguments regarding a downward departure based on her substance abuse rehabilitation. The district court recognized its discretion to grant a downward departure pursuant to <em>United States v. Harrington, </em>947 F.2d 956, 962 (D.C.Cir.1991), but declined to exercise that discretion. Appellant presents no basis for reversing the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Sammoury, </em>74 F.3d 1341, 1343 (D.C.Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Pinnick, </em>47 F.3d 434, 439 (D.C.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">Pursuant to D.C.

The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
