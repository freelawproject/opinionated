We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-17\">Rodriguez-Leon contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960, the statute under which he was convicted, is unconstitutional after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He further contends that his due process rights were violated because the government did not prove that he knowingly imported 28.8 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-21\">These contentions are foreclosed by our recent decisions in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2002) (concluding that \u00a7 960 is not facially unconstitutional), and <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643-44 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that the government was required to prove that he knew the type and amount of the imported controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b936-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
