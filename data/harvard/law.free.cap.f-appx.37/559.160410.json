Garaufis, <em>District Judge) </em>dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus as untimely pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217, 1220 (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244). In dismissing the petition, the district court granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether Brigian is entitled to equitable tolling of the one-year statute of limitations imposed by AEDPA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We conclude that he is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">Brigian was convicted, following a jury verdict, of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in Queens County Supreme Court in September 1992. Following his conviction, Brigian filed a motion pursuant to N.Y. Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440.10 seeking to have his conviction vacated. This motion was denied by Queens County Supreme Court on January 25, 1994, and leave to appeal the decision was denied by the Appellate Division. Brigian\u2019s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal by the Appellate Division in June 1995. <em>People v. Brigian, </em>216 A.D.2d 405, 628 N.Y.S.2d 512 (N.Y.App.Div.1995). On August 22, 1995, the New York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal Brigian\u2019s conviction. <em>People v. Brigian, </em>86 N.Y.2d 791, 632 N.Y.S.2d 504, 656 N.E.2d 603 (1995). Bri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>gian did not file a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court and, thus, his conviction became final on November 20, 1995, the expiration date for seeking direct review by the United States Supreme Court. <em>See Ross v. Artuz, </em>150 F.3d 97, 98 (2d Cir.1998). Because Brigian\u2019s conviction became final before April 24, 1996, the date AEDPA became effective, Brigian had until April 24, 1997 plus any time tolled under \u00a7 2244(d)(2) or under the doctrine of equitable tolling to file his first habeas petition. <em>See id. </em>at 102-03; <em>see also Smith v. McGinnis, </em>208 F.3d 13, 17 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 840, 121 S.Ct. 104, 148 L.Ed.2d 63 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">According to Brigian\u2019s petition, in December 1996 he retained attorney Richard Heelan to prepare and file either a second \u00a7 440.10 motion or a federal habeas corpus petition, paying him a $7500 retainer. On April 15, 1997, Brigian sent Heelan all of Brigian\u2019s court documents. The attorney, however, never filed the petition and never returned Brigian\u2019s documents. Brigian filed a grievance against Heelan and was informed in May 1998 that Heelan had been disbarred. Brigian made several efforts to obtain duplicate copies of his lost documents, including filing motions and writing letters to various court agencies and the District Attorney\u2019s office, all, apparently, to no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">On August 31, 1999, Brigian filed a second \u00a7 440.10 motion. The motion was denied by the Queens County Supreme Court on September 29, 1999, and leave to appeal was denied by the Appellate Division on August 2, 2000. On May 5, 2000, more than four and a half years after the completion of Brigian\u2019s direct appeal and more than three years after the effective date of AEDPA, Brigian filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court. On June 5, 2001, the district court granted respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition as time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The district court rejected Brigian\u2019s argument that he was entitled to equitable tolling of the AEDPA limitations period, finding that Brigian could have filed the petition without obtaining the court documents he sought for two years (pointing out that Brigian in fact did file his petition without obtaining the papers), and therefore, that Brigian failed to exercise reasonable diligence in filing his petition. <em>Brigian v. Artuz, </em>No. 00-cv-2675, slip op. at 6-8 (E.D.N.Y. June 5, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We have held that equitable tolling \u201cis only appropriate in Tare and exceptional circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smaldone v. Senkowski, </em>273 F.3d 133, 138 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Smith, </em>208 F.3d at 17), <em>cert. denied, </em>122 S.Ct. 1606, 152 L.Ed.2d 621(2002). To be entitled to equitable tolling, a petitioner must show \u201cthat extraordinary circumstances prevented him from filing his petition on time\u201d and that he \u201cacted with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>208 F.3d at 17; <em>see also Smaldone, </em>273 F.3d at 138. To establish \u201cextraordinary circumstances,\u201d a petitioner \u201cmust \u2018demonstrate a causal relationship between the extraordinary circumstances ... and the lateness of his filing, a demonstration that cannot be made if the petitioner, acting with reasonable diligence, could have filed on time notwithstanding the extraordinary circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hizbullahankhamon v. Walker, </em>255 F.3d 65, 75 (2d Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Valverde v. Stinson, </em>224 F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir.2000)), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 9, 2001) (No. 01-8722). We agree with the district court that the circumstances advanced by petitioner do not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">Although the conduct of Brigian\u2019s retained attorney was egregious and Brigian\u2019s inability to obtain his court records is unfortunate, it is far <em>from </em>clear whether either situation would constitute an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>traordinary circumstance sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the analysis. <em>See Smaldone, </em>273 F.3d at 138 (\u201c[Attorney error [is] inadequate to create the \u2018extraordinary1 circumstances equitable tolling requires.\u201d); <em>Davis v. McCoy, </em>No. 00 Civ. 1681, 2000 WL 973752, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 14, 2000) (holding that inability to obtain court documents did not constitute \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d). <em>But see Valverde, </em>224 F.3d at 133-34 (finding that intentional confiscation of petitioner\u2019s legal papers by corrections officer constituted an \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstance).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Assuming they would constitute an extraordinary circumstance, however, we nevertheless find that Brigian is not entitled to equitable tolling because he failed to \u201cact[ ] with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>208 F.3d at 17. In <em>Valverde, </em>224 F.3d at 134, we held that if extraordinary circumstances \u201cprevent[ ] a petitioner from filing before the ordinary limitations period expires, the tolling period must be sufficient to permit the filing of a petition on or before the earliest date after the [extraordinary circumstance] by which that petitioner, acting with reasonable diligence, should have filed his or her petition.\u201d As the district court noted, Brigian failed to exercise such reasonable diligence because, although he ultimately filed his \u00a7 440.10 motion and his habeas petition without the benefit of obtaining the court papers he sought, he did not file any collateral attack on his conviction until almost two and a half years after the AEDPA deadline had passed and more than one year after learning that his attorney had been disbarred. <em>See id. </em>at 134 (\u201cIf the person seeking equitable tolling has not exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to file after the extraordinary circumstances began, the link of causation between the extraordinary circumstances and the failure to file is broken, and the extraordinary circumstances therefore did not prevent timely filing.\u201d); <em>see also Zarvela v. Artuz, </em>254 F.3d 374, 382 (2d Cir.) (observing that \u201c[p]rompt action by the petitioner to initiate exhaustion and return to federal court after its completion^ normally no more than 30 days for each process,] serves as the functional equivalent of ... \u2018reasonable diligence\u2019 \u201d), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Fischer v. Zarvela, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 506, 151 L.Ed.2d 415 (2001). Accordingly, we find no basis for equitably tolling the time to file petitioner\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
