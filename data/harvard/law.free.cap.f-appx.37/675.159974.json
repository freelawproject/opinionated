Coble appeals from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment and from his conviction of attempting to obstruct and impede the administration of the tax laws, in violation of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7212(a) (West 2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We conclude, first, that Coble\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction patently is meritless; therefore, the district court properly denied the motion. Second, our review of the record discloses that the evidence presented by the Government \u2014 Coble\u2019s use of an invalid \u201ccomptroller warrant\u201d to discharge his tax liability and to receive a substantial tax refund \u2014 was sufficient to sustain Coble\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 7212(a). <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (providing standard of review); <em>United States v. Wells, </em>163 F.3d 889, 897 (4th Cir.1998) (defining the elements of a \u00a7 7212(a) offense and affirming a conviction under that section). We also have reviewed all of Coble\u2019s claims raised in his informal briefs and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Coble\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and affirm his conviction. In light of this disposition, we also deny Coble\u2019s motion entitled \u201cEmergency Petition for Administrative Review.\u201d We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b724-17\">The facts underlying Coble\u2019s conviction are provided in our prior opinion, in which we reversed Coble\u2019s sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Coble, </em>No. 00-4247, 2001 WL 431529, 11 Fed.Appx. 193 (4th Cir. April 27, 2001) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
