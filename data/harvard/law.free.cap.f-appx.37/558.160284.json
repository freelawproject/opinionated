A two-day jury trial was held on November 13 and 14, 2001, in which counsel appointed by the District Court represented Alvarez. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Defendants on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Alvarez complains on appeal of errors at trial. The claims of error at trial that we may construe Alvarez to raise are whether the trial judge erred in: (1) appointing ineffective counsel; (2) not recusing himself for alleged bias; (3) not permitting Alvarez to present witness testimony on his behalf; (4) discontinuing the jury trial when four of the defendants had yet to testify; (5) dismissing two defendants without closing all of the evidence related to them;(6) intervening in Alvarez\u2019s examination of a witness in a manner that intimidated Alvarez; (7) keeping Alvarez shackled during the trial; and (8) removing Alvarez from the court room during jury deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">We are unable to review the claims in the absence of a transcript of the trial. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Appellant may have his appeal restored to the docket of the Court of Appeals if, within 90 days of the issuance of the mandate of this Court, he files in the District Court a copy of the transcript of the trial (having obtained a copy from the Official Court Reporter by purchase in the ordinary course) or files a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f) to obtain a free transcript. The District Court is directed to act upon any such motion within 21 days of its filing. If no such transcript or motion is filed in the District Court within the time prescribed, this dismissal of the appeal shall be deemed to have been entered with prejudice. If Appellant obtains a transcript as noted above, the Clerk shall restore this case to the docket of the Court of Appeals upon notice to her by either party that there appears to have been compliance with this Court\u2019s mandate. This panel shall not retain continuing jurisdiction over any such putative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
