We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Dismissals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) for failure to state a claim are reviewed de novo. <em>Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194 (9th Cir.1998). We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Sattler contends Ms privacy was violated when a female prison guard brought his breakfast while he was naked, and that he was improperly disciplined for indecent exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Occasional viewing of male prisoners by female correctional officers does not violate the Fourth Amendment right to privacy or the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Grummett v. Rushen, </em>779 F.2d 491, 496 (9th Cir.1985); <em>see also Somers v. Thurman, </em>109 F.3d 614, 622 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">To the extent the rule against indecent exposure furthers the legitimate penological interest of \u201cpreserving institutional order and discipline,\u201d Sattler\u2019s First Amendment claim fails. <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Sattler\u2019s claim that he was denied due process during prison disciplinary proceedings lacks merit, because he was given written notice and an opportumty to present his defense at a hearing. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Further, Sattler cannot demonstrate a legitimate claim of entitlement to a particular prison grievance procedure. <em>See Mann v. Adams, </em>855 F.2d 639, 640 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Sattler\u2019s claim that he did not receive adequate notice that prison regulations prohibited being naked in his cell, however, may have merit. Due process requires fair notice of prohibited conduct before a sanction can be imposed. <em>See United States v. Kozminski, </em>487 U.S. 931, 949-50, 108 S.Ct. 2751, 101 L.Ed.2d 788 (1988). Although \u201cindecent exposure\u201d was proscribed in the prison\u2019s regulation on sexual misconduct, it is not clear that this prohibition would include Sattler\u2019s nudity within the confines of his own cell. <em>See United States v. Christopher, </em>700 F.2d 1253, 1258 (9th Cir.1983) (holding that a regulation must \u201csufficiently convey the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices\u201d to avoid unconstitutional vagueness.). To the extent Sattler has alleged a due process violation based on a lack of fair warning, we remand for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Finally, Sattler\u2019s allegation that prison officials have not provided him with nasal decongestant does not show \u201cdeliberate indifference to serious medical needs\u201d constituting \u201cunnecessary and wanton infliction of pain,\u201d necessary to support a section 1983 claim. <em>See Hamilton v. Endell, </em>981 F.2d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.1992) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b359-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
