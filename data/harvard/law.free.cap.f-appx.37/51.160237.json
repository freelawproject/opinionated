Schools, United States Attorney, Columbia, South Carolina, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b100-7\">Before WILKINSON, Chief Judge, and MOTZ and GREGORY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"b100-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Petitioner, Larry Dutton, is currently serving a sentence of two hundred thirty five (235) months for unlawful possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The sentence was imposed on Dutton in the Western District of North Carolina. Dutton has previously filed a motion to vacate, set aside or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The motion was denied by the district court, and we affirmed. <em>United States v. Dutton, </em>No. 98-6719, 1998 WL 613828, 161 F.3d 4 (4th Cir. Sept. 4, 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The current action was filed by Dutton in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Dutton alleged that his sentence is in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\u201cICCPR\u201d), and in violation of the holding of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). On the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, a magistrate judge recommended that the petition be dismissed without prejudice because the petition was, in actuality, a second motion under \u00a7 2255. Dutton had not sought permission to file a second motion under \u00a7 2255, and was therefore barred from filing the motion. The magistrate judge declined to recommend transferring the case to the Western District of North Carolina because Dutton acknowledged that he had not sought permission to file the motion. The district court adopted the recommendation without change. Dutton filed a timely appeal. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">The district court dismissed the petition on a purely legal basis. Our review is <em>de novo. United States v. Brown, </em>155 F.3d 431, 434 (4th Cir.1998); <em>Ashe v. Styles, </em>67 F.3d 46, 50 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">As the district court found, Dutton\u2019s petition was a challenge to the validity of his sentence and was therefore required to be brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255. <em>In re Vial, </em>115 F.3d 1192, 1194 (4th Cir. 1997). Because Dutton has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court correctly concluded that he cannot file a second motion unless he obtains our permission to do so. <em>Id. </em>We have not granted permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">Dutton seeks to avoid the requirements of \u00a7 2255 by arguing that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his sentence, and that he is therefore statutorily entitled to bring his claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Dutton states that he is being held in violation of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and that because \u00a7 2241 but not \u00a7 2255 includes language regarding violations of \u201ctreaties,\u201d he must be permitted to file his petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c)(3). This argument is plainly meritless. Regardless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>of whether claims based on violations of treaties must be brought pursuant to \u00a7 2241, Dutton\u2019s claim fails because the ICCPR is not privately enforceable. To be privately enforceable, a treaty must either be self-executing or Congress must have passed implementing legislation. <em>Goldstar (Panama) S.A. v. United States, </em>967 F.2d 965, 968 (4th Cir.1992); <em>Breard v. Pruett, </em>134 F.3d 615, 622 (4th Cir.1998) (Butzner, J., concurring). To the extent that a treaty has not been implemented and is not self-executing, habeas relief is not available. <em>Garza v. Lappin, </em>253 F.3d 918, 924 (7th Cir.2001). The ICCPR is not self-executing, nor has it been implemented by Congress. <em>See </em>Senate Resolution of Ratification of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 102d Cong., 138 Cong. Rec. S4781-01, S4784 (April 2, 1992) (noting that \u201cthe United States declares that the provisions of Articles 1 through 27 of the [ICCPR] are not self-executing\u201d); Senate Committee on Foreign Relations Report on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, S. Exec. Rep. 102-23, 31 I.L.M. 645, 652, 657 (1992) (stating \u201c[t]he Administration proposed a declaration stating that Articles 1 through 27 of the [ICCPR] are not self-executing\u201d and that \u201c[t]he intent is to clarify that the [ICCPR] will not create a private cause of action in U.S. courts\u201d); <em>see also Igartua De La Rosa v. United States, </em>32 F.3d 8, 10 n. 1 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that ICCPR is not privately enforceable).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Dutton also makes an equally meritless argument based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139 (4th Cir.2001). And it certainly has not been made retroactive by the Supreme Court, which is what would be required in this case, since this is Dutton\u2019s second motion. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Sanders, </em>247 F.3d at 146 n.4. Finally, we reject Dutton\u2019s argument that his sentence violates 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(s). This claim relates to the validity of his sentence and is therefore governed by \u00a7 2255. \u201cIt is beyond question that \u00a7 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual is unable to obtain relief under that provision.\u201d <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">For the above stated reasons, the district court properly dismissed Dutton\u2019s petition. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
