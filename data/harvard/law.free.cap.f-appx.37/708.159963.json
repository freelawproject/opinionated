Felton\u2019s counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but addressing the propriety of the district court\u2019s plea hearing conducted pursuant to Fed. R.Crim.P. 11. Tabor has also filed an informal brief on his own behalf raising several additional contentions. We have reviewed the plea hearing and the colloquy the district court undertook with Tabor. We find the court fully complied with Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>11 and that Tabor\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. Moreover, we find the issues raised in Tabor\u2019s informal brief to be without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. This Court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this Court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
