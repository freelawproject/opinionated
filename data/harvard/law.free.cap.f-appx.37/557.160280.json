He appeals, arguing that his trial counsel provided him with constitutionally deficient assistance by failing to present his argument that the theft had been committed by Linda Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-22\">In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show (1) that his attorney\u2019s \u201cperformance was deficient ... [by] showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment\u201d and (2) that \u201cthe deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>In this case, Cantey cannot show that his counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, let alone that it resulted in prejudice. The argument that Cantey now advances would have been a dangerous argument to present at trial, because a jury would likely have considered the case as presenting a choice between the defense\u2019s theory, which was contradicted by the testimony of every witness that testified on the matter including the defendant, and the prosecution\u2019s theory. Moreover, Can-teas theory that it was Robinson who took the gun was scarcely exculpatory. To the contrary, it would have strongly suggested Cantey\u2019s guilt on the theory that he aided and abetted or procured her theft, given the evidence that Cantey entered the store with Robinson, asked to see the gun, and later bought ammunition for it at another store. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Under the circumstances, we cannot conclude that defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy was deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
