The plaintiffs ADA claim fails because the plaintiff has not shown that his socialization problems and sporadic lapses in his ability to care for himself constitute substantial limitations. <em>See Bragdon v. Abbott, </em>524 U.S. 624, 639, 118 S.Ct. 2196, 141 L.Ed.2d 540 (1998) (under the ADA a plaintiff must show a \u201csubstantial limit\u201d on a major life activity). The plaintiffs claim under the Rehabilitation Act fails because the defendant does not receive federal funding. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a). And the plaintiffs equal protection claim fails because the plaintiff has not shown that the purpose of New York Election Law \u00a7 6-138(4) is to discriminate against disabled individuals. <em>Johnson v. Wing, </em>178 F.3d 611, 615 (2d Cir.1999) (a facially neutral statute only violates the Equal Protection Clause where its effect on disabled individuals reflects \u201cpurposeful discrimination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
