We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s determination that Woldearegay failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, we deny Woldearegay\u2019s petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Woldearegay v. INS, </em>No. A70-817-716 (B.I.A. Jan. 30, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
