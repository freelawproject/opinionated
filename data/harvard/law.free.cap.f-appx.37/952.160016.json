R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">Defendant Dracy Lamont McKneely was convicted by a jury of aiding and abetting the distribution of cocaine base and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Representing himself, he appeals from the denial of his motion for habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">The district court thoroughly reviewed defendant\u2019s timely motions and untimely supplements and amendments. The court determined that defendant\u2019s initial claims were either without merit or were procedurally barred. The court determined that two of the claims raised in defendant\u2019s untimely supplements and amendments did not insert new theories into the case and could relate back to a timely filed motion, but they were without merit. The court held that the other claims raised in defendant\u2019s supplements and amendments inserted new theories into the case, could not relate back to a timely filed motion, and required this court\u2019s consent before they could be pursued in a second or successive petition. The court denied defendant\u2019s motions to amend as to his new claims, denied habeas relief on his other claims, and denied defendant\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability (COA). Defendant renews his request for a COA in this court. To obtain it, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">In one of his untimely supplements, defendant asserted that under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the government was required to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt the quantity of drugs which formed the basis of his sentence. Defendant argues on appeal that his supplemental filings related back to his original \u00a7 2255 motion and his <em>Apprendi </em>claim was therefore timely. We have carefully reviewed the district court\u2019s decision in light of defendant\u2019s brief and the record on appeal. We find no error. For substantially the same reasons as those given by the district court, the application for a certificate of appealability is denied as to defendant\u2019s argument that he should have been allowed to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion to add his <em>Apprendi </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">Defendant does not request permission from this court to file a second or successive petition to bring his <em>Apprendi </em>claim. Even if he were to do so, we would deny the request. <em>See Browning v. United States, </em>241 F.3d 1262 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">The application for a COA is denied and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1001-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
