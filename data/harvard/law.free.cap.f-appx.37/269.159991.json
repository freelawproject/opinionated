In this action, brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, O\u2019Brien claims that Maui County, MCPD, and county officials violated her constitutional rights by failing adequately to train police officers on domestic violence and failing to protect her from abuse. The district court granted summary judgment to defendants on all claims. It also denied O\u2019Brien\u2019s motions to compel discovery. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Atr\">A. Claims Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">O\u2019Brien alleged that former MCPD Police Chief Howard Tagamori and MCPD Sergeant Jeffrey Tanoue violated her due process rights by failing to protect her from domestic violence. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Tagamori and Tanoue on qualified immunity grounds on these claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">\u201c[GJovernment officials performing discretionary functions, generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established ... constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (citations omitted). There is generally no constitutional duty on the part of government officials to protect members of the public against harm inflicted by third parties. <em>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Serv., </em>489 U.S. 189, 196-97, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). We have identified two exceptions to this rule. The government assumes the constitutional duty to protect a person when it: (1) creates a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with that person; or (2) affirmatively places that person in danger. <em>Wang v. Reno, </em>81 F.3d 808, 818 (9th Cir.1996) (per curiam). Neither exception applies to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">A special relationship may exist where the state has \u201ccreated or assumed a custodial relationship toward the plaintiff,\u201d where it \u201caffirmatively placed the plaintiff in a position of danger,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> where it \u201cwas aware of a specific risk of harm to the plaintiff,\u201d or where \u201cthe state affirmatively committed itself to the protection of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Balistreri v. Pacifica Police Dep't, </em>901 F.2d 696, 700 (9th Cir.1988). The district court correctly concluded that O\u2019Brien\u2019s evidence was insufficient to show that a special relationship existed. As the district court noted, it is undisputed that O\u2019Brien was not in custody during the time that any abuse occurred and therefore no special obligation to protect arose on that basis. Moreover, the fact that O\u2019Brien had obtained restraining orders on several occasions and alerted MCPD officers to the threat posed by Rock did not give rise to a special relationship under this Circuit\u2019s precedent. <em>See id. </em>at 698-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>O\u2019Brien fares no better under the \u201cdanger creation\u201d exception. \u201cThe \u2018danger creation\u2019 basis for a claim ... necessarily involves affirmative conduct on the part of the state in placing the plaintiff in danger.\u201d <em>L.W. v. Grubbs, </em>974 F.2d 119, 121 (9th Cir.1992). To determine whether defendants affirmatively placed O\u2019Brien in danger, we must focus on \u201cwhether the officers left [her] in a situation that was more dangerous than the one in which they found [her].\u201d <em>Munger v. City of Glasgow Police Dep't, </em>227 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir. 2000). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to O\u2019Brien, the facts here do not support such a conclusion. Between 1995 and 1997, Rock was arrested on three separate occasions for abusing O\u2019Brien. There is no evidence that in any of these situations the police affirmatively imperiled O\u2019Brien\u2019s physical safety. To the contrary, the evidence shows the police repeatedly taking action to intervene in incidents of physical violence and arresting the responsible party. Therefore, this case does not present the type of affirmative official conduct that we have held falls within the ambit of the danger creation exception. <em>See id. </em>at 1087; <em>Grubbs, </em>974 F.2d at 123; <em>Wood v. Ostrander, </em>879 F.2d 583, 589-90 (9th Cir.1989).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">O\u2019Brien next turns to the district court\u2019s dismissal of her due process claims against Maui County. Her allegations against Maui County mirror those against the individual defendants: that Maui County violated her due process rights by failing adequately to train its police officers and failing to protect her from domestic violence. A local government entity may be hable under \u00a7 1983 if it has a \u201cpolicy of inaction and such inaction amounts to a failure to protect constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Oviatt v. Pearce, </em>954 F.2d 1470, 1474 (9th Cir.1992) (citing <em>City of Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197). The custom or policy of inaction, however, must be the result of a \u201cconscious,\u201d <em>City of Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, or \u201cdeliberate choice to follow a course of action,\u201d <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </em>475 U.S. 469, 483, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986) (Brennan, J., plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">O\u2019Brien has not shown that Maui County consciously or deliberately pursued a policy of inaction with respect to her constitutional rights. Any connection between MCPD\u2019s alleged noncompliance with regulations promulgated under the Violence Against Women Act and an alleged broader policy of denying protection to domestic violence victims is too attenuated to support O\u2019Brien\u2019s municipal liability theory. Further, the district court did not err in determining that the declarations of four other domestic violence survivors were not enough to prove a \u00a7 1983 violation against the county.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Finally, O\u2019Brien contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on her equal protection claims. It held that these claims failed because O\u2019Brien had not provided any evidence of discriminatory intent. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>agree. \u201c[A] long line of Supreme Court cases makes clear that the Equal Protection Clause requires proof of discriminatory <em>intent </em>or <em>motive.\u201d Navarro v. Block, </em>72 F.3d 712, 716 (9th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). Other than proffering evidence of irregular domestic violence training and arguably improper police responses to several domestic violence victims, O\u2019Brien has failed to provide evidence of the requisite \u201cinvidious intent\u201d to prove an equal protection violation. <em>See id. </em>at 717. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Maui County defendants on the equal protection issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">B. Discovery Requests</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">O\u2019Brien also contends that the district court erred in denying several discovery requests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court denied O\u2019Brien\u2019s motion to compel the production of the personnel files of the Maui County prosecutors and specific police officers. As these personnel files have no demonstrable relevance to O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying O\u2019Brien\u2019s requests in this regard. The other discovery denials at issue addressed O\u2019Brien\u2019s requests for information regarding Maui County\u2019s domestic violence prosecution policies; documents related to complaints, investigative reports, and prosecution records for domestic violence and other violent crimes; and documents related to victim and witness protection policies. In denying O\u2019Brien\u2019s motion to compel responses, the district court ruled that O\u2019Brien\u2019s requests were irrelevant, overbroad, and unduly burdensome. Given the unduly expansive scope and dubious necessity of the documents O\u2019Brien sought, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying O\u2019Brien\u2019s requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">C. Negligence Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">Having disposed of all of O\u2019Brien\u2019s federal claims on summary judgment, the district court declined to assert supplemental jurisdiction over O\u2019Brien\u2019s state law negligence claims. O\u2019Brien contends that this constituted reversible error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is no basis for her contention. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3), a district court may, in its discretion, decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related state law claims once it has \u201cdismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction. ...\u201d As the district court properly dismissed the federal claims, it did not abuse its discretion in dismissing the state law negligence claims as well. <em>See Ove v. Gwinn, </em>264 F.3d 817, 826 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b321-15\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. We earlier issued an order to show cause (\"OSC\u201d) why this appeal should not be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction, <em>i.e., </em>lack of a final, appealable judgment, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the record indicated that no judgment had been entered on O\u2019Briens claims against defendant Timothy Rock. In response to the OSC, O\u2019Brien filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of all of her claims against Rock, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(l)(i). This dismissal rendered the district court\u2019s judgment a \"final decision\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1291. <em>See Duke Energy Trading &amp; Mktg., L.L.C. v. Davis, </em>267 F.3d 1042, 1049 (9th Cir.2001), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>70 U.S.L.W. 3580 (U.S. Mar. 5, 2002) (No. 01-4312).

O\u2019Brien also argues that the county violated her due process rights by failing adequately to train police officers on domestic violence enforcement. This argument also fails. Section 1983 liability for failure to train requires that such failure \"amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.\u201d <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989).
