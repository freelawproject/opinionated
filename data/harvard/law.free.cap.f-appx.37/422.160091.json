R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s motion requesting oral argument is denied and the case is ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-22\">Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Courtney Scott appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of the civil rights complaint he brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Scott is currently incarcerated in an Oklahoma state penitentiary. Scott complains that Defendants have violated his Eighth Amendment rights by denying him appropriate medical and dental treatment. Scott also alleges that his due process rights were violated in two disciplinary hearings. Finally, Scott asserts that Defendants have impaired his First Amendment right of access to the courts and that Defendants have retaliated against him for exercising his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-23\">Defendants moved to dismiss all of Scott\u2019s claims and the court ordered a <em>Martinez </em>report. <em>See Martinez v. Aaron, </em>570 F.2d 317, 319-20 (10th Cir.1978). After considering Defendants\u2019 brief, the <em>Martinez </em>report, and Scott\u2019s response, the court dismissed Scott\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C \u00a7 1915(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The district court\u2019s order contains a comprehensive description of each of Scott\u2019s claims and the duplication of the court\u2019s description is not warranted. With respect to Scott\u2019s First Amendment claims, the court concluded that Scott had failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice from Defendants\u2019 alleged interference with his access to the courts. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 350-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (\u201c[T]he inmate therefore must ... demonstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d). The court then concluded that Scott\u2019s Eighth Amendment assertions amounted only to a difference of opinion as to the need for medical and dental treatment or the adequacy of any treatment and, thus, Defendants\u2019 acts did not constitute deliberate indifference to Scott\u2019s serious medical needs. <em>See Johnson v. Stephan, </em>6 F.3d 691, 692 (10th Cir.1993). To the extent Scott was complaining of delays in receiving medical treatment, he failed to demonstrate that any alleged delay had resulted in substantial harm. <em>See Olson v. Stotts, </em>9 F.3d 1475, 1477 (10th Cir.1993) (\u201c[Djelay in medical care can only constitute an Eighth Amendment violation if there has been deliberate indifference which results in substantial harm.\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The district court also concluded that Scott failed to state a due process claim because in each of the two prison disciplinary proceedings he was: (1) provided with advance notice of the charges, (2) furnished an opportunity to present a defense, and (3) given a written statement of the reasons for the disciplinary decision. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 564-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Additionally, the disciplinary sanctions were supported by some evidence. <em>See Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Inst, at Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). Finally, the district court concluded that Scott\u2019s allegations of retaliation were conclusory and not supported by allegations of specific facts, rendering them insufficient to state a valid claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Upon review of Scott\u2019s appellate brief and <em>de novo </em>review of the entire record on appeal, this court affirms the district court\u2019s dismissal of Scott\u2019s complaint for substantially those reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order dated September 14, 2001. Scott is reminded that he remains obligated to continue making partial payments until his appellate filing fee is paid in fuh. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b470-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
