Ferguson\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Relief was premised on the district court\u2019s conclusion the state trial court, in violation of the Sixth Amendment, improperly denied Ms. Ferguson substitute counsel after she and her appointed counsel informed the court of the total breakdown in communications between the defendant and her attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-16\">Seeking reversal of that judgment, the State here asserts the trial court\u2019s refusal to substitute counsel was fully supported by the substantial evidence that Ms. Ferguson\u2019s distrust of her counsel was irrational and a product of her contempt for the entire judicial process. Moreover, the State contends the district court\u2019s holding has improperly expanded rights protected under the Sixth Amendment by requiring a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d between a defendant and her counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-17\">Nevertheless, we conclude the district court did not err because the peculiar facts of this case disclose that despite substantial evidence, the state court failed to inquire into the role Ms. Ferguson\u2019s mental capacity played in her inability to communicate with her appointed counsel. Its analysis of the breakdown of the relationship was therefore flawed and unsupportable. We agree with the district court and affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">On direct appeal, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed Ms. Ferguson\u2019s convictions, rejecting her Sixth Amendment and competency claims. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>254 Kan. 62, 864 P.2d 693, 694-95 (1993). Among the facts the court recited relating to Petitioner\u2019s conviction was her admission of killing a man and setting him on fire. Subsequent investigation established the decedent was Petitioner\u2019s former husband. From the outset, Ms. Ferguson did not deny her entanglement in the crime. Although Ms. Ferguson told investigators she did not intend to kill, there is no doubt in the record the crime was flagrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The crux of this case, however, lies within Ms. Ferguson\u2019s psychological problems, first diagnosed in 1983, several years before the crime of which she was convicted. After an initial evaluation, Dr. Herbert Modlin<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Meninger Clinic concluded Ms. Ferguson suffered from Mixed Personality Disorder with Paranoid and Avoidant Features.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During this time, Ms. Ferguson\u2019s son was stationed in Saudi Arabia, a fact which plunged her into a deep depression, including a loss of sleep precipitated by recurring nightmares of his death. Her fears were exacerbated when her ex-husband cancelled her long distance service, disconnecting her from any news of her son.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">To defend the charges of first degree felony murder and aggravated arson, the trial court appointed Ron Wurtz, a District Public Defender, who appeared at the first preliminary hearing on February 15, 1991. From the outset, Ms. Ferguson complained that because Mr. Wurtz was hired and paid by the State of Kansas, he could not possibly represent her interests. On March 29, 1991, Mr. Wurtz filed a motion for continuance alleging Ms. Ferguson\u2019s \u201cemotional turmoil\u201d and the trauma of the events rendered her incapable of assisting him in preparing for trial and crafting a defense. On April 16, 1991, Mr. Wurtz filed a second motion for a continuance based on Ms. Ferguson\u2019s hospitalization for treatment of her mental illness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Her psychiatrist, Dr. Gilbert. Parks, subsequently testified at the hearing on the motion that Ms. Ferguson was severely depressed \u201cwith suicidal plan and ideations.\u201d He opined not only was she so ill she could not endure the stress of trial or assist in her defense, but also, she should not have any contact with Mr. Wurtz<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>unless counsel went through him. The court granted this continuance and set July 29, 1991, for trial unless Mr. Wurtz raised concerns about her competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">On July 24, 1991, Mr. Wurtz filed a motion to determine competency, stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">The only method counsel has of trying to communicate with his client is by passing information to Dr. Parks. Dr. Parks is not a lawyer, and counsel cannot be personally satisfied that [petitioner] is receiving proper legal information with which she can make the decisions that are the client\u2019s to make, such as whether to testify or to enter plea negotiations. Counsel believes [petitioner\u2019s] mental condition precludes her from thus assisting in her defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">On the following day, the trial court ordered Dr. James Horne, a court psychiatrist, to evaluate Ms. Ferguson. After examination, Dr. Horne concluded Ms. Ferguson was incompetent to stand trial because she suffered from a mental illness and exhibited signs of paranoia. Though he judged her \u201coriented, cooperative, and alert,\u201d Dr. Horne recommended Petitioner was incapable of working with her attorney. On that basis, the court found Ms. Ferguson incompetent to stand trial, committed her to the Larned State Security Hospital, and ordered the staff to report on her progress within sixty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In that report submitted on October 21, 1991 (the Report), the evaluating staff diagnosed Petitioner with Schizoaffective Disorder, Depressive Type, described in the DSM III as a disorder in which the individual suffers from delusions or hallucinations. Nonetheless, the staff concluded she was competent to stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATZ\">[Ferguson\u2019s] expressed unwillingness to cooperate with the attorney appears to be related to her strong feelings of being let down by him because he never contacted her and was not working in her best interest while she was in jail. There are no strong indications to suggest that her mental illness is the basis for her lack of trust in her attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\"><em>Ferguson, </em>864 P.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">Five days before trial began and shortly after Ms. Ferguson was discharged from Larned, Mr. Wurtz again moved to withdraw as counsel. In support, he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGV\">Your Honor, my request to withdraw as counsel is somewhat tied up with the [competence] report, as the Court knows the contents of that report. I respectfully request permission to withdraw from this case as counsel for Ms. Ferguson for the reason that although the doctors think she\u2019s able to \u2014 she\u2019s able to cooperate with counsel, I have my own lay suspicions and sincere beliefs that she cannot cooperate with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-13\">Since her release from the Larned State Security Hospital, I have communicated with her physician, Doctor Gilbert Parks, and that, as far as I know, is the only communication directly that I had with Ms. Ferguson until actually yesterday when I spoke with her briefly on the phone. Ah, I had passed several requests through Doctor Parks that she come in and talk to me. She has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>done so. I do not know the reasons why except that she has a deep and abiding distrust of everything I do. She feels, Your Honor, that everything she tells me, that I pass on to the District Attorney. And the way she presents herself, I think she sincerely believes that. The district attorney can tell you whether it\u2019s true or not, which, of course, it\u2019s not. But she believes it. If she firmly believes that, it follows that she would be in fact protecting herself by not telling me what I need to know in order to put on a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">Your Honor, back when I first represented her, within the first month, we had communication. During that communication, she provided me with some details which I needed in order to begin working up a defense. That, however, was before I had completely investigated it myself. And as the Court may understand, without me releasing any confidences in this request, questions have come up which I believe that only Lena Ferguson can help me deal with. She cannot do that. She says she cannot do that because she does not trust me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">One of the grounds for allowing withdrawal of counsel is that the attorney-client relationship has deteriorated to the point that it is effectively no relationship at all. When I spoke with Ms. Ferguson yesterday over the mix-up, and as I advised the Court, my failure to make sure she was notified of the hearing set yesterday, she very clearly told me both today and yesterday, that she believed that I had done that in order to make her look bad. In her demeanor and in her statements, she appears to be sincere in that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">Your Honor, a defense lawyer\u2019s relationship with his client is the key to a good defense, not just a competent defense. It\u2019s certainly a key to a competent defense. But really, in this case, it\u2019s a key to a defense at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">In the present state of our relationship, as I see it, there being no relationship, I don\u2019t believe I can effectively present a defense on her behalf. And I sincerely believe that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-9\">As I have been preparing for this intensively for the last week after the Court has advised us of the trial-I was prepared once before, but it takes some time to get back up to speed again-there are questions that I fear without her having some trust in me, that I will ask one wrong question or say one wrong thing that I would know to avoid if she could communicate with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">I am totally frustrated and I hope that doesn\u2019t get into it. But when I get frustrated, that\u2019s a side event that causes me not to concentrate too. And I worry about how effective I can be under these circumstances. And I implore this Court to consider appointing counsel knowing that it would necessarily result in another postponement of the trial, but I think fairness requires that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1V\">At that time, Mr. Wurtz also stated Petitioner\u2019s distrust \u201cis deeper than simply who is paying the bill.\u201d He expanded, \u201c[S]he has much \u2014 many more complaints about things that have happened in the past.\u201d Later in the hearing, Ms. Ferguson asked to be excused from the proceedings. Given that request, Mr. Wurtz renewed his motion to withdraw, stating that it was \u201cextremely dangerous for a defense lawyer to consent to his client leaving when there may be a question that needs to be answered\u201d and that her request was a \u201cfurther demonstration ... of the fact that [their] relationship is such that she cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>help [him].\u201d Nonetheless, the trial court denied the motion to withdraw and allowed Ms. Ferguson to leave the hearing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">On November 18, 1991, the morning of the first day of trial, Mr. Wurtz again moved to withdraw, stating in his supporting brief,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">[S]ince [petitioner\u2019s] release from jail she has consistently refused to discuss the matters which have resulted in the charges now pending against her. She has expressed the belief that present counsel is in league with the authorities who seek to punish her for the events which are the foundation for this action. She currently refuses to even come to counsel\u2019s office to permit counsel to explain the trial process, seek her input on jury selection, discuss the theory of the case which must be presented in light of her refusal to testify, and generally to assist counsel in even the most rudimentary matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Further, he stated to preserve client confidences he could not fully disclose the \u201cincidents supporting his belief;\u201d thus, he could not provide Ms. Ferguson \u201cconstitutionally valid assistance under the conditions\u201d that then existed. Mr. Wurtz asserted he had nothing to add factually to his previous motions, but that in his final preparation for trial, he did not have Ms. Ferguson\u2019s assistance in clarifying some questions in preparing for cross examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">The trial court again denied the motion, emphasizing that Mr. Wurtz was a highly qualified attorney, a fact which it believed removed any reasonable basis for substituting him. In support, it remarked that Mr. Wurtz succeeded in reducing Petitioner\u2019s bond to secure her release. The trial court then based its conclusion solely on testimony that was offered at a hearing held a week before Dr. Parks saw Petitioner and before either of her hospitalizations occurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Trial proceeded, culminating in a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">In rejecting the Sixth Amendment claim, the Kansas Supreme Court set forth some of this history but characterized it, much like the trial court had, to reflect Petitioner\u2019s dissatisfaction with Mr. Wurtz\u2019s competence as a lawyer. Quoting the Report, the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">The district court judge who received this recommendation, unlike the staff members who made it, was aware that Ferguson\u2019s complaints of her counsel\u2019s lack of diligence were not supported by the facts. He knew that Ferguson\u2019s bond had been reduced and she had been released from jail. With regard to her complaint that her competency evaluation should have occurred at an earlier time, the district court knew that her personal psychiatrist, Dr. Parks, testified on May 1 that she understood the nature and purpose of the legal proceeding against her and that, with (his) treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ment for a month or two, she would be able to assist in her defense. The district judge knew that Dr. Parks had testified in May that Ferguson had a \u201csuspicious distrust almost at a paranoid level which makes it difficult for her to cooperate with anyone <em>at this point.\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag7\"><em>Ferguson, </em>864 P.2d at 701 (emphasis added). Citing <em>Thomas v. State, </em>421 So.2d 160 (Fla.1982), and <em>State v. Long, </em>206 Mont. 40, 669 P.2d 1068 (1983), the court concluded although the breakdown in communication between Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Wurtz was \u201cabsolute, her refusal to cooperate is not of itself basis for reversal on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d 864 P.2d at 701. Observing that \u201carguably\u201d the trial court should have appointed substitute counsel, it opined \u201c[t]here is no reason to believe such a substitute counsel would fare any better than trial counsel did.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">II. Relief under \u00a7 2254</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Petitioner then proceeded with her federal habeas action. After her petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies, this court reversed and remanded the case, holding all of Ms. Ferguson\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d simply supplemented rather than fundamentally altered her claim. <em>Ferguson v. McKune, </em>No. 99-3214, 2000 WL 1133134 (Aug. 10, 2000) (unpublished). In that appeal, as here, the State argued Petitioner transformed her Sixth Amendment claim from one based on distrust of an attorney paid by the State, to one mired in the details of her poor relationship with Mr. Wurtz. We responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">Our review of the record does not bear this out. Mr. Wurtz clearly, repeatedly, and emphatically informed the trial court that there were other reasons petitioner did not trust him and would not cooperate with him. Indeed, he stated that petitioner\u2019s distrust of state-paid attorneys was not the overriding reason for their bad relationship. Rather, it was the Kansas courts that focused the attention on petitioner\u2019s distrust of an attorney in the state\u2019s employ. The fact that the Kansas courts chose to concentrate on petitioner\u2019s professed distrust of such an attorney, however, is not dispositive of our exhaustion analysis. We conclude that petitioner exhausted her Sixth Amendment claim in the state forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">2000 WL 1133134, at * 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">After remand, an evidentiary hearing was held by a Magistrate Judge who forwarded a recommendation the writ be granted. In adopting that recommendation, <em>Ferguson v. Koerner, </em>131 F.Supp.2d 1208, 1214 (D.Kan.2001), the district court employed the four-step inquiry we set forth in <em>Romero v. Furlong </em>to decide whether the complete breakdown in communications rendered the attorney\u2019s representation constitutionally ineffective. 215 F.3d 1107, 1113 (10th Cir.2000). Those four factors are: (1) whether petitioner made a timely motion requesting new counsel; (2) whether the trial court adequately inquired into the matter; (3) whether the conflict between the petitioner and her attorney was so great it resulted in a total lack of communication; and (4) whether petitioner substantially and unjustifiably contributed to the breakdown in communication. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">The district court agreed with the State that only the second factor was at issue in this case, that is, whether the trial court adequately inquired into the matter. It found the trial court correctly inquired into Ms. Ferguson\u2019s distrust based on her attorney\u2019s state funding. Nonetheless, it concluded the trial court unequivocally failed to inquire into Mr. Wurtz\u2019s representations that other factors contributed to the breakdown in communications. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>support, the district court cited Mr. Wurtz\u2019s November 13 statement: \u201cthe fact of payment of counsel, only [Petitioner] can answer whether that makes a difference to her, and the Court may obviously inquire. But that is not what I have found to be an overriding concern in her expressions of discontent with me.\u201d The district court pointedly observed this statement provoked no further inquiry by the trial court, which instead relied upon its memory of a hearing seven months previously. The district court also observed on the morning of trial the court \u201cdeclined, again relying on its prior understanding, to inquire into the matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Guided by the factual contrasts presented by <em>Romero, </em>in which relief was denied, the district court noted, in Ms. Ferguson\u2019s case, the motion to substitute counsel was renewed \u201con several occasions, and most importantly, indicated additional factors were contributing to the communication breakdown between Mr. Wurtz and herself.\u201d 131 F.Supp.2d at 1214. Upon these facts, the district court stated, it was <em>\u201cnot </em>reluctant to conclude that the trial court should have expanded the scope of its inquiry and considered matters beyond the already settled state funding issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Like <em>Romero, </em>this case is pre-AEDPA; thus, the standard of review <em>Romero </em>enunciated applies here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">As a federal court conducting a review in habeas of state court determinations, our role is secondary and limited. Although we review legal conclusions de novo, a state court\u2019s factual findings are entitled to a presumption of correctness. Mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo, but the presumption of correctness will continue to apply to any findings of fact underlying mixed questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">215 F.3d at 1110 <em>(citing Castro v. Ward, </em>138 F.3d 810, 815-16 (10th Cir.1998)). Thus, here, too, \u201c[t]he substance of our review is confined\u201d to whether Ms. Ferguson is \u201cin custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Although the State concedes <em>Romero </em>is \u201cgood law,\u201d it urges, \u201cits analytical framework must be applied in a habeas case with a more demanding standard of review.\u201d That contention is fatuous. As noted, <em>Romero </em>is a habeas case. By setting the stage in that fashion, however, the State seems bent upon convincing us that somehow an abuse of discretion standard sneaked in and infected the district court\u2019s analysis and review. Unequivocally, the district court set forth the correct standard, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Against this background, the State argues the district court simply \u201csubstituted its decision for that of the state trial court,\u201d rejecting factual findings and engaging in \u201cunwarranted fact-finding on its own.\u201d It maintains the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to appoint substitute counsel in light of the uncontroverted fact the absolute breakdown in communications was tied entirely to Ms. Ferguson\u2019s \u201cown irrational and uncooperative behavior.\u201d However, this and other of the State\u2019s arguments ignore the critical point that it is clear from the record, as it would have been clear to the trial court had it made further inquiry. Petitioner\u2019s irrational and uncooperative behavior was the product of her mental illness and not of a rational mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">It cannot be gainsaid that open and free communication between client and counsel is the touchstone of the lawyer\u2019s effectiveness. In this case we are certain that touchstone was missing because of Ms. Ferguson\u2019s illness. That illness provoked delusional beliefs that prevented her from communicating with counsel so that he could effectively defend her. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>share the state court\u2019s comfort that Mr. Wurtz was able to fully represent his client\u2019s interests simply because he was able to achieve some minor successes along the way without Petitioner\u2019s help. The overriding fact is Mr. Wurtz went to trial without a prepared defense because his client\u2019s sickness impeded her ability to communicate and furnish counsel the necessary assistance. Likewise, we also disagree with the state court there was no reason to believe different counsel would have been better able to represent Ms. Ferguson effectively. Indeed, we believe the record demonstrates the factors underlying her delusional rejection of Mr. Wurtz were attributable to him alone and were not a foreseeable deterrent to other counsel. We conclude a more judicious inquiry into all the reasons provoking Mr. Wurtz\u2019s attempts to withdraw from the case would have illuminated these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">We conclude the district court correctly followed and applied the rule of <em>Romero. </em>Its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-6\">. The Kansas Public Defender's Office called . Dr. Modlin the day after Ms. Ferguson's arrest. In that and a subsequent interview, Dr. Modlin reported Ms. Ferguson was \"depressed, tearful, and tense\u201d about her son and exhibited signs of paranoia, refusing meals, served by food handlers who did not wear gloves, medications, and injections. She told Dr. Modlin the interview rooms were bugged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">. The American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 220-21 (3d ed. 1980) (DSM III), the version used at the time of treatment, defines this condition as a \"chronic disturbance of mood involving either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, usual activities and pastimes.\u201d The paranoia includes \"unwarranted suspiciousness and mistrust of people which makes the person reluctant to confide in others for fear the information will be used against her. The avoidant features include a hypersensitivity to potential rejection or humiliation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b426-13\">. Mr. Wurtz also filed his first motion to withdraw, stating that Ms. Ferguson \"has no confidence in her present counsel or in any counsel who is employed by the Public Defender's office. Said conflict and absence of confidence is [sic] so serious that the attorney-client relationship is so adversely affected that there is effectively no counsel for the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b426-14\">. Mr. Wurtz testified at the habeas hearing he tried every means to persuade Ms. Ferguson to cooperate but was usually arguing with her to help herself.

I cried with her. I threatened her with the possibility of prison. I sent some of my staff to talk with her. I yelled at her. I even tried physical intimidation to get her to understand the consequences of not communicating with me by blocking her exit from the interview room and backing her into a corner. None of these methods worked, and I became increasingly frustrated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">Ms. Ferguson testified she asked him to get her counseling when she was in jail, but he failed to provide anyone.

The court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">If she elects not to discuss her case with Mr. Wurtz, or to fully cooperate, I can only conclude that it is her conscious decision not to do so, and it is her responsibility for taking that position. Mr. Wurtz has done nothing in this case to justify releasing him. He is a highly competent, highly experienced attorney. He has done everything in the Court\u2019s view to represent his client effectively and diligently. And I find no ground, whatsoever, to grant this request.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b429-13\">.
