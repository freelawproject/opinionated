The affidavit set forth detailed observations that were made by Potter, and other members of the Jersey City Police Narcotics Squad, during a ten-day surveillance, as well as' information that had been received from a \u201creliable source.\u201d The affidavit contained no dates as to when the surveillance had been conducted, nor did it contain the date when the information from the supposedly reliable source had been received by the police. The affidavit did aver, in its opening paragraph, that narcotics <em>are being stored </em>in both the premises and the motor vehicle described particularly therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the State produced detective Potter, who had procured the warrant, and who proceeded to testify as to the circumstances surrounding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>his application for it.

You told him that under oath?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-20\">A. Yes, I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-21\">The municipal judge who issued the warrant was called as a defense witness. He testified that he could not recall the specific application then before the court because of the large number of applications he had considered in the intervening time.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-22\">The County Court Judge in granting the motion to suppress stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-23\">I have no reason to disbelieve what Officer Potter told me, but I find no eases which permit an affidavit for a search warrant to be supplemented by the testimony of the officer applying for it. The cases indicate that either a transcript of the testimony given in addition to the affidavit or the testimony of the Magistrate are the methods by which that testimony can be brought before a reviewing court. Therefore, I don\u2019t believe the testimony of Detective Potter was competent and don\u2019t find it necessary to characterize as to credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-24\">Then, retying on <em>Rosencranz v. United </em>States, 356 <em>F. 2d </em>310 (1st <em>Cir. </em>1966), he held that the failure of the affidavit to contain an express statement as to the time when the surveillance was conducted was a fatal defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Legal precedents are ol dubious value when a court is called upon to determine whether a search warrant has been issued on probable cause. See <em>State v. </em>Kasabucki, 52 <em>N. J. </em>110, 116-117 (1968). This observation is amply demonstrated by an examination of the trial judge\u2019s reasoning in determining that the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrant issued here should be suppressed. He noted that in <em>Rosencranz </em>the <em>same deficiency </em>(lack of a date as to the ten-day surveillance) was found to be a fatal defect. He then observed that <em>Rosencranz </em>followed a long series of at least a dozen cited cases in the federal system on all levels, including both the District and Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In Rosencranz, the court had under consideration a search based upon an affidavit of an extremely sparse nature. After reviewing several decisions in which the lack of a reference to the time at which surveillance activities which had taken place had not been referred to in affidavits used to procure warrants, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">We conclude that a <em>combination </em>of undated, conclusory information from an anonymous source and an undated general allegation of personal observation by the affiant, with no other reasonably specific clues to the time of their happening, is inadequate. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The determination of whether or not there was probable cause for a warrant to issue must depend on the particular situation existing as it is disclosed either by the testimony or by the record. Barely are two eases factually identical. Numerous decisions have made it perfectly plain that no mathematical formula exists for application either by a trial or appellate court in deciding whether a search warrant was supported by probable cause. As was stated in <em>State v. </em>Kasabucki, above, \u201ceach case depends upon a sensitive appraisal of the circumstances shown to the issuing judge.\u201d 52 <em>N. J., </em>at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The affidavit Sled in support of the warrant under review closely disclosed the activities of the investigating offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>cers, including the affiant, with respect to the activities of the defendant. There is reference to a ten-day period of investigation which included specific instances of conduct unquestionably disclosing to the officers that traffic in narcotics was being conducted. Further, in support of the observations made by the officers, the affidavit also included the fact that information had been given by a reliable informant as to the narcotics activities of this defendant. In support of Potter\u2019s conclusion as to the reliability of the informant, the affidavit included names of individuals who had been apprehended and convicted for narcotics violations on the strength of this same informant\u2019s information. One of the areas sought to be searched was a motor vehicle. Based on these facts, the affiant concluded that narcotics \u201care being stored\u201d on the premises, which were specifically described, and in the motor vehicle, also specifically described. Taking all of these factors together, we are satisfied that there was sufficient contained in the affidavit to satisfy the issuing magistrate that the violations of'the law described in the affidavit were currently occurring, and that the investigative activities of the investigating officers were likewise reasonably current.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The investigating officers involved here may- well have had probable cause to believe that a crime was being committed in their presence during their investigation, and thus have arrested defendant and searched his motor vehicle without warrant. Instead, apparently mindful of the teachings of the courts with respect to the rights of citizens granted under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, they applied to the independent judicial mind, here a municipal judge, for a warrant. To characterize them now as \u201cblundering constables\u201d because of a technical defect in the supporting affidavit presented, can only serve to discourage them in the execution of their official activities. in the future. As was stated by Mr. Justice Goldberg in <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 <em>U. S. </em>102, 108-109, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>741, 746, 13 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>684 (1965) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>* * * Ii the teachings of the Court\u2019s cases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search warrants, such as the one involved here, must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion. They are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation. Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">sjs ^ ^ \u00a3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">See also: <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>279 <em>F.2d </em>712 (2 Cir). <em>cert. den </em>364 <em>U. S. </em>850, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>95, 5 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>74 (1960); <em>State v. Zuzulock, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>276 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">While we reverse the order of suppression for the reasons just expressed, we deem it necessary to make some observations about the use of supportive testimony at the hearing, in view of the apparent confusion of the trial judge as to the propriety of its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and Article I, Paragraph 7 of the Constitution of our State require that probable cause for a warrant be \u201csupported by oath or affirmation.\u201d In accordance with these injunctions, our rule <em>R. </em>3 :5-3 <em>(formerly R. R. </em>3:2A-3) requires that \u201can applicant for a search warrant shall appear personally before the judge who must take his affidavit or testimony before issuing the warrant.\u201d In the former rule, the word \u201cdeposition\u201d was used in place of \u201ctestimony,\u201d but the meaning was the same. Our rule differs from federal Eule 41 (c), which requires that \u201ca warrant shall issue only on affidavit sworn to before the judge, * * Under our rule, therefore, it is proper for an issuing judge, after having sworn the applicant for a search warrant, to interrogate the applicant as to the contents of the affidavit presented, and any additional facts which are known to the applicant at that time. The information so elicited can, of course, be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>considered by tbe issuing judge in weighing whether probable cause exists. Concededly, better practice would dictate recordation of any supportive information.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">If on subsequent proceedings to suppress the issue is one of probable cause, all of the factors before the issuing judge at the time he issued the search warrant must be before the reviewing judge, either in the form of the affidavit submitted, a transcript of any testimony given before the judge, or, if no transcript was taken, testimony based on notes made by the magistrate or on the recollection of either or both the applicant and the issuing judge. There is nothing in our cases requiring that the testimony of the issuing judge be taken at such a proceeding. The authorities relied on by respondent to this appeal, <em>Stale v. </em>Moriarty, 39 <em>N. J. 502 </em>(1963), and <em>State v. Calabro, </em>81 <em>N. J. Super. </em>422 <em>(App. Div. </em>1963), do not hold that the testimony of the issuing judge is mandatory in such a situation. Readings of both of these opinions indicate that, under the circumstances existing in each case, the appellate court concerned directed that the testimony of the issuing judge involved be taken. We do not read these opinions so as to require such a procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Of course, whether the testimony of the issuing judge will be taken at a hearing on a motion to suppress is a decision to be made by the State, or, conceivably by the defendant\u2014 as was done here\u2014at the time of the motion. The mere lack of the corroborative testimony of the issuing judge does not, however, render testimony by the applicant incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The order of suppression is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-12\"> STATE OF NEW JERSEY ) COUNTY OF HUDSON } SS</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">Det. Robert Potter o\u00ed tile Jersey City Police Department assigned to the Narcotics Squad, being duty sworn upon his oath, dejioses, says and complains:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>Within the premises situated 62 Franklin St., in Jersey City, N. J., on the third floor right, occupied by one PAUL CLEMENTE and within the confines of a 1964 Pontiac Black Vinil over maroon, N. J. Reg. BBC 990, and owned by one JOSEPH P. CLEMENTE of 83 Palisade Ave., in Jersey City, N. J., and operated by PAUL CLEMENTE previously mentioned, are being stored narcotics as defined in the New Jersey Statutes 24:18-4, known as the uniform narcotic drug law and/or narcotic paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The facts upon which these beliefs are based are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">1. Personal surveillance by deponent and by Sgt. Edmond Spies of the Jersey City Police Department and by members of the Jersey City Police Narcotic Squad, for a period of ten days, during varied periods of the day and night time, has shown known narcotic violators and in company with PAUL CLEBIENTE entering and leaving his home at 62 Franklin St., this city, and also seen in his company within the aforementioned automobile being the 1964 Pontiac, N. J. Reg. BBC 990. Among the persons seen entering and leaving the premises situate 62 Franklin St., in company with PAUL CLEMENTE include STANLEY RYDZEWSKI, WILLIAB1 NIPPING, JOHN PONTUS, LEONARD ERWINSKI, who are all narcotic users and violators of the Narcotic drug laws of the State of New Jersey. During this period of surveillance deponent noted that the said PAUL CLEBIENTE would contact individuals clustered in a group on corners and would make personal contact with each person handling a small item and receiving something in return. In all cases the person with which he made this contact would immediately leave the scene. Included in these contacts were the aforementioned known users of narcotics and narcotic law violators. In many cases it was observed by the Jersey City Police Narcotics squad and by the deponent in par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>tieular that the aforementioned PAUL CLEMENTE would approach a group of persons on a street corner while operating the 1964' Pontiac N. J. Reg. BBC 990, and would use this vehicle for such unlawful purposes as aforementioned and being violations of the narcotics laws of the State of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-20\">2. Information from a reliable source which has proven exacting in the past and has led the Jersey City Police Narcotics Squad and the deponent in particular to the arrest of persons involved in Narcotic law violations. Among such persons who have been brought before the courts of the State of New Jersey for narcotic violations include: PAUL SUCTIDOLSKI, RONALD SUCTIDOLSKI AND JAMES BLANET, JOHN HENNESSEY, ROBERT WARD. This informant has at close range seen the exchange of glassine bags from the person of PAUL CLEMENTE to persons who in return have given the said PAUL CLEMENTE United States Currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-21\">Therefor [sic! the deponent' prays that a warrant may issue so the premises situate 62 Franklin St., third floor right apartment occupied by PAUL CLEMENTE and the person of the said PAUL CLEMENTE and the 1904 Pontiac N. J. Reg. B B C 990, may be searched in a manner prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-22\">S/ Det.

D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">(concurring). My concurrence</p>\n<p id=\"Aqi\">in the reversal is based solely on Detective Potter\u2019s affidavit, without regard to his uncorroborated testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress. In testing the adequacy of such an affidavit our approach must be a common-sense one, nontechnical, ungrudging and positive. <em>United States v. Ventresca, </em>380 <em>U. S. </em>103, 108-109, 85 <em>S. Ct. </em>741, 13 <em>L. Ed. 2d </em>684 (1965). Thus, \u201cwhen the adequacy of the facts offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to show probable cause is challenged after a search made pursuant to a warrant, and their adequacy appears to be marginal, the doubt should ordinarily be resolved by sustaining the search.\u201d <em>State v. Kasabucki, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>110, 116 (1968), citing <em>Ventresca. </em>Viewed in the light of those cases, I, like my colleagues, find the affidavit sufficient to support the search warrant which issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\"><em>Rosencranz v. United States, </em>356 <em>F. 2d </em>310 (1 <em>Cir. </em>1966), on which defendant relies, is not persuasive. As the main opinion points out, the affidavit there involved was unusually meagre. The only grounds recited for the issuance of a search warrant were: \u201cInformation given anonymously to the Affiant that the aforementioned materials [mash, distillation apparatus and nontax-paid alcohol] are being held on said premises\u201d and \u201cThe detection of a strong odor of mash outside the premises by the Affiant.\u201d Although recognizing the holding in Ventresca\u2014a case in which the First Circuit (324 <em>F. 2d </em>864 (1963)) had been reversed\u2014the court held the affidavit invalid because it failed to allege the time when the affiant received information from the anonymous informant or the time when he detected the odor of mash outside the premises. In footnote 5 of the opinion (356 <em>F. 2d, </em>at 315) the court summarized numerous authorities\u2014all but two predated Ventresca\u2014holding that such a defect was fatal. And see Annotation, \u201cSearch warrant: sufficiency of showing as to time of occurrence of facts relied on,\u201d 100 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>525 (1965), and particularly 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">In my view the <em>Rosencranz </em>court failed to give full value to <em>Ventresca. </em>Contrast <em>Rider v. United States, </em>355 <em>F. 2d </em>192 (5 Cir. 1966), and <em>United States v. Slapo, </em>285 <em>F. Supp. </em>513 (D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1968), where, as here, the affidavits contained an allegation couched in the present tense; and compare the more common-sense, nontechnical and positive approach of our highest court in such cases as <em>State v. Zuzulock, </em>39 <em>N. J. </em>276 (1963), and <em>State v. Kasabucki, </em>above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
