J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"ATqA\">These consolidated appeals are from a judgment of the Superior Court, Law Division, upholding the validity of ordinance No. 260 of the City of Elizabeth purporting to license and regulate pool and billiard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>tables, bowling allej\u2019s, music machines (juke boxes) and other amusements and entertainment devices, and fixing the license fees to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Plaintiffs Dierickx Music, Inc. and Silco Automatic Vending Co. are New Jersey corporations engaged in the business of supplying coin-operated music machines and other amusement and entertainment devices. Both plaintiffs applied to defendant municipality for licenses under the ordinance to operate music machines. When licenses were not issued, the instant suits were filed seeking an adjudication that plaintiffs are entitled to licenses and also challenging the validity of the ordinance and particular sections thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The facts are stipulated and are set forth in detail in the trial court\u2019s opinion reported at 105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>72 (Law Div. 1969). They need not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Ordinance No. 260, which supplants an earlier licensing ordinance, provides that the license for the operation and maintenance of a music machine shall be issued in the name of the owner thereof. The ordinance appears to require two separate licenses, namely an operator\u2019s license as well as a license for each machine. Pertinent provisions of the ordinance are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">Before a license is issued for any of the coin operated devices covered by this ordinance, the applicant for such license shall first apply for and obtain an operator\u2019s license, the fee for which shall be (a) in the case of music machines, the sum of Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars per year for an operator licensing and operating more than one (1) music machine, and a fee of One Hundred ($100.00) Dollars for an operator licensing and operating only one (1) music machine <em>* </em>* *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\">A fee of $10.00 for the operation of one music machine plus a fee of $5.00 for each of such machines in excess of one in the ownership of one licensed operator * * * shall be charged to operators for the issuance of a license for each such machine or coin operated device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">The number of music machines in the City of Elizabeth and all other amusement devices in which coins are inserted, shall be limited as follows: (a) in the case of music machines, licenses shall be issued for no more than two hundred fifty (250) machines * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>The ordinance provides that before issuing a license the license inspector shall \u201cdetermine\u201d from an investigative report prepared by the chief of police as to \u201cthe character, moral turpitude and fitness of the applicant.\u201d The ordinance contains no regulatory provisions affecting music machines except to prohibit the placement, operation and use of a machine within 250 feet of a church or school.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We agree with the trial court that a municipality may regulate the placement and operation of music machines under its police power, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :48-l and 2. Indeed, it is undisputed that the operation of juke boxes is widely regulated at the municipal level. See Annotation, \u201cValidity, construction and application of statutory or municipal regulation of \u2018juke boxes\u2019 or other mechanical musical devices,\u201d 151 <em>A. L. R. </em>1178 (1944). 7 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>(3d ed. 1968, rev. vol.), \u00a7 24.215.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> We also agree that the license fees set out in the ordinance have not been shown to be unreasonable, confiscatory, or exorbitant. A municipality may derive some revenue from a licensing ordinance even though the purpose of the ordinance is to regulate under the police power. <em>Salomon v. Jersey City, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>379 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The difficulty we have with the particular ordinance is fourfold. First, the only requirement for licensing involves the investigation as to good character, moral turpitude, etc., of the owner of the machine. Since most of these machines are placed in locations on a rental or franchise basis, it would seem that the only purpose of the ordinance is to exclude suppliers having criminal backgrounds or associations. The right of the municipality to legislate in this area is questionable in the absence of some indication that the public health, welfare and morals are affected thereby. <em>Belleville Chamber of Commerce v. Belleville, </em>51 <em>N. J. </em>153, 157, 158 (1968). However, see <em>Ragan v. Seattle, </em>58 <em>Wash. </em>2d 779, 364 <em>P. </em>2d 916 (Wash. Sup. Ct. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Second, the ordinance contains no standards for the license inspector to determine what persons are eligible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>for, or disqualified from obtaining, a license. Sueti deficiency makes the ordinance violative of the Federal and State Constitutions. Hobo<em>ken v. </em>Bauer, 137 <em>N. J. L. </em>327 (Sup. Ct. 1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Third, the ordinance limits the number of licenses for music machines in the municipality to 250. There is no doubt that a municipality may, in the proper exercise of its police power and in the interest of public welfare, limit the number of licenses that may issue for certain activities, such as taverns, bars, junk yards, used car lots, etc. We recognize that some control may be exercised over the number of juke boxes permitted in a municipality in the interests of protecting the public from unnecessary and unwanted noise and commotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Howiever, without some affirmative showing that the numerical limitation set by the ordinance bears a rational relationship to those or other aspects of the public health, welfare and morals, it would appear to be arbitrary. <em>Messina v. </em>Mayor, <em>etc. of </em>Lodi, 18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>503, 510 (App. Div. 1952). It is significant that there were 272 juke boxes in Elizabeth licensed under the old ordinance, which did not limit the number of licenses to be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">' [6] Our fourth and most basic difficulty with the ordinance is that, save for prohibiting the placing of a machine within 250 feet of a church or school, it contains no provisions whatever for the regulation and control of the placement and location of the machines, method and hours of operation, type of entertainment presented, and the like. Such matters fall within the traditional municipal police power and have been generally upheld. <em>Miller v. Memphis, </em>181 <em>Tenn. </em>15, 178 <em>S. W. </em>2d 382, 151 <em>A. L. R. </em>1172 (Tenn. Sup. Ct. 1944). McQuillin, <em>supra. </em>See 1 Mmlo Model Ordinance Service (1960), c. 6, <em>\u201cAmusements and Recreaaiion.\u201d Cf Moyant v. Paramus, </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>528 (1959). However, this ordinance regulates nothing and is therefore fundamentally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>For the reasons expressed, we conclude that the ordinance as enacted is an invalid exercise of municipal power and must be declared void.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">We therefore reverse and remand for entry of judgment declaring the ordinance to be illegal. However, we direct that entry of judgment be withheld for a period of 90 days to afford the municipality the opportunity to pass a new ordinance which conforms to the views herein expressed. Ho costs on these appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
