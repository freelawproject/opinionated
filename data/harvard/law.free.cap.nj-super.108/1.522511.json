D.</author>\n<p id=\"A5\">Defendant appeals from convictions, following a jury verdict of guilty, for attempted breaking and entering with intent to steal <em>(N. J. S. A. 2A </em>:94-1, 2A:85-5), and for possession of burglary tools <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:94-3).</p>\n<p id=\"b22-13\">Defendant, a police officer, was indicted jointly with one Robert Nece on three separate indictments charging con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>spiraey to break and enter, attempted breaking and entering with intent to steal, and possession of burglary tools. The indictments were consolidated for trial and, on defendants\u2019 application, separate trials were granted. Nece was tried first and acquitted on all charges. Prior to the commencement of defendant\u2019s trial, the trial, judge dismissed the indictment for conspiracy on the ground that \u201cthere [had] been an adjudication that there was no criminal partnership.\u201d However, he denied motions to dismiss the other indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">On appeal defendant contends that (1) the acquittal of Neee, on essentially the same evidence, collaterally estopped the State from prosecuting him, and (2) the trial judge committed prejudicial error in excluding evidence of acts of misconduct by the State\u2019s primary witness, Officer Clements, as challenging his credibility, and in excluding evidence of Clements\u2019 reputation for being \u201caccusatory in nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Defendant relies on State <em>v. Cormier, 46 N. J. </em>494 (1966), in support of his argument that the State was collaterally estopped from prosecuting him. He claims that the conspiracy indictment having been dismissed, a logical extension of <em>Cormier </em>required a dismissal of the other two indictments of which he was found guilty, especially in view of Nece\u2019s acquittal on the latter indictments. The facts in <em>Cormier </em>are readily distinguishable from those in the present case. In <em>Cormier </em>the same defendant was tried twice on substantially the same factual evidence, although on different charges (conspiracy to defraud and the substantive crime of fraud). Here, however, the subsequent prosecution was against a different defendant. It is well established that a judgment of acquittal or conviction against one defendant does not operate as <em>res judicata </em>or collateral estoppel with regard to the prosecution of another defendant, even though the same transaction is involved. See Annotation, \u201cModem status of doctrine of res judicata in criminal cases,\u201d 9 <em>A. L. R.</em>3d 203, 218 (1966). The supporting rationale for this rule is plain. An acquittal of defendant X merely adjudges his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>nonparticipation in some alleged criminal conduct; it does not adjudge that no criminal act was committed or that codefendant Y was not the erring perpetrator. It simply determines that X alone was not the wrongdoer, and so the final determination as to X has no bearing on Y\u2019s alleged-guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">Defendant further argues that the dismissal of the conspiracy charge was equivalent to the prior acquittal in <em>Cormier. </em>Hot so; a pretrial dismissal, unlike an acquittal, adjudicates no issues as such. In this ease the acquittal of ETece rendered the conspiracy charge against Mondrosch nugatory, but it had no hearing on the other charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s second main point. As noted, Officer Clements was the primary prosecution witness at defendant\u2019s trial. Defendant attempted to elicit from another officer, Terinzi, several of Clements\u2019 past actions that would indicate that he had previously falsely accused certain persons of committing criminal acts. After a lengthy colloquy the trial judge disallowed this line of questioning. Defendant asserts, essentially, that the proffered evidence was both an attack on Clements\u2019 credibility and an attempt to establish a pattern of habit or custom, and so was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\"><em>Evidence Rule </em>20, dealing with evidence generally affecting credibility, permits the introduction of evidence to impeach a witness. However, this general rule is explicitly limited by <em>Evidence Rules </em>22 and 47. <em>Rule </em>22 provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b24-7\">As affecting the credibility of a witness * * *' (c) evidence of traits of his character other than honesty or veracity or their opposites, shall be inadmissible; (d) evidence of specific instances of his conduct, relevant only as tending to prove a trait of his character, shall be inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">And <em>Evidence Rule </em>47 permits proof of a trait of character \u2022\u2014\u2022 here Clements\u2019 propensity falsely to accuse others of committing criminal acts \u2014 only by \u201c(a) testimony in the form of opinion, (b) evidence of reputation, or (c) evidence of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>viction of a crime which tends to prove the trait. Specific instances of conduct not the subject of a conviction of a crime shall be inadmissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Defense counsel\u2019s attempted line of questioning clearly \u2022ran counter to the rules just cited. The trial judge quite properly ruled as inadmissible the proffered evidence of specific instances of past misconduct by Clements as affecting his <em>credibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">After the original line of impeaching questioning had been disallowed, defendant attempted to elicit, through Terinzi, Clements\u2019 \u201creputation with regard to a propensity or an inclination to be accusatory in nature against others.\u201d The trial judge sustained the prosecuting attorney\u2019s objection, finding that the testimony was not within the meaning of <em>Evidence Rule </em>47. <em>We </em>agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
