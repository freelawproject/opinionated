J. S. A. </em>2A:119-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Defendant was tried before a jury and found guilty. He prosecutes this appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">On December 1, 1967, about 4:20 p.m., defendant, a police sergeant with ten years\u2019 experience, was in charge of the desk at the East Hanover police headquarters, when his superior officer, Chief Schuler, entered the room and asked defendant to accompany him to a new building under construction, \u201cfor privacy.\u201d They went to this new building, a new police headquarters, to the chief\u2019s office there. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>they sat down, the chief said to defendant: \u201cYou were seen last night taking something from Two Guys. What did you take?\u201d \u201cTwo Guys\u201d is the popularly known name of stores operated by Vornado, Inc. Defendant worked part-time in its East Hanover store at night as a stock clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The chief\u2019s question was undoubtedly prompted by his having received a call at about 5 :30 a.m. at his home from someone connected with \u201cTwo Guys\u201d or Vornado.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">The chief testified that defendant \u201cbroke down a little bit and he told me that he took two cigarette lighters, a pack of cigars and a watch.\u201d In the chief\u2019s words, \u201cI said, \u2018What the hell did you do that for?\u2019 He didn\u2019t give me no explanation. So with that I said, \u2018We will go back to our old headquarters and I want you to go and bring back that stuff back to me right away.\u2019 \u201d The Chief testified that defendant, who was working the 4 to 12 shift on this particular day, went outside the old building, to which they had returned, got in a patrol car and went in the direction where defendant lived. He was back within approximately eight minutes and handed the chief the four items. The chief put the articles in an envelope, marked it for identification, and later turned the envelope and contents over to the prosecutor. He identified them at trial. The chief\u2019s testimony was objected to, but the objection was overruled and the four items were received in evidence, over objection. A pretrial motion to suppress this evidence had been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">In his appeal defendant advances three points for reversal, <em>viz:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">(1) A police officer is entitled to the same constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment as any other citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">(2) The statement of defendant Bode, as testified to by Chief Schuler, was inadmissible since it was involuntarily obtained under circumstances that were fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">(3) The goods introduced as evidence against defendant were inadmissible since they were the product of an illegal interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>We consider in the foregoing order of submission the validity of those contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"> It may be conceded that a police officer is entitled to the same constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment as any other citizen. For example, police officers are constitutionally entitled to protection against the use of \u201ccoerced confessions\u201d made by them. <em>Garrity v. New Jersey, </em>385 <em>U. S. </em>493, 87 <em>S. Ct. </em>616, 17 L. Ed. 2d 562 (1967). So, too, they may not be compelled to incriminate themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">At the same time, under proper circumstances, a police officer may vountarily admit his commission of a crime, as may any other citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">In this instant case there was no \u201ccoerced confession\u201d by defendant, nor was there any compulsory self-incrimination. In <em>Garrity </em>the police officers were threatened with loss of their jobs if they refused to answer the questions posed. There was a New Jersey statute, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:81\u201417.1, providing for forfeiture of office or employment, tenure and pension rights of persons refusing to testify on the ground of self-incrimination. The validity of that statute was not passed upon by our Supreme Court and was deemed unnecessary for consideration in <em>Garrity, supra, </em>385 <em>U. S. </em>at 496, 87 S. Ct. 616, citing <em>State v. Naglee, </em>44 <em>N. J. </em>209, 223 (1965). <em>Garrity </em>and <em>Naglee </em>were limited to a consideration of the voluntariness of the incriminating statements by the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Defendant argues that his admission to Chief Schuler should have been excluded because he had not been given the warnings required by <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U. S. </em>436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), before his making the incriminating statement. The State\u2019s position as to this argument is that defendant was a police officer with ten years of experience and knew the rights of persons accused of criminal acts. It reasons that it cannot be said that do<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>fendant was unaware of his rights because he recited the <em>Miranda </em>warnings as part of his police duties in taking statements from others. The State relies upon <em>Coyote v. United </em>States, 380 <em>F. </em>2d 305 (10 Cir. 1967), wherein the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">Surely Miranda is not a ritual of words to be recited by rote according to didactic niceties. Wluit Miranda does require is meaningful advice to the unlettered and unlearned in language which he can comprehend and on which he can knowingly act. [at 308]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">But <em>Coyote </em>dealt with the sufficiency of the language used in advising defendant of his rights, rather than a total absence of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, as in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The trial court determined that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not necessary in the case of defendant becanse of his long experience as a police officer and his familiarity with the duty (of the police) to give these warnings to others. However, the court in <em>Miranda </em>discussed the many psychological pressures that may affect a person in custody who is being questioned by the police, and the need of a warning to overcome those pressures. A police officer being questioned about his possible involvement in a crime might not, under that emotional stress, be as conscious of all his rights as the same police officer questioning others.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We would prefer to rest our conclusion of admissibility on the ground that defendant\u2019s statement was not made during \u201ca custodial interrogation,\u201d as required under the <em>Miranda </em>rule, thus making <em>Miranda </em>inapplicable herein. Defendant was at police headquarters because he was on duty there, and not because he was in police custody. After the episode with the chief, he resumed his work as desk sergeant until midnight, when his tour of duty ended. lie was not placed under arrest either that day or at any time thereafter. No criminal complaint was ever filed against him. He was suspended the next day pending the filing of disciplinary charges for a departmental hearing. But the charges were not filed or heard because defendant resigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>from the police department a week later. Several months thereafter he was indicted. Accordingly, whatever defendant said to the chief of police was not the product of a \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The record does not support defendant\u2019s claim that his statement was inadmissible because involuntarily obtained under circumstances that were fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">On the contrary, Chief Schuler\u2019s interrogation and conduct were more consonant with that of a protector of a fellow-officer, shielding him by talking with him \u201cin privacy,\u201d by making no arrest and keeping him on desk duty for the remainder of the tour, and by making no arrest thereafter or causing any criminal complaint to be filed. It may reasonably be assumed that \u201cwell enough\u201d would have been \u201cleft alone\u201d by the chief, but for the indictment several months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Under the totality of the circumstances, we find no sound basis for defendant\u2019s claim that his statement was \u201cinvoluntarily obtained\u201d or that the circumstances under which it was given were \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">Defendant\u2019s argument that introduction of the goods m evidence was improper, in that they were the product of an illegal interrogation, falls with our disposition of his prior two points. It is true that under <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 <em>U. S. </em>471, 83 S. Ct. 407, 9 L. Ed. 2d 441 (1963), the doctrine of excluding \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d applies to physical or verbal evidence obtained from an illegal entry or from an illegally obtained statement. But that doctrine does not apply here because the major premise upon which the conclusion depends has not been established, as noted above. Accordingly, we find no merit in this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>We note too, in passing, that there were other State\u2019s witnesses who testified to their having personally observed defendant on the night in question, from lookout posts at the store, take the two lighters, cigars and watch and put them in his pocket. Edward Kennedy, general manager, and Harry Hale, security manager, so testified. Kennedy identified the exhibits in court as the type of items he saw defendant take and put in his pocket, having observed him through a pair of field glasses. Kennedy also established in his testimony the respective values of the items. Thus, there was strong direct evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond his own inculpatory admission and delivery of the stolen merchandise to the chief of police.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
