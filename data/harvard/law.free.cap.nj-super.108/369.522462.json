J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax_\">This appeal presents a complex legal problem concerning priority of interest in respect of an aircraft as between the lien of a security agreement thereon held by defendant bank and a statutory possessory lien <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>2A:44-1 <em>et seq.; L. </em>1934, <em>c. </em>121) (hereinafter referred as an \u201caircraft mechanic\u2019s or artisan\u2019s lien\u201d) for services and materials subsequently furnished to the owner in relation to the aircraft by plaintiff, which is engaged in the business of servicing, supplying and storing aircraft. In particular, we are concerned with the effect of the recording provisions of \u00a7 503 of the Eederal Aviation Act of 1958, 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1403, as applied to the instant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Defendant bank recorded its security agreement at the office of the Eederal Aviation Agency (FAA) in Oklahoma City pursuant to the federal act; plaintiff did not record its statutory lien until after the bank purported to seize and sell the aircraft (to itself) after default on the loan by the owner. The combination of these facts was held by the Atlantic County Court to warrant entry of summary judgment in favor of the bank declaring its interest in the plane to enjoy priority over that of the aircraft mechanic and awarding the bank possession. Eeliance was had upon <em>Smith v. Eastern Airmotive Corp., </em>99 <em>N. J. Super. </em>340 (Ch. Div. 1968). We conclude this was error, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> The material facts are undisputed. On August 11, 1967 the New York law firm of Saxe, Bacon and Bol\u00e1n, owner, borrowed $32,500 from defendant bank and executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>a note and \u201csecurity agreement\u201d covering the aircraft in favor of the hank as collateral for the loan. This was recorded with the EAA on October 3, 1967. Thereafter the plane was stored and mantained at plaintiff\u2019s hangar at Bader Eield, Atlantic City. During a period of time in 1968 the owner incurred unpaid charges to plaintiff for storage, repairs, maintenance and fuel amounting to some $4,515.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The aircraft remained in plaintiff\u2019s possession. The owner having defaulted on its loan to the hank, the latter on December 9, 1968 appointed a bailiff to take possession of the plane. The bailiff on December 16, 1968 purported to take possession and posted a notice of public sale thereof on the aircraft. On December 30, 1968 the bailiff sold the plane at public sale, and the bank purchased it as the highest bidder. However, plaintiff refused to surrender possession, having physically retained possession at all times, relying upon its statutory aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien. After preliminary legal skirmishes involving a futile attempt by the bank to obtain possession by posting a bond under the New Jersey aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien law, cited above, plaintiff instituted this action to establish its prior interest in the plane. In the interim, on January 8, 1969, plaintiff filed with the EAA a \u201cNotice of Aircraft Lien\u201d on a form apparently of its own devising, the paper containing no signature or acknowledgement by the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Preliminarily, to the extent that recording <em>vel non </em>under the federal act of plaintiff\u2019s lien affects its position on the merits, we agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the recording of that interest by plaintiff, coming after sale by defendant under its security agreement, was too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>late. But, as will be seen, the absence of a valid filing was not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s lien claim is founded upon <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:44^1 <em>et seq., </em>which grants a possessory lien for sums due for the storage, maintenance, keeping or repair of aircraft or the furnishing of gasoline, accessories, materials and supplies therefor, in favor of persons engaged in the business of supplying such goods or services. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A :44-2. \u201cThe lien shall be superior to all other liens, except liens for taxes, and the operator of such aircraft shall be deemed the agent of any owner, mortgagee, conditional vendor or other lienor thereof for the creation of such superior lien.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The lien under the cited statute gains emphatic confirmation from the Uniform Commercial Code. Adopted in New Jersey in 1961, effective in 1963 <em>(L. </em>1961, c. 120) the immediately pertinent code provision <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>12A:9-310) reads :<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">When a person in the ordinary course of Ms business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a security interest, a lien upon goods in the possession of such person given by statute or rule of law for such materials or services takes priority over a perfected security interest unless the lien is statutory and the statute expressly provides otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:44-2 and the Code section quoted, taken together, a qualified aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien-holder having possession would clearly take priority over a security interest perfected under Article 9 oE the Code. See New Jersey Study Comment, Note 3, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:9-310, p. 472. In other words, apart from the effect of the Federal Aviation Act, plaintiff herein would prevail over defendant under New Jersey law. The here crucial inquiry is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>whether the recording provisions of the federal act were intended or should be construed to effect a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The present federal statute respecting recordation of titles and security interests in aircraft' stems from \u00a7 503 of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, 52 <em>Stat. </em>1006 (1938) \u2014as of then, 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 523. After first requiring the registration <em>of </em>all certificates of ownership of aircraft by the Civil Aeronautics Administration (now the Eederal Aviation Agency) it directed the agency to maintain a system for recording \u201cany conveyance which affects the title to, or any interest in, any civil aircraft of the United States.\u201d The statute was superseded in 1958 by the Eederal Aviation Act (now 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1403). Its recording provisions here material read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">(a) The Administrator shall establish and maintain a system for the recording of each and all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">(1) Any conveyance which affects the title to, or any interest in, any civil aircraft of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">* * * * * <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">(b) The Administrator shall also record under the system provided for in subsection (a) of this section any release, cancellation, discharge or satisfaction relating to any conveyance or other instrument recorded under said system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-9\">(c) No conveyance or instrument the <em>recording </em>of <em>which is provided </em>for by subsection (a) of this section shall be valid in respect of such aircraft, aircraft engine or engines, propellers, appliances, or spare parts against any person other than the person by whom the conveyance or other instrument is made or given, his heir or devisee, or any person having actual notice thereof, until such conveyance or other instrument is filed for recordation in the office of the Administrator: * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-10\">(d) Each conveyance or other instrument recorded by means of or under the system provided for in subsection (a) or (b) of this sectiozz shall from the time of its filing for recordation be valid as to all persons without further or other recordation * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Under the act the EAA maintains an office in Oklahoma City both for registration of ownership of aircraft (49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1401) and for recordation (under \u00a7 1403) of conveyances of aircraft and of security \u25a0 instruments therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">Thorough study of the matter convinces us that Congress did not intend by adoption of the cited recordation pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>cedure necessarily to displace and preempt all state law otherwise applicable bearing upon priorities of lien and title interests in aircraft. Bather it was the intent, in relation to aircraft, to substitute for the multiplicity of state registration or recording systems a single preemptive federal system for registering (1) instruments of title, comparable to state registration of titles to motor vehicles, and recording (2) security documents of the kinds commonly comprehended by state recording laws concerning written consensual security interests affecting personal property. The reason was that the ready mobility of aircraft and their common use across state lines made it cumbersome and burdensome for persons having concern with title to or incumbrances on aircraft to have to record or search in all states or localities which could arguably be claimed to constitute the proper recording situs in relation to the specific owner or incumbrancer of a particular aircraft. See Scott, \u201c'Liens in Aircraft: Priorities,\u201d 25 <em>J. Air L. &amp; Com. </em>193, 200, 203 (1958); Case Note, 48 <em>Colum. L. Rev. </em>1248 (19-18). Thus, failure to federally record a recordable instrument would entail the specific consequences declared by \u00a7 1403(c), but no other. Federal recording would validate a title or incumbrance as against any claim of invalidity based upon absence of state recording, but would not necessarily create affirmative priority as against competing rights declared by applicable state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">And so, referring to all the provisions of the federal act in entirety, including that declaring immunity to tort claims in the holder of a security interest, Professor Gilmore\u2019s authoritative text states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">The several provisions summarized above obviously amount to a good deal more than a recording system (like the patent and copyright provisions) but are still a good deal less than a comprehensive coverage of security interests in aircraft; they are much less comprehensive than the Ship Mortgage Act, which goes into great detail on the formal requisites and priorities of ship mortgages and includes sections on foreclosure and on the status of mortgages on foreign flag ships. There is of course no plenary federal power over air transportation comparable to the patent and copyright powers or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>even to the extention [sic] of the \u201cjudicial power of the United States\u201d to admiralty and maritime cases. Here Congress acts under the interstate commerce and the bankruptcy powers \u2014 which have, however, become so extensive that there is not likely to be any constitutional challenge to anything Congress has done or may do in the future. A truly comprehensive security statute for aircraft \u2014 or indeed a statute covering security interests in transportation equipment of any kind, by air, rail, road and water \u2014 would undoubtedly be within the power of Congress to enact; there is, however, little likelihood that such a federal preemption of the field will take place in the near future. [1 Gilmore, Security Interests in Personal Property, \u00a7 13.5, at 423 (1965)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">\u2022 Except for the engine and spare parts liens, \u00a7 503 is not in any sense a substantive statute. Therefore, it is believed, apart from these substantive provisions, the question of formal requisites, and the operation of the recording system, state law should apply to determine any question arising in connection with a security interest in aircraft. The argument for a federal law solution is even weaker here than under any of the other federal statutes we have so far discussed: \u00a7 503 is much less comprehensive than the Ship Mortgage Act and there is not the same federal source of power that could be alleged in favor of a federal solution in the fields of copyright, patent and admiralty law. The eases decided under \u00a7 503 all seem to assume that state law is generally applicable and that \u00a7 503 is dearly an \u201cinterstitial\u201d statute, which goes as far as it goes but no further. [Id., at 426-427]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Striking a similar note is Scott, <em>supra, </em>25 <em>J. Air L. &amp; Com., </em>at 202, wherein, after discussing the case holding the federal act constitutionally applicable to aircraft used solely in intrastate commerce,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the writer says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\"><em>Meaning of Section 508 </em>[now \u00a7 1403], Accepting the constitutional validity of the section, we are then faced with the more important question \u2014 what priority in right is obtained by a security holder through federal recordation? Clearly it is not axiomatic that recordation assures priority as to subsequent lienors, and the statutory language cannot be construed in such a way as to leave the matter free from doubt. The statute merely provides that conveyances or other instruments filed for recordation\u201d shall be valid as to all per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>sons * * It does not speak in positive terms of priority, as does for instance <em>the </em>Ship Mortgage Act of 1920 discussed above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Most of the decisions having to do with the federal act have been careful to delineate its recording provisions as preemptive and exclusive only in respect of place and requirements of recording and the effect of failure to record a federally recordable conveyance or instrument as to subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchasers or lienors without notice. <em>Aircraft Investment Corp. v. Pezzani &amp; Reid Equipment Co., </em>205 <em>F. Supp. </em>80, 82 (E. D. Mich. 1962) ; <em>American Aviation v. Aviation Insurance Managers, Inc., </em>244 <em>Ark. </em>829, 427 <em>S. </em>W. 2d 544, 547 (Sup. Ct. 1968); <em>Blalock v. Brown, </em>78 <em>Ga. App. </em>537, 51 <em>S. E. </em>2d 610, 9 A. L.

Southern Flight Service, Inc., </em>227 <em>F. Supp. </em>411, 415 (M. D. M. C. 1961); <em>cf. Lochhead v. G. A. C. Finance Corp. of Camelback, </em>6 <em>Ariz. App. </em>539, 434 <em>P. </em>2d 655 (Ct. App. 1968); <em>Curtis v. Carey, </em>393 <em>S. W. </em>2d 185, 189 (Tex. Ct. Civ. App. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The decision by our Chancery Division in <em>Smith v. Eastern Airmotive Corp., supra </em>(on which the trial court relied in the instant ease), defeating a subsequent Mew Jersey aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien as against a prior federally recorded security agreement solely because of the absence of federal recordation of the former (99 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at 353-354), was based on a line of authority following <em>In re </em>Veterans\u2019 <em>Air Express Co., supra </em>(n. 3). There, after a sound holding that the federal act applies to planes used in intrastate as well as interstate flight, the court held a government-owned and federally recorded chattel mortgage to take priority over a subsequent possessory lien of a repairman under a California statute. The opinion did not mention, nor did the result depend upon whether the latter lien was federally recorded, and its rationale is beclouded by allusions to priority of government-owned liens. However, the actual holding on the facts seems partly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>to depend on an apparent assumption that the federal act is preemptive not alone as to recording requirements but sweepingly as to all substantive title and lien questions pertaining to aircraft. 76 <em>F. Supp., </em>at 688. This approach was pointedly rejected in <em>Aircraft Investment Corp. v. Pezzani &amp; Reid Equipment Co., supra, </em>where Chief Judge Levin said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-4\">Plaintiff suggests that Congress has preempted the entire field of conveyancing of interests in aircraft. This view is erroneous, notwithstanding <em>In re Veterans\u2019 Air Express Company, </em>76 <em>F. Supp. </em>684 (D. N. J. 1948), which contains dicta on which plaintiff relies. Congress has said only that until an instrument purporting to convey an interest in an aircraft is recorded, in accordance with the Act, it is void as to third parties without notice. Upon federal recordation, it is valid without further recording. [205 <em>F. Supp., </em>at 82].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The court went on to indicate that the holder of a prior federally recorded chattel mortgage on an aircraft might not be prior in lien to the interest of a purchaser from the chattel mortgagor if certain principles of state law precluding that result were found applicable on the facts when the case should be tried. Expressly citing and following the statement in <em>Pezzani &amp; Reid, supra, </em>as to the limited degree of preemption of the federal act, the court in <em>American Aviation v. Aviation Insurance Managers, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">It has previously been pointed out that Congress has preempted the field as far as recordation and registration of aircraft is concerned, but we do not mean to say that Congress has preempted the entire field relating to conveyances of aircraft, for it has been held otherwise * * *, [427 S. W. 2d, at 547; citing <em>Pezzani </em>&amp; <em>Reid, supra].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">See also, <em>State Securities Company v. Aviation Enterprises, Inc., supra </em>(355 <em>F. </em>2d, at 229), emphasizing that the federal act is preemptive only as a recording system and not as to \u201cquestions of the validity of * * * title documents, actual notice, good faith purchaser status and the like\u201d which must be resolved under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>Squarely assailing both the rationale and holding in <em>Veterans\u2019 Air Express, supra, </em>insofar as it subordinated the subsequent artisan\u2019s possessory lien to the federally recorded chattel mortgage held by the government, Scott, <em>supra, 25 J. Air L. &amp; Com., </em>at 203, writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\">While the court is undoubtedly correct that Congress may establish the priority of its liens with respect to liens asserted by private individuals under state statutes or by virtue of common law, one may seriously question whether it intended to do so in this instance. The purpose of the statute was reportedly to eliminate confusion engendered by a multitude of state recording systems by providing a single basis for constructive notice, not to establish the priority of a recorded security interest over all subsequent claims. The only situation in which priority appears to be determined by operation of the statute is where the security holder has failed to record his interest. Such failure invalidates the conveyance as to innocent third persons. <em>But recordation itself merely validates; it does not grant priority. </em>Certainly there is much respectable authority in this country preferring the lien of the artisan to that of the antecedent holder of a recorded security, either on a theory of implied consent or agency. There is no indication that Congress intended to overrule such authority by passing section 508. [emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">There is cogent evidence supporting the view that statutory or common-law possessory liens arising <em>in invitum </em>as a matter of law from the doing of work or furnishing of materials, unaccompanied by the execution by the obligor of any document or instrument, were not intended by the draftsmen of the federal recording act to be affected by it in any way: (1) the statutory language describing the recordable interests; (2) the treatment of the federal act by the drafters of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">1. We note, preliminarily, that determination of this particular case requires no definitive holding as to whether a New Jersey aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien is recordable under 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1403(a). As will be further developed <em>infra, </em>plaintiff\u2019s failure to record in this case, assuming the lien was recordable, should not prejudice it <em>vis-a-vis </em>defendant since the requirement of recording is to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>notice for the benefit of those who subsequently contemplate taking an interest in the aircraft, and defendant\u2019s interest here was taken prior to plaintiff\u2019s. However, the statutory description of recordable rights makes it rather dubious that the drafters actually contemplated recordation of such a lien. The operative subparagraph (1) under paragraph (a) of \u00a7 1403, in specifying what should be recorded, speaks of \u201cany <em>conveyance </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis ours). Paragraph (b) provides for the recordation of releases, discharges, etc. \u201crelating to any <em>conveyance or other instrument </em>recorded under said system.\u201d (Emphasis ours). Thereafter, uniformly in the remainder of \u00a7 1403 after paragraph (b) the references are to \u201cconveyance(s) and (or) other instrument (s)\u201d. \u00a7 1403(a)(2) calls for the recordation of \u201cany lease, and any mortgage, equipment trust, contract of conditional sale, or other instrument executed for security purposes\u201d covering specifically identified aircraft engines, propellers or other parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u201cConveyance\u201d is defined in 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1301 as \u201ca bill of sale, contract of conditional sale, mortgage, assignment of mortgage, or other <em>instrument </em>affecting title to or interest in, property.\u201d (Emphasis ours) See <em>Marrs v. Barhem, </em>336 <em>Mass. </em>416, 146 <em>N. E. </em>2d 353 (Sup. Jud. Ct. 1957), holding that an attachment of a plane is not a recordable \u201cconveyance or other instrument\u201d affecting title to or interest in an aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Paragraph (g) authorizes administrative regulations to provide for the endorsement upon certificates of registration or aircraft certificates of information in various specified categories. If the paragraph authorizes regulations further particularizing the kinds of recordable instruments, as to which the language is at best ambiguous, there is no such regulation clearly encompassing a lien like plaintiff\u2019s. The regulations now in effect (quoted in <em>Smith v. Eastern Airmotive Corp., supra </em>(99 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at 352)) expand the statutory definition of recordable conveyances quoted above to include \u201clease, equipment trust, notice of tax lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>or of other lien * * The latter phraseology would seem to contemplate a notice or other written document or instrument at least of a kind regularly employed in the creation or enforcement of a lien, <em>e. g., </em>a tax title certificate. It is, of course, elementary that an administrative regulation must be within the fair contemplation of the delegation of the enabling statute. The statute is confined to \u201cconveyances\u201d and \u201cinstruments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">That the act contemplates a written instrument executed by the obligor or grantor is further evident from the fact that former section 503 (now \u00a7 1403(e)) required acknowledgement of the instrument as a prerequisite for recording. While the act was amended in 1966 to eliminate the necessity of acknowledgement except as the Administrator might by regulation prescribe, the fact that acknowledgeable instruments were the only type of security or title instrument contemplated for recordation is evidenced not only by the history of the act but also by the present amendatory regulation (\u00a7 49.13(c)) which, while eliminating the need for acknowledgement, nevertheless states: \u201cThe law of the place of delivery of the conveyance determines when a conveyance or other instrument must be acknowledged in order to be valid for the purposes of that place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">It hardly needs iteration that the New Jersey aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien is not evidenced by any instrument executed by the obligor, thus not one susceptible of acknowledgement by an obligor. There is no requirement in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:44-1 <em>et, seq. </em>under which anyone, lienor or lienee, need sign any paper for the rise or enforcement of the lien (beyond the posting of a notice of sale by the lienor in connection with satisfaction of the lien by sale).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number><em>2. </em>We have observed above that the UCC confirms the paramountey of plaintiff\u2019s lien, considered solely as a matter of New Jersey law. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A:9-310. However, the Code also provides in <em>N. J. S. A. 12\u00c1 </em>:9-104 that <em>Article </em>9 does not apply, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cto a security interest subject to any statute of the United States such as the Ship Mortgage Act, 1920, to the extent that such statute governs the rights of parties to and third parties affected by transactions in particular types of property; * *</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">The here pertinent question generated by the foregoing is whether the Code draftsmen contemplated the then Civil Aeronautics Act (in respect of its recordation provisions) as a \u201cstatute of the United States\u201d necessarily governing the rights of contesting lienholders of an aircraft, much less those of a mortgagee as against a subsequent mechanic\u2019s lienor in an aircraft, for purposes of section 9-104. The Official Code Comment <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>12A:9-104, at 339) answers that question in the negative. It states that while proposed legislation then pending in Congress covering all aircraft financing would, if enacted, displace <em>Article </em>9 in that field, the existing provisions of the Civil Aeronautics Act do not necessarily do so. Such legislation was never enacted. The supersession of the recording provisions of the Civil Aeronautics Act by those of the Eederal Aviation Act in 1958 involved no changes in substance. See 1 <em>Gilmore, op. cit. </em>\u00a7 13.5, at p. 422, n. 1. Thus, the draftsmen of the Code join with Gilmore, Scott and Judge Levin in regarding the federal aircraft recording act as something less than a comprehensive preemptive statute controlling sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>stantive priority rights in aircraft to the exclusion of state law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Proceeding from the foregoing background, we examine the other cases considering the priority status of mechanic\u2019s or artisan\u2019s liens on aircraft. A Wisconsin court held, prior to <em>Veterans\u2019 Air Express, supra, </em>that a prior federally filed chattel mortgage did not constitute notice to a repairman and thus was subordinated to his lien. <em>Anderson v. Triair Associates, Inc., </em>1949 <em>U. S. Av. R. </em>440 (Wise. C. C. 1947) (not officially reported). While the technical holding was that federal \u201crecording,\u201d as distinguished from \u201cfiling,\u201d took place after commencement of the repairs, and thus did not under the federal act as then constituted confer priority on the mortgagee (at 445), the court thought it inequitable \u201cupon principle\u201d to hold repairmen subject to constructive notice of a distant recording not called for by any state statute when such repairs preserve the value of the property for the benefit of all in interest and are often made under emergency conditions (at 446, 448).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In <em>United States v. United Aircraft Corporation, </em>80 <em>F. Supp. </em>52 (D. Conn. 19481, the court held that a federally recorded chattel mortgage did not take precedence over a subsequent artificer\u2019s lien on engines of the aircraft overhauled by it, but only because the recordation did not identify the engines with sufficient particularity. Although the implication is that had there been sufficient specificity in description the mortgagee would have prevailed, the court left open the question as to whether the artisan should have prevailed in any case on the ground that it might have been \u201cthe intent of the contracting parties to the mortgage that an artisan\u2019s lien should have priority * <em>* </em>*\u201d (80 <em>F. Supp., </em>at 55). See the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>comment on this case in Scott, <em>supra, </em>25 <em>J. Air L. &amp; Com., </em>at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">It is noteworthy that the opinion in the <em>United Aircraft </em>ease does not indicate that the artisan recorded its lien with the CAA; yet the court did not undertake to invalidate the lien on that ground, as did the court in the Chancery Division decision of <em>Smith, supra, </em>and the trial court in the present case. Thus, <em>United Aircraft </em>could be argued as authority to the effect that failure of an artificer to record a lien federally (assuming it to be so recordable) does not <em>per se </em>void the lien as to the entirety of competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In <em>Crescent City Aviation, Inc. v. Beverly Bank, </em>139 Ind. App. 669, 219 <em>N. E. </em>2d 446 (Ind. App. Ct. 1966), the attempted statutory foreclosure of a mechanic\u2019s lien for work and material in repairing an airplane was defeated as against a previously recorded conditional sale contract. Purporting to rely on <em>Veterans\u2019 Air Express, supra, </em>the court asserted that the federal act intended to preserve state \u201cremedies\u201d but only for \u201cthose who give notice by filing with the Administrator\u201d (219 N. E. 2d, at 449). It will be recalled that <em>Veterans\u2019 Air Express </em>was not decided on the basis of failure of the (subsequent) artisan to file under the federal act. The <em>Crescent City </em>decision obviously cannot be supported on the \u201cnotice\u201d rationale since, as in the instant case, the mechanic\u2019s work and lien came <em>after </em>the creation of the competing interest \u2014 there, the conditional sale contract. We are not, moreover, apprised whether Indiana law gave priority to the mechanic\u2019s lien. Finally, the case is distinguishable in that enforcement of the mechanic\u2019s lien involved a foreclosure proceeding and the local filing of an <em>instrument </em>(notice of lien), a factor noted above to be absent as to the statutory lien in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">In <em>Continental Radio Co. v. Continental Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>369 <em>S. W. </em>2d 359 (Tex Civ. App. 1963), a prior-in-time constitutional artisan\u2019s lien was held subordinate to the chattel mortgage of the defendant bank on the aircraft because the bank took its interest without notice of the lien and there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>no constructive notice of the artisan\u2019s lien since it was not federally recorded. Although a letter and supporting documents claiming the artisan\u2019s lien were dispatched to the EAA for filing, the court without explanation says: \u201cNone of these instruments complied with the [federal] statutory requirements for filing\u201d (at 362). While the opinion abounds in <em>dicta </em>reiterating the discredited theory of total substantive federal preemption bottomed on <em>Veterans\u2019 Air Express </em>(see <em>supra), </em>the express <em>ratio decidendi </em>of the case is that the Texas constitutional artisan\u2019s lien \u201ccan only be enforced in equity and no enforcement will lie as against an innocent purchaser,\u201d such as the court regarded the mortgagee in that ease to be. (at 362). Thus, the case is not authority for such a situation, as here, where the aircraft mechanic\u2019s possessory lien is under state law automatically paramount without any recording against any other security interest, past or future.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Finally, defendant cites as a purported artisan-lien precedent the case of <em>International Atlas Services, Inc. v. Twentieth Century Aircraft Co., </em>251 Cal. App. 2d 434, 59 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>495 (D. Ct. App. 1967), <em>cert. </em>den. 389 <em>U. S. </em>1038, 88 S. Ct. 775, 19 L. Ed. 2d 827 (1968). At the outset, this ease is not actually one involving the priority of an artisan\u2019s lien, as such, although the plaintiff was a maintenance aircraft contractor. The interest asserted by it in that case was one of <em>title </em>to engines of its own which it had temporarily bailed t\u00a9 the owner of the aircraft by way of maintenance replacement for worn-out engines it had removed for overhaul. The contest was with the prior-in-time conditional vendor of the new aircraft as an entirety, which had federally recorded its interest. The contract of conditional sale required the buyer to replace wornout parts, engines, etc., only with other parts, engines, etc. owned by the buyer free and clear of any encumbrances. 49 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1403(a)(2), as noted above, provides for the recordation of any \u00a1\u00edlease\u201d etc. of any \u201cspecifically identified aircraft engine,\u201d with the same consequences for failure to record as noted above in case of fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>ure to record a recordable \u201cconveyance.\u201d The court held that \u25a0while, as a matter of California law, the plaintiff would have prevailed in its claim to the engines as against the mortgagee, it forfeited its right \u201cunder federal law\u201d because of its failure to record federally what the court held constituted its \u201cleases\u201d of the engines to the owner. The opinion embraced completely and uncritically the \u201ctotal federal preemption\u201d theory stemming from <em>Veterans\u2019 Express Qo. </em>and rejected by the leading commentators and by the draftsmen of the UCC, as observed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">. \u25a0 It is notable, moreover, that the plaintiff\u2019s interest was \u2022represented by an instrument clearly recordable under the federal act. However, the decision does not lend support to any view that priority in federal recording assures priority as to all subsequent interests regardless of state law, since the engine owner would have been accorded priority had it recorded. What is unjustifiable about the decision, however, is its holding of forfeiture of the owner\u2019s title interest because of absence of recording in a situation where the prevailing prior-in-time conditional vendor obviously did not take its security interest in reliance upon the absence from record of the then nonexistent leases of the engines. The result can be justified, if at all, only on the theory that subsequent checking of the record by the conditional vendor and prompt filing by the \u201clessor\u201d could have apprised the former .earlier of the breach of the retention-of-title-to-engines provisions of the contract, mentioned above, and enabled earlier remedial action by the vendor against the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u25a0 On the other hand, we find decisions holding <em>section </em>1403 .not effective to produce what the court deems a result contra-indicated by local law and policy. The most common .example of this is the case of a retail buyer of an aircraft from a dealer in such products where the dealer has previously incumbered the plane with a recorded lien. Whether the buyer fails to record his purchase at all, or buys and records after the recording of the earlier security interest, .the, buyer consistently prevails against the lienor. <em>Texas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>National Bank of Houston v. Aufderheide, </em>235 <em>F. Supp. </em>599 (E. D. Ark. 1964) ; <em>Northern Ill. Corp. v. Bishop Distributing Co., </em>284 <em>F. Supp. </em>121 (W. D. Mich. 1968); <em>Suburban Trust &amp; Savings Bank v. Campbell, </em>19 <em>Ohio Misc. </em>74, 250 <em>N. E. </em>2d 118 (C. P. 1969); <em>cf. Lochhead v. G. A. C. Finance Corp. of Camelback, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">In the <em>Aufderheide </em>case the federal court, while recognizing the right of Congress \u201cto legislate in the field of registration of aircraft and to provide for the recordation of liens upon or conveyances of such craft * * *\u201d (235 <em>F. Supp., </em>at 603), nevertheless held that \u00a7 1403 had not supplanted the general rule of mortgage law that when a mortgagee consents to the sale of a mortgaged chattel free of lien by the mortgagor, the purchaser takes free of the lien. The court found implied consent on the facts of the case\u2014. that the mortgagee bank knew the mortgagor was a dealer in aircraft and that the prior course of dealing between the parties signalled an implied consent by the lienholder to sale to customers of the obligor free of the lien.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The rationale of <em>Northern Ill. Corp., supra., </em>was basically that of <em>Aufderheide, supra, </em>while the other cases cited are influenced by other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">This line of cases is a practical exemplification by federal as well as other courts of the limited effect accorded \u00a7 1403 where its literal application would frustrate important state policy embodied in local law.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">We return to the specific questions here posed for decision. They are:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">(1) Assuming plaintiff\u2019s lien was a federally recordable one (as to which we have above expressed strong doubt), did the failure so to record it invalidate it as against defendant\u2019s security interest?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>(2) If question (1) is answered in the negative, does defendant\u2019s interest nevertheless prevail over plaintiff\u2019s lien, by virtue of \u00a7 1403, because of its antecedence in creation and the fact of its recordation?</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">1. We have intimated our view as to this question above in discussion of <em>Crescent City Aviation, Inc. v. Beverly Bank </em>and <em>International Atlas Services Inc. v. Twentieth Century Aircraft Co., </em>both <em>supra, </em>but explain it more fully here. Everything written about \u00a7 1403, whatever the disagreement on other aspects of its interpretation, is concordant in the view that it is essentially a constructive notice device, designed to supplant diverse state recording statutes similarly functioning as means of constructively imputing notice to those subsequently dealing with or in relation to the aircraft. As pithily put in <em>Marsden v. Southern Flight Service, Inc., supra, </em>\u201cThe purpose of the recording provisions of the act is to protect persons who have dealt on the faith of recorded title or [sic] aircraft and as to whom it would be a fraud to give effect to unrecorded titles to their detriment.\u201d (227 <em>F. Supp., </em>at 415). The legislative history supports this conclusion. Hearings before Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on <em>H. R. </em>9738, <em>75th Cong., 3rd Sess., </em>at 405\u2014406 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In the instant case, recording plaintiff\u2019s lien would have obviously afforded no constructive notice to defendant, which had taken its interest previously, could thus not by search of the record before its investment have found plaintiff\u2019s lien, even if ultimately recorded, and presumably relied only on the absence from record of any earlier titles or liens. Therefore, to destroy plaintiff\u2019s Hew Jersey statutory lien, reinforced by the weight of Code provision <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A :9-310, <em>as against this defendant, </em>would senselessly subvert Hew Jersey law without the justification of service of the rationale of the federal act. Such a result could be arrived at only by a blindly literal reading of \u00a7 1403 (c), and ignoring its intent and purpose. This we will not do. <em>Alexander v. New Jersey Power &amp; Light Co., </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>373, 378-379 (1956). The case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>would, of course, be different had defendant\u2019s interest <em>followed </em>the creation of the nonrecorded plaintiff\u2019s lien (still assuming recordability of the latter). <em>Blalock v. Brown, Marsden v. Southern Flight Service, Inc., </em>and <em>United States v. United Aircraft, </em>all <em>supra, </em>and <em>Pope v. National Aero Finance Co., </em>236 <em>Cal. App. </em>2d 722, 46 <em>Cal Rptr. </em>233 (D. Ct. App. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The holding of the County Court, insofar as based on absence of recording of plaintiff\u2019s lien, is erroneous, and the decision in <em>Smith v. Eastern Airmotive Corp., supra, </em>to the same effect is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">2. The answer to this question depends on how one reads the statutory language (\u00a7 1403(d)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Each conveyance or other instrument recorded * * * under the system provided for in * * * this section shall from the time of its filing for recordation be valid as to all persons without further or other recordation, * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Those of the authorities which have deliberately considered the meaning of this clause have, as fully developed above, concluded that it means no more than what it expressly says: in effect, that recording under the federal act is all the recording necessary to prevent relative <em>invalidity vis-a-vis </em>other interests. The section does not say that such recording <em>per se </em>grants priority as against any other interest. Eor example, it obviously would not ordinarily grant priority against an earlier, federally-recorded interest. Its priority, ordinarily, against later interests, recorded or unrecorded, is consistent with state law which, absent the federal requirement, would generally accord priority to the earlier of two recorded interests (where recording is required by state law). To restate the teaching of Gilmore,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">* * \u00ae apart from [certain substantive provisions not here relevant], the question of formal requisites, and the operation of the recording system [under \u00a7 1403], state law should apply to determine any question arising in connection with a security interest in aircraft. [1 Gilmore, op. cit., at 426].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Accordingly, as applied to the instant facts, the recording of defendant\u2019s lien does not <em>per se </em>confer priority in interest as against that of plaintiff. The inquiry is remitted to state substantive law, and the latter gives priority to plaintiff\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">To recapitulate: we hold that (1) plaintiff\u2019s failure to record its lien (assuming federal recordability) does not invalidate it as against defendant; (2) federal recording of defendant\u2019s lien did not accord it priority over plaintiff\u2019s, and (3) the relative priorities of the parties must be determined in accordance with state law, which, on the present facts, accords priority to plaintiff\u2019s aircraft mechanic\u2019s possessory lien to the extent noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">In a supplemental post-argument brief defendant for the first time argues that if federal law does not here control on priority, the law of New York rather than that of New Jersey applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The note and security agreement were mailed for signature from the bank\u2019s office in Secaucus, New Jersey, to the owners in New York City and signed there by them. The copy of the security agreement furnished us is blank as to place of execution by the bank, but it was inferably signed by the bank officers at Secaucus. The security agreement recites that the plane is to be kept at Bader Field in Atlantic County, New Jersey, and plaintiff\u2019s goods and services were supplied there. Not only was New York law not pleaded or established below, see <em>Evidence Buie </em>9(2) (a), (3); <em>cf. Graulich Caterer, Inc. v. Hans Holterbosch, Inc., </em>101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>61, 67 (App. Div. 1968), and thus not a factor considered in the trial court\u2019s decision, but the present supplemental brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>contains no expository argument either supporting the thesis of applicability of New York law in these circumstances or indicating what such law is,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> if materially contrary in effect to New Jersey law. At trial level, in the original briefs and at the oral argument the issue was debated solely in terms of construction of the federal and New Jersey statutes. In all these circumstances, we ignore the belated argument and assume the applicability of New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b394-5\"> Plaintiff also claims $4,076.44 for \u201cpilot service\u201d and $1,530 for \u201ctrade\u201d (unexplained). The trial court held these items were not lienable under the New Jersey statute cited above. We agree as to the first. The \u201ctrade\u201d item will have to be explained and readjudicated <em>on </em>the remand. If it consists, as defendant asserts, of trade balance of rentals as between this plane and others furnished the owner by plaintiff, it is not lienable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b395-9\"> See also <em>N.

Repair and maintenance obligations are ordinarily incurred over a period of time, but the New Jersey lien is only for such as have actually been incurred at any given time. Would a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>federal filing, if required at all, made by the mechanic when the work began, protect him against intervening liens as to work done later? Would he have to make repeated filings as the work proceeded? Consider that \u201cnotice filing,\u201d as distinguished from \u201ctransaction filing,\u201d was hardly known in 193S when the federal act was first enacted (see Official Code Comment, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>12A :9-402, at 522-523). Of course, as seen, neither notice filing nor transaction filing has ever had any relevancy to the statutory aircraft mechanic\u2019s lien as a matter of New Jersey law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> The foregoing observation is not affected by the circumstance that <em>N.
