Braunstein, deceased.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b594-4\">[Argued February 7th, 1934.</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AL_\">Decided April 12th, 1934.]</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-8\">On appeal from a decree of the New Jersey prerogative court advised by Vice-Ordinary Sooy, who filed the following opinion:</p>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-9\">\u201cThis is an appeal from an order of the orphans court of Atlantic count}', which order purports to have been made under the authority of section 22 of the Orphans Court act. <em>3 Comp. Stat. p. 3819 </em>\u00a7 22.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-10\">\u201cThere are six grounds for reversal. The first attacks the constitutionality of the Orphans Court act, and is without merit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-11\">\u201cThe second ground is: \u2018The statute invoked does not empower the orphans court to make the order made.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-12\">\u201cInasmuch as the act distinctly empowers either the ordinary, \u2018or the judge of the orphans court in the county where such paper is probated,\u2019 to make the order therein provided for, there is no merit to this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-13\">\u201cThe third ground is: \u2018The petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of the statute.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-14\">\u201cThe petitioner in this case is the next friend of a grandchild of the deceased and the statute provides that the petition may be filed by \u2018any child or children of the deceased, or by any child or children of any deceased child or children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>of the deceased (and if any such child or children be within the age of twenty-one years, then by the next friend of such child or children).\u2019 The minor child being the child of a deceased son of the decedent, is clearly entitled to have the petition filed in its behalf, as is done in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-4\">\u201cThe next ground for reversal is: \u2018The amount allowed by the order is unreasonable and excessive.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-5\">\u201cThere is nothing before me to substantiate this reasoning, and unless I am to assume the amount granted by the orphans court to be unreasonable, the order must stand. There is no justification for any such assumption on my part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-6\">\u201cThe next ground for reversal is: \u2018The petition is defective in not stating with particularity the facts which justify the issuance of the order.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-7\">\u201cThere is no merit in this contention, because the petition clearly states the facts upon which the order is based, which facts, as stated by the petition, justified the order made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-8\">\u201cThe last reason advanced for reversal is: \u2018The evidence adduced did not warrant the making of the order.\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"b595-9\">\u201cI find that it did.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-10\"><em>Messrs.
