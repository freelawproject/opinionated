For the following reasons, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-17\">The complaining witness, Monique S. Patterson, alleged that appellant made verbal threats and pushed and shoved her on August 2, 1995 at appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>residence in Middletown. Appellant was subsequently arrested, charged, and convicted as stated above. Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">\u201cThe trial court erred when it found defendant/appellant guilty of the crime of domestic violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Appellant argues that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction for domestic violence where the state failed to prove that Patterson is a family or household member as defined by statute. Appellant\u2019s argument is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Middletown Codified Ordinances 636.17(a) states in part that \u201cno person shall knowingly cause or attempt to cause physical harm to a family or household member.\u201d \u201cFamily or household member\u201d is defined as a person who resides or has resided with the offender and who is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\">\u201c1. A spouse, a person living as a spouse, or a former spouse of the offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\">\u201c2. A parent or a child of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to the offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">\u201c3. A parent or a child of a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender, or another person related by consanguinity or affinity to a spouse, person living as a spouse, or former spouse of the offender.\u201d Middletown Codified Ordinances 636.17(a)(4)(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">Patterson testified at the hearing in this case that she has dated appellant for the past four years. The record indicates that appellant and Patterson currently maintain separate residences, and there is no evidence that the two ever cohabited. Patterson testified that she and appellant do not have any children together. There is no evidence that appellant and Patterson are related either by consanguinity or affinity. In sum, the state failed to prove a material element of the offense contained in the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">Appellant\u2019s assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the Middletown Municipal Court is vacated, and pursuant to App.R. 12(B), appellant is ordered discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b561-14\">Walsh, P.J., and William W. Young, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
