The issue presented for summary judgment is the interpretation of R.C. 4111.03(A) and its application to the facts of this case. The parties agree that there are no disputed material facts before the court although the defendants have reserved certain defenses in the event that the court interprets the statute in favor of the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the only issue presented by these motions is the proper application of the Ohio statute.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">Defendant Beverly Enterprises, doing business in Ohio as Community Nursing Home, is a wholly owned subsidiary of defendant Beverly Enterprises, Inc., a Delaware corporation. Beverly Enterprises, Inc., operates a variety of nursing homes and health care institutions throughout the United States. The plaintiffs in this action are several current or former employees of Community Nursing Home.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The plaintiffs have leveled three allegations against the defendants: (1) that defendants have failed to pay the plaintiffs overtime in accordance with R.C. 4111.03(A), (2) that defendants have failed to maintain accurate records of hours worked by their employees as required by R.C. 4111.08, and (3) that defendants have failed to pay the aforementioned overtime wages for more than thirty days after they came due in violation of R.C. 4113.15(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Civ.R. 56 provides that summary judgment shall by granted if the pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact, if any, show (1) that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact; (2) that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, which is entitled to have the evidence construed most strongly in its favor. <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co., Inc. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Upon the filing of a motion for summary judgment the court must review the facts in evidence, and if those facts which are material to the outcome of the case are not disputed and demonstrate that the movant is entitled to a judgment in its favor as a matter of law, then summary judgment will be granted. In addition to the motions for summary judgment, the court has reviewed all of the statutes in question, the legislative history of the 1987 amendments to R.C. 4111.03, and a poster promulgated by the Ohio Department of Industrial Relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-11\">The question presented for summary judgment is whether defendants\u2019 method of computing overtime hours comports with the Ohio overtime wage law, R.C. 4111.03, which is loosely based upon the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (\u201cFLSA\u201d), Title 29, U.S.Code, Section 207 <em>et seq. </em>Section 207(a)(1) establishes the standard method of computing overtime, commonly known as the \u201cOver 40\u201d method. This method requires the employer to pay overtime wages <em>(i.e., </em>time- and-a-half) to any employee who works more than forty hours in one week. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Section 207(j) allows certain employers, including health care facilities such as Community Nursing Home, to use what is known as the \u201c8/80\u201d method. Under this approach, the employer pays overtime wages to an employee for every hour worked in excess of eight hours per day, or for every hour worked in excess of eighty hours in two weeks. From the outset, it must be understood that on the face of the statutes, neither method is necessarily more or less generous. Whether a computation will allow more overtime pay depends upon the specific hours worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The plaintiffs assert that the Ohio overtime law does not permit any employers to utilize the 8/80 method, which is the method utilized by Community Nursing Home. Defendants assert that the Ohio statute does incorporate the 8/80 method. R.C. 4111.03(A) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">\u201cAn employer shall pay an employee for overtime at a wage rate of one and one-half times the employee\u2019s wage rate for hours worked in excess of forty hours in one work week, in the manner and methods provided in and subject to the exemptions of section 13 of the \u2018Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,\u2019 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C. 207, 213, as amended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Section 213, referred to in the Ohio statute simply as \u201csection 13,\u201d provides several exemptions to the Over 40 scheme which do not apply to the parties in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">R.C. 1.42 dictates that statutes \u201cshall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d In <em>State v. Cravens </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 69, 536 N.E.2d 686, the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County summarized the law of statutory interpretation in Ohio. That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-9\">\u201cThe interpretation of a statute is the determination of what the statute means. The interpretation starts and ends with the words chosen by the legislature, but is not limited to the words alone, because the whole context of the enactment must be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">\u201cThe process of interpretation requires (1) a decision about the purpose to be attributed to the statute and (2) a decision about the meaning of the legislature\u2019s words that will carry out that purpose. The words have a double function: They serve as guides to discovery of the purpose, and they serve as limitations on the extent of the statute\u2019s applications. The words must be taken in the usual, normal or customary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 536 N.E.2d at 689.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-11\">-In the instant case, the plaintiffs read the Ohio statute to mandate the Over 40 rule subject only to the exemptions of Section 213, which are inapplicable to Community Nursing Home. The defendants assert that the clause \u201cin the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>manner and methods provided in\u201d incorporates Section 207(j), which permits the 8/80 method, and that the Ohio statute\u2019s general citation to Section 207 supports this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Contrary to the assertions of both parties, the meaning of the statute is ambiguous; only upon close inspection does its mandate seem clear. On its face, the statute appears to require employers to apply the Over 40 computation, subject only to the limitations set forth in Section 13 of the FLSA. When the statute is read in conjunction with Section 13, however, an ambiguity arises as to the proper interpretation of two clauses, \u201cin the manner and methods provided in\u201d and \u201csubject to the exemptions of.\u201d Clearly, \u201csubject to the exemptions of\u2019 modifies \u201csection 13.\u201d It is less clear what the \u201cmanner and methods\u201d clause is intended to modify. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 1376, defines \u201cmanner\u201d as \u201cthe mode or method in which something is done or happens: a mode of procedure or way of acting.\u201d It defines \u201cmethod\u201d as \u201ca procedure or process for attaining an object; * * * a way, technique, or process of or for doing something.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1422-1423. All of the provisions in Section 13 of the FLSA are most accurately categorized as \u201cexemptions,\u201d which Webster\u2019s defines as \u201cfreedom from any charge or obligation to which others are subject.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 795. Section 13 of the FLSA does not contain any provision that could properly be categorized as a \u201cmanner\u201d or \u201cmethod.\u201d Furthermore, if the \u201cmanner and methods\u201d clause is interpreted to modify \u201csection 13,\u201d then the \u201csubject to the exemptions\u201d clause becomes redundant. Therefore, the \u201cmanner and methods\u201d clause would seem to modify something other than \u201csection 13.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The only alternative construction is that \u201cin the manner and methods provided in\u201d modifies the clause \u201cof the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\u201d This interpretation essentially amounts to reading the statute as if it contains commas that it currently does not. Specifically, this interpretation approaches the statute as if it read, \u201cin the manner and methods provided in, and subject to the exemptions of Section 13 of, the \u2018Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\u2019 \u201d This alternative interpretation abuses a grammatical rule, but it makes the statute more sensible when read contextually. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that R.C. 4111.03(A) cites Section 207, Title 29, U.S.Code. That section does contain manners and methods of computation, including the 8/80 method. A conflict arises, then, between what would appear to be the plain meaning of the statutory language and this alternative construction which attempts to give a logical meaning to the statute when read contextually.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">When a statute is ambiguous, as is the present case, Ohio courts may rely upon the canons of construction which are codified in R.C. 1.49. This statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\u201cIf a statute is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention of the legislature, may consider among other matters:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">\u201c(A) The object sought to be attained;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">\u201c(B) The circumstances under which the statute was enacted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">\u201c(C) The legislative history;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">\u201c(D) The common law or former statutory provisions, including laws upon the same or similar subjects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-9\">\u201c(E) The consequences of a particular construction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">\u201c(F) The administrative construction of a statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">Many of these factors offer guidance as to the proper interpretation of R.C. 4111.03(A), but this list does not purport to be exhaustive, nor is any factor given particular weight over any other. Because relevant portions of the statute in question have been amended, it is important to consider the goal and purpose of those amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">Prior to its amendment in 1987, R.C. 4111.03(A) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">\u201cAn employer shall pay an employee for overtime at a wage rate of one and one-half times the employee\u2019s wage rate for hours worked in excess of forty hours in one work week, in the manner and methods provided in and subject to the exemptions of section 7 and section 13 of the \u2018Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,\u2019 52 Stat. 1060, 29 U.S.C.A. 207, 213, as amended.\u201d See 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3672, 3964.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">Plaintiffs argue that by deleting \u201csection 7\u201d from the statute, the legislature intended\u2019 to eliminate from Ohio law all of the provisions contained within that section, including the provision allowing computation under the 8/80 method. Defendants argue instead that the deletion of \u201csection 7\u201d was intended to accomplish a much narrower function, and that the legislature intended the 8/80 method to remain intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">The plaintiffs\u2019 position carries with it the weight of the presumption that the legislature was aware of and intended to accomplish the consequences of the amendment. A facial comparison of the old statute with its revised counterpart seems to suggest that whereas Section 7 provisions were once incorporated into the statute, they are now excluded. This was the same conclusion reached by Judge Ann Aldrich of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio in an unreported decision, <em>Howell v. Jones, </em>case No. 4:92 CV 1825. In her decision, Judge Aldrich states that the meaning of R.C. 4111.03(A) can be determined by its plain terms, but she supports her interpretation primarily by reference to the 1987 amendment. After careful consideration, this court respectfully declines to adopt Judge Aldrich\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"An8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>The strongest evidence that the legislature did not intend to prohibit the Section 7 provisions is the fact that nowhere in the extensive legislative history of the amendment is the elimination of the 8/80 method, or of any other of the Section 7 provisions, contemplated or debated. The preamble to the text of Am.Sub. H.B. No. 178 states that the purposes of the amendments were \u201cto establish new benefits for certain state employees exempted from the Collective Bargaining Law, to make other changes in the Civil Service Law, to exclude members of certain boards from the Public Employees Retirement System, to remove the mandatory retirement age for members of the Public Employees Retirement System, and to declare an emergency.\u201d See 142 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2564.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Neither the statements of the bill\u2019s sponsor, nor the testimony of witnesses appearing in support of the bill, nor the comments to proposed legislation as compiled by the Legislative Service Commission, reveal any intent to prohibit the 8/80 method. In fact, these statements indicate that the purpose of the bill was to bring Ohio law into compliance with the FLSA as it pertains to compensatory time off for overtime hours worked by public employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Furthermore, the fact remains that the legislative history is devoid of any reference to the 8/80 method or the possibility of its abolition. The provisions of Section 7 apply in various forms to individual contractors, piece rate employees, retail and service establishment employees, health care providers, fire protection and law enforcement employees, domestic employees, tobacco industry employees, and transportation system employees. If R.C. 4111.08(A) were interpreted so as to preclude the Section 7 provisions, all Ohio employers in these industries which currently rely on federally authorized methods of overtime computation other than the Over 40 method would have to restructure their overtime payment programs, and might be liable for back pay. These employers might also be guilty of misdemeanors for these wage violations under R.C. 4111.99(A). R.C. 1.47(C), which codifies the presumption that statutory enactments are intended to accomplish just and reasonable results, proscribes such an interpretation of R.C. 4111.03(A). It strains the limits of credulity to think that the Ohio legislature intended to accomplish such dramatic results, to diverge so drastically from the federal design, without a modicum of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">It is impossible to determine exactly why the legislature deleted \u201csection 7\u201d from R.C. 4111.03(A). It is notable, though, that Section 207 of the FSLA does contain provisions which address compensatory time off for overtime hours worked by public employees. It is quite possible that the legislature deleted \u201csection 7\u201d in order to eliminate confusion as regards the amendments it was then making to Ohio\u2019s compensatory time-off laws. Additionally, the 1987 bill included several amendments that were obviously designed to effect nonsubstantive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>changes. Section 124.81(D) of Am.Sub. H.B. No. 178, for example, amended the clause \u201cNothing in this section shall affect\u201d to read \u201cThis section does not affect.\u201d Thus it is possible that the amendment to R.C. 4111.08(A) was not intended to make a substantive change to Ohio overtime wage law.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Also worthy of consideration is a poster published by the Ohio Department of Industrial Relations (\u201cODIR\u201d). This poster, which ODIR requires employers to hang in a conspicuous place, specifically states that health care providers are entitled to rely upon the 8/80 method. The poster\u2019s statements are not dispositive. Ohio case law offers no guidance as to whether such a poster qualifies as \u201can administrative construction of the statute,\u201d as contemplated by R.C. 1.49. Nor, as Judge Aldrich observed, does the poster reveal the basis for ODIR\u2019s determination that the 8/80 method is permitted. Nevertheless, the poster does indicate that the Ohio agency most significantly involved in the application of Ohio overtime law does not believe that the 8/80 method has been revoked. As a reflection of ODIR\u2019s position regarding Ohio law, the poster merits consideration. It supports this court\u2019s holding that the 1987 amendments to R.C. 4111.03(A) were not intended to prohibit the use of the 8/80 method in this' state.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Finally, the defendants have argued, and the plaintiffs have denied, that in R.C. 4111.03 is interpreted to prohibit the 8/80 method, then it is preempted by the FLSA. Because the court holds that the Ohio overtime statute does not prohibit the 8/80 method, it does not decide the issue of preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">In light of all of the evidence in the record, as construed in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\n<em>So ordered. </em>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
