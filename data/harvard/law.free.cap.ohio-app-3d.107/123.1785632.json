Young, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">Clark County Coroner Dirk G. Wood appeals from the trial court\u2019s declaratory judgment ordering him to amend Joy Sue Severt\u2019s death certificate to show her cause of death as \u201cundetermined\u201d rather than \u201csuicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Wood advances two assignments of error. First, he contends the trial court erred in not finding R.C. 313.19 void for vagueness. Second, he asserts the trial court erred in applying a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard when reviewing his opinion concerning Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death. He also argues that even under the preponderance standard, the trial court should have sustained his medical opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Wood\u2019s appeal stems from Joy Severt\u2019s death by a gunshot wound in the early morning hours of February 5, 1993. Shortly before her death, Joy Severt, who was home alone, telephoned her daughter, Tammy Severt, and stated that someone outside Joy Severt\u2019s home was banging on the windows. Tammy Severt arrived at her mother\u2019s residence approximately five minutes later and, finding neither her mother nor an intruder, called 911 from inside her mother\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Shortly thereafter, law enforcement officials arrived at Joy Severt\u2019s home and discovered her lying face down in the back yard with an apparent bullet hole in her chest. Officers also discovered a .45 caliber revolver lying beneath her body. A subsequent autopsy confirmed a close range gunshot wound to Joy Severt\u2019s chest. Toxicology reports also signaled the presence of the drug benzodiapines in Joy Severt\u2019s system.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Based upon his own investigation, the investigation of the Clark County Sheriffs Department, the autopsy report, and the toxicology results, Wood certified Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death as \u201csuicide\u201d on February 8, 1993. Approximately six weeks later, Edmund Severt initiated the present action as executor of Joy Severt\u2019s estate. Pursuant to R.C. 313.19, he sought an order from the common pleas court directing Wood to change Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death from \u201csuicide\u201d to \u201cundetermined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Wood filed a motion to dismiss Edmund Severt\u2019s complaint on April 16, 1993, arguing that R.C. 313.19 is unconstitutional. The trial court subsequently overruled this motion and issued a decision ordering Wood to amend Joy Severt\u2019s death certificate to list her cause of death as \u201cundetermined.\u201d Wood subsequently filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">In his first assignment of error, Wood contends the trial court erred when it overruled his motion to dismiss Edmund Severt\u2019s complaint brought pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to R.C. 313.19. Specifically, Wood claims that R.C. 313.19, which permits a court of common pleas to direct a coroner to change his decision regarding a decedent\u2019s cause of death, is constitutionally void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">We begin our analysis with a review of R.C. 313.19, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">\u201cThe cause of death and manner and mode in which the death occurred, as delivered by the coroner and incorporated in the coroner\u2019s verdict and in the death certificate filed with the division of vital statistics, shall be the legally accepted manner and mode in which such death occurred, and the legally accepted cause of death, unless the court of common pleas of the county in which the death occurred, after a hearing, directs the coroner to change his decision as to such cause and manner and mode of death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In <em>Vargo v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 27, 516 N.E.2d 226, the Ohio Supreme Court construed R.C. 313.19 and ruled that a coroner\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018is entitled to much weight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30, 516 N.E.2d at 229 (quoting <em>State v. Manago </em>[1974], 38 Ohio St.2d 223, 227, 67 O.O.2d 291, 293, 313 N.E.2d 10, 13). The court then held that \u201cthe coroner\u2019s factual determinations concerning the manner, mode and cause of the decedent\u2019s death, as expressed in the coroner\u2019s report and death certificate, create a non-binding, rebuttable presumption concerning such facts in the absence of competent, credible evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Vargo </em>at 30, 516 N.E.2d at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The <em>Vargo </em>court also explained in dicta that pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2721, commonly known as the Declaratory Judgments Act, a court of common pleas has jurisdiction to resolve factual questions arising in an R.C. 313.19 action. <em>Id. </em>at 29-30, 516 N.E.2d at 229, fn. 3. The Ohio Supreme Court reaffirmed its <em>Vargo </em>dicta six years later in <em>Perez v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 397, 613 N.E.2d 199, when it again interpreted R.C. 313.19 and concluded that a declaratory judgment action is the proper means for a plaintiff to challenge a coroner\u2019s findings. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 613 N.E.2d at 200-201. Finally, last year in <em>State ex rel. Blair v. Balraj </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 310, 631 N.E.2d 1044, the court cited its earlier <em>Vargo </em>and <em>Perez </em>decisions and noted that \u201can action for declaratory judgment in the court of common pleas [was] the way to implement R.C. 313.19\u2019s hearing provisions in a case where plaintiff sought to have the coroner\u2019s verdict changed from \u2018homicide\u2019 to \u2018natural causes.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 314, 631 N.E.2d at 1048.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Wood stresses, however, that three Ohio appellate decisions have declared R.C. 313.19 void for vagueness, and he challenges the provision\u2019s constitutional validity. The Ohio Supreme Court acknowledged these appellate decisions in <em>Perez </em>but declined to address R.C. 313.19\u2019s constitutionality because the issue was not properly before the court. <em>Perez, supra, </em>66 Ohio St.3d at 398, 613 N.E.2d at 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In support of his argument that R.C. 313.19 is constitutionally infirm, Wood cites <em>State ex rel. Dana v. Gerber </em>(1946), 79 Ohio App. 1, 34 O.O. 48, 70 N.E.2d 111, <em>Roark v. Lyle </em>(App.1953), 52 O.O. 168, 121 N.E.2d 837, and <em>Goldsby v. Gerber </em>(1987), 31 Ohio App.3d 268, 31 OBR 553, 511 N.E.2d 417. In <em>Dana, </em>the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals articulated the crux of Wood\u2019s argument, holding that G.C. 2855-16 (now R.C. 313.19) \u201cattempts to vest the Court of Common Pleas with jurisdiction to review the findings of the coroner but does not provide the method or means by which such jurisdiction shall be invoked or exercised, and does not provide some mode or method which will guarantee the parties their constitutional rights to have their day in court and is inoperative and void for uncertainty and indefiniteness.\u201d <em>Dana, supra, </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Hamilton County Court of Appeals adopted Dana\u2019s reasoning and conclusions in a one-sentence <em>per curiam </em>opinion in 1952. <em>Roark, supra, 52 </em>O.O. at 168, 121 N.E.2d at 837. Similarly, in <em>Goldsby </em>the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals cited approvingly to its earlier <em>Dana </em>ruling and noted: \u201cThis court long ago held that the judicial review provision in R.C. 313.19 is constitutionally void for vagueness. The purported judicial review language fails to define the method or means by which the court\u2019s jurisdiction can be invoked or exercised. Nothing explains who can initiate review, when it can be initiated, how it can be initiated, or what standard the court uses for that review.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Goldsby, supra, </em>31 Ohio App.3d at 270, 31 OBR at 555, 511 N.E.2d at 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Wood urges this court to adopt the reasoning first articulated in <em>Dana </em>and later followed in <em>Roark </em>and <em>Goldsby. </em>However, we respectfully disagree with the contention that R.C. 313.19 is unconstitutionally void for vagueness. In so doing, we rely upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s repeated pronouncements, discussed <em>supra, </em>that an action for a declaratory judgment in the court of common pleas is the <em>proper </em>means to implement R.C. 313.19 and challenge a coroner\u2019s findings. Although the court has not definitively addressed whether R.C. 313.19 is void for vagueness, its ruling that a declaratory judgment action is the proper vehicle to challenge a coroner\u2019s conclusions resolves much of R.C. 313.19\u2019s ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">We recognize, as Wood stresses, that R.C. 313.19 does not delineate the method or means by which the common pleas court\u2019s jurisdiction can be invoked. Nor does the statute explain who can initiate review, when it can be initiated, or what standard the court should apply when conducting that review. However, we believe the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Vargo, Perez, </em>and <em>Blair </em>decisions provide significant guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">As noted above, the Ohio Supreme Court identified an action for declaratory judgment as the proper means of invoking R.C. 313.19\u2019s hearing provision. See <em>Vargo, supra, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 29-30, 516 N.E.2d at 229, fn. 3 (noting that under R.C. Chapter 2721, the Declaratory Judgments Act, the common pleas court \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>jurisdiction to both hear and determine the type of factual questions raised in an R. C. 313.19 action.\u201d); <em>Blair, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 314, 631 N.E.2d at 1047-1048 (identifying a declaratory judgment as the proper method to challenge a coroner\u2019s findings pursuant to R.C. 313.19). Consequently, we cannot agree that the statute is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to identify the method or means by which the common pleas court\u2019s jurisdiction can be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Similarly, we reject Wood\u2019s assertion that R.C. 313.19 is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to identify who may initiate a review of the coroner\u2019s conclusions. Having determined that a declaratory judgment action is the proper mechanism to invoke R.C. 313.19, Ohio case law defines who may initiate such a review. In <em>Schaefer v. First Natl. Bank </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 511, 13 O.O. 129, 18 N.E.2d 263, the Ohio Supreme Court declared that a plaintiff must present a \u201creal and substantial controversy\u201d to be afforded relief through the special remedy of a declaratory judgment. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, resolution of that controversy must confer certain rights or status upon the litigants. <em>Corron v. Corron </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 75, 79, 531 N.E.2d 708, 712, citing <em>Radaszewski v. Keating </em>(1943), 141 Ohio St. 489, 26 O.O. 75, 49 N.E.2d 167. Finally, a court may not issue a declaratory judgment constituting merely an advisory opinion \u201c \u2018upon a hypothetical state of facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bilyeu v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St.2d 35, 36, 65 O.O.2d 179, 179-180, 303 N.E.2d 871, 873, quoting <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Haworth </em>(1937), 300 U.S. 227, 241, 57 S. Ct. 461, 464, 81 L.Ed. 617, 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">We believe these guidelines adequately identify who may initiate a declaratory judgment action. In the context of R.C. 313.19, a plaintiff must demonstrate an interest in a real and substantial controversy concerning the coroner\u2019s findings. In the present case, the trial court apparently determined that Edmund Severt, as husband of the decedent and executor of her estate, had a sufficient interest in Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death to maintain a declaratory judgment action. In any event, we need not review the sufficiency of Edmund Severt\u2019s interest since it has not been challenged on appeal. Wood asserts only that R.C. 313.19 is void for vagueness because it fails to identify who may initiate an R.C. 313.19 challenge. For the foregoing reasons, however, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Likewise, we reject Wood\u2019s assertion that R.C. 313.19 is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to identify what standard the common pleas court should use when reviewing a coroner\u2019s decision. In so doing, we rely in part upon R.C. 2721.10, which provides that when a declaratory judgment action involves an issue of fact, \u201csuch issue may be tried and determined in the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in which the proceeding is pending.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Thus, the same general rules applicable to other legal proceedings also apply to declaratory judgment actions. As with other civil actions, the plaintiff in a declaratory judgment suit must prove each allegation in his complaint by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Coventry Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Augustine </em>(June 19, 1985), Summit App. No. 11906, unreported, 1985 WL 10753 (citing <em>Berlin v. Kilpatrick </em>[C.P.1958], 15 O.O.2d 73, 172 N.E.2d 339).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In the present case, Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death was a question of fact for the trial court to resolve. As noted earlier, a coroner\u2019s findings create \u201ca nonbinding, rebuttable presumption concerning such facts in the absence of competent, credible evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Vargo, supra, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 30, 516 N.E.2d at 229. Consequently, Edmund Severt bore the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of competent, credible evidence to the contrary, that the coroner\u2019s opinion was inaccurate. Having reached this conclusion, we cannot agree with Wood\u2019s claim that R.C. 313.19 is unconstitutional because it fails to articulate what standard the trial court should apply when reviewing the coroner\u2019s factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We also reject Wood\u2019s claim that R.C. 313.19 is void for vagueness because it fails to identify when a review of the coroner\u2019s findings may occur. Wood is correct in his assertion that R.C. 313.19 does not define precisely when a challenge to a coroner\u2019s ruling may be raised. However, we do not find such imprecision constitutionally fatal in the present case. Wood certified Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death as suicide on February 8, 1993. On March 23, 1993, Edmund Severt initiated the present action on behalf of Joy Severt\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Obviously, a declaratory action challenging a coroner\u2019s ruling cannot be initiated until the coroner completes his investigation and certifies the cause of death. Edmund Severt filed his complaint approximately six weeks after the coroner reached his decision. By so doing, we believe Edmund Severt acted in a reasonable and timely fashion, and we are unprepared to declare R.C. 313.19 void for vagueness because it fails to articulate an outer time limit for plaintiffs\u2019 challenges. It is well settled that all legislation enjoys a presumption of constitutionality. <em>Sedar v. Knowlton Constr. Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 193, 199, 551 N.E.2d 938, 944 (citing <em>Hardy v. VerMeulen </em>[1987], 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 48, 512 N.E.2d 626, 629-630; <em>State v. Dorso </em>[1983], 4 Ohio St.3d 60, 61, 4 OBR 150, 150-151, 446 N.E.2d 449, 450-451; <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>[1955], 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59). Moreover, when a party raises a constitutional challenge to a statute, \u201c \u2018courts must apply all presumptions and pertinent rules of construction so as to uphold, if at all possible,\u2019 \u201d the legislation\u2019s validity. <em>Sedar, supra, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 199, 551 N.E.2d at 944 (quoting <em>Dorso, supra, </em>4 Ohio St.3d at 61, 4 OBR at 151, 446 N.E.2d at 450).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In light of this judicial deference to acts of the legislature, we decline to find R.C. 313.19 unconstitutional because it fails to articulate some statute of limitations for actions challenging a coroner\u2019s findings. Based upon the facts before us, we believe Edmund Severt clearly initiated his challenge within a reasonable time. Accordingly, we conclude that R.C. 313.19 is not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional simply because it fails to identify when a plaintiff may contest the coroner\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Finally, Wood contends R.C. 313.19 is unconstitutional because it vests the coroner with power to make a judicial determination binding upon all persons, even those not involved with the coroner\u2019s investigation. However, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected this argument in <em>Vargo, </em>noting that it never has interpreted R.C. 313.19 as \u201cconclusively setting forth the manner, mode and cause of death.\u201d <em>Vargo, supra, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 30, 516 N.E.2d at 229. Rather, the court held, \u201cthe coroner\u2019s factual determinations concerning the manner, mode and cause of the decedent\u2019s death, as expressed in the coroner\u2019s report and death certificate, create a <em>non-binding, rebuttable presumption </em>concerning such facts in the absence of competent, credible evidence to the contrary.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>As a result, \u201cneither the coroner\u2019s report nor the death certificate is conclusive concerning the manner, mode or cause of death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31, 516 N.E.2d at 230. See, also, <em>Blair, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.3d at 314, 631 N.E.2d at 1048 (\u201c \u2018R.C. 313.19 does not deprive a civil litigant of due process of law. The statute does not compel the fact-finder to accept, as a matter of law, the coroner\u2019s factual findings concerning the manner, mode and cause of decedent\u2019s death.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Nor does R.C. 313.19 represent an attempt by the legislature to vest the coroner with the power to make <em>ex parte </em>judicial decisions. Rather, \u201cR.C. 313.19 merely recognizes the quasijudicial character of the coroner\u2019s statutorily mandated duty to ascertain, in certain cases, a person\u2019s cause of death.\u201d <em>Vargo, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 30, 516 N.E.2d at 229. Consequently, we reject Wood\u2019s argument and overrule his first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In his second assignment of error, Wood asserts that the trial court erred by not requiring Edmund Severt to show that the coroner abused his discretion when he declared Joy Severt\u2019s death a suicide. Specifically, Wood urges this court to treat declaratory judgment actions under R.C. 313.19 as analogous to appeals from administrative orders pursuant to R.C. Chapter 2506.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">In support of his argument, Wood relies upon <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 12 O.O.3d 198, 389 N.E.2d 1113. At issue in <em>Dudukovich </em>was whether the housing authority acted improperly in firing Marie Dudukovich. The housing authority justified its decision by citing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>variety of alleged deficiencies related to Dudukovich\u2019s job performance. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 12 O.O.3d at 198-199, 389 N.E.2d at 1114. Dudukovich appealed the agency\u2019s decision to the common pleas court, which reversed the board\u2019s ruling and ordered Dudukovich reinstated. <em>Id. </em>at 203, 12 O.O.3d at 199-200, 389 N.E.2d at 1114-1115. The court of appeals subsequently affirmed, and the agency appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Although the Ohio Supreme Court ultimately affirmed the lower court rulings, Wood stresses the <em>Dudukovich </em>court\u2019s declaration that a trial court may not \u201cblatantly substitute its judgment for that of the agency, especially in areas of administrative expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 12 O.O.3d at 202, 389 N.E.2d at 1117. While this statement indicates some deference for agency findings, it does not direct the trial court to adopt an \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard when reviewing an agency\u2019s ruling. Indeed, in the sentence preceding that cited by Wood, the <em>Dudukovich </em>court concluded: \u201cThus, it is quite evident that the Court of Common Pleas must weigh the evidence in the record, and whatever additional evidence may be admitted * * *, to determine whether there exists <em>a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence to support the agency decision.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the court noted that \u201cthe key term is \u2018preponderance.\u2019 If a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence exists, the Court of Common Pleas must affirm the agency decision; if it does not exist, the court may reverse, vacate, modify or remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>See, also, <em>Sterling Drug, Inc. v. Wickham </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 16, 24, 17 O.O.3d 10, 15, 406 N.E.2d 1363, 1369 (affording agency rulings a presumption of correctness and placing upon the plaintiff the burden of rebutting this presumption with a preponderance of substantial, probative, and reliable evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">In light of this language, we fail to find Wood\u2019s argument compelling. <em>Dudukovich </em>does little, if anything, to support his claim that a plaintiff in an R.C. 313.19 action must show that the coroner\u2019s ruling constitutes an abuse of discretion. Rather, the opinion tends to support this court\u2019s position, discussed more fully in Wood\u2019s first assignment of error, that a plaintiff must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the coroner\u2019s ruling is inaccurate. Consequently, we reject Wood\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">Nevertheless, Wood contends that even under a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, the trial court erred in rejecting the coroner\u2019s findings. However, based upon our review of the record, we cannot agree that the trial court erred when it directed the coroner to change Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death from \u201csuicide\u201d to \u201cundetermined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The record contains sufficient probative evidence for the trial court to have found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>unknown. Although a coroner\u2019s findings are entitled to \u201cmuch weight,\u201d <em>Vargo, supra, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 30, 516 N.E.2d at 229-230, Edmund Severt presented competent, credible evidence supporting his argument that Joy Severt\u2019s death was not self-inflicted. While Wood also presented significant evidence tending to show that Joy Severt\u2019s death was a suicide, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion when it found Joy Severt\u2019s cause of death to be uncertain. The phrase \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d refers to something more than an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482-483, 450 N.E.2d 1140, 1141-1142. \u201c[I]t implies that the court\u2019s attitude is unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we noted recently in <em>McLin v. Leigh </em>(1991), 74 Ohio App.3d 127, 598 N.E.2d 731, a reviewing court may not find an abuse of discretion and reverse a judgment supported by some competent, credible evidence. Having determined that Edmund Severt presented such evidence, we overrule Wood\u2019s second assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b176-6\">Wolff and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
