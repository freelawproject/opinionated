DAHP contends that the trial court erred in concluding that R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, was not pre-empted by the passage of federal Public Laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>102-276 and 103-66. Furthermore, DAHP contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it concluded that DAHP had failed to prove that compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirement would jeopardize DAHP\u2019s economic viability and found that DAHP was not entitled to a waiver from the open enrollment requirement pursuant to R.C. 1742.12(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">We do not find merit in either of DAHP\u2019s contentions. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, is not pre-empted by federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66, although we reach our conclusion upon different grounds. Moreover, careful review of the record reveals that DAHP did not raise the issue in the trial court concerning its alleged entitlement to exemption from the open enrollment requirement pursuant to R.C. 1742.12(D). Therefore, we need not address this issue, which is raised for the first time on appeal. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">This case involves an action for declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction brought by plaintiff-appellant Dayton Area Health Plan and its affiliate, Health Plan Network (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cDAHP\u201d), against defendant-appellee Ohio Department of Insurance (\u201cODI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">ODI is the state department responsible for enforcing the laws governing health maintenance organizations (\u201cHMOs\u201d) within the state of Ohio, specifically the laws set forth in R.C. Chapter 1742. DAHP is an Ohio not-for-profit corporation and an HMO organized in 1985 in response to increasing difficulty delivering affordable health care to Montgomery County\u2019s Medicaid and general assistance population. As of July 1, 1994, DAHP had 26,673 members, all of whom were Medicaid or general assistance recipients. DAHP is one of very few health insurance networks in the country organized to provide health care solely to the Medicaid/general assistance population with no commercial, private-paying enrollees.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">As an HMO for Medicaid recipients, DAHP is financed through both state and federal funding. According to federal Medicaid regulations, the federal government will match state expenditures for Medicaid recipients if the organization complies with the requirements set forth in the federal Social Security Act. Section 1396 <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code. One particular prerequisite, known as the \u201c75/25 rule,\u201d requires that in order for a HMO to be eligible to receive federal Medicaid matching funds for its Medicaid enrollees, the HMO must consist of at least twenty-five percent non-Medicaid, commercial enrollees. Section 1396b(m)(2)(A)(ii), Title 42, U.S.Code. The purpose behind the 75/25 requirement mix is to ensure the quality of care provided to Medicaid recipients. Congress theorized that if one out of every four enrollees in a given HMO were not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Medicare recipient, it would be unlikely that the effect of the federal largesse would be to create a two-tiered system, with HMOs providing services to Medicare recipients providing substantially less service than other HMOs providing services to the general population. If a Medicare-eligible HMO were able to attract non-Medicare recipients to fill at least twenty-five percent of its membership, it would presumably be offering services comparable to those of other HMOs not catering to Medicare recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Because DAHP was organized for the sole purpose of organizing a health care network for Montgomery County\u2019s Medicaid and general assistance population, DAHP sought and obtained a one-time, three-year administrative waiver of the federal 75/25 membership requirement from the Federal Health Care Financing Administration. When the federal administrative waiver expired on April 30, 1992, DAHP sought and received a waiver of the 75/25 membership requirement through the passage of Public Law 102-276 by the United States Congress, which granted DAHP a waiver until January 31, 1994. DAHP\u2019s congressional waiver was extended again until December 31,1995, by Public Law 103-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">To become licensed to operate in the state of Ohio, all HMOs must comply with the regulatory laws set forth in R.C. Chapter 1742. One licensing regulation, set forth in R.C. 1742.12, requires that all HMOs that have been in business for twenty-four months and that meet certain financial requirements must hold an advertised, thirty-day open enrollment period at least once during every calendar year. During open enrollment, the HMO is required to accept all commercial, non-group applicants in the order of their application, up to one percent of the HMO\u2019s total enrollees. During the open enrollment period, notwithstanding certain limited exceptions set forth in the statute, the HMO cannot deny a commercial, non-group applicant enrollment based on the applicant\u2019s health status. An HMO is excused from the open enrollment requirement only if it can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of' Insurance that open enrollment would jeopardize the organization\u2019s economic viability. R.C. 1742.12(D). If the organization successfully establishes that compliance with the requirements of open enrollment will jeopardize its economic viability, the Superintendent of Insurance may waive the requirement or make other concessions aimed at preserving the organization\u2019s economic viability.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">It is generally accepted that the purpose behind Ohio\u2019s mandatory open enrollment period is to provide a health insurance option for individuals who might otherwise be unable to obtain health insurance due to pre-existing medical conditions. Additionally, by requiring all HMOs to hold open enrollment, the burden of covering high-demand illnesses, such as AIDS, cancer, and high-risk pregnancies, is shared by all of the licensed HMO\u2019s in the local health care community.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>In October 1992, ODI notified DAHP of its obligation to hold open enrollment pursuant to R.C. 1742.12. In response to the notification, DAHP requested that ODI waive the open enrollment requirement for DAHP because it was not administratively prepared to hold open enrollment. ODI denied the request for the waiver, but granted DAHP a seven-month extension to comply with the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">During the seven-month extension period, although DAHP filed proposed rates and public notices in preparation for open enrollment, DAHP also sought a legislative exemption from open enrollment from the Ohio General Assembly. Although the statutory exemption passed both houses of the General Assembly, Governor Voinovich vetoed it; the veto was not overridden. DAHP then requested ODI to limit its open enrollment requirement to twenty-five enrollees. When that request was denied, DAHP again requested an exemption from open enrollment. ODI denied the request on the basis that DAHP had failed to establish that holding open enrollment would jeopardize the organization\u2019s economic viability.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In July and August 1993, after DAHP still had not complied with the open enrollment requirement, ODI threatened to take administrative action in the form of fines or suspension or revocation of DAHP\u2019s license if DAHP did not immediately comply with the open enrollment requirements set forth in R.C. 1742.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">On September 23, 1993, DAHP filed the present action with the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas seeking (1) a judicial declaration that the open enrollment requirements set forth in R.C. 1742.12 as applied to DAHP were preempted by federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66, and (2) a permanent injunction enjoining ODI from requiring DAHP to comply with open enrollment requirements until December 31, 1995, the time when the federal waiver of the 75/25 enrollment requirement was due to expire.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">After a trial to the bench, the trial court denied DAHP\u2019s requests for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in a decision journalized on September 1,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">From this judgment, DAHP appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">DAHP\u2019s first assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of DAHP in its determination that O.R.C. \u00a7 1742.12 as applied to DAHP was not pre-empted by federal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The Supremacy Clause (Clause 2, Article VI) of the United States Constitution provides that laws of the United States \u201cshall be the supreme Law of the land * * *.\u201d Pursuant to this provision, the United States Congress possesses the power to pre-empt state law. See, generally, <em>Fid. Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. de la Cuesta </em>(1982), 458 U.S. 141, 102 S.Ct. 3014, 73 L.Ed.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u201cThe question of whether a certain state action is pre-empted by federal law is one of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Gade v. Natl. Solid Wastes Mgt. Assn. </em>(1992) , 505 U.S. 88, 112 S.Ct. 2374, 120 L.Ed.2d 73, citing <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 202, 208, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 1909-1910, 85 L.Ed.2d 206, 213. \u201c \u2018To discern Congress\u2019 intent we examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Gade, </em>citing <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon </em>(1990), 498 U.S. 133, 138, 111 S.Ct. 478, 482, 112 L.Ed.2d 474, 483. Because pre-emption law generally cautions courts to be reluctant to infer preemption, courts should start with the presumption that federal legislation was not intended to displace state laws. <em>Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council of the Metro. Dist. v. Associated Bldrs. &amp; Contractors of Massachusetts/Rhode Island, Inc. </em>(1993) , 507 U.S. 218, 113 S.Ct. 1190, 122 L.Ed.2d 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Pre-emption generally arises in three different situations. First, express pre-emption occurs when Congress\u2019s intent to pre-empt state law is expressly stated in the statute\u2019s language. <em>Jones v. Rath Packing Co. </em>(1977), 430 U.S. 519, 525, 97 S.Ct. 1305, 1309-1310, 51 L.Ed.2d 604, 613, 614. In the absence of express pre-emption language, field pre-emption occurs \u201cwhere the scheme of federal regulations is \u201c\u2018so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for the States to supplement\u201d \u2019 \u201d the regulations. <em>Gade, </em>505 U.S. at 98, 112 S.Ct. at 2383, 120 L.Ed.2d at 84, citing <em>Fid. Federal S. &amp; L., </em>458 U.S. at 152-153, 102 S.Ct. at 3022, 73 L.Ed.2d at 674-675. Finally, conflict pre-emption occurs where state law directly conflicts with federal law. <em>Gade.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">A conflict between state and federal law can occur where \u201ccompliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u201d <em>Gade, </em>citing <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 132, 142, 83 S.Ct. 1210, 1217, 10 L.Ed.2d 248, 256-257 or \u201cwhere State law \u2018stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gade, </em>citing <em>Hines v. Davidowitz </em>(1941), 312 U.S. 52, 67, 61 S.Ct. 399, 404, 85 L.Ed. 581, 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">DAHP does not contend that express or field pre-emption has occurred in this case, but raises the issue only of whether implied conflict pre-emption applies. DAHP argues that implied conflict pre-emption applies in the present case because its compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment regulation would defeat the purposes and objectives behind Congress\u2019s enactment of Public Laws 102-276 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>and 103-66. According to DAHP, the purpose behind the congressional waiver of the federal 75/25 enrollment requirements was to \u201cprevent the disruption of [DAHP]\u201d by permitting it to operate as a Medicaid-only HMO with no commercial enrollment. DAHP asserts that by granting DAHP a waiver from the federal 75/25 requirement mix, Congress granted DAHP a federally conferred right to operate as a one hundred percent Medicaid HMO. Therefore, DAHP asserts that compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requir\u00e9ment, which would require DAHP to accept some commercial enrollees, would conflict with its federally conferred right to operate as a Medicaid-only HMO. Moreover, DAHP argues that compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirements would detrimentally affect its financial viability and would, therefore, stand as an obstacle to meeting the congressional objective of \u201cpreventing the disruption of DAHP.\u201d Therefore, according to the alleged conflict between R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, and federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66, DAHP contends that the state law must yield to the federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The trial court agreed with DAHP\u2019s interpretation of the purpose behind the congressional waiver as being \u201cthe preservation of DAHP.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court concluded that the pivotal issue in determining whether the state law was pre-empted by the federal law was whether DAHP\u2019s participation in the open enrollment period would compromise DAHP\u2019s financial viability, thereby creating an obstacle to achieving the federal purpose of \u201cpreserving DAHP.\u201d After hearing testimony regarding the effect that open enrollment might have on DAHP\u2019s economic viability, the trial court was not convinced that DAHP\u2019s compliance with open enrollment would threaten its economic viability. Therefore, the trial court held that R.C. 1742.12 was not pre-empted by federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66, because compliance with the state requirement would not conflict with the Congress\u2019s objective of preserving DAHP.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">DAHP contends that the trial court erred to its prejudice by determining that R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, was not pre-empted by federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66 as a matter of implied conflict pre-emption. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We agree with the trial court that the question of whether R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, is pre-empted by the federally enacted public laws turns on whether DAHP\u2019s compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirement would present an obstacle to achieving the purpose behind the congressional waiver. We also agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that DAHP\u2019s compliance with open enrollment would not obstruct the federal purpose behind the enactments; however, we reach this conclusion on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">As with any question of law, we review <em>de novo </em>the question whether R.C. 1742.12 is pre-empted by federal law. In this case, resolution of the conflict pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>emption issue turns on how one defines Congress\u2019s purpose for enacting Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Federal Public Law 102-276 is entitled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">\u201cAn Act: To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver of the requirement limiting the maximum number of individuals enrolled with a health maintenance organization who may be beneficiaries under the Medicare or Medicaid programs in order to enable the Dayton Area Health Plan, Inc., to continue to provide services through January 1994 to individuals residing in Montgomery County, Ohio, who are enrolled under a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social Security Act.\u201d 106 Stat. 126.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">The purpose of the waiver, as set forth in the House Report 102-494, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">\u201cThe purpose of H.R. 4572 is to provide temporary relief from the enrollment mix requirement of current Medicaid law to certain health maintenance organizations associated with the Dayton Area Health Plan, operating in Montgomery County, Ohio.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">The trial court and DAHP have both construed the Congress\u2019s purpose for enacting Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66 too broadly. We do not agree that the purpose behind the enactment of the federal public laws should be construed as having been to \u201cpreserve DAHP.\u201d Instead, based on our review of the language of the federal public laws and the legislative history of the enactments, we find it more reasonable to conclude that by granting DAHP a waiver of the twenty-five-percent commercial enrollment requirement, Congress\u2019s immediate purpose was to permit DAHP to receive federal Medicaid funding even if it had less than twenty-five percent commercial enrollment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">We find nothing in either the language of the federal statutes or the legislative history to indicate that, by granting the waivers of the federal Medicaid funding prerequisite, Congress intended to affect DAHP\u2019s obligation to comply with Ohio\u2019s HMO licensing obligations, or that Congress intended to do anything more than lift the federal Medicaid funding requirement that presented an obstacle to DAHP\u2019s operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">DAHP\u2019s congressional waiver of the twenty-five percent commercial enrollment requirement was not made contingent upon the number of DAHP\u2019s commercial enrollees. Accordingly, DAHP will continue to receive federal Medicaid matching funds pursuant to the congressional waivers in effect until December 31,1995, without regard to the percentage of the organization\u2019s commercial enrollment. Therefore, DAHP can comply with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirement by accepting commercial enrollees up to one percent of its current enrollment without presenting an obstacle to achieving Congress\u2019s objective for DAHP to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>receive federal Medicaid funding with less than twenty-five percent commercial enrollment. Accordingly, we conclude that DAHP\u2019s compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirement does not present an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress\u2019s purpose for enacting Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66. Because we do not construe the purpose behind the congressional legislation as being to \u201cpreserve DAHP,\u201d we need not pursue the question of whether DAHP\u2019s compliance with open enrollment would jeopardize its economic viability in order to reach this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Furthermore, we find absolutely no support in either the language of the federal laws or the legislative history to support DAHP\u2019s contention that by granting DAHP a waiver from the federal Medicaid 75/25 rule, Congress granted DAHP a right to operate as a one-hundred-percent Medicaid HMO. The waiver was intended to excuse DAHP from prerequisites for federal assistance, rather than to confer rights. Accordingly, DAHP\u2019s compliance with Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirements will not interfere with a federally conferred right.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Because we find no conflict between R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, and federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66, we conclude that the trial court did not err in determining that R.C. 1742.12, as applied to DAHP, is not pre-empted by federal Public Laws 102-276 and 103-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">DAHP\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">DAHP\u2019s second assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred to the prejudice of DAHP in its determination that DAHP failed to prove that open enrollment would jeopardize its economic viability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">According to DAHP, R.C. 1742.12 exempts an HMO from the open enrollment requirement if it can establish that \u201copen enrollment would jeopardize its economic viability.\u201d DAHP asserts that it presented sufficient evidence to the trial court to establish that compliance with open enrollment would jeopardize its economic viability. Accordingly, DAHP argues that the trial court abused its discretion by determining that open enrollment would not jeopardize DAHP\u2019s economic viability and by denying DAHP exemption from the requirement pursuant to the exception set forth in R.C. 1742.12(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">Initially, we note that R.C. 1742.12(D) provides that \u201cwhere the health maintenance organization demonstrates <em>to the satisfaction of the superintendent [of insurance] </em>that such open enrollment would jeopardize its economic viability,\u201d the superintendent may exempt the organization from the requirement or make other accommodations aimed at preserving its economic viability. (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>added.) The statute grants the Superintendent of Insurance, not the trial court, the explicit authority to decide whether a waiver of the open enrollment requirement is justified. Accordingly, DAHP\u2019s challenge to the propriety of the superintendent\u2019s decision not to grant a waiver upon the ground of economic viability, a decision involving the substantial exercise of discretion, and lying within the superintendent\u2019s sphere of administrative expertise, should have been in the form of an administrative appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Furthermore, from our review of the complaint and the transcript of the hearing before the trial court, we find that DAHP did not raise in the trial court the issue of the application of the Ohio statutory exemption set forth in R.C. 1742.12(D). Nor is there any indication in the trial court\u2019s opinion that the trial court addressed an argument based on the exemption set forth in R.C. 1742.12(D). Instead, a close review of the record reveals that DAHP raised arguments only about open enrollment\u2019s jeopardizing its economic viability as a part of its pre-emption argument, and the trial court addressed the economic viability issue only within the pre-emption context. Specifically, the trial court, having concluded that the waiver enacted by the United States Congress was intended to ensure that DAHP\u2019s economic viability would be protected from both state and federal regulation, an interpretation of the federal waiver with which we disagree, then concluded that Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirement would not undermine DAHP\u2019s economic viability. The trial court was never called upon to, and never did, determine whether Ohio\u2019s statutory economic viability exemption applied to DAHP.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Because we conclude that DAHP never argued in the trial court that it was entitled to the benefit of the economic viability exemption provided for in R.C. 1742.12(D), it may not make that argument for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">However, even if DAHP had raised the issue of the propriety of the superintendent\u2019s ruling under R.C. 1742.12(D) in the trial court, it is not likely that this argument would have prevailed. The standard of appellate review of an administrative agency ruling is limited to a determination whether the agency\u2019s action is supported by reliable, probative and substantial evidence, and whether it is contrary to law. <em>Richard T. Kiko Agency, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of Real Estate </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 74, 77, 549 N.E.2d 509, 512-513. A reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of an administrative agency, especially in areas of administrative expertise. See <em>West Virginia v. Ohio Hazardous Waste Facility Approval Bd. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 83, 28 OBR 179, 502 N.E.2d 625. Based on the evidence that DAHP presented at trial, in the context of the pre-emption argument, regarding the likely effect that open enrollment would have on DAHP\u2019s economic viability, a decision disturbing the superintendent\u2019s refusal to grant DAHP a waiver of the open enrollment require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ment would not have been supported. DAHP\u2019s best argument in support of its eligibility for the economic viability exemption was that the failure to obtain the exemption from Ohio\u2019s open enrollment requirement would, in turn, lead the United States Congress not to renew the statutory waiver of the federal 75/25 requirement when it expires later this year, and the nonrenewal of the federal waiver would cause DAHP\u2019s demise. Although DAHP presented testimony that Congress would respond to DAHP\u2019s failure to obtain an exemption from the Ohio requirement by declining to renew the waiver from the federal requirement, we cannot accept its contention that the Ohio General Assembly intended to include the likely effect of its statutory requirements for HMO\u2019s upon legislative decisions of the United States Congress when it used the phrase \u201ceconomic viability\u201d in the exemption provision. The effect of the state requirement upon federal legislation is too remote, causally, to justify an exemption from the state requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">DAHP\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Both of DAHP\u2019s assignments of error having been overruled, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-9\">Brogan, P.J., and Grady, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
