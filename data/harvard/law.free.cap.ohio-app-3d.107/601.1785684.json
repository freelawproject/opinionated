On April 28, 1995, appellant, Fifth Third Bank of NW Ohio, N.A., filed a complaint seeking judgment from appellee, Kevin Kuney, on a promissory note. The trial court received a letter from appellee on May 23, 1995, which it accepted as an answer to the complaint, stating that he \u201chad enlisted in the Armed Forces as of 4/25/95 * * Appellee also alleged in the letter that he was \u201cprotected under the Soldiers and Sailors Act\u201d and requested that the \u201ccharges be dismissed.\u201d Accompanying the letter to the trial court was a document captioned, \u201cENLISTMENT/REENLISTMENT DOCUMENT ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES.\u201d On June 6, 1995, the trial court ordered the case dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">On appeal appellant sets forth the following assignment of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in dismissing the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The trial court relied on the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940, Section 501 <em>et seq., </em>Title 50 U.S.C.A.App., U.S.Code, as the basis for dismissing this case. The Act, however, provides protection for those persons engaged in active military service only from having default judgments entered against them without their knowledge. <em>Roqueplot v. Roqueplot </em>(1980), 88 Ill. App.3d 59, 43 Ill.Dec. 441, 443, 410 N.E.2d 441, 443. Even if a person is on active duty, the Act does not prevent the entry of judgment when there has been notice of the pendency of the action and there is adequate time and opportunity to appear and defend such action. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">In reviewing the entire record in this case, it is clear that appellee failed to submit evidence that he is currently on active military duty. Paragraph 8(a) of the document appellee submitted to the trial court states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">\u201cI understand that I will be ordered to active duty as a Reservist unless I report to the place shown in item 4 above by * * * 0545 96 APR 23 for enlistment in the Regular component of the United States * * * AIR FORCE for not less than 4 years and 0 weeks.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Additionally, the record shows that appellee had notice of the pendency of the action and adequate time and opportunity to appear and defend this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Accordingly, pursuant to the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940, Section 501 <em>et seq., </em>Title 50 U.S.C.AApp., U.S.Code, we find that the trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint and its assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On consideration whereof, this court finds that substantial justice has not been done the party complaining, and the judgment of the Toledo Municipal Court dismissing the complaint is reversed. This matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Court costs of this appeal are assessed to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b647-7\">Abood, P.J., Handwork and Glasser, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
