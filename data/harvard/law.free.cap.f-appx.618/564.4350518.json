He contends that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>trict court plainly erred in sentencing him under the career-offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, based on his prior state convictions for selling and delivering cocaine. Specifically, he asserts that the statute underlying his prior convictions\u2014 Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) \u2014 is a strict liability statute that does not require an offender to have knowledge of the illicit nature of the substance involved. Walkers contends that any \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d serving as a predicate conviction for \u00a7 4B1.2(b) requires a <em>mens rea </em>element. After a thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In November 2013, a grand jury indicted Walker on one count of knowingly possessing with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C). Walker later pleaded guilty to that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In preparing the presentence investigation report (PSI), the probation officer determined that Walker was subject to the career-offender enhancement based on his prior state convictions for the sale and delivery of cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on a total offense level of 29 and a criminal history category of VI, the PSI set Walker\u2019s guideline range at 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Neither Walker nor the government had any unresolved objections to the final version of the PSI. In a separate sentencing memorandum, Walker requested a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(3)(A), arguing that his criminal history category overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">At sentencing, both Walker and the government reiterated that they did not have any objections to the final PSI. As such, the district court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and advisory guideline range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. Although the court rejected Walker\u2019s request for a downward departure, the court opted to vary downward and imposed a final sentence of 114 months\u2019 imprisonment. This is Walker\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-13\">Generally, we review the district court\u2019s determination that a defendant qualifies as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 <em>de novo. United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1243 (11th Cir.2006). Because Walker failed to object to the court\u2019s application of the career-offender enhancement, however, we review only for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-14\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, a convicted defendant qualifies as a career offender if: (1) he was at least 18 years old when he committed the instant offense; (2) the instant offense is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) he has at least two prior felony convictions that constitute either a crime of violence or a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>trolled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). For purposes of \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is \u201can offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,' that prohibits\u201d among other things, the \u201cdistribution ... of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Under Florida law, \u201ca person may not sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell, manufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(l)(a). This court recently held that a conviction under \u00a7 893.13(1) qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). <em>United States v. Smith </em>775 F.3d 1262, 1268 (11th Cir.2014). In <em>Smith, </em>we determined that the definitions for both \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b), and \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A), include crimes that do not require an element of <em>mens rea </em>regarding the illicit nature of the controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>Specifically, we explained that \u201c[n]o element of <em>mens rea </em>with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance is expressed or implied\u201d by the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>Id. </em>at 1267. Additionally, because the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d in \u00a7 4B1.2 is unambiguous, neither the presumption in favor of mental culpability nor the rule of lenity apply. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">In light of our recent decision in <em>Smith, </em>we conclude that the district court did not err, plainly or otherwise, in sentencing Walker as a career offender. Walker\u2019s prior convictions under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13(1) qualified as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d for purposes of the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>See Smith, </em>775 F.3d at 1264, 1267; <em>see also United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008) (holding that this court is bound to follow prior precedent unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court or by this Court sitting <em>en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Additionally, Walker\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Young v. United States, </em>936 F.2d 533, 536-37 (11th Cir.1991) \u2014 to argue that state crimes are \u201ccontrolled substance offenses,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4B1.2(2), only if they are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to federally drug trafficking crimes \u2014 is unavailing. As we explained in <em>Smith:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">When we decided <em>Young, </em>\u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d was defined as an enumerated list of federal drug trafficking crimes and \u201csimilar offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(2) (Nov. 1988). But the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense,\u201d in this appeal, does not reference drug trafficking or a class of \u201csimilar offenses.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (Nov. 2013).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-9\"><em>Smith </em>775 F.3d at 1268. As such, <em>Young </em>interpreted a different version of the guidelines than in effect during Walker\u2019s sentencing, and his rebanee on this case to establish a <em>mens rea </em>element is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">Accordingly, the district court properly characterized Walker as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1, and we affirm his 114-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">. Walker\u2019s criminal history includes Florida convictions for the: (1) delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a convenience business; (2) sale/delivery of cocaine; and (3) delivery of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">. The government argues that the doctrine of invited error precludes us from reviewing Walker\u2019s challenge at all. <em>See United States v. </em>Ross, 131 F.3d 970, 988 (11th Cir.1997) (\"It is a cardinal rule of appellate review that a party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted). We disagree. At sentencing, defense counsel stated that Walker\u2019s \"acts in the past ... technically qualify him[] as a career offender.\u201d But this statement came after the district court already had adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations, including the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement. Although Walker failed to object to his classification as a career offender, he did not ask for it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
