Charles argues that the district court abused its discretion by declining to reduce his original sixty-three-month sentence. Charles contends that the court had no basis to conclude that he had \u201cprobably lied\u201d and \u201cperjured himself\u2019 at his sentencing hearing and denying his motion on that basis was improper. Relying on <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778 (11th Cir.2000), Charles further argues that the court failed to conduct an analysis of the two-part test for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions and failed to consider the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Furthermore, he avers that his status as a deportable alien weighs in favor of a sentence reduction because he does not pose a threat to the public\u2019s safety since he will be immediately deported upon his release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, because we conclude that the district court\u2019s decision to deny Charles\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion did not constitute an abuse of its discretion, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 926 (11th Cir.2009). \u2022 \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it applies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, or makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>582 F.3d 1239, 1249 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the district court may reduce a currently incarcerated defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment when that defendant\u2019s original Sentencing Guideline range is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). We have held that \u201cwhen a sentencing guideline is amended ... and retroactive application is authorized, the district court may reduce the previously imposed sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Vautier, </em>144 F.3d 756, 759 (11th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u2019 In determining whether to apply a retroactive amendment to an eligible defendant, \u201cthe district court must make two distinct determinations.\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 760; see <em>also Bravo, </em>203 F.3d at 780. First, the court must recalculate the sentence under the amended Guidelines, and arrive at an amended range. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Second, the court must consider the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and decide whether, in its discretion, it will impose the newly calculated sentence under the amended Guidelines or retain the original sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id.; see also </em>\u00dc.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(i) (requiring the court to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors when determining whether to reduce the sentence and to what extent). In addition to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court also must consider the public\u2019s safety by taking into account \u201cthe nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that may be posed by a reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment\u201d when deciding whether and to what extent a reduction is warranted. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(ii). Additionally, the court may consider the defendant\u2019s post-sentencing conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"A57m\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to reduce Charles\u2019s sentence pursuant to the amended Guideline range. First, the district court properly recalculated Charles\u2019s Guideline range under the amended Guidelines and arrived at an amended Guideline range of forty-one to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760. Secondly, the district court explicitly cited and sufficiently stated that it had considered the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In addition, Charles\u2019s contention that the district court improperly relied on its conclusion that he had probably lied during his sentencing hearing when denying his motion is unavailing. A review of the court\u2019s order denying Charles\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion reveals that the district court based its denial on its observation that a reduction in Charles\u2019s sentence would not provide adequate deterrence or promote respect for the law. Furthermore, while Charles argues that a sentence reduction was warranted in light of Congress\u2019s \u201ceconomical intent,\u201d Charles points to no auth\u00f3rity \u2014 and we have found none \u2014 that would require the district court to consider the legislative intent behind retroactive sentencing amendments before deciding whether a reduction is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Finally, while we note that the district court\u2019s order did not explicitly state that it had considered the mandatory \u201cpublic-safety\u201d factor before deciding whether a reduction in Charles\u2019s sentence was warranted, it did state that it had considered the immigration consequences of Charles\u2019s incarceration. Because Charles argued at length in his motion that upon release, his deportable alien status would trigger his removal from the United States before he could pose a threat to the public, we are satisfied that the district court made an assessment of the public safety element based on the court\u2019s acknowledgement that it had considered the consequences of Charles\u2019s immigration status. Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Charles\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-6\">. Charles also makes a single passing reference to a constitutional argument, asserting that, if a prisoner\u2019s sentence can be shortened or modified by rights conveyed to him by law, ^en those rights should not be denied without due process. However, having offered no argument regarding this issue on appeal, he has abandoned it and we need not address it now. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\u201cWhen an appellant fails to offer argument on an issue, that issue is abandoned.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-11\">. While the two-step \u00a7 3582(c)(2) analysis is required, the district court is not required to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence, because that determination is discretionary. <em>Vautier, </em>144 F.3d at 760.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\">. A court need not \"articulate specifically the applicability \u2014 if any \u2014 of each of the [\u00a7 ] 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\" <em>United States v. Eggersdorf, </em>126 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
