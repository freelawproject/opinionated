No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the scope of its authority under section 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012). We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">A district court ordinarily may not modify a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). A district court may, however, reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the term of imprisonment was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u2018Where a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d 328, 337 (11th Cir.2013). The defendant bears the burden of establishing that a retroactive amendment actually lowers his guideline range. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">When determining whether a reduction is warranted, a court should determine the guidelines range that would have applied had the pertinent amendment been in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(l). In doing so, a court must substitute only the pertinent amendment into the district court\u2019s original guidelines calculations and must leave all other sentencing decisions unaffected. <em>Id.; United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">In this case, the sentencing court calculated Baptiste\u2019s base offense level as 38 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), based on the quantity of drugs involved in his offense. The court then added a two-level enhancement for Baptiste\u2019s possession of a firearm, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 40. Because Baptiste qualified as a career offender, the court applied the sentencing guidelines under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Under section 4B1.1, Baptiste\u2019s offense level was deemed to be the greater of 37 or \u201cthe offense level otherwise applicable\u201d which, in Baptiste\u2019s case, was 40. Based on a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of VI, Baptiste\u2019s guideline range was calculated as 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. The sentencing court imposed a sentence of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">The district court committed no error in denying Baptiste a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782. Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>782 reduced \u2014 by two \u2014 the base offense levels for most drug sentences calculated pursuant to the Drug Quantity Table, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(c). U.S.S.G.App. C\u201e amend. 782. Applying retroactively Amendment 782 to Baptiste\u2019s case would decrease Baptiste\u2019s base offense level from 38 to 36. Even absent the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, Baptiste\u2019s total offense level would then be adjusted up to 37, pursuant to section 4B1.1, based on Baptiste\u2019s status as a career offender. Together with his criminal history category of VI, Baptiste\u2019s resulting guideline range remains 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment. Because the retroactive application of Amendment 782 results in no change to Baptiste\u2019s sentencing range, no sentence reduction is authorized under section 3582(c)(2). <em>See Hamilton, </em>715 F.3d at 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b675-11\"> To the extent Baptiste challenges the constitutionality of his sentence, this argument is not cognizable in a section 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (in section 3582(c) proceedings, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider collateral attacks on a sentence). Moreover, Baptiste has abandoned his arguments (raised for the first time in his reply brief) that he is entitled to relief under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 and Amendments 706 and 750. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
