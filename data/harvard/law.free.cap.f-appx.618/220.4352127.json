He asserts that his sentence, which is within the advisory guidelines range, is unreasonable. Barrera-Pa-tino argues that his sentence is greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the guideline that applies to offenses involving illegal reentry, is not empirically based and results in prior convictions being unduly weighed and double counted. He contends that sentences imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 are not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the .guideline is not empirically based; but he concedes that this contention is foreclosed by precedent. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Barrera-Patino further urges that (1) his illegal reentry was not a violent crime but an international .trespass, and (2) his sentence did not account for his personal history and characteristics or his benign motive for reentering the country (i.e., to visit his ailing mother). We review a sentence for reasonableness, under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The record reflects that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision was based on an individualized assessment of the facts in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See id. </em>at 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The district court\u2019s determination of the appropriate sentence is entitled to deference, and we may not reweigh its assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586. Barrera-Patino\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks an empirical basis and double counts prior convictions is unavailing. <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.2009). Further, we have rejected the contention that the Sentencing Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry when it is merely an international trespass crime. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Barrera-Patino\u2019s motive for illegally reentering this country, even if benign, is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that applies to his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, .565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
