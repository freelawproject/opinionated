On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in (1) applying a base offense level of 12 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(l) rather than 10 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(2); and (2) not applying a minor or minimal role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. After consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and review of the record, we find that the district court did not err in either decision. Accordingly, we affirm Duckworth\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-13\">Duckworth first argues that he should have been assigned a base offense level of 10, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(2), instead of the level of 12 that he was assigned, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(l). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its application of the Guidelines to those facts is reviewed de novo. <em>See United States v. Dimitrovski, </em>782 F.3d 622, 628 (11th Cir.2015). \u201c\u2018The findings of fact of the sentencing court may be based on evidence heard during trial, facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>admitted by a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty, undisputed statements in the presentence report, or evidence presented at the sentencing hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1232 (11th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>884 F.2d 1355, 1356 (11th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\"><em>\u201c </em>\u2018Offense\u2019 means the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3 ... unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 1(H). The base offense level is determined on the bases of \u201call acts and omissions committed, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused by the defendant,\u201d and, \u201cin the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ..., all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A)-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Under \u00a7 2E3.1(a) (\u201cGambling Offenses; Animal Fighting Offenses\u201d), the base offense level is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">(1) 12, if the offense was (A) engaging in a gambling business; (B) transmission of wagering information; or (C) committed as part of, or to facilitate, a commercial gambling operation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">(2) 10, if the offense involved an animal fighting venture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-9\"><em>Id. \u00a7 </em>2E3.1(a)(l)-(2). An \u201canimal fighting venture\u201d is defined as \u201cany event, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, that involves a fight conducted or to be conducted between at least 2 animals for purposes of sport, wagering, or entertainment.\u201d 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2156(g); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">As an initial matter, we find that the district court did not clearly err in determining that Duckworth was involved beyond just the April 7,2012 fight in which he admitted participating. Evidence existed that Duckworth refereed fights, fought dogs in other fights, and trained dogs. In addition, Duckworth was known by other participants as being involved in the dog fighting circuit. Furthermore, the district court did not clearly err in finding that the gambling activities of the other codefen-dants (the facts of which are not contested here) were reasonably foreseeable to Duckworth. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B) (stating that the base offense level in jointly undertaken criminal activity includes \u201call reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">Accordingly, based on these-facts, the district court did not err in applying the base level of 12 under \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(l). Looking to the plain language of the guideline, the gambling activities of Duckworth\u2019s co-conspirators fit within \u201cengaging in a gambling business\u201d or \u201ca commercial gambling operation.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1(a)(l). Although Duckworth argues that dog fighting is quintessentially economic, the guideline definition of animal fighting is broader and can include fights for sport or entertainment, not just those for wagering. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2156(g); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E3.1 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">While Duckworth also argues that the statutory definition of \u201cgambling business\u201d as found in 18 U.S.C.1955(b)(l) should apply, there is no cross-reference in the guideline (unlike for animal fighting) and, therefore, we look to the plain language of gambling. <em>See United States v. Cruz, </em>713 F.3d 600, 607 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201cWhen interpreting the Guidelines, a guideline\u2019s meaning is derived first from its plain language and, absent ambiguity, no additional inquiry is necessary.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). However, even if we were to apply the \u00a7 1955 definition, Duckworth\u2019s offense qualifies \u2014 it was illegal, involved 5 or more people, and grossed far more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>$2,000 in a single day. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. 1955(b)(1). Thus, we do not find that the district court erred in assigning Duck-worth a base offense level of 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Duckworth next argues that the district court should have applied a minor or minimal role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. A district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez Be Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc). \u201c[T]he district court has considerable discretion in making this fact-intensive determination.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1277-78 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant may receive a reduction for having a limited role in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. The defendant may receive a four-level reduction if he was a minimal participant, a two-level reduction if he was a minor participant, or a three-level reduction if he was somewhere between a minimal and minor participant. <em>Id. </em>The determination of whether to apply a mitigating role adjustment \u201cis heavily dependent upon the facts of the particular case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C). \u201cThe defendant has the burden of establishing his role in the offense by a- preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Alvarez-Coria, </em>447 F.3d 1340, 1343 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to apply a minor role reduction or a minimal role reduction! Duckworth transported a dog and fought it at a dog fight hosted by one of his codefendants on April 7, 2012. And, as mentioned above, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Duckworth also fought dogs in other dog fights, refereed fights hosted by a codefendant, received money from this codefendant to train dogs, and had trained other individuals\u2019 dogs. Duck-worth also knew the scope of operations and activities of others and was known by others in the dog fighting circuit. <em>Cf. </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4 (noting that minimal participation may be indicated by a defendant\u2019s \u201clack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">In light of these activities, it was not clearly erroneous to find that Duck-worth was not substantially less culpable than or plainly among the least culpable of the other participants, even excluding those individuals who only attended the dog fights. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). The fact that he did not plan the fights or take wagers is not dispositive, because although his role may have been less than some of the other participants, \u201cit is possible that none of them are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>See De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 944. That is particularly appropriate here, where Duckworth, despite his potentially lesser culpability than some codefendants, still kept 12-15 dogs of his own, trained and fought dogs, refereed fights, and was known and discussed by other participants regarding dog fighting and gambling. Thus, Duckworth has not established his qualification for a minor role reduction by a preponderance of the evidence, and the district court did not err in finding that the reduction did not apply. <em>See Alvarez-Coria, </em>447 F.3d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Accordingly, we affirm Duckworth\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-7\">. Although Duckworth was released from federal imprisonment on May 1, 2015, he is currently serving his term of supervised release, \"which is part of his sentence and involves some restrictions upon his liberty.\u201d <em>Dawson v. Scott, </em>50 F.3d 884, 886 n. 2 (11th Cir.1995). Thus, his appeal is not moot. <em>See id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
