Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm Bryant\u2019s conviction and sentence for the reasons 'set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Bryant first argues that the district court abused its discretion when it excused a juror for cause over Bryant\u2019s objection (1) because th\u00e9 juror said that she could be fair and would be able to set aside a painful experience she had had with' fraudulent documents and (2) because the circumstances did not warrant her dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">A district court may excuse a juror and replace her with an alternate if, prior to deliberations, the juror is \u201cunable to perform\u201d or' \u201cdisqualified from performing\u201d her duties. Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(1); <em>see also United States v. Fajardo, </em>787 F.2d 1523, 1525 (11th Cir.1986). \u201cThe decision to remove a juror and replace [her] with an alternate is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge \u2018whenever facts are presented which convince the trial judge that the juror\u2019s ability to perform [her] duty as a juror is impaired.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fajar-do, </em>787 F.2d at 1525 (quoting <em>United States v. Smith, </em>550 F.2d 277, 285 (5th Cir.1977)); <em>see also United States v. Augustin, </em>661 F.3d 1105, 1129 (11th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (\u201cA district court\u2019s decision to remove a juror is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\u201d). Absent a showing of bias or prejudice to the defendant, we will not disturb the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. De La Vega, </em>913 F.2d 861, 869 (11th Cir.1990). \u201c[Prejudice includes discharge of a juror without factual support or for a legally irrelevant reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). It is not necessary that a defendant consent to the court\u2019s replacement of a juror with an alternate \u2014 \u201creasonable cause for the replacement\u201d is all that is required. <em>See Fajardo, </em>787 F.2d at 1526.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in excusing the-subject juror. The district court\u2019s concern that the juror could not be fail' and impartial in Bryant\u2019s case was reasonable, <em>see id., </em>based on the juror\u2019s statements (1) that she was never treated fairly by the justice system, including courts, lawyers, and law, enforcement, (2) that evidence of fraudulent documents likely to be introduced at Bryant\u2019s trial would be painful for her, and (3) that whether her past experiences would affect her judgment would depend on what evidence was, in fact, presented at trial. The juror\u2019s ability to serve impartially was certainly \u201cless than clear,\u201d and the district judge\u2019s ultimate excusal of the juror was supported by a factual basis. <em>See De La Vega, </em>913 F.2d at 869. Moreover, Bryant failed to show how the juror\u2019s excusal was prejudicial to her \u2014 indeed, she conceded that the juror\u2019s inclusion more likely would have favored the government. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s excusal of the juror and replacement with an alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Bryant next contends that the district court erred in admitting evidence of her meeting with a tax preparer regarding a business tax return that was never filed, arguing that this evidence had no probative value, was not relevant to her intent to seek a false refund with respect to the individual tax return at issue, and thus did not meet the Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) test. <em>See United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1267 (11th Cir.2008) (dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>cussing Rule 404(b) standard). Bryant further argues that her meeting with the tax preparer was not \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the charged offense and that admitting evidence thereof was harmfully prejudicial. <em>See id. </em>at 1269 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, Bryant invited the alleged error and thus cannot challenge the admission of this evidence on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The doctrine of invited error applies when a party \u201cinduces or invites\u201d the district court into committing error. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). When a party invites error, we are precluded from reviewing that error on appeal. <em>See id. </em>Although Bryant argued below that the evidence of her meeting with the tax preparer was not inextricably intertwined with the alleged offense, she conceded its admissibility under Rule 404(b) by (1) requesting a Rule 404(b) instruction from the court, (2) introducing the evidence herself \u201cto steal [the government\u2019s] thunder,\u201d and (3) using the evidence to argue to the jury that she was not guilty. Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s admission of evidence concerning Bryant\u2019s meeting with the tax preparer.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Bryant next argues that the district court erred in denying her Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal because the government had failed to produce evidence that a refund issued to Bryant by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was caused by Bryant\u2019s alleged false claim. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. According to Bryant, the government had not concluded its investigation as to why the IRS reissued a refund to her more than a year after the original refund check was returned and a criminal investigation was initiated. Without such information, Bryant contends, denial of her Rule 29 motion was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Ordinarily, we review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and drawing ah reasonable inferences in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See United States v. Vernon, </em>723 F.3d 1234, 1266 (11th Cir.2013). However, because Bryant is presenting her sufficiency of the evidence argument for the first time on appeal, we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>See United States v. Joseph, </em>709 F.3d 1082, 1093, 1103 (11th Cir.2013), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1273, 188 L.Ed.2d 310 (2014). \u201cTo establish plain error, a defendant must show there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Evans, </em>478 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the defendant demonstrates plain error has occurred, we may recognize the otherwise forfeited error, \u201cbut only if the error seriously affect[s] the fairness,. integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ACYI\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287, it is unlawful to \u201cmake[ ] or present\u00ed ] ... to any department or agency [of the United States], any claim upon or against the United States, or any department or agency thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent.\u201d To sustain a conviction for making a false claim under \u00a7 287, the government must prove:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">[1] That the defendant made or presented a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim to a department of the United States;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-13\">[2] That the defendant knew such claim was false, fictitious, or fraudulent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>[3] That the defendant did so with the specific intent to violate the law or with a consciousness that what he was doing was wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><em>United States v. Slocum, </em>708 F.2d 587, 596 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Here, the district court did not plainly err in denying Bryant\u2019s Rule 29-motion, despite the government\u2019s failure to explain the basis for the IRS\u2019s reissuance of her refund. The cause of the reissuance was not necessary to the charge of false claims for which Bryant was convicted. Moreover, an IRS agent testified that the IRS regularly issues refunds to taxpayers before verifying the fraudulent nature of individual claims. Thus, it was not plain error to conclude that it was possible for a reasonable jury to find Bryant guilty of false claims beyond a reasonable doubt, even without knowing why the IRS decided to reissue the refund to Bryant after the criminal investigation against her had ensued. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Bryant\u2019s Rule 29 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Finally, Bryant argues that the district court erred in imposing a higher sentence than it had originally intended based solely on her maintaining her innocence during her allocution. Bryant contends that this was an improper basis upon which to sentence her to a longer term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\u201c[T]he familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review ... applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A court abuses its discretion in imposing a sentence if it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight, (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight, or (3) commits a clear error of judgment by balancing the proper factors unreasonably. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191-92 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Early, </em>686 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">We review de novo whether the district court considered an impermissible sentencing factor. <em>See United States v. Stanley, </em>739 F.3d 633, 652 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2317, 189 L.Ed.2d 195 (2014). Although the district court may not consider a defendant\u2019s exercise of her Fifth Amendment rights, it may consider her lack of remorse, <em>see id., </em>and disrespect for the law, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). We have stated that where a defendant chooses to allocute at his sentencing hearing without pressure from the court and repeatedly denies any wrongdoing, the court is permitted to consider the defendant\u2019s freely offered statements indicating a lack of remorse in sentencing. <em>See Stanley, </em>739 F.3d at 652. \u201cJust as a jury weighs a defendant\u2019s testimony once he waives his Fifth Amendment privilege at trial, a judge may consider a defendant\u2019s freely offered allocution regarding remorse during sentencing.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">In the instant case, the district court did not err in considering Bryant\u2019s lack of remorse and her disrespect for the law evinced by her allocution in sentencing her to a term of imprisonment at the higher end of the Guidelines range. Her (1) repeated denial of guilt and blaming of others, (2) accusations against the court, law enforcement, and the government, and (3) threats to continue \u201cscreaming\u201d and \u201cfight[ingl\u201d, all of which were freely made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>during allocution, demonstrated a lack of remorse, <em>see </em>id,-and showed a disrespect for the law, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). The district court expressly stated that it made its determination not on account of Bryant\u2019s maintaining her innocence but out of a motivation to promote respect for the law. <em>See id. </em>The court also indicated that it gave due weight to the statements of the parties, the presentence report and Advisory Guidelines, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Bryant\u2019s twenty-seven-month sentence \u2014 which was within the Guidelines and well below the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 287; <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 745 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in considering Bryant\u2019s lack of remorse and did not abuse its discretion in sentencing her to twenty-seven-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
