Chance, Jr., appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for attorneys fees under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988(b), 'following the settlement of his complaint under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000ce. Chance contends that the district court misinterpreted the settlement agreement and erred in concluding that he was not the prevailing party and not entitled to attorneys fees under \u00a7 1988. Even under de novo review, Chance\u2019s claims are unavailing. <em>See Davis v. Abbott, </em>781 F.3d 207, 213 (5th Cir.2015). Particularly in the absence of the legal term of art \u201cprevailing party\u201d in its fees provision, the plain language and the parties\u2019 Rule 11 agreement left to the district court the resolution of the issue of entitlement to attorneys fees. <em>See Davis, </em>781 F.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">In determining whether a party is the prevailing party, courts use a tripartite test, traceable to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Buckhannon Bd. &amp; Care Home, Inc. v. W. Virginia Dep\u2019t Of Health &amp; Human Res., 532 </em>U.S. 598, 121 S.Ct. 1835, 149 L.Ed.2d 855 (2001). <em>Davis, </em>781 F.3d at 214. First, a \u201cplaintiff must achieve judicially-sanctioned relief\u2019; second, \u201cthe relief must materially alter the legal relationship between the parties\u201d; and, third, \u201cthe relief' must modify the defendant\u2019s behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff at the time the relief is entered.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>781 F.3d at 214, quoting <em>Petteway v. Henry, </em>738 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">Chance does not contest the district court\u2019s construction of the parties\u2019 agreement as a private settlement, and he fails to establish that the settlement was anything other than a voluntary agreement by the defendants to alter their future conduct regarding particular religious items required for his practice of a Native American ceremony. <em>See Davis, </em>781 F.3d at 214. As such, the settlement lacked the required judicial imprimatur on the change to the parties\u2019 relationship to constitute Chance as the prevailing party. <em>See Davis, </em>781 F.3d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir, R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
