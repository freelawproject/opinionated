Quarterman, </em>507 F.3d 884, 888 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-23\">The district court did not expressly determine whether a COA should issue from the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. Ordinarily, we would conclude that we lack jurisdiction over the present appeal and remand. <em>See Sonnier v. Johnson, </em>161 F.3d 941, 945-46 (5th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>116 F.3d 1113, 1115 (5th Cir.1997). However, we decline to remand this case to the district court for a COA ruling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>lacks jurisdiction over this Rule 60(b) motion. The motion, which was not directed to the procedural ruling and did not allege a defect in the integrity of the proceedings, was really a successive \u00a7 2254 application. <em>See Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 530-33, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005); <em>In re Cain, </em>137 F.3d 234, 235 (5th Cir.1998). Thus, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider the motion without authorization from this court, which was neither sought' nor given. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3); <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The appeal is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction, and Stallworth\u2019s motions for a COA and for IFP are DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b262-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-27\">. Because we conclude that remand is inappropriate for other reasons, we need not address whether the district court\u2019s January 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>2015 order referring to its prior denial of a COA, denying IFP status, and concluding that an appeal would be frivolous constitutes an implicit denial of an application for COA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
