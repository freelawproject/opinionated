On appeal, Fernandez argues that the district court erred in denying his request for a minor-role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">The district court did not clearly err in denying Defendant Fernandez a minor-role reduction. In calculating Fernandez\u2019s offense level, the district court held Fernandez accountable for only the 6,897 grams of methamphetamine, which Fernandez admits he transported from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale. In other words, Fernandez\u2019s relevant conduct was the same as his actual conduct in the drug conspiracy. <em>See United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 940 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc) (instructing courts to consider the defendant\u2019s role in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant at sentencing). Thus, Fernandez cannot point to the wider drug conspiracy for which he was not held accountable \u2014 including the uncompleted plan t\u00f3 exchange the methamphetamine for cocaine \u2014 to show his role was minor. <em>See id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Fernandez contends his role was minor compared to the role of his codefendant, Jacinto Marte, who was the source of the methamphetamine, arranged the drug exchange, and gave Fernandez his instructions. The district court may, but is not required to, compare a defendant\u2019s role to the other participants in the relevant conduct. <em>See id. </em>at 944. And, a comparison of the defendant\u2019s role against his relevant conduct attributed to him \u201cin many cases ... will be dispositive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">In any event, the fact that Fernandez may have been less culpable than Marte does not mean that Fernandez\u2019s role was minor. <em>See id. </em>at 944 (explaining that it is possible to have no minor or minimal participants). In fact, Fernandez\u2019s role in the proposed drug exchange was substantial. Not only did Fernandez drive a very large amount of methamphetamine from Philadelphia to Fort Lauderdale, he also obtained a driver\u2019s license and car registration in his brother\u2019s name to do so, texted updates to the confidential source working with investigators during his trip, met with an undercover officer at a Starbucks to make the exchange, and, after speaking with the undercover officer, he made the decision not to allow the undercover officer to inspect the methamphetamine prior to a trade and ended the meeting when he became uneasy. While Fernandez stresses that he did not have an equity interest in the drugs, he admits he was to be paid $3,000 plus expenses for his part in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">Given the undisputed facts, the district court\u2019s finding that Fernandez played more than a minor role in the drug conspiracy was not clear error.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-7\">. \"We review a district court's denial of a role reduction for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v.
