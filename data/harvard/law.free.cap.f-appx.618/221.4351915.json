Because Ortega is proceeding under \u00a7 2241, he need not obtain a certificate of appealability. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">A federal prisoner may use \u00a7 2241 to challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence if he can satisfy the requirements of the so-called \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). In order to proceed under the savings clause, Ortega must raise a previously foreclosed claim that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>Id. </em>at 904. In his opening brief, Ortega cites to <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). To the extent that he relies upon these decisions to make the showing required by <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>we have previously determined that the holdings from these decisions are not retroactively applicable. <em>See United States v. Olvera, </em>775 F.3d 726, 730 (5th Cir.2015); <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 427 (5th Cir.2005). Ortega does not otherwise challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to make the showing necessary to proceed under the savings clause. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-15\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b244-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
