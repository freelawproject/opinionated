(\u201cHSBC\u201d). In this civil action, McCloud alleged that HSBC foreclosed improperly on her real property (\u201cProperty\u201d), in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), and Georgia foreclosure law. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-19\">Construed liberally, McCloud raises three issues on appeal: (1) summary judgment was improper because HSBC lacked standing to foreclose on the Property; (2) HSBC failed to comply with the notice requirements of the FDCPA and of Georgia foreclosure law; and (3) the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment deprived McCloud of her Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-20\">First, we conclude that HSBC had standing to foreclose on the Property. McCloud financed her purchase of the Property through a mortgage loan secured by a Security Deed in favor of Vanguard Mortgage Corporation and its \u201csuccessors and assigns.\u201d The Security Deed was later assigned by Vanguard to different intermediate financial institutions, and ultimately to HSBC.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Security Deed grants to HSBC, as one of Vanguard\u2019s \u201csuccessors and assigns,\u201d a security inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>est in the Property \u201cwith power of sale.\u201d Thus, HSBC was authorized expressly to foreclose on the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">Contrary to McCloud\u2019s assertions, Georgia law provides that an assignee of a security interest may foreclose upon the collateral securing the debt, even if the assignee holds no promissory note evidencing the underlying debt. <em>See You v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, </em>293 Ga. 67, 743 S.E.2d 428, 429 (2013). Moreover, the security interest in the Property survived McCloud\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, which discharged only McCloud\u2019s personal liability for the underlying debt. <em>See Bank of Am. v. Cuneo, </em>332 Ga.App. 73, 770 S.E.2d 48, 53 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">About McCloud\u2019s second argument, the record demonstrates that HSBC complied with both the FDCPA and with Georgia law in pursuing foreclosure on the Property. First, HSBC sent McCloud proper written notice of the debt, in compliance with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(a). And, in response to McCloud\u2019s dispute letter, HSBC provided McCloud with information verifying the debt, as required under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692g(b). HSBC also provided McCloud with proper written notice of the foreclosure sale, in compliance with O.C.G.A. \u00a7 44-14-162.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-7\">We also reject McCloud\u2019s Sixth Amendment argument: an argument foreclosed by our circuit precedent. <em>See Itel Capital Corp. v. Cups Coal Co., </em>707 F.2d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.1983) (\u201cwhere no issue of fact remains, summary judgment decides only questions of law and does not deprive the losing party of its jury trial right.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-8\">No genuine issue of material fact exists; the district court committed no error in granting HSBC summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b971-15\">. We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (11th Cir.2007). We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b971-21\">. McCloud\u2014as a non-party to the assignments \u2014 lacks standing to challenge the validity of the assignments. <em>See Montgomery v.
