However, the court varied downward from the advisory guideline range of 18 to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment, sentencing Ade-neye to 13 months for each count, to be served concurrently, for a total of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment. We vacated and remanded, and instructed the district court to make clear findings as to whether grouping was appropriate under \u00a7 3D1.2(a) or (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On remand, the district court again refused to group the counts and sentenced Adeneye to a total of 13 months\u2019 imprisonment. In doing so, it clarified that it would have sentenced Ade-neye to the same total sentence of 13 months even if the counts were grouped.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The present appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">On appeal, Adeneye argues that the district court erred in refusing to group his counts of conviction when calculating his advisory guideline range. The government responds, inter alia, that grouping the counts would not' have been proper, as Adeneye committed two separate offenses with two separate wrongs. After consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs and review of the record on appeal, we find that, even if the district court erred in failing to group Adeneye\u2019s two counts of conviction, any error in that regard was harmless, and the 13-month sentence imposed is reasonable regardless of whether the counts are grouped. Accordingly, we affirm Ade-neye\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">We review the district court\u2019s refusal to group multiple counts under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 with due deference. <em>See United States v. Bradford, </em>277 F.3d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.2002) (per curiam). Counts should be grouped together for guideline calculation purposes when they \u201cinvolv[e] substantially the same harm,\u201d such as when they \u201cinvolve the same victim and the same act\u201d or \u201cinvolve the same victim and two or more acts ... connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a)-(b). We need not decide a guidelines issue or remand for new sentencing proceedings, however, when the district court expressly states that it would have imposed the same sentence regardless of its ruling on the issue, and the sentence would have been reasonable assuming the issue was.decided in the defendant\u2019s favor. <em>See United States v. Keene, </em>470 F.3d 1347, 1349 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-11\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, <em>see Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and we will vacate a sentence imposed by a district court only when left with a \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that the district court com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>mitted a clear error of judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). The court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">We have stated that, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). And we have found that \u201c[a] sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a reasonable sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d 1353, 1362, 1364 (11th Cir.2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 1186, 191 L.Ed.2d 142 (2015) (holding that the sentence was reasonable in part because it was well below the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Here, we need not decide whether the district court erred in failing to group Ade-neye\u2019s two counts of conviction because any error in that regard was harmless. <em>See Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349. The district court imposed a total sentence below the calculated advisory guideline range and within the advisory guideline range Ade-neye proposes, so harmless error analysis is appropriate. <em>See United States v. Burner, </em>572 F.3d 1239, 1248 (11th Cir.2009). Moreover, the district court stated multiple times that it sentenced Adeneye to 13 months\u2019 imprisonment because it thought the sentence was reasonable and that it would have imposed the same sentence even if his two counts of conviction had grouped. <em>See id.; see also Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1348-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">Additionally, a 13-month total sentence would have been substantively reasonable even if the district court had grouped the counts of conviction. <em>See Keene, </em>470 F.3d at 1349-50. The district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3353(a) factors and found a 13-month total sentence to be reasonable. It did not have to lay the factors out one by one. <em>See United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (noting that district courts do not have to conduct an accounting of every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and explain the role each played in the sentencing decision). The court specifically addressed how it focused on deterrence, and it was within the court\u2019s discretion to give that factor greater weight. <em>See Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 872 (noting that we will not \u201csecond guess the weight\u201d accorded to a given factor (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-15\">Further, the advisory guideline range would have been 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment if the counts were grouped, while the advisory guideline range was 18 to 24 months with the counts not grouped. Thus, a 18-month total sentence was within the 12-to-18-month guideline range that would have applied even if the counts had been grouped, which indicates reasonableness. <em>See, e.g., Snipes, </em>611 F.3d at 872. Moreover, the concurrent 13-month sentences fell far below the applicable 5-year maximum sentences, further evidenc-' ing the reasonableness of the total sentence imposed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Dougherty, </em>754 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>at 1862. Based on the foregoing, even if Adeneye\u2019s counts of conviction had been grouped, the 13-month total sentence that the court stated that it would have imposed regardless would not leave us with \u201cthe definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). Therefore, after careful consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 arguments on appeal, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-3\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-7\">.We note that the judgment incorrectly lists the offense of conviction as to count two as 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(b)(A)(ii), instead of \u00a7 3146(b)(l)(A)(ii). We point this out in case the district court wishes to correct this clerical error in the judgment; the inadvertent omission of the \"(1)\u201d does not affect the instant appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b584-12\">. <em>United States v.
