On appeal, Tinker challenges the denial of his motion to suppress the firearm and also his enhanced sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). After review, we affirm Tinker\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">I. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The district court did not err when it denied Tinker\u2019s motion to suppress. First, the police officers involved in the traffic stop had both probable cause to believe a traffic violation had occurred and also a reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>526 F.3d 1334, 1337 (11th Cir.2008) (requiring a traffic stop to be supported by either probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has been committed or a reasonable suspicion that crime is afoot).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Both officers testified that they observed the vehicle swerve and weave as it travelled down an unmarked roadway, even though there were no obstructions in the roadway, and the vehicle did not need to pass another car. Specifically, Detective Jeffrey Parker testified that the vehicle was \u201cswerving off and on the road.\u201d Detective Michael Fernando Mendez testified that the vehicle was \u201cweaving in and out of the traffic lane on the street\u201d and that it was \u201cimpeding the other lane for\u201d oncoming traffic. While the officers\u2019 testimonies differed slightly, they agreed that the vehicle left its own lane and crossed into the lane for oncoming traffic, which is a \u201cnoncriminal traffic infraction\u201d under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.081(1), (5) (requiring vehicles to drive on the right side of the roadway). Moreover, the officers agreed that the vehicle weaved several times and that they stopped the vehicle because they were concerned that the driver might be intoxicated, which is a criminal offense under Florida law. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 316.193 (making it a crime to drive a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">The district court listened to the officers\u2019 testimony, weighed their credibility, and determined that the officers were justified in making the stop. Tinker did not present any evidence to controvert the officers\u2019 testimony. And, the fact that the officers\u2019 testimony was not completely consistent on every detail does not provide a basis for reversing the district court\u2019s credibility findings. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d 1359, 1366 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that, this Court will not reverse a credibility finding unless the challenged testimony \u201cis contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and affording deference to the district court\u2019s credibility findings, the officers had both probable cause and a reasonable suspicion to initiate the traffic stop. <em>See United States v. Lewis, </em>674 F.3d 1298, 1303 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">Additionally, Detective Parker\u2019s testimony established that, after the vehicle was pulled over, he had a reasonable suspicion that Tinker was armed and dangerous. <em>See Arizona v. Johnson, </em>555 U.S. 323, 327, 129 S.Ct. 781, 784, 172 L.Ed.2d 694 (2009) (concluding that an officer is permitted to conduct a limited search of the outer clothing of a passenger in vehicle during a traffic stop if the officer has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>reasonable suspicion that the passenger may be armed and dangerous). Detective Parker' testified that the traffic stop occurred in a high-crime area. As Detective Parker spoke to Tinker through the passenger-side window, Tinker appeared nervous, muttered, and would not make eye contact, his right hand was shaking, and his left hand appeared to be holding an object in his waistband. When, at Detective Parker\u2019s request, Tinker stepped out of the vehicle, Tinker adjusted the object in his waistband as if to secure it. At this point, Detective Parker asked Tinker to place his hands on top of the vehicle, conducted a pat-down search of his waist area, felt the butt of a gun, and then found a loaded firearm in his waistband.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Based on this testimony, the district court found that, \u201c[ajfter seeing Tinker adjust something in his waistband, Detective Parker immediately ordered Tinker to face the vehicle and place his hands on it.\u201d This finding is not inconsistent with Detective Parker\u2019s testimony and Detective Parker\u2019s testimony was not so improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder would accept it. <em>See Pineiro, </em>389 F.3d at 1366. Given the facts as the district court found them, Detective Parker had a reasonable suspicion that Tinker was armed and dangerous based on the totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Griffin, </em>696 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that the officer does not have to have definitive evidence of a weapon or be certain the defendant, is armed to have a reasonable suspicion). Accordingly, the district court did not err in finding that the pat-down search was justified and constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">II. ACCA ENHANCEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Finally, Tinker asserts that the district court misapplied the ACCA\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence because his three qualifying prior convictions were neither charged in the indictment nor proven to a jury. As Tinker acknowledges, however, this Apprendi-based argument is foreclosed by binding precedent: <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 239-7, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1229-33, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (allowing the district court to consider prior convictions at sentencing); <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (expressly declining to overrule Almendarez-Torres); <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2160 n. 1, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (declining to revisit <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>); <em>United States v. King, </em>751 F.3d 1268, 1280 (11th Cir.2014) (concluding that Almendarez-Torres remains binding precedent).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">We note that Tinker has never disputed that his prior Florida convictions \u2014 1999 convictions for robbery while using a deadly weapon and aggravated assault with a firearm, a 2010 conviction for resisting an officer with violence, and a 2013 conviction for aggravated battery \u2014 constitute \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under the ACCA. Moreover, Tinker\u2019s predicate offenses appear to qualify as violent felonies under the \u201celements\u201d clause in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(l), rather than the \u201cresidual\u201d clause in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), and thus Tinker\u2019s classification as an armed career criminal does not appear to be affected by <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S.-, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). In any event, Tinker has never claimed that his predicate offenses are included based on the residual clause and has never raised the constitutional challenge to the ACCA\u2019s residual clause asserted by the defendant in <em>Johnson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">For these reasons, we affirm Tinker\u2019s conviction and 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">. Pursuant to a written pled agreement, Tinker entered into a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
