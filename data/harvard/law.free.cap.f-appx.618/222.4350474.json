The district court varied upward from the six-to-twelve-month guidelines range, reasoning that the sentence imposed \u201caddresse[d] the-issues of adequate deterrence and protection of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Priestley did not timely object to the sentence when it was imposed, so we review his claims under the deferential plain error standard. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009). In so doing, we evaluate the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation of its revocation sentence pursuant to <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). <em>Whitelaiv, </em>580 F.3d at 261. The district court noted deterrence and protection of the public, thereby explicitly considering those 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a) factors that the court deemed relevant to its determination. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C). The sentencing court committed no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">In any event, no error affected Priestley\u2019s substantial rights. His assertion to the contrary notwithstanding, the record of the sentencing proceedings in this case does permit a meaningful appellate review. <em>See Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 264. Nothing in the record suggests that a more thorough explanation would have resulted in a shorter sentence, or that the district court considered any improper factor, or that it would impose a different sentence on remand. <em>Id. </em>at 264-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">Finally, Priestley\u2019s argument that <em>Whi-telaw </em>was wrongly decided \u2014 concededly raised to preserve that contention for further review \u2014 is unavailing. We may not overrule <em>Whitelaw </em>absent a superseding decision by the Supreme Court or by this court en banc. <em>See United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
