She claims: the court did not adequately explain the reasons for its sentence; and the sentence is unreasonable. Revocation sentences are reviewed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)\u2019s \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>634 F.3d 841, 843 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-19\">\u2022 To determine whether a sentence is plainly unreasonable, our court first evaluates whether the district court committed a \u201csignificant procedural error, such as failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence, including failing to explain a deviation from the Guidelines [sentencing] range\u201d. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>720 F.3d 321, 326 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Dicicco did not object to the adequacy of the court\u2019s explanation for the sentence, the standard of review is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009). Along that line, the requisite \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cobvious\u201d error is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-20\">The court acknowledged the nature of Dicicco\u2019s supervised release violations and considered defense counsel\u2019s argument, in which counsel discussed Dicicco\u2019s circumstances and requested leniency. The court\u2019s explanation reflects an implicit consideration of the relevant sentencing considerations of \u00a7 3553(a), which include \u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d, as well as the need to promote respect for the law and- adequately deter criminal conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(B). The court considered the relevant sentencing factors; therefore, its explanation was sufficient to explain the above-Guidelines sentence. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-21\">Regarding the second step under the \u201cplainly unreasonableness\u201d standard, Dicicco challenges the reasonableness of her sentence. Along that line, the court im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>plicitly based its sentencing determination on the relevant sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). Although, as the court acknowledged, the sentence was outside the advisory Guidelines sentencing range of three to nine months, its weighing of the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a) is entitled to deference. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating a reviewing court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance\u201d). Moreover, a revocation sentence of 24-months of imprisonment was permitted by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Our court has routinely affirmed revocation sentences like Dicicco\u2019s, that are above the advisory range, but do not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>See Warren, </em>720 F.3d at 332 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b254-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
