We review a district .court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) <em>de novo, </em>\u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003) (per cu-riam). \u201c[A] complaint must ... contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all material elements of a cause of action.\u201d <em>Snow v. DirecTV, Inc., </em>450 F.3d 1314, 1320 (11th Cir.2006). We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings because we hold them to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Mr. Green originally \u00f1led a complaint in Florida state court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections (the \u201cSecretary\u201d), alleging deliberate indifference to serious medical needs arising from his back injuries. The Secretary then removed the complaint to federal court and moved to require Mr. Green to refile his complaint on an approved form for prisoner civil rights cases. The magistrate judge considered this motion in tandem with its initial screening of the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Upon screening the complaint, the magistrate judge found that it failed to allege facts sufficient to show what each defendant did that would support a claim against that defendant. The magistrate judge granted the Secretary\u2019s motion and instructed Mr. Green to file an amended complaint remedying the defects. Instead, Mr. Green filed an amended complaint with even less detail than his original complaint, including no factual allegations whatsoever as to the deficient medical treatment he alleged that he received in his initial complaint. Thus, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that dismissal was appropriate, and the district court adopted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">We agree with the magistrate judge and the district court that the amended complaint falls far short of stating a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983. The amended complaint contains no factual allegations as to any defendant, despite the magistrate judge\u2019s instruction to Mr. Green to provide such details. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-9\">. As in any \"civil action in which a prisoner seeks redress against a governmental entity or its employee,\u201d Mr. Green\u2019s complaint was initially subject to review \"as soon as practicable after docketing\" \u2014 here, by the magistrate judge \u2014 to determine whether it \"fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(a), (b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b678-14\">. Mr. Green's motion to appoint counsel is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
