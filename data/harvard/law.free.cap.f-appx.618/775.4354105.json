We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Scott does not dispute that she waived her rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) during an interview following her altercation with the alleged victim. Nonetheless, she contends that her conviction should be reversed because the prosecution highlighted her failure to return to provide a written statement to a law enforcement investigator and her pretrial failure to claim that she had acted in self-defense. <em>See Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">We review for plain error the claim pertaining to pretrial silence. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 62-63, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). By answering the investigating officer\u2019s questions after waiving her <em>Miranda </em>rights, Scott made \u201cfair game [of] both [her] answers and omissions.\u201d <em>United States v. Vargas, </em>580 F.3d 274, 277 n. 1 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 763, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987). If a defendant chooses <em>to </em>talk, \u201cwhat he says or omits is to be judged on its merits or demerits.\u201d <em>Vargas, </em>580 F.3d at 277 n. 1 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see United States v. Pando Franco, </em>503 F.3d 389, 397 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-11\">Scott\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver remained effective unless \u201ccontradicted by an invocation\u201d of the right. <em>Berghuis v. Thompkins, </em>560 U.S. 370, 384, 130 S.Ct. 2250, 176 L.Ed.2d 1098 (2010). Scott does not contend, and nothing in the record shows, that she unambiguously and unequivocally invoked the right to remain silent after having waived it. <em>See id. </em>Thus, with regard to any <em>Doyle </em>claims pertaining to testimony (and any prosecutorial comments thereon) concerning a claim of self-defense, there is no plain error because Scott has failed to demonstrate any \u201cerror at all.\u201d <em>United States v. Teuschler, </em>689 F.3d 397, 400 (5th Cir.2012).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-12\">Even assuming arguendo that' it was error to allow mention of Scott\u2019s omissions in and after her Mirandized interview, such an error was not plain. <em>See Vargas, </em>580 F.3d 274, 277; <em>see also United States v. Fambro, </em>526 F.3d 836, 847 (5th Cir.2008) (characterizing as \u201cnot clear\u201d circuit law regarding <em>Doyle </em>error in cases in which the right to remain silent was waived). If circuit law is unclear, then whether the prosecutor crossed the <em>Doyle </em>line by highlighting Scott\u2019s pretrial reticence about self-defense following her waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights would be a matter \u201csubject to reasonable dispute.\u201d <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 377-78 (5th Cir.2009). A reasonable dispute precludes a conclusion of plain error. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number><em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>Ellis, </em>564 F.3d at 377-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Because there was no error, plain or otherwise, in connection with the claim concerning the questioning of the investigator about whether Scott returned to provide a written statement, we need not determine what standard of review applies. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525 (5th Cir.2008). There, was no violation of <em>Doyle </em>because the investigator did not answer the question, the jury was instructed to ignore unanswered questions, and the question itself did not necessarily comment on the exercise of the right to remain silent. <em>See Miller, </em>483 U.S. at 763, 107 S.Ct. 3102; <em>United States v. Carter, </em>953 F.2d 1449, 1466 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Nor is reversal warranted on the notion that the district court committed cumulative errors resulting in a miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Delgado, </em>672 F.3d 320, 343-4 (5th Cir.2012) (en banc). The <em>Doyle </em>claims are explained above, and the two remaining claims of error \u2014 concerning the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to impeach Scott through testimony offered by an emergency medical technician and the district court\u2019s rulings in connection with Scott\u2019s cross-examination of the victim \u2014 are unsupported by the record. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>334 F.3d 406, 411 (5th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. York, </em>888 F.2d 1050, 1056 (5th Cir.1989). There are thus no errors to accumulate. <em>See Delgado, </em>672 F.3d at 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b798-13\">. We also note that Scott represented in the district court that she had no objection to testimony about what happened in her Miran-dized interview. <em>Cf. United States v.
