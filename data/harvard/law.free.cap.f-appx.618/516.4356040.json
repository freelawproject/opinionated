On appeal, the Petitioners argue first that the BIA erred in denying their applications for asylum. They argue that the harm Maciene suffered in Lithuania, including being beaten and raped by her first husband, rose to the level of persecution, and that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution because the government of Lithuania is unwilling or unable to protect her from him. They contend that these facts qualify both her and Macys for asylum. Second, the Petitioners argue that the BIA erred in denying Maciene\u2019s application for withholding of removal. They argue that the evidence in the record undermines the IJ and the BIA\u2019s determination that changed conditions in Lithuania rebutted any presumption that Ma-ciene\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened if she returned. Finally, the Petitioners argue that the BIA erred in denying Ma-cys\u2019s application for withholding of removal because, if returned to Lithuania, Macys will suffer persecution on account of Ma-ciene\u2019s membership in a particular social group.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, unless the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). When the BIA explicitly agrees with the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ as to those issues. <em>Ayala v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>605 F.3d 941, 948 (11th Cir.2010). If the BIA declines to address an IJ\u2019s alternative basis for a conclusion, the alternative basis is not an issue before us for review. <em>See Martinez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1219, 1221 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">We review our subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). An alien seeking asylum must file her application within one year of her arrival in the United States, or show that changed or extraordinary circumstances warrant consideration of an untimely application. INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), (a)(2)(D). Moreover, the INA precludes judicial review of an agency determination regarding the timeliness of an asylum application, including a determination that an applicant failed to show changed or extraordinary circumstances. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to. review the BIA\u2019s decisions as to whether an alien complied with the one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>year time limit for filing an asylum application or whether extraordinary circumstances justified an untimely filing. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of the Petitioners\u2019 asylum applications on the basis that they were untimely. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ruiz, </em>479 F.3d at 765. Therefore, we dismiss the petition for review as to their asylum claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">We may not review a final order <em>of </em>removal unless \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). If a petitioner has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies by not raising an issue in her notice of appeal or appeal brief to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim. <em>Amayar-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006). To properly exhaust a claim, the alien must raise the issue in such a way as to give the agency a \u201cfull opportunity\u2019 to consider the claim and compile a record adequate for judicial review. <em>Id. </em>at 1250 (quotation omitted). We have explained that to adequately raise a claim before the BIA, a petitioner need only argue the \u201ccore issue.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1228 n. 3 (11th Cir.2008). Thus, exhaustion \u201cis not a stringent requirement,\u201d and it does not require a petitioner to use precise legal terminology or provide a well-developed argument to support her claim. <em>Indrawati v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>779 F.3d 1284, 1297 (11th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-16\">Whether an alien is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal is a factual determination that we review under the substantial-evidence test. <em>Imelda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 724, 727 (11th Cir.2010). The substantial-evidence test applies to a determination that changed country conditions negate a presumption that the alien will be persecuted if returned to her country of origin. <em>See id. </em>at 727-33; <em>Mehmeti v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1196, 1199-1200 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-18\">Under the substantial-evidence test, we view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en </em>banc). We must affirm the decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We may reverse \u201conly when the record compels a reversal; the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough;\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our inquiry is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and we consider \u201conly whether there is substantial evidence for the findings made by the BIA, <em>not </em>whether there is substantial evidence for some <em>other </em>finding that could have been, but was not, made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The substantial-evidence test does not allow us to reweigh the importance attributed to specific evidence in the record. <em>Djonda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1168, 1175 (11th Cir.2008). The record compels a reversal only when there is \u201cno reasonable basis\u201d for the decision. <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1029.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">To qualify <em>for </em>withholding <em>of </em>removal, an applicant must establish that her life or freedom would be threatened in her country of origin on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that she would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be persecuted upon being returned to her country of origin. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number><em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). This burden may be satisfied in two ways. First, an alien may establish past persecution based on a statutorily protected ground. <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 437 (11th Cir.2004). Past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to her country. <em>Id. </em>Second, an alien is entitled to withholding of removal if she establishes a future threat to her life or freedom in her country on account of a protected ground. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">If the alien demonstrates past persecution, the government can rebut the presumption that her life or freedom would be threatened upon return to her country by showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) \u201c[tjhere has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened on account of\u2019 a protected ground; or (2) \u201c[t]he applicant could avoid a future threat to ... her life or freedom by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal and, under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d <em>Imelda, </em>611 F.3d at 728 (brackets and ellipsis in original) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Although we have declined to fashion a bright line rule for what constitutes a fundamental change in circumstances, we have explained that the change must be one that is sufficient to rebut the presumption that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened upon her return to her home country. <em>Id. </em>at 729. The BIA is permitted to rely heavily on Department of State reports when making this determination as long as it does not fail to account for the unique circumstances of an applicant\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at' 728-29. Indeed, \u201c[gleneral information about the conditions in a given country are only useful to the extent that they comment upon or are relevant to the highly specific question of whether <em>this individual </em>has suffered or is likely to suffer persecution in a country.\u201d <em>Seek v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>663 F.3d 1356, 1368 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">In <em>Imelda, </em>we concluded that the country report for Indonesia did not support the BIA\u2019s determination that the government had rebutted the applicant\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. 611 F.3d at 733. In that case, the applicant had established past persecution on account of her religion (Christianity) and her ethnicity (Chinese). <em>Id. </em>at 726-27. However, the country report did not address whether conditions for Christians in the applicant\u2019s home province or the country in general had improved, and, for the two provinces about which it reported improvements, it still detailed significant acts of violence directed at Christians. <em>Id. </em>at 731-32. Moreover, although the country report stated that harassment directed at ethnic Chinese \u201ccontinued to decline from previous years,\u201d it did not provide any basis to measure the extent of that decline. <em>Id. </em>at 732-33. Thus, we held that the improvements discussed in the country report did not rebut the presumption of a future threat to the applicant\u2019s life or freedom. <em>Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">On the other hand, the petitioner in <em>Mehmeti </em>argued that the BIA erred when it relied solely on the country report to conclude that the government had rebutted his presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution in Albania. 572 F.3d at 1198-99. Nevertheless, we held that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that changed country conditions in Albania rebutted the presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s determination that changed conditions in Lithuania rebut any presumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>that Maeiene would be persecuted if she were removed. In particular, there was evidence that Lithuania passed its first law on protection'against domestic violence in 2011, which required police to investigate reports of domestic violence even if the victim did not press charges, and that after passage of this law, police investigations of domestic violence increased substantially. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Maciene\u2019s claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Whether an alien has suffered past persecution is a factual finding that we review under the substantial-evidence test. <em>See Kazemzadeh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>577 F.3d 1341, 1350, 1352-53 (11th Cir.2009) (applying the substantial-evidence test in considering whether prior incidents rose to the level of past persecution); <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290-92 (11th Cir.2006) (applying the substantial-evidence test to an IJ\u2019s determination that the petitioner had failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution and noting that the petitioner\u2019s five-day detention did not <em>\u201ccompel </em>the conclusion that he experienced past persecution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d and requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1229, 1231 (quotation omitted) (concluding that threats against an asylum applicant, her brother, and her university group were mere harassment not amounting to persecution). \u201cMinor physical abuse and brief detentions do not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Kazemzadeh, </em>577 F.3d at 1353. In determining whether an applicant has suffered past persecution, the factfinder must consider the cumulative effects of any alleged incidents. <em>See Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 861 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Furthermore, unlike the asylum statute, the withholding-of-removal statute does not provide derivative benefits to spouses. <em>Id. </em>at 862. Accordingly, \u201cthere are no derivative benefits associated with a grant of withholding of removal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Macys did not establish that he would more likely than not face persecution on account of a protected ground if he returned to Lithuania. First, Macys never alleged he was a member of a particular soeial group, but rather claimed he was entitled to relief because of Ma-ciene\u2019s membership in a particular social group. But because there are no derivative benefits under the withholding-of-removal statute, Macys must establish persecution on account of his own membership in a particular social group. Second, the record does not compel a finding that the mistreatment Macys suffered or would more likely than not suffer in the future from Maciene\u2019s ex-husband constitutes persecution. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review as to Macys\u2019s claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">Upon review of the entire record, and after consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we dismiss the petition in part and deny the petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
