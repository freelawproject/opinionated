Nurse, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal with prejudice of his amended complaint, which asserted 21 claims against the Sheraton Atlanta Hotel, Walden University, and two university employees, including alleged violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d; Title IX of the Education' Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681-1688; and the Age Discrimination Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6101-6107. After a careful review of the record and Mr. Nurse\u2019s brief, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">A magistrate judge granted Mr. Nurse leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but noted that because he was proceeding IFP, his initial complaint was subject to <em>sua sponte </em>review prior to service of process under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1916(e)(2). <em>See </em>D.E. 11. The magistrate judge ruled that Mr. Nurse\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and was an impermissible shotgun pleading. 'Accordingly, the magistrate judge ordered Mr. Nurse to amend his complaint within 14 days-, and provided Mr. Nurse with specific, detailed instructions on how to \u2022 remedy the complaint\u2019s deficiencies. Mr. Nurse was instructed to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-14\">(1) address the shortcomings noted [in the order]; (2) comply with the pleading requirements of Rules 8 and 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; (3) include a factual background section setting forth <em>specific </em>factual allegations in support of [his] claims which directly pertain to [his] case; (4) identify by reference with specific factual allegations and acts by the Defendants supporting] each cause of action within each count of [his] Complaint; (5) clearly specify which Defendant is responsible for the alleged unlawful acts referenced within the Complaint; (6) clearly indicate the Defendant or Defendants against whom [he] is bringing each cause of action and fully identify each Defendant\u2019s role with regard to any alleged cause of action; .(7) clearly identify by specific reference the federal, state or local law or laws within each cause of action asserted by [him]; and (8) exclude all generalized and immaterial facts, statement and allegations not specifically related to [his] claims of relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 7-8 (emphasis original). The magistrate judge concluded by cautioning Mr. Nurse that <em>\u201cfailure to timely file his repleaded Complaint and cure the aforementioned deficiencies will result in this Court\u2019s recommendation that [his] case be dismissed with prejudice.\u201d Id. </em>at 8 (emphasis original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">Mr. Nurse filed an amended complaint, which the district court ruled was untimely. <em>See </em>D.E. 17 at 4. Nonetheless, the district court reviewed Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint and ruled that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>frivolous, <em>see id. </em>at 5-6, and that, \u201clike the original Complaint, [the amended complaint was] a classic shotgun' pleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6-7. Specifically, the district court stated that \u201c[d]ue to the shotgun nature of [Mr. Nurse\u2019s] Amended Complaint, it is virtually impossible ... to ascertain the facts intended tp support each claim for relief, and any such effort to do so derails the Court\u2019s obligation to administer justice in an orderly, efficient, and effective manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The district court went on to note that Mr. Nurse attempted to amend his complaint three times, but \u201crepeatedly failed to comply with Rules 8 and 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">The district court ruled that Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint \u201csuffers from many of the same deficiencies cited in [the magistrate\u2019s] dismissal ... of the original Complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -6. The district court dismissed Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice and subsequently entered judgment dismissing the action as frivolous \u201cpursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 1915A.\u201d [D.E. 18.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">Because we may affirm on any of the grounds set forth by the district court, we first address the dismissal of Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint for failure to comply with court rules and a court order. We review such an order for abuse of discretion. <em>See Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V MONADA, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005). We have explained that under this deferential standard of review, we will not disturb a district court\u2019s ruling \u201cunless we find that the district court [ ] made a clear error of judgment, or [ ] applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Guideone Elite Ins. Co. v. Old Cutler Presbyterian Church, Inc., </em>420 F.3d 1317, 1325 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-10\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">District courts \u201cpossess[] the inherent power to police [their] dockets.\u201d <em>Mingo v. Sugar Cane Growers Co-op. of Fla., </em>864 F.2d 101, 102 (11th Cir.1989). Included within this inherent power is the authority to \u201cimpose formal sanctions upon dilatory litigants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The sanctions available to a district court \u201crange from a simple reprimand to an order dismissing the action <em>with or ivithout prejudice.\u201d Mingo, </em>864 F.2d at 102 (emphasis added). <em>See also Goforth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe court\u2019s power to dismiss is an inherent aspect of its authority to enforce its orders and insure prompt disposition of lawsuits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">We have recognized that dismissal with prejudice is an extreme sanction, which should be employed as a last resort. <em>See Goforth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535. Dismissal with prejudice may be appropriate, however, in cases where, as here, the party, as opposed to the party\u2019s lawyer, is culpable. <em>See Betty K Agencies, </em>432 F.3d at 1337. \u201c[Dismissal with prejudice, ... sua sponte, ... may be properly imposed <em>only </em>when: (1) a party engages in a clear pattern of delay or willful contempt (contumacious conduct); and (2) the district court specifically finds that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>1338 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Nevertheless, we have occasionally \u201cfound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>implicit in an order the conclusion that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Min-go, </em>-864 F.2d at 102 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). <em>See also Go-forth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535 (\u201cThe record also supports an implicit finding that any lesser sanction than dismissal would not have served the interests of justice.\u201d); <em>Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 484 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that a district court need not explicitly consider lesser sanctions and reject them in order to dismiss with prejudice). Importantly, we have explained that \u201cdismissal upon disregard of an order, especially where the litigant has been forewarned, generally is not an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989) (involving a <em>pro se </em>litigant who \u201cstubbornly violated the Federal Rules and court orders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">A shotgun pleading is one where \u201cit is virtually impossible to know which allegations of fact are intended to support which claim(s) for relief.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Diet. Bd. of Trs. of Cent. Fla. Cmty. Coll., </em>77 F.3d 364, 366 (11th Cir.1996). \u201cSuch pleadings divert already stretched judicial resources into disputes that are not structurally prepared to use those resources efficiently.\u201d <em>Wagner v. First Horizon Pharm. Corp., </em>464 F.3d 1273, 1279 (11th Cir.2006). We have condemned shotgun pleadings for decades. <em>See Davis v. Cocar-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., </em>516 F.3d 955, 979, 985 n. 54 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[Sjince 1985 we have explicitly condemned shotgun pleadings upward of fifty times.\u201d). Where, as here, \u201cthe plaintiff fails to comply with the court\u2019s order \u2014 by filing a repleader with the same deficiency \u2014 the court should strike his pleading or, depending on the circumstances, dismiss his case and consider the imposition of monetary sanctions.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1133 (11th Cir.2001), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &amp; Indem. Co., </em>553 U.S. 639, 128 S.Ct. 2131, 170 L.Ed.2d 1012 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-6\">\u2022 The magistrate judge provided Mr. Nurse with specific, detailed instructions on how to remedy the deficiencies of his complaint and directed him to the applicable Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance. Rather than Jieed this advice, however, Mr. Nurse filed an amended complaint that is just as confusing as his initial complaint and four times as long. From our point of view, the magistrate judge\u2019s and the district court\u2019s characterization of Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint as a shotgun complaint is fitting. Indeed, it is a far cry from the \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim,\u201d required by Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, it is an 18-page hodgepodge of allegations and defendants that we cannot reasonably decipher. <em>See </em>D.E. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">The amended complaint contains 21 counts alleging violations of Title YI of the -'Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, unfair business practices, \u201cmalfeasance and continuous mi-sandry,\u201d fraud of federal student loans, breach of confidentiality, slander and libel, \u201ctaunting and teasing the plaintiff after he filed his lawsuit,\u201d cruel and unusual punishment, false advertising, malicious prosecution, \u201cconspiracy to destroy plaintiffs education and lifestyle,\u201d infliction of emotional distress, failing to protect plaintiff from bullying and hate crimes, and violations of the Fourteenth Amendment \u2014 to name but a few.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-8\">History teaches us that \u201cunless cases are pled clearly and precisely, ... [a] trial court\u2019s docket becomes unmanageable, the litigants suffer, and society loses confidence in the court\u2019s ability to administer justice.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>77 F.3d at 367. Filing a lawsuit is a serious matter, which often' times results in significant conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>quences to the parties. And judicial resources are far too scarce to be exploited by litigants who, after being specifically advised about how to correct their errors and warned that failing to do so will result in dismissal with prejudice, continue in their recalcitrance. <em>See </em>Wagner; 464 F.3d at 1279. On this record, and in light of Mr. Nurse\u2019s failure to heed the magistrate judge\u2019s explicit guidance, we are hard-pressed to see how allowing Mr. Nurse to amend his complaint a third time would have yielded a more intelligible pleading. Accordingly, we conclude that district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice. <em>See Kuehl v. F.D.I.G., </em>8 F.3d 905, 908 (1st Cir.1993) (affirming dismissal with prejudice of <em>pro se </em>plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint where plaintiffs failed to follow magistrate judge\u2019s instructions). <em>See also Moon, </em>863 F.2d at 837.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">As noted above, the magistrate judge granted Mr. Nurse leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>A district court shall dismiss an IFP complaint at any time if it determines that the action or appeal (i) is frivolous or malicious; (ii) fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted; or (iii) seeks monetary relief against a defendant who is immune from such relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). A similar provision appears in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, but that provision applies to only civil actions in which a prisoner seeks redress from a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">The judgment states that the amended complaint was dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, but that provision is inapplicable because Mr. Nurse was not a prisoner and did not seek redress from a governmental entity. Therefore, although we affirm the district court\u2019s order, we vacate the judgment, in part, and remand <em>sua sponte </em>for the limited purpose of correcting the clerical error in the judgment. <em>See United States v. Campos-Diaz, </em>472 F.3d 1278, 1280 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Mr. Nurse\u2019s amended complaint with prejudice, vacate the judgment, and remand for the district court to correct its citation in the judgment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">. The appellees were not served with Mr. Nurse\u2019s complaint or amended complaint in i the district court, and consequently did not \u00a1file a responsive brief on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">. The district court\u2019s docket indicates that Mr. Nurse filed two motions for leave to amend his initial complaint, <em>see </em>D.E. 9 &amp; 10, prior to the magistrate judge\u2019s order putting Mr. Nurse on notice that his initial complaint was deficient and warning him that failure to cure the deficiencies could result in dismissal with prejudice. See D.E. 11. Mr. Nurse\u2019s motions for leave to .amend include memoranda in support of the motions, which, like his complaint, amended complaint, and brief on appeal, are difficult to decipher.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
