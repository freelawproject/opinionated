According to Perez, none of the employees of Action E-File Services testified that he trained or encouraged anyone to commit tax fraud or that they observed him commit the crimes alleged in the counts of conviction; the testimony of taxpayers for whom he prepared returns was insufficient to show that he willingly violated federal tax laws; and the taxpayers\u2019 testimony was not credible because they received \u201cconsideration\u201d as the Government stated it did not intend to prosecute them. Perez further asserts that the jury\u2019s decision was not rational because the evidence on the counts of conviction was materially indistinguishable from the counts on which he was acquitted. In a similar vein, he asserts that the evidence against his codefendant, Carolyn Clark, was more incriminating than any evidence presented against him, but the jury acquitted Clark on all but one count. Finally, Perez maintains that reversal of his convictions is required because of the \u201cequipoise rule,\u201d that the evidence tends to give equal or nearly equal circumstantial support to a theory of guilt or a theory of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>This court reviews de novo a properly preserved challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>United States v. McElwee, </em>646 F.3d 328, 340 (5th Cir.2011). Evidence is sufficient to support a conviction \u201cif a reasonable trier of fact could conclude ... the elements of the offense were established beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and drawing all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>498 F.3d 308, 312 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To establish that Perez aided and assisted in the preparation of false and fraudulent tax forms, the Government had to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Perez \u201cwillfully aided, assisted, counseled, or advised another in the preparation or presentation under the internal revenue laws of a document that is fraudulent or false as to any material matter.\u201d <em>United States v. Mudekunye, </em>646 F.3d 281, 285 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The evidence was more than sufficient to support Perez\u2019s convictions. Perez presented himself as a professional tax preparer, and his name appeared as the preparer on the tax returns at issue. Perez listed numerous deductions or credits even though the taxpayers testified that they did not incur the expenses, did not discuss the expenses with Perez, and did not provide the figures or documentation to support the expenses to Perez. These included education credits and deductions for charitable donations and unreimbursed employee expenses. The false information was material as the taxpayers received tax refunds. Perez also cautioned one-Action employee, Veronica Torres, that the numbers she used on tax returns would be suspicious if the claimed amounts were not proportionate to the taxpayer\u2019s income. A rational jury could infer from this evidence that Perez acted willfully to aid or assist in the preparation and presentation of false or fraudulent tax returns. Although Perez asserts he acted in good faith, he has not identified any specific evidence in support of this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Perez\u2019s argument that the taxpayer witnesses were not credible because they had agreements with the Government fails as Perez has not shown that the testimony was incredible on its face. See <em>United States v. Shoemaker, </em>746 F.3d 614, 623 (5th Cir.2014). The jury had the sole responsibility for determining the credibility of the witnesses. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Contrary to Perez\u2019s argument, we do not consider the jury\u2019s rejection of certain counts in determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support Perez\u2019s convictions. <em>See United States v. Parks, </em>68 F.3d 860, 865 (5th Cir.1995). Further, we have abrogated the \u201cequipoise rule\u201d cited by Perez. <em>See United States v. Vargas-Ocampo, </em>747 F.3d 299, 301-02 (5th Cir.2014) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b263-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
