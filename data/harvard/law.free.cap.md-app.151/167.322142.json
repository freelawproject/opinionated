It is owned and operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>by Anthony Dwight Triplin and his company, Trip Associates, Inc. The Club has presented adult entertainment, two nights a week, for over two decades. There is no question that that is a lawful non-conforming use of those premises\u2014at least, as we shall see, for two nights a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In April 2000, Triplin received a zoning violation notice for providing this form of entertainment on a portion of the Club\u2019s premises without a license. The notice ordered the Club to discontinue it until one was obtained. The notice was issued by the office of the Zoning Administrator on behalf of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (\u201cthe City\u201d). Triplin demurred, filing an. appeal with the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">After a public hearing, the Board found that Triplin had established a nonconforming use of the premises for adult entertainment but, to Tripliris chagrin, limited that use to no more than its current level of two nights a week. When the Circuit Court for Baltimore City affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, Triplin noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Triplin presents two issues for our review. Reworded, they are:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">I. Whether the Board erred as a matter of law in placing the two nights per week restriction on Triplin\u2019s nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">II. Whether the circuit court erred in deciding, <em>sua sponte, </em>an issue not presented to the Board\u2014namely, whether Triplin was required to obtain an adult entertainment license.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">For the reasons that follow, we shall hold that the Board properly limited the adult entertainment offered by Triplin\u2019s Club to two nights a week, but that the circuit court erred in ordering Triplin to obtain a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Triplin and the City have submitted, with their briefs, a \u201cJoint Statement of the Case in lieu of a Joint Record Ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>tract.\u201d Md. Rule S-dlolb).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to that statement, on April 14, 2000, a Baltimore City zoning inspector issued a \u201cCode Violation Notice And Order\u201d to Anthony Dwight Trip-lin, operator of a nightclub, known as \u201cClub Choices,\u201d and located at 1815-17 N. Charles Street in the B-5-1 Zoning District.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The violation notice was issued for \u201c[u]sing [a] portion of the premises for adult entertainment without first obtaining proper Adult Entertainment Ordinance and Adult Entertainment License.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Aggrieved by the Zoning Administrator\u2019s decision to issue the violation notice, Triplin appealed that decision to the Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In doing so, Triplin sought the Board\u2019s approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>of his use of a \u201cportion of [his] premises for Adult Entertainment.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That appeal was heard by the Board on October 3, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">At that hearing, Anthony Triplin testified that he has owned Club Choices \u201c[s]ince approximately January of 1983\u201d and, from that time on, the Club has continuously presented dancing shows with partial nudity. Moreover, according to Mr. Triplin, the Club had featured adult entertainment for five years before his acquisition of the property. At the time he purchased it, Triplin stated, \u201c[i]t was a nightclub ... with various acts, entertainment acts and also was even doing some nude male and female dancing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Upon purchasing the Club, Triplin made some changes. \u201cI did not want the nudes,\u201d he stated, \u201cso I did exotic a couple of, a couple of hours two times a week and did more like jazz, top 40 bands, comedy, dancing and then later moved into an after-hour use as well.\u201d After the Board approved Triplin\u2019s use of the premises for an after-hours club<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in 1992, he presented exotic dancing exclusively in the after-hours club. At the time of the violation hearing, Triplin\u2019s Club offered adult entertainment two nights a week: every Wednesday and Friday night for two hours each night. Two employees of the Club, Gregory Gee and Charles Watkins, testified that adult entertainment had been presented at the Club before Triplin\u2019s purchase; that after Triplin\u2019s purchase of the Club, stripping with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>full nudity was scaled back to exotic dancing with partial nudity; and that the Club has presented exotic dancing with partial nudity two nights a week since 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">After the hearing, the Board, on October 12, 2000, found that \u201ca nonconforming use of the premises for adult entertainment had been established prior to Ordinance 443 (adult entertainment business approved December 15, 1994) and may be continued under section 13-402 of the Zoning Code.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">On October 27, 2000, Triplin filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, requesting judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. After a hearing, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. Unhappy with that result, Triplin filed a motion for reconsideration, claiming that the circuit court\u2019s affirmance was based on its review of the wrong Board decision. Triplin claimed that \u201c[t]he court appeared to be reviewing and considering an earlier decision of the Board of March 9, 1992 and not the decision of October 12, 2000 in reaching its decision.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On June 14, 2001, the circuit court held a second hearing. Following that hearing, the court found that the Board had the authority to impose the two nights per week restriction on Triplin\u2019s use of the premises for adult entertainment. In addition, the court ruled that \u201c[Triplin] must apply for and obtain all necessary and relevant licenses required by the City for the operation of an adult entertainment business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Triplin then filed a motion to revise, claiming that the court erred in interpreting \u201cthe various zoning ordinances in question.\u201d Specifically, he asserted that the circuit court had \u201cconfused, in a fundamental way, the concept of non-conforming use and conditional use\u201d in stating that \u201cthe Board found a non-conforming conditional use of the premises for adult entertainment.\u201d On August 15, 2001, the circuit court conducted another hearing to address that issue. After that hearing, the court issued an opinion affirming the Board\u2019s decision for the third and last time. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The Board\u2019s decision to restrict the Club\u2019s presentation of adult entertainment to its present level of adult entertainment to two nights a week is, Triplin claims, \u201cplain error as a matter of law.\u201d According to Triplin, the Board\u2019s decision \u201chas the effect of vitiating Triplin\u2019s non-conforming use and constitutes an impermissible restriction of Triplin\u2019s constitutional right to continue the use of the premises that has existed for many years.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Title 13 of the Baltimore City Zoning Code (2000) \u201cprovides for the regulation of nonconforming uses and noncomplying structures\u201d in Baltimore City. A \u201cnonconforming use\u201d is defined by that title as <em>\u201cany lawfully existing use </em>of a structure or of land that does not conform to the applicable use regulations of the district in which it is located.\u201d City Zoning Code \u00a7 13-101(c) (emphasis added). And a \u201cuse\u201d is defined by the Zoning Code as: \u201c(1) any purpose for which a building, other structure, or tract of land can be used or occupied; and (2) any activity, occupation, business, or operation that is earned on or intended to be carried on in a building or other structure or on a tract of land.\u201d \u00a7 1-196.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Triplin\u2019s club is a Class III non-conforming use,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under \u00a7 13-609. That section states that \u201c[a]ny adult-entertainment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>business <em>existing on September 10, 1993 </em>is considered a nonconforming use, subject to all Class III regulations.\u201d (emphasis added). That would, it is undisputed, include Triplin\u2019s club.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">But the issue before us is not whether Triplin\u2019s club is a non-conforming use but whether the use of the club for adult entertainment may be limited to two nights. To answer that question, we turn to \u00a7 13-406 of the Zoning Code. That section provides that \u201cexcept as authorized by the Board under Subtitle 7 {\u2019\u2019Modifications and Continuances by Board\u201d} a Class III nonconforming use <em>may not be expanded in any manner.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). In limiting the presentation of adult entertainment by the club to its present level, the Board interpreted this prohibition against expanding a non-conforming use to include a temporal expansion of such a use. As an \u201cinterpretation and application\u201d of a law which the Board administers, that decision must be given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d <em>Board. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Once that is done, we are constrained to conclude that the Board\u2019s restriction on expanding the hours of adult entertainment at the club is permitted by that section of the Baltimore City Zoning Code. In other words, the Board\u2019s decision to limit future temporal expansions of adult entertainment by the Club was plainly not error, as Triplin claims, but in fact was consistent with the \u201cexpansion\u201d proscription of \u00a7 13-406.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Moreover, the Board\u2019s finding that the adult entertainment offered by Triplin never exceeded more than two nights a week was supported by the evidence presented. Two employees of the Club, Gregory Gee and Charles Watkins, testified that partial nude dancing had been presented by the Club two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>nights a week since 1983. Triplin gave similar testimony. Therefore, the Board\u2019s decision, in effect, allowed Triplin to continue to do what he had done since he acquired the club in 1983\u2014present partial nude dancing at his club two nights a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Furthermore, the Board\u2019s decision is consistent with Maryland\u2019s general and well-established policy against the expansion of nonconforming uses. \u201cWhether a nonconforming use can be changed, extended, enlarged, altered, repaired, restored, or recommenced after abandonment ordinarily is governed by the provisions of the applicable local ordinances and regulations.\u201d <em>County Council v. Gardner, Inc., </em>293 Md. 259, 268, 443 A.2d 114 (1982). But \u201c[t]hese local ordinances must be strictly construed in order to effectuate the purpose of eliminating nonconforming uses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, limitations on the continuance of nonconforming uses are meant \u201cto achieve the ultimate elimination of nonconforming uses through economic attrition and physical obsolescence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Colati v. Jirout, </em>186 Md. 652, 655, 47 A.2d 613 (1946) (\u201c[T]he [Baltimore City] Zoning Ordinance prohibits generally the extension of a non-conforming use except to the portion of the building designed for such use at the time of the passage of the ordinance, and ... the stopping of expansion of a nonconforming use is not an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of governmental power.\u201d); <em>Grant v. Mayor of Balt., </em>212 Md. 301, 307, 129 A.2d 363 (1957) (\u201c[T]he earnest aim and ultimate purpose of zoning was and is to reduce nonconformance to conformance as speedily as possible with due regard to the legitimate interests of all concerned.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Unfortunately, however, there is little Maryland case law on the question of the legality of a temporal expansion of an existing non-conforming use. But what is true of Maryland is not true of other jurisdictions. Indeed, a number of state courts have held, as we do today, that the general policy against the expansion of non-conforming uses applies to temporal expansions as well. <em>See Garb-Ko v. Carrollton Township, </em>86 Mich.App. 350, 272 N.W.2d 654, 655 (1978) (holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that township board could restrict the operating hours of nonconforming grocery store in view of the policy against expansion of nonconforming uses); <em>Inc. Vill. v. Hillside Ave. Rest. Corp., </em>55 A.D.2d 927, 390 N.Y.S.2d 637, 638 (App.Div. 1977) (holding that a nonconforming bar was unlawfully extended when it increased its hours of entertainment from 9:00 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. on weekends, to noon to 4:00 a.m. daily). Or have otherwise held that a non-conforming use may be temporally restricted. <em>See Time-Low Corp. v. City of LaPorte Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>547 N.E.2d 877, 880 (Ind.Ct.App.1989) (holding that zoning board had authority, in approving a change to a nonconforming filling station, to restrict its hours of operation); <em>Cornell Uniforms, Inc. v. Township of Abington, </em>8 Pa.Cmwlth. 317, 301 A.2d 113, 116 (1973) (holding that zoning board had authority to impose condition that nonconforming dry cleaning establishment must operate five days a week, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., since it previously operated within the same time frame).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Notwithstanding the strong legislative and judicial disinclination in Maryland and elsewhere to permit the expansion of non-conforming uses, Triplin claims that the Board\u2019s restriction on expanding the hours in which adult entertainment may be presented by the Club was not only unlawful but unconstitutional as well. In support of that argument, Triplin cites <em>Amereihn v. Kotras, </em>194 Md. 591, 71 A.2d 865 (1950), for the proposition that \u201czoning ordinances are prospective and cannot be used to terminate a valid, existing, non-conforming use of property,\u201d and <em>Mayor of Baltimore v. Dembo, Inc., </em>123 Md.App. 527, 719 A.2d 1007 (1998), for the notion that his nonconforming use of the property is \u201ca vested constitutional right that is entitled to protection as such by the courts.\u201d But Triplin fails to explain how either case advances his cause or, more specifically, casts doubt on the Board\u2019s right to maintain a two-night limit on the Club\u2019s presentation of adult entertainment. That failure is understandable as neither <em>Amereihn </em>nor <em>Dembo </em>even addresses the question of whether a zoning board may impose a temporal limitation on a nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>And finally, Triplin argues that the Board, in deciding this case, may have confused a nonconforming use with a conditional use by imposing \u201cconditions\u201d on Triplin\u2019s continued use of the premises for adult entertainment. In support of this argument, Triplin claims that the language on \u201cpage 3 (paragraph 1) ... is language that is apparently used in all conditional use approvals made by the Board\u201d under \u00a7 14-103 of the Zoning Code. Triplin then cites <em>National Institutes of Health Federal Credit Union v. Hawk, </em>47 Md.App. 189, 422 A.2d 55 (1980), for the proposition that nonconforming uses may not be extended, eliminated, or subjected to \u201cconditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Zoning Code states: \u201cCertain uses exist, however, that, because of their unique characteristics, cannot properly be classified in any particular district without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses on neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. These uses, referred to as \u2018conditional uses\u2019, may only be approved as specified in title.\u201d \u00a7 14-101(b). The Code further provides that the Board or City Council may impose conditions, restrictions, or limitations necessary to: \u201c(1) reduce or minimize any effect of the use on other properties in the neighborhood; (2) secure compliance with the standards and requirements of this title; and (3) better carry out the intent and purposes of this article.\u201d \u00a7 14-103(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">An examination of the Board\u2019s written opinion quickly dispels any notion that it might have confused \u00a7 14-103 with \u00a7 13-402. In that opinion, it is clear that the Board knew that it was dealing with the continuance of a nonconforming use under \u00a7 13-402\u2014not an approval of a conditional use under \u00a7 14-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Moreover, Triplin\u2019s reliance on <em>Hawk </em>is misplaced. In <em>Hawk, </em>at issue was an administrative determination that a credit union\u2019s nonconforming use of a facility as a headquarters was unlawfully extended- to conducting financial transactions on the premises. On appeal, we upheld the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the county board\u2019s decision to revoke a certificate of final inspection and occupancy. 47 Md.App. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>200, 422 A.2d <em>55. </em>In affirming the circuit court, we explained that \u201cMaryland case law permits continuing a nonconforming use, but does not permit the transmogrification of an approved non-conforming use into a new different use. The latter constitutes an unlawful extension, even if there is no outward change in the appearance of the facility being used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We did not state in <em>Hawk, </em>as Triplin contends, that nonconforming uses may not be eliminated, extended, or subjected to conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Before leaving this issue, we feel compelled to address, for the benefit of the circuit court, an issue that was not raised by either party. That issue is whether an increase in the number of nights that adult entertainment can be presented is an \u201cexpansion\u201d of a nonconforming use, requiring approval, or merely an intensification of that use, requiring none. We do so because that issue will no doubt emerge in subsequent litigation between the parties. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131 (a) (An appellate court may decide an issue not raised below \u201cif necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The Court of Appeals has held that while the \u201cbasic premise underlying zoning regulations is to restrict rather than expand nonconforming uses.... [A]n intensification of a nonconforming use is permissible so long as the nature and character of the use is unchanged and substantially the same facilities are used.\u201d <em>Jahnigen v. Staley, 245 </em>Md. 130, 137, 225 A.2d 277 (1967) (citations omitted). That doctrine has been applied by the Court to permit a business to enclose a porch on its premises, <em>Helfrich v. Mongelli, 248 </em>Md. 498, 504, 237 A.2d 454 (1968) ; to boost the amount of equipment available lor rental, <em>Jahnigen, </em>245 Md. at 138, 225 A.2d 277; to store more material on its premises, <em>Feldstein v. Lavale Zoning Board, </em>246 Md. 204, 211, 227 A.2d 731 (1967); and to increase parking on a nonconforming parking lot, <em>Nyburg v. Solmson, </em>205 Md. 150, 161-62, 106 A.2d 483 (1954). But none of these cases involved an expansion of the temporal limits of operation. Each concerned, at most, increasing the amount of business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>performed within an existing temporal framework\u2014in other words, intensifying the use of the premises during existing business hours. Indeed, the Court has not applied this doctrine to an expansion of business hours, with one possible exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">That exception was <em>Green v. Garrett, </em>192 Md. 52, 63, 63 A.2d 326 (1949). More than fifty years ago, in <em>Green, </em>the Court of Appeals upheld an \u201cenlargement\u201d of the use of Baltimore Stadium to include \u201cprofessional baseball games for a considerable period of a year,\u201d calling that increase in the nonconforming use of the Stadium a more frequent use, not an expanded one. But <em>Green </em>is of little precedential value here.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">For one thing, <em>Green </em>was decided before the zoning administrative process was created. Therefore, considerations such as the deference owed an administrative body\u2019s interpretation of its governing statute and the substantial evidence rule played no role in the Court\u2019s decision. And that distinction is of particular significance in this case. As here, we have before us a governing statute, and it emphatically states that \u201cexcept as authorized by the Board under Subtitle 7 {\u2019\u2019Modifications and Continuances by Board\u201d} a Class III nonconforming use <em>may not be expanded in any manner.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). No exception is made for \u201ctemporal expansions.\u201d And consistent with that uncompromising language, the Board has interpreted it to apply to all expansions, temporal or otherwise. Moreover, there is nothing in the language of <em>Green </em>that can be read to prohibit all future efforts to control temporal expansions, and we decline to read such a prohibition into <em>Green </em>now.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">And finally, to hold that a temporal extension of operating hours is an intensification, not an expansion, of a non-conforming use undermines governmental efforts to reconcile public policy with private interest. If we were to so rule, localities would be presented with the harsh choice of either tolerating the growth of an undesirable use or eliminating it altogether. Depriving localities, as such a ruling would, of a milder alternative\u2014that of restricting a nonconforming use to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>current level\u2014benefits neither the regulating locality nor nonconforming property owners, whereas holding, as we do, that the Board had a right to control temporal expansions of use accommodates the interests of both.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Triplin contends that the circuit court erred in ordering Triplin to obtain an adult entertainment license, as that issue had not been either raised or decided below. Triplin further claims that the licensing issue was beyond the authority of the Board because the Board had no authority to address \u201cthe licensing requirement of the adult entertainment ordinances.\u201d We agree that the circuit court erred in ordering Triplin to obtain a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">By ordering Triplin to do so, the circuit court made a decision the Board did not. This it cannot do. A court reviewing an administrative agency decision \u201cmay not pass upon issues presented to it for the first time on judicial review and that are not encompassed in the final decision of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Brodie v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>367 Md. 1, 4, 785 A.2d 747 (2001) (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Campbell, </em>364 Md. 108, 123, 771 A.2d 1051 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">We are not suggesting, however, that this matter should have first been decided by the Board of Municipal and Zoning Appeals, as that agency has no jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation of adult entertainment. In fact, jurisdiction over such matters was transferred, effective May 26, 1999, from the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development to the Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the circuit court erred in ordering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Triplin to obtain a license for adult entertainment business. We therefore vacate the judgment of the circuit court in so far as it ordered Triplin to obtain such a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">ORDER OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REQUIRING THAT APPELLANT OBTAIN AN ADULT ENTERTAINMENT LICENSE VACATED; JUDGMENT OTHERWISE AFFIRMED.
