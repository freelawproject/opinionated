Accordingly, appellant retained T. Joseph Touhey, Esquire, appellee, to represent her in an effort to uncover the full extent of the marital assets and to renegotiate her property settlement agreement with Dr. Al-fert.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Unhappy with appellee\u2019s performance, Vogel discharged Touhey. A few days later, Vogel settled her dispute with Dr. Alfert for $50,000, a fraction of the additional sum she had hoped to recover. Thereafter, appellant filed a legal malpractice suit against Touhey in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, asserting that she had settled her divorce case on unfavorable terms because appellee: 1) failed \u201cto take adequate discovery and investigative efforts to obtain a complete and accurate assessment of the Alferts\u2019 marital assets\u201d; 2) fail[ed] \u201cto properly analyze and evaluate the discovery materials ... produced by Dr. Alfert\u201d; 3) \u201cfail[ed] to employ a competent professional, such as an accountant, to help identify and evaluate the marital assets\u201d; and 4) \u201crecommend[ed] a settlement for an inadequate amount without full knowledge and understanding of the marital assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Appellee filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that appellant\u2019s malpractice suit was barred by the doctrine of judicial estop-pel. In support of his motion, appellee submitted the transcript from the hearing in the divorce case, at which appellant represented that her divorce settlement was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d After the malpractice court (Rowan, J.) granted appel-lee\u2019s motion to dismiss, Vogel noted this appeal. She presents us with a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">Whether Appellant\u2019s lawsuit for legal malpractice ought to have been barred, under the doctrine of judicial estoppel, by her prior statement to the Court, in the underlying divorce hearing, that the marital settlement agreement which had been negotiated by Appellee, and about which she now complains in her malpractice action, was \u201cfair and equitable[,]\u201d where Appellant also complained at the same hearing about Appellee\u2019s lack of diligence in investigating her then husband\u2019s finances, and where she had had an inadequate opportunity, as of the time of the divorce hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>ing, to fully review financial records supplied by her then husband in discovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">FACTUAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Appellant, who is a lawyer, and Dr. Alfert, who is a urologist, were married on January 25,1988; no children were born to the union. The couple separated on June 6,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">On March 6, 1999, appellant and Dr. Alfert entered into a property settlement agreement (the \u201cProperty Agreement\u201d). Appellant, who has worked in the Criminal, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Division of the Justice Department for over seventeen years, was not represented by counsel in connection with the Property Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">The Property Agreement provided for the equal division of the couple\u2019s marital assets, valued at about two million dollars under the Property Agreement. According to appellant, she subsequently discovered that Dr. Alfert had failed to disclose \u201csubstantial [marital] assets\u201d during the negotiation of the Property Agreement, with the intent of depriving her of her fair share of the parties\u2019 assets, and that he had diverted and/or dissipated marital assets. Appellant alleged that the \u201cpile of [marital] assets that should have been divided\u201d amounted to three or four million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Accordingly, on or about January 18, 2001, appellant retained appellee to represent her in the divorce case, then pending in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. She sought legal representation because she \u201cbelieved that [the] \u2018Property Agreement\u2019 executed on March 6, 1999, by her and her then husband was unfair and had been obtained by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>fraudulent misrepresentations, due to [the] lack of full financial disclosure by the husband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">During appellant\u2019s initial consultation with Touhey, she told him that the marital assets totaled \u201csubstantially more\u201d than the two million dollars that had been the subject of the Property Agreement. Appellant asserted that Dr. Alfert failed to divulge various brokerage accounts, bank accounts, and pension funds. Appellant specifically inquired whether appellee \u201chad sufficient time and interest to handle a domestic case that involved thorough investigation and analysis of the parties\u2019 complex financial situation.\u201d Touhey assured appellant that \u201che had sufficient time to devote to such a complex case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">In connection with Touhey\u2019s representation of appellant, the parties executed a retainer agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It provided, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxN\">You [i.e., appellant] seek to contest the validity of a Property Settlement Agreement with your estranged husband entered into [in] 1999. You claim that marital assets were not disclosed or accounted for by him in the preparation of that Agreement which was [prepared] without counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">I [i.e., appellee] have discussed with you candidly the prospects for such a claim and litigation. <em>Obviously, it all depends on the discovery of those assets, and the identity and value of those assets.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">(Emphasis added in the malpractice complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">On February 1, 2001, appellee filed an Amended Counter-Complaint for Absolute Divorce in the underlying divorce case, challenging the Property Agreement. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUl\">[O]n or about March 6, 1999, [appellant and Dr. Alfert] executed a document entitled Property Agreement.... Additionally, despite the fact that this document specifically required both parties to make full financial disclosure of any and all assets, [appellant] has subsequently discovered, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>[Dr. Alfert] withheld disclosure of substantial marital assets, of which he has unjustly deprived [appellant]. [Dr. Alfert] also failed to bargain in good faith and made material misrepresentations to [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Later, when Dr. Alfert opposed appellant\u2019s motion to postpone a hearing in the divorce case, appellee filed a response on appellant\u2019s behalf. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">[Appellant] is challenging the validity of the Property Agreement, based upon [Dr. Alfert\u2019s] failure to disclose substantial marital assets at the time the parties executed the Property Agreement. In order for this issue to be resolved, it is quite apparent, that extensive financial documents must be obtained for numerous marital accounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">In addition, in February 2001, appellee propounded discovery in the divorce case, including interrogatories and a request for production of documents. On or about March 6, 2001, Dr. Alfert responded to the discovery requests. Appellant alleged in the malpractice case that Dr. Alfert\u2019s responses were \u201cincomplete and did not reveal critical information concerning marital assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">According to the malpractice complaint, appellant \u201creviewed Dr. Alfert\u2019s initial responses to the interrogatories and document requests, noted many discrepancies!,] and regularly asked [appellee] questions, both orally and in writing, about specific marital assets.\u201d From February 2001 through April 2001, appellant allegedly made numerous written and oral requests to appellee to obtain more specific financial information from her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">Further, appellant alleged in the malpractice complaint that, in order for her to obtain the information needed to assess the nature and value of the marital assets, \u201cthe requests would have had to be augmented by subpoenas to financial institutions, depositions and analysis by a professional sophisticated in the area of asset identification and evaluation, such as an accountant.\u201d Although appellant \u201crepeatedly requested\u201d that appellee \u201cissue subpoenas to financial institutions,\u201d the appel-lee, she averred, failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>On March 8, 2001, appellee wrote to Dr. Alfert\u2019s lawyer, requesting additional financial information from Dr. Alfert. According to Vogel, appellee \u201ceventually received supplemental answers to interrogatories and additional documents which revealed the existence of previously undisclosed marital assets....\u201d Nevertheless, appellant maintained that Touhey failed to \u201ccarefully review! ] or analyze! ]\u201d the information \u201cin time to have an impact on the ultimate outcome of the [divorce] case.\u201d Appellant also asserted that in March 2001, Touhey was too involved in other cases to devote the necessary time to her case. She alleged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">In or about March of 2001, on information and belief, [appellee] was heavily involved in motions and trial preparation in a high-profile criminal case in Anne Arundel County. From that time on, [appellee] seemed to have little time to spend on [appellant\u2019s] case. Most of the work done on the case, by [appellant\u2019s] observation, was performed by a young associate ... who seemed well-intentioned but clearly had difficulty understanding the complex financial records which had been produced. [The associate] also seemed to have little idea of how to obtain the necessary additional information which [appellant] was regularly requesting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">According to appellant, Dr. Alfert telephoned her in April 2001, asking why she had failed to respond to the settlement offer that had been communicated by his attorney. Appellant responded that she was never informed of the settlement offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">In the meantime, by letter of April 9, 2001, appellee wrote to appellant, advising that \u201cit is essential that we pinpoint the specific marital assets which you contend were hidden from you at the time of the 1998[sic] Separation Agreement.\u201d Touhey also asked appellant to \u201cprovide ... a list of each and every account or asset which you contend was not properly disclosed or divided at the time of separation.\u201d By letter of April 16, 2001, appellant provided a list of the various bank and investment accounts about which she had questions. According to appellant, neither appellee nor his associate ever answered her questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>In a letter of April 25, 2001, appellee provided appellant with copies of Dr. Alfert\u2019s supplemental answers to interrogatories, along with a settlement proposal from Dr. Alfert\u2019s attorney. The letter of April 25, 2001 stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">Enclosed please [find the] April 11, 2001 correspondence from [Dr. Alfert\u2019s counsel] which is self-explanatory.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Please review the supplemental Answers to Interrogatories and the settlement proposal and contact me to discuss.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Appellant claimed that she did not receive the documents until after a meeting with appellee and his law associate on April 26, 2001. At that meeting, appellee advised appellant that, based on his evaluation of the discovery materials received from Dr. Alfert, he recommended that she settle the divorce litigation for $50,000, i.e., $50,000 in excess of the assets she was to receive pursuant to the 1999 Property Agreement. Vogel authorized appellee to proceed. By facsimile sent on Thursday April 26, 2001, appellee\u2019s associate conveyed a $50,000 settlement demand to Dr. Alfert\u2019s counsel. The letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">This is to confirm that [appellant] has authorized me to offer the following settlement which would fully and finally resolve all matters between our clients:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">1. Mr. Alfert would make a payment in the amount of $50,000 to [appellant] as an adjustment of the partiesf] marital property. This is a non-negotiable sum and we do not invite counter-offers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">2. Each party would then keep all assets currently titled in their name and in their possession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">3. Each party would be responsible for their own attorney\u2019s fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">4. The parties would proceed to final uncontested divorce based upon a written separation agreement on these terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Please contact me promptly with your response so that we may avoid further attorney\u2019s fees and court filing. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">By return facsimile that same day, Dr. Alfert accepted appellant\u2019s settlement demand. As an attorney, appellant believed that once Dr. Alfert accepted her demand, a binding contract was created. However, the facsimiles of both appellant and Dr. Alfert made clear that a written settlement agreement was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">On April 30, 2001, appellant proceeded to appellee\u2019s office to retrieve the documents pertinent to her divorce case. At that time, appellant \u201cfound a large box\u201d in a storage room, with her name on it, which contained supplemental documents submitted by her husband during discovery. Vogel alleged in the malpractice complaint that, until then, she did not know that Dr. Alfert had produced the documents. According to appellant, the box contained \u201chundreds of pages of materials,\u201d which were \u201ctotally disorganized.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]here was no sign they had ever been reviewed\u201d by appellee. Indeed, she claimed that \u201cit was apparent from their disorganized state that [the documents] had never been carefully reviewed or analyzed by [appellee], his associate, an accountant or anybody else.\u201d And, appellant insisted that she lacked \u201cthe time, or the financial acumen, to review, organize and digest the contents . ... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Following appellant\u2019s discovery of the documents, she promptly terminated appellee\u2019s representation in the divorce case, notwithstanding the impending hearing scheduled for May 4, 2001. By letter of May 3, 2001, appellee wrote to appellant: \u201cIn accordance with your instructions to withdraw as counsel of record in your case in the Montgomery County Circuit Court, we enclose herewith [the] appropriate Motion and your direction to us.\u201d Consequently, appellant appeared without an attorney at the hearing on May 4, 2001, which was conducted by a domestic relations master. The following exchange is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>THE COURT:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Okay. And, ma\u2019am? Your name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AED\">[APPELLANT]: Karen Alfert, and I\u2019m representing myself <em>pro se.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-5\">THE COURT: Yes. Now, is that your intention in this proceeding, that you represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-6\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">THE COURT: ... And have you discharged your attorney from representation, from representing you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">Have you terminated his services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\">THE COURT: Okay. One of the things, there is in the file\u2014it was filed on May 1, 2001\u2014a line from you to the Clerk saying \u201cI\u2019m requesting the withdrawal of T. Joseph Toohey [sic], Esq. as counsel for Karen Vogel Alfert in the above referenced matter by fax this date.[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">\u201cI will request Mr. Toohey [sic] to withdraw as my counsel and to file the appropriate documents with the Circuit Court. [\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">\u201cUntil new counsel is retained, I will represent myself pro se,\u201d and that is signed by you, I believe? So this is something you filed with the court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-13\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-15\">THE COURT: ... Mr. Toohey [sic] did not file anything with the court now to formally withdraw his appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-16\">We have contacted his office this morning. My secretary contacted his office, and we were informed that he is in court in Anne Arundel County or in Annapolis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0j\">[APPELLANT]: I called yesterday and was told that he was out of town.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>THE COURT: Or something. Okay. Were you calling him yesterday to see if he was coming here for you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aau\">[APPELLANT]: Actually, I called several times this week to talk to him, and he hasn\u2019t returned my calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">THE COURT: All right, but is that about him no longer representing you, or to have him represent you, or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0WW\">[APPELLANT]: Well, I think mostly to find out where things stand with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">[APPELLANT]: Because I had not heard from him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">THE COURT: Well, what is your understanding of where things stand right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">[APPELLANT]: My understanding is that he must believe he is withdrawn from the case. Otherwise he would be here today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">THE COURT: And is it your understanding and belief that he was withdrawing, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">[APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">THE COURT: Okay. All right. Is it your desire to proceed today on your own behalf and represent yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2D\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">THE COURT: Okay. You understand that an attorney could be helpful to you in terms of giving you advice and representing you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">[APPELLANT]: Well, that is why I am here pro se.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">THE COURT: Okay. Do you believe that it would be more helpful for you to not have an attorney? Is that what you are saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-15\">[APPELLANT]: No, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-16\">THE COURT: No. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-17\">[APPELLANT]: I\u2019m sorry. What was the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-18\">THE COURT: I was asking you do you understand that it could be helpful to you to have an attorney to represent you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-19\">[APPELLANT]: I have had legal advice until now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">[APPELLANT]: <em>So I am fully aware of the issues. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">The court proceeded to inquire as to the terms of the settlement reached by appellant and Dr. Alfert on April 26, 2001. The following colloquy is illuminating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">THE COURT: Okay, and have you come to a settlement of all the issues?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">[APPELLANT]: I think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">THE COURT: Okay. Then are the settlements contained in any written documents.at this time, or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Yes, Your Honor. Counsel for my husband provided me with a supplemental property settlement a little while ago, and I read it, and it looks fine.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">THE COURT: Okay. What I would do, ma\u2019am, is give you an opportunity to read the agreement\u2014or, I guess you have read it, <em>but to make sure that you are satisfied with it, and then if you both want to sign it.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-13\">Then what I am going to do is I am just going to ask both parties briefly on the record, I am going to do what is known as voir dire you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-14\">It is just ask you a series of questions just to be satisfied that you both understand the terms, and that it is in fact your agreement and that you understand that you would be bound by the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-15\"><em>So if you want to take as much time as you need right now to read through it again, </em>and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-16\">[APPELLANT]: <em>I don\u2019t need any additional time. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">Thereafter, the Alferts were sworn and the master examined them in regard to their settlement. Notably, the master gave appellant an opportunity to contest the terms of the supplemental settlement agreement and to proceed to trial, if she wanted to do so. Moreover, the master referred to appellant\u2019s \u201cright to obtain further discovery\u201d and her \u201cright <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>to make [her] decision.\u201d In response, appellant informed the master of her belief that \u201c[t]he discovery documents had not even been reviewed,\u201d but stated that she refused to \u201cgo back on [her] word\u201d as to the settlement. Appellant answered in the affirmative when the master asked if she was \u201csatisfied with the terms\u201d of the supplemental property agreement. Of significance here, Vogel expressly indicated that the terms of the agreement were \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The following colloquy is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">THE COURT: ... The May 4, 2001 supplemental property settlement agreement, you have had an opportunity to read that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">THE COURT: Okay. And up until recently you were represented by counsel in connection with this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-O\">[APPELLANT]: Yes, Your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">THE COURT: Okay, and <em>did you have an opportunity to discuss the facts and circumstances with your attorney and have sufficient time to meet with him so that he could give you proper legal advice concerning your rights and responsibilities?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Well, that is why I terminated his services.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">THE COURT: Okay, because he wasn\u2019t accessible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5D\">[APPELLANT]: <em>He wasn\u2019t accessible. The analysis of the accounts was incomplete. It was incorrect. The discovery documents had not even been reviewed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-12\">THE COURT: <em>And had you reviewed them yourself?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV_\">[APPELLANT]: <em>No. I picked them up Monday morning.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALh\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-13\">[APPELLANT]: And that is when I terminated their services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-14\">THE COURT: All right, and have you\u2014what is your educational background?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Well, my highest level is a J.D., and I have worked at the Department of Justice for about 17 years. I work in the Criminal Division, Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-5\">THE COURT: Okay. Do you have any remaining questions that you would have concerning the agreement that you would like to raise in open court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\n<em>Do you have any questions at all about the agreements or about your rights or responsibilities or any questions at all about the supplemental property settlement agreement property agreement [sic]?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">[APPELLANT]: <em>I don\u2019t have any questions. I could state what I would have been able to show if discovery had been completed as represented, but that wasn\u2019t done, and I agreed to the proposal last Thursday [i.e., April 26, 2001], prior to the discovery of the box of unreviewed records in appellee\u2019s office, and I will stick with my word.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-8\">THE COURT: <em>All right. So you have considered your right to obtain further discovery and your right to make your decision?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-9\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Well, I don\u2019t think in good faith that I can renege on accepting the agreement as presented.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-10\">THE COURT: All right. All right. <em>Well, you understand that if you didn\u2019t come to an agreement that this matter could be set for a contested trial, and then the Court would decide any disputed issues or property issues or property issues [sic], or any issues that are open?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-11\">[APPELLANT]: <em>I realize that, but I\u2019m not going to go back on my word.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-12\">THE COURT: All right. <em>And then do you understand, though, that by making an agreement, you are asking that there not be a trial date, and that the terms of this agreement become binding on you and part of a court order?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACF\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Yes, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-13\">THE COURT: Okay, <em>and do you believe, then, that the terms of the agreement are fair and equitable? </em>Are you satisfied with the terms of this agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>[APPELLANT]: <em>They are fair and equitable.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">THE COURT: <em>So you have signed both documents as a voluntary act on your part?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">[APPELLANT]: <em>Yes, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">Thereafter, the master said: \u201c[T]he Court will certainly accept this agreement, and I believe that it was entered into freely and voluntarily by both parties.\u201d The master also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-9\">[A]nd [Vogel] has also testified that she believes it is fair and equitable, and that she has chosen to proceed without counsel, and I believe that she has the education and experience, and certainly the competence to make that decision and to do so, and so now we will be proceeding now with the divorce hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-10\">The master then proceeded with the uncontested divorce hearing. At the close of the hearing, the master indicated that he would recommend a judgment of absolute divorce. According to the transcript, the parties then submitted a waiver of exceptions, in order to expedite the issuance of the divorce decree.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">About ten months later, on March 14, 2002, appellant, through counsel, filed a malpractice action against Touhey. As we noted, appellee moved to dismiss, claiming that the suit was barred by the doctrine of judicial estoppel. He asserted, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">In [appellant\u2019s] papers, and in her testimony of May 4, 200[1], she makes clear that although she was dissatisfied with [appellee], she was satisfied that the settlement agreement distributing the marital property was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d Under the principles of judicial estoppel, [appellant] is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>precluded from now asserting that the amount of the settlement of the division of the marital property was inadequate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">In his memorandum in support of the motion, appellee argued: \u201cJudicial estoppel precludes a litigant from taking a position \u2018which is directly contrary to, or inconsistent with, one previously assumed by him, at least where he had, or was chargeable with, full knowledge of the facts and another will be prejudiced by his action.\u2019 \u201d Further, appellee contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ab5-dedup-0\">Where, as in the case at hand, a party (who happens to be an attorney) represents to a court that a settlement agreement is \u201cfair and equitable,\u201d that same party should be precluded from later complaining that the same settlement agreement is inadequate. This is particularly so in this case where the [appellant] had discharged [appellee] because of the allegedly poor investigation that he conducted into her husband\u2019s assets and disclosure of those assets and where she had taken custody of the financial documents she claims [appellee] failed to review <em>before </em>she told the Court that the settlement agreement was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-6\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">... In complete contradiction to her earlier statements to the Court, however, [appellant] now claims that the marital property settlement is inadequate and she attempts to hold [appellee] responsible for what she calls an inadequate settlement. [Appellant] cannot have it both ways. She is presenting contrary positions to different Courts, and she should be estopped from making a legal malpractice claim under these circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">(Underlining in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Appellant countered: \u201cWhile [appellant] may have been upset that [appellee] had been less than diligent in investigating Dr. Alfert\u2019s finances, she had no reason to believe at the time that the new agreement was fundamentally unfair.\u201d Further, relying on cases from in and beyond Maryland, appellant argued that \u201ca client\u2019s agreement to settle a case does not bar a subsequent suit by the client against her lawyer for negligence in recommending the settlement.\u201d According <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to appellant, she is not judicially estopped from raising the claim, because her conduct was not \u201cheinous,\u201d \u201cfast and loose,\u201d or tantamount to \u201cblatant misrepresentations.\u201d She asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">Nor has [appellant] herein played \u201cfast and loose\u201d with the Court. On the contrary, her behavior toward the Court has been impeccable. She did not try to reneg [sic] on an agreement she knew she had been bound to by her lawyer. She did the honorable thing and accepted it. Accordingly, she should not be penalized by dismissal of her malpractice claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">In support of her opposition to Touhey\u2019s motion to dismiss, appellant also submitted an affidavit. She averred, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">6. That at the April 26 [, 2001] meeting [between appellant and appellee], Mr. Touhey explained to me that he had evaluated materials received from Dr. Alfert and that he believed the best I could do was receive $50,000 more than I was to get under the earlier, pro <em>se </em>Property Agreement. He stated that if I didn\u2019t accept such an amount, T might do worse at trial. One of the reasons given to me by Mr. Touhey in favor of such a settlement was that the stock market had declined since the date of the <em>pro se </em>agreement. During the discussion, Mr. Touhey gave me the impression that he had studied and analyzed the supplemental discovery materials which had been provided by Dr. Alfert earlier in April. The next day, April 27, we were scheduled to go to a mandatory pretrial settlement conference, we might not get such a good settlement. <em>Based upon this discussion and his recommendations, I authorized Mr. Touhey to communicate to my husband\u2019s attorney a demand for $50,000 \u2018as an adjustment of the parties[] marital property.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">At the hearing in the malpractice case on July 30, 2002, the court focused on appellant\u2019s representation that the settlement agreement was fair and equitable, and informed appellant that it was \u201cinclined to adopt [appellee\u2019s] argument----\u201d The following exchange is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>THE COURT: Unless you can persuade me otherwise. I mean, I recognize everything that you said, but your client, in effect, stood up in court and said, you know, this is fair and equitable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Your Honor, I think that the Court has to take into consideration the circumstances around which she said that, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to elucidate in my papers and in her affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">THE COURT: [S]he gets upset with [appellee], whether its justified or not, I don\u2019t know, and, in effect says, you\u2019re gone. I don\u2019t want you anymore. And I want to see all my papers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-8\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: More than in effect, she fires him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">THE COURT: Right. I want to see all my papers. So she gets the papers and says\u2014I take it from what you\u2019ve said in your papers, and what she has said\u2014she gets the papers and it becomes apparent to her that Touhey hadn\u2019t reviewed these.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-10\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">THE COURT: And once again she\u2019s getting shafted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ane\">[COUNSEL FOR APPELLANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-12\">THE COURT: And, as she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t do any thorough analytical analysis of it, but\u201d\u2014I mean, <em>she\u2019s already fired him because she didn\u2019t think he did a good job, gets papers now that buttress her argument that he didn\u2019t do a good job, and then marches into court four days later and said, Hey Judge, everything is okay. It\u2019s a fair and equitable settlement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-13\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-14\">Appellant\u2019s malpractice lawyer observed that appellant \u201cfelt [at] the [divorce] hearing that [she] had to, in effect, carry through on [her] agreement,\u201d which she made with Dr. Alfert <em>before </em>she discovered that Touhey had failed to review the financial records. Moreover, because appellant relied on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Touhey\u2019s advice when she accepted the additional $50,000 in settlement, appellant\u2019s attorney maintained that she \u201chad no chance to do any kind of exhaustive, comprehensive analytical processing of what was in the box of documents.\u201d Vogel\u2019s attorney emphasized that appellant hired Touhey to establish that Dr. Alfert \u201choodwinked\u201d her with respect to the original Property Agreement and, at the divorce hearing in May 2001, appellant disclosed that she was dissatisfied with appellee\u2019s performance. Appellant\u2019s counsel insisted that a party\u2019s prior settlement in an underlying case does not preclude a subsequent legal malpractice action. Because appellant had acted mistakenly but in good faith, she insisted that judicial estoppel did not preclude her from pursuing the malpractice case.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The court disagreed, ruling that appellant\u2019s malpractice claim was barred by judicial estoppel. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">The Court agrees with the arguments of the defendant Touhey that, in fact, judicial estoppel is present in this case. And, accordingly, the Court will order that [appellant\u2019s] complaint is dismissed with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-7\">[IJt just seems to me that under the circumstances, that when a person who is particularly knowledgeable as a lawyer stands up, after being dissatisfied with her own lawyer and says, after having the documents in her hands that she later is going to use as the basis of a malpractice action, says that everything is fair and equitable, I don\u2019t see how this can proceed in violation of the judicial estoppel rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-8\">For those reasons the Court is going to grant the motion to dismiss, which really, in effect, because it brings in outside items is a motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-9\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Vogel argues that the court erred in dismissing her case based on the doctrine of judicial estoppel. She asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the doctrine is designed to protect courts from \u201cegregious conduct\u201d perpetrated by a litigant. Vogel contends that \u201capplication of the doctrine ... requires an element of wrongful misconduct that is conspicuously absent in the instant proceeding.\u201d Because she had no \u201cintent to deceive whatsoever,\u201d and lacked full knowledge of important facts, appellant maintains that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Appellant concedes, as she must, that at the time of the divorce settlement \u201cshe was generally aware of [appellee\u2019s] lack of care in discovering her husband\u2019s assets.\u201d But, she asserts that she \u201clearn[ed] subsequently, on careful review of the papers with her accountant, that the agreement was grossly unfairf.]\u201d Vogel insists that she acted in good faith, and claims her conduct was the result of appellee\u2019s negligence. In her view, \u201can innocent inconsistent statement, where the declarant is not in possession of all the relevant facts, is insufficient to support the application of the [judicial estoppel] doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyG\">In this regard, Vogel emphasizes that she obtained Dr. Alfert\u2019s documents from appellee <em>after </em>she reached a binding settlement agreement with Dr. Alfert, pursuant to appellee\u2019s recommendation. Although Vogel had possession of Dr. Al-fert\u2019s documents by the time of the court hearing on May 4, 2001, she contends that she lacked the financial acumen to analyze the records, and had neither the right nor the obligation to repudiate the prior settlement agreement with Dr. Alfert. Thus, appellant asserts: \u201cRather than be castigated, Appellant should be credited for doing the right thing under difficult circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">Additionally, claiming \u201ca client\u2019s agreement to settle a case does not bar a subsequent [malpractice] suit by the client against her lawyer for negligence in recommending the settlement,\u201d appellant urges us to reverse. According to appellant, the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not apply here, because \u201cshe clearly did not have full knowledge of what was in her husband\u2019s financial documents when she announced that the divorce settlement was \u2018fair and equitable.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Appellee vigorously disputes appellant\u2019s contention that, in order for judicial estoppel to apply, he must show that she acted with an intent to deceive. According to appellee, \u201cthe doctrine of judicial estoppel has been applied by the Court of Appeals in circumstances where a party\u2019s inconsistent position was not attributable to any willful or intentional misrepresentation.\u201d Therefore, appellee seeks to bind Vogel to her assertion on May 4, 2001, when she announced that she was \u201cfully aware of the issues\u201d and that the settlement was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d Appellee contends: \u201cWithout question [appellant] was chargeable with knowledge of the facts before she told the court that the property settlement agreement was \u2018fair and equitable\u2019.... \u201d Thus, he urges the Court to preclude appellant \u201cfrom taking an inconsistent position by asserting that the settlement to which she agreed was not \u2018fair and equitable.\u2019 \u201d He reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">[Appellant] was not compelled to agree in open court that the settlement agreement in the underlying matter was \u201cfair and equitable____\u201d She had the option, if she so chose, to say that the settlement was not appropriate and/or to request more time to review the financial records and obtain new counsel. She elected to do neither.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">Further, appellee distinguishes the malpractice cases cited by appellant, noting that in those cases \u201cthe disappointed legal malpractice plaintiffs all discovered their attorneys\u2019 negligence after they finalized their settlements.\u201d Characterizing appellant as a \u201csophisticated party\u201d with \u201clegal training,\u201d Touhey maintains that she \u201chad sufficient time to review the financial records and reach an independent judgment with respect to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">Appellee\u2019s motion was styled as a motion to dismiss, but it was replete with references to the transcript of the hearing of May 4, 2001, which was attached as an exhibit to the motion. Additionally, in her opposition, appellant referred to numerous exhibits that were appended to her opposition. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>court considered those \u201coutside items,\u201d the parties and the court below recognized that appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss was transformed to a motion for summary judgment, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-322(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we turn to consider the standard of review applicable to a summary judgment ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Maryland Rule 2-501 establishes a two-part test for summary judgment. \u201cIn deciding a motion for summary judgment ... the trial court must decide whether there is any genuine dispute as to material facts and, if not, whether either party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Bagwell v.

Further, if the motion is \u201csupported by an affidavit or other statement under oath, an opposing party who desires to controvert any fact contained in it may not rest solely upon allegations contained in the pleadings, but shall support the response by an affidavit or other written statement under oath.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-501(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In resolving a motion for summary judgment, the trial court may not determine the credibility of witnesses. <em>Impala Platinum, Ltd. v.

His sole argument is a legal one; taking the facts asserted by appellant, Touhey contends that appellant\u2019s legal malpractice claim is barred under the doctrine of judicial estoppel. Accordingly, we turn to consider whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Beyer, </em>369 Md. at 360, 800 A.2d 707; <em>Goodwick v.

Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097 (1997), provides guidance. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Eagan, </em>\u201cMaryland has long recognized the doctrine of estoppel by admission, derived from the rule laid down by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>English Court of Exchequer ... that \u2018[a] man shall not be allowed to blow hot and cold, to claim at one time and deny at another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 88, 698 A.2d 1097 (citation omitted). Similarly, this Court explained in <em>Gordon v.

First, the doctrine of judicial estoppel \u201crests upon the principle that a litigant should not be permitted to lead a court to find a fact one way and then contend in another judicial proceeding that the same fact should be found otherwise.\u201d Judicial estoppel ensures \u201cthe \u2018integrity of the judicial process\u2019 by \u2018prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment[.]\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">142 Md.App. at 425, 790 A.2d 675 (alteration in original; citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">Nevertheless, a party is not always foreclosed from asserting a position that is inconsistent with one previously adopted. Judicial estoppel is inapplicable unless the party \u201c \u2018 \u201chad, or was chargeable with, lull knowledge of the facts and another will be prejudiced by his action.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Gordon, </em>142 Md.App. at 426, 790 A.2d 675 (citations omitted); <em>see Stone v.

But, the Supreme Court has articulated several factors relevant to the judicial estoppel analysis. In <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. 742, 750-51, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001), it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">[Sjeveral factors typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case: First, a party\u2019s later position must be \u201cclearly inconsistent\u201d with its earlier position. Second, courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party\u2019s earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create \u201cthe perception that either the first or the second court was misled.\u201d Absent success in a prior proceeding, a party\u2019s later inconsistent position introduces no \u201crisk of inconsistent court determinations,\u201d and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity. A third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">(Internal citations omitted). The Supreme Court cautioned, however, that it was \u201cnot establishing] inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808. To the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>trary, it observed that \u201c[additional considerations may inform the doctrine\u2019s application in specific factual contexts.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">At the divorce hearing, appellant said that she was \u201cfully aware of the issues\u201d and that the supplemental settlement was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d Based upon appellant\u2019s representations to the divorce court, she was successful in persuading the master to accept the supplemental settlement and to recommend the divorce decree, which the circuit court subsequently issued.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Later, in the malpractice action, appellant mounted a collateral attack on the divorce settlement. She insisted that she lacked full knowledge of material facts and claimed that, because of appellee\u2019s negligence, her supplemental divorce settlement was grossly unfair and inequitable. Thus, Vogel\u2019s representations to the divorce court\u2014that she was cognizant of the issues and satisfied with the property settlement\u2014were clearly inconsistent with her position in the malpractice case. Nevertheless, she urges us to conclude that her prior representations in the domestic case were not made with the requisite intent to mislead.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">In support of Vogel\u2019s claim that application of the judicial estoppel doctrine requires intentional misconduct, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>relies, <em>inter alia, </em>on <em>Wilson v. Stanbury, </em>118 Md.App. 209, 702 A.2d 436 (1997). In appellant\u2019s view, the <em>Wilson </em>decision limits application of judicial estoppel to those situations in which the party making the prior inconsistent statement acted deliberately, with the specific intent to mislead or deceive the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In <em>Wilson, </em>the appellant alleged that his first lawyer, the appellee, committed legal malpractice by suing the wrong party, Queen, as the sole tortfeasor in connection with an underlying auto tort. <em>Id. </em>at 210, 702 A.2d 436. After the statute of limitations had expired, the appellee realized that he had failed to sue the actual tortfeasor, Brumfield. <em>Id. </em>The appellee informed the appellant of his error and advised him to obtain new counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 702 A.2d 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Appellant\u2019s new attorney refiled the suit against Queen, knowing he was not liable, after Queen agreed not to raise the bar of limitations. Appellant\u2019s new attorney subsequently procured a settlement from Queen\u2019s insurance carrier, apparently because the insurer was unaware that Brumfield actually caused the accident. <em>Id. </em>at 212, 702 A.2d 436. Then, the same attorney filed a legal malpractice case against appellee on appellant\u2019s behalf. <em>Id. </em>In finding that appellant\u2019s malpractice suit was barred by judicial estoppel, the Court stated that it was \u201cclear that the improper allegations [against Queen] were made intentionally for an improper purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 215, 702 A.2d 436. The Court also stated, <em>id. </em>at 217, 702 A.2d 436:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b732-7\">We are especially cognizant ... that the doctrine of judicial estoppel has evolved to protect the courts from just the type of egregious conduct that occurred, on appellant\u2019s behalf, during the ... Queen case and the instant case. If we were to hold that the doctrine did not apply under these circumstances, it would be hard to imagine when it would be applicable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">We have not uncovered any Maryland case that has squarely addressed the issue of whether judicial estoppel includes, as a required element, the intent to mislead the court to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>an unfair advantage. But, <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 754 A.2d 1030 (2000), is noteworthy. There, in <em>dicta, </em>the Court of Appeals recognized the standard articulated by the Fourth Circuit. Quoting <em>Sedlack v. Braswell Servs. Group, Inc., </em>134 F.3d 219, 224 (4th Cir.1998), the <em>Pittman </em>Court said that, in order for judicial estoppel to apply, \u201c \u2018the party sought to be estopped must intentionally have misled the court to gain unfair advantage.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pittman, </em>359 Md. at 529 n. 9, 754 A.2d 1030. But, the <em>Pittman </em>Court expressly noted that judicial estoppel was not raised by the appellants. <em>See also Winmark Limited P\u2019ship v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>109 Md.App. 149, 170-71, 674 A.2d 73 (1996) (\u201c[Clases outside of the unique context of a debtor\u2019s nondisclosure of a claim in bankruptcy support the proposition that the application of judicial estoppel depends on the deliberate manner in which the party assumes two inconsistent positions.\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>345 Md. 614, 693 A.2d 824 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In <em>Sedlack, </em>134 F.3d 219, the Fourth Circuit recognized intent to mislead the court as an element in the judicial estoppel analysis. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">Although \u201ccourts have had difficulty in formulating a specific test for determining when judicial estoppel should be applied,\u201d at least three elements must always be satisfied. First, the party sought to be estopped must assert a position inconsistent with that taken in prior litigation and the position must be one of fact rather than law or legal theory. Second, the prior inconsistent position must have been accepted by the court. And third, the party sought to be estopped must intentionally have misled the court to gain unfair advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 224 (citations omitted). <em>See John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert &amp; Frieden, P.C., </em>65 F.3d 26, 29 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe \u2018determinative factor\u2019 in the application of judicial estoppel is whether the party who is alleged to be estopped \u2018intentionally misled the court to gain unfair advantage.\u2019 \u201d) (Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Several other federal and state courts have expressly recognized intent as an element in regard to the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>judicial estoppel. <em>See, e.g., Thompson v. Continental Airlines, </em>18 S.W.3d 701, 703-04 (Tex.App.2000) (recognizing that judicial estoppel \u201cmay be applied only when the position of the party to be estopped is clearly inconsistent with its previous one, the court must have accepted the prior position[,] and the party must have acted intentionally, not inadvertently\u201d); <em>Chandler v. Samford Univ., </em>35 F.Supp.2d 861, 863 (N.D.Ala. 1999) (concluding that the \u201capplicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel ... requires a determination that ... the inconsistency would allow a party to benefit from deliberate manipulation of the courts\u201d); <em>O\u2019Neill v. O\u2019Neill, </em>551 So.2d 228, 232 (Miss.1989) (noting that judicial estoppel applies \u201conly in those cases where the party against whom the estoppel is sought has knowingly ... asserted a position which was inconsistent with its position in prior judicial proceedings\u201d); <em>Scarano v. Central R. Co., </em>203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir.1953) (stating that judicial estoppel bars use of \u201cintentional self-contradiction ... as a means of obtaining unfair advantage\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">While the Court of Appeals in <em>Eagan, supra, </em>347 Md. 72, 698 A.2d 1097, did not directly address the issue of intent as an element of judicial estoppel, the holding in that case seems consistent with the view that, in order for the doctrine of judicial estoppel to apply, the party sought to be estopped must have asserted an inconsistent position knowingly, intentionally, or deliberately, in order to gain an unfair advantage. In that case, a wrongful death action was initiated on behalf of two minor children who claimed that their father killed their mother. The Court of Appeals considered whether the children\u2019s wrongful death action was barred based on the doctrine of parent-child immunity. The Court agreed with this Court, 111 Md.App. 362, 681 A.2d 609 (1996), that the parent-child immunity doctrine does not bar a wrongful death action filed on behalf of a minor child if the parent committed an act of murder or voluntary manslaughter as to the deceased parent. <em>Eagan, </em>347 Md. at 74, 698 A.2d 1097. Moreover, the Court acknowledged that, ordinarily, \u201cit would be a jury question whether\u201d the accused parent intentionally killed the other parent. <em>Id. </em>at 86, 698 A.2d 1097. Based on the father\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>at trial that his wife\u2019s death was an accident, this Court remanded for a new trial on that issue. Ill Md.App. at 398-99, 681 A.2d 609. But, the Court of Appeals disagreed with the remand. 347 Md. at 86-87, 698 A.2d 1097.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">From its independent review of the record, the Court of Appeals determined that the father was judicially estopped from claiming that he killed his wife accidentally. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 698 A.2d 1097. The Court noted that, in the prior criminal action against the father, he \u201chad entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter, which constituted a judicial admission\u201d that he had killed his wife. <em>Id. </em>at 87, 698 A.2d 1097. Moreover, the Court acknowledged that, ordinarily, such an admission would not be conclusive and \u201cwas subject to rebuttal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court determined, however, that rebuttal was not an option available to the father in the <em>Eagan </em>case. It relied on an exhibit attached to the father\u2019s affidavit, submitted by him in connection with his motion for summary judgment in a collateral proceeding pertaining to the guardianship of his children. <em>Id. </em>There, the father \u201ctook the position,\u201d through counsel, that \u201cthe death of [his wife] was homicide, homicide was voluntary manslaughter, [and appellee] was the criminal agent.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">In advancing his position in the guardianship proceeding, the father sought to benefit from the \u201cslayer\u2019s rule,\u201d by which he would hold his wife\u2019s half interest in the marital home in trust for their children. The father claimed that the wife\u2019s half interest in the marital home \u201cdevolved to him by reason of [his wife\u2019s] death in trust for his children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Writing for the Court of Appeals, Judge Wilner said, <em>id. </em>at 88, 698 A.2d 1097:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">In the memorandum filed by [the father\u2019s] attorney in connection with the guardianship matter, [appellee] acknowledged that his conduct constituted voluntary manslaughter and was therefore intentional. [Appellee] was obviously aware of that memorandum, as he attached a copy of it to his own affidavit filed in this case. Having thus conceded that the killing of [his wife] was an act of voluntary manslaughter, [appellee] is estopped from taking any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>contrary position in this case. At the very least, the force of that estoppel allows the plea of guilty to stand unrebutted and thus to establish that the killing was a voluntary manslaughter. Accordingly, the ... exception [to parent-child immunity] applies as a matter of law____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><em>New Hampshire v. Maine, supra, </em>532 U.S. 742, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968, is also instructive. That case involved a dispute between Maine and New Hampshire with respect to the boundary \u201calong the inland stretch of the Piscataqua River....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 121 S.Ct. 1808. New Hampshire brought an original action against Maine, \u201cclaiming that the Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore and that the entire river and all of Portsmouth Harbor belong to New Hampshire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, 121 S.Ct. 1808. Relying on judicial estoppel, Maine moved to dismiss the case. It argued that the river boundary was \u201cdefinitively fixed\u201d at \u201cthe middle of the river\u2019s main channel of navigation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 745, 121 S.Ct. 1808, based on a 1740 decree issued by King George II, and a 1977 consent judgment entered by the Supreme Court in connection with litigation between the same states concerning lobster fishing rights and \u201cthe \u2018lateral marine boundary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 746, 121 S.Ct. 1808. The Supreme Court agreed and granted Maine\u2019s motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The 1977 consent decree was predicated, in part, on the 1740 decree, which located the river boundary at the \u201cMiddle of the River.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ruling that New Hampshire was judicially estopped \u201cfrom asserting\u2014contrary to its position in the 1970\u2019s litigation\u2014that the inland Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 749, 121 S.Ct. 1808, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-6\">\u201c \u2018Where a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position, especially if it be to the prejudice of the party who has acquiesced in the position formerly taken by him.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Further, the Court explained that the \u201crule [of] judicial estoppel, \u2018generally prevents a party from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument-and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pegram v. Herdrich, </em>530 U.S. 211, 227 n. 8, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">In concluding that the doctrine of judicial estoppel barred <em>New Hampshire\u2019s </em>case, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">[T]he record of the 1970\u2019s dispute makes clear that this Court accepted New Hampshire\u2019s agreement with Maine that \u201cMiddle of the River\u201d means middle of the main navigable channel, and that New Hampshire benefited from that interpretation.... Although New Hampshire now suggests that it \u201ccompromised in Maine\u2019s favor\u201d on the definition of \u201cMiddle of the River\u201d in the 1970\u2019s litigation, ... that \u201ccompromise\u201d enabled New Hampshire to settle the case ... on terms beneficial to both States. Notably, in their joint motion for entry of the consent decree, New Hampshire and Maine represented to this Court that the proposed judgment was \u201cin the best interest of each State.\u201d Relying on that representation, the Court accepted the boundary proposed by the two States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">In short, considerations of equity persuade us that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case. Having convinced this Court to accept one interpretation of \u201cMiddle of the River,\u201d and having benefited from that interpretation, New Hampshire now urges an inconsistent interpretation to gain an additional advantage at Maine\u2019s expense. Were we to accept New Hampshire\u2019s latest view, the \u201crisk of inconsistent court determinations,\u201d ... would become a reality. We cannot interpret \u201cMiddle of the River\u201d in the 1740 decree to mean two different things along the same boundary line without undermining the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 752, 755, 121 S.Ct. 1808 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">Extrapolating from the cases discussed above, we readily conclude that the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars appellant\u2019s legal malpractice claim. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>Appellant hired appellee solely because she believed that Dr. Alfert significantly misrepresented the couple\u2019s marital assets at the time of the 1999 Property Agreement. In Vogel\u2019s words, she \u201cadvised [appellee] that she sought a fair settlement with her husband, based on full financial disclosure by both sides.\u201d Moreover, appellant does not dispute that she was aware that the case required \u201cthorough investigation and analysis of the parties\u2019 complex financial situation.\u201d Although appellant hired appellee for a particular purpose, the uncon-troverted facts revealed that, four days prior to the divorce hearing, appellant fired appellee specifically because she believed he had failed to perform; he had not reviewed or analyzed the financial documents produced by Dr. Alfert. Clearly, at the point that appellant discovered the documents produced by Dr. Alfert and fired appellee, appellant knew Touhey was not in a position to recommend a \u201cfair settlement\u201d on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">To be sure, when Vogel agreed to appellee\u2019s recommendation to settle with Dr. Alfert for $50,000, she had not yet discovered that Dr. Alfert had produced the documents in discovery, nor was she aware that appellee had not reviewed them. But, by the time Vogel fired Touhey, and by the time of the divorce hearing a few days later, she had to know what she did not know. She discovered appellee\u2019s alleged dereliction prior to the divorce hearing, and knew by the time of the hearing on May 4, 2001, that Touhey had no sound factual basis to support his earlier recommendation to settle with Dr. Alfert for $50,000. Clearly, then, Vogel knew by the time of the divorce hearing that she was not in a position to make an informed decision as to the settlement, because the information she had hired Touhey to obtain had not yet been analyzed. Yet, despite the fact that Vogel knew she had insufficient information as to an appropriate settlement with Dr. Alfert, she represented to the master that she was \u201cfully aware of the issues,\u201d and that the settlement was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">Further, any suggestion by Vogel that she had no choice but to proceed with the settlement is belied by the record. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>master conducted a thorough <em>voir dire </em>at the hearing on May 4, 2001, and gave appellant every opportunity to avail herself of a variety of options, including: 1) reneging on the divorce settlement; 2) pursuing further discovery; and 3) proceeding to a trial on the merits. Appellant declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Further, appellant had no basis to assume that she was contractually bound to proceed with the oral, supplemental property agreement, reached by the attorneys before she learned of Touhey\u2019s alleged dereliction. Significantly, during the divorce hearing Dr. Alfert never demanded that appellant proceed with the settlement agreement, nor did he argue that appellant was legally bound by it. Moreover, both Dr. Alfert and appellant clearly contemplated a written settlement agreement. In her settlement demand, appellant said that the \u201cparties would proceed to final uncontested divorce based upon a written separation agreement on these terms.\u201d Similarly, in his responsive facsimile, Dr. Alfert requested that appellee \u201cprepare the written separation agreement.\u201d As we recognized in <em>David v. Warwell, </em>86 Md.App. 306, 316, 586 A.2d 775 (1991), when a written settlement agreement is contemplated, there is no settlement until the written agreement is executed. <em>See also Pearlstein v. Maryland Deposit Ins. Fund, </em>78 Md.App. 8, 19, 552 A.2d 51 (1989) (determining that an oral property settlement was \u201csubject to disavowal because it contemplated the execution of a formal written document.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">We acknowledge that, merely because appellant is an attorney, this does not mean that she knew she was not contractually bound to settle the divorce case. Moreover, she may not have had the capability, time, or financial acumen to analyze Dr. Alfert\u2019s financial documents. But, there is no indication in the record that the master or Dr. Alfert attempted to force Vogel to choose immediately between a settlement with Dr. Alfert that she did not want or a prompt trial, with or without the benefit of counsel. At the very least, Vogel\u2019s status as an attorney for more than seventeen years suggests that she was aware of the right to ask for a postponement to consider her options or to retain new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Vogel told the divorce court that she refused to \u201cgo back on [her] word.\u201d Moreover, she did not believe, \u201cin good faith,\u201d that she could \u201crenege on accepting the agreement.\u201d Yet, the master conducted the <em>voir dire </em>to establish that the settlement was a voluntary and knowing settlement; the transcript of the divorce hearing reflects that the agreement was not executed until after appellant indicated in open court that she was \u201csatisfied with the terms.\u201d Under these facts, appellant\u2019s decision to settle was a matter of her choice, not the product of duress or coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">In our view, appellant is bound by her representations in the divorce proceedings. Like the Supreme Court in <em>New Hampshire v. Maine, </em>532 U.S. at 755, 121 S.Ct. 1808, we are persuaded by \u201cconsiderations of equity ... that application of judicial estoppel is appropriate in this case.\u201d Through her representations, Vogel convinced the master to \u201caccept\u201d her characterization of the property settlement as \u201cfair and equitable,\u201d and on that basis to recommend the divorce decree to the circuit court; the divorce decree was subsequently issued by the circuit court. Clearly, she \u201cbenefitted\u201d from the court\u2019s acceptance of the property agreement: Appellant received $50,000 more than she would have received under the terms of the original 1999 Property Agreement; she was able to settle her divorce case without incurring further expense or time; and, Vogel avoided the risk of an unfavorable result in a contested divorce proceeding. Clearly, Vogel \u201cnow urges an inconsistent interpretation to gain an additional advantage at [appellee\u2019s] expense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Furthermore, we are satisfied that, from appellant\u2019s intentional assertion of an inconsistent position, she would derive an \u201cunfair advantage\u201d if estoppel does not apply. By discharging appellee and then representing to the divorce court that the proposed settlement was fair and equitable, appellant inevitably created the circumstances that culminated in the malpractice claim that Touhey has had to defend. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Appellant\u2019s conduct deprived Touhey or his successor of the opportunity to correct any mistake or malfeasance at a time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>when an adjustment of the settlement with Alfert may well have been feasible. Because the divorce trial had not yet occurred, Touhey could have undertaken a review of Dr. Alfert\u2019s financial records and attempted to secure a more favorable settlement, if appropriate. If that course of conduct had occurred, obviously there would have been no basis for a malpractice suit. Alternatively, appellant could have retained a new lawyer or a financial consultant to do what she had initially hired appellee to do. Again, if the financial records, upon review, supported Vogel\u2019s claims against Dr. Alfert, she may have secured a more favorable settlement from Alfert, or she may have prevailed at a contested divorce hearing. In essence, appellant\u2019s decision to settle with Dr. Alfert foreclosed her ability to recover more money from Dr. Alfert and, in turn, it affected appellee\u2019s ability to avoid or succeed in the malpractice suit; Vogel\u2019s decision to settle made it impossible for her to obtain the result she desired from Dr. Alfert, and it set up the scenario for a malpractice claim against Touhey that might otherwise have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In the context of this case, there is also no merit to appellant's claim that her acceptance of a settlement negotiated by appellee \u201cdid not bar her from later complaining about the attorney\u2019s performance in recommending the settlement.\u201d We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In <em>Thomas v. Bethea, </em>351 Md. 513, 718 A.2d 1187 (1998), the Court of Appeals recognized that a client may be allowed to pursue a legal malpractice claim even when the client accepted a settlement in the underlying action with knowledge of the attorney\u2019s negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 718 A.2d 1187. Indeed, the Court said that \u201c[t]he principle that a lawyer may be held liable for negligence in the handling of a case that was ultimately settled by the client, whether based on deficiencies in preparation that prejudiced the case and more or less required a settlement or on a negligent evaluation of the client\u2019s case, has been accepted by nearly every court that has faced the issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527, 718 A.2d 1187. The <em>Thomas </em>Court explained, 351 Md. at 522, 718 A.2d 1187:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>These kind of cases have tended to fall into two categories, although they sometimes contain features of both. One category involves situations in which the client claims that he or she was given little choice but to settle on disadvantageous terms because the lawyer failed in some other respect to prepare or prosecute the case properly, thereby diminishing the prospect of success if the litigation continued. The gravamen of the action in those situations is not so much that the lawyer negligently recommended a settlement that was unreasonably low, but that what otherwise would be an unreasonably low settlement was essentially forced on the client because of other deficiencies by the lawyer. If the client was aware of those deficiencies prior to settling, the settlement itself, given the circumstances then faced by the client, may not have been unreasonable at all, and, indeed, may have been entirely prudent. The question still is raised of whether, by agreeing to the settlement, the client should be barred from litigating its fairness in a suit against the lawyer, and the answer appears to be \u201cno.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-5\"><em>See also Prande v. Bell, </em>105 Md.App. 636, 654, 660 A.2d 1055 (1995) (stating that \u201c[i]t would be patently unfair to allow attorneys who may have committed malpractice in handling a case to turn around and rely on a defense that effectively says that, because the client knowingly settled his or her case, the issue of whether the attorney was negligent was also settled\u201d); <em>Crowley v. Harvey &amp; Battey, P.A., </em>327 S.C. 68, 488 S.E.2d 334, 335 (1997) (holding that \u201cthe fact the client has accepted the benefits of the settlement and judicially sought to enforce its terms are not bars to maintenance of a malpractice claim\u201d); <em>Lowman v. Karp, </em>190 Mich.App. 448, 476 N.W.2d 428, 431 (1991) (concluding that \u201csettlement of the underlying action should not act as an absolute bar to a subsequent legal malpractice action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\"><em>Thomas </em>is distinguishable from the case <em>sub judice, </em>however. Here, appellant was not forced to accept an unreasonably low settlement because of irreparable damage to her case due to appellee\u2019s derelictions. Nor did the court put appellant in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>position of having to go to trial imminently if she opted not to settle. And, appellant discovered the appellee\u2019s alleged derelictions <em>before </em>she consummated her settlement. Therefore, her concerns could have been rectified by a new lawyer or financial consultant.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The case of <em>Lowman, supra, </em>190 Mich.App. 448, 476 N.W.2d 428, is also illuminating. There, the plaintiff/appellant was injured when she was kicked in the head by a horse. She retained the appellee to represent her in a suit against both the owner and boarder of the horse. <em>Id. </em>at 429. As the case progressed to trial, the plaintiff informed the appellee that she refused to settle for $20,000, as suggested by a mediation panel and appellee. According to the appellant, the appellee had told her that if she did not settle the case, he would refuse to try the matter. <em>Id. </em>The appellant consulted with another attorney and an experienced insurance claims adjuster, both of whom recommended that she refuse to accept the settlement offer and proceed to trial. <em>Id. </em>at 431. Nevertheless, the appellant settled the case for $20,000. <em>Id. </em>at 429. In doing so, she wrote, beneath her signature: \u201c \u2018Even though I feel this case is worth more I am accepting on the sole advise [sic] of my attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in Lowman). Following settlement, the appellant filed a legal malpractice suit against the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The lower court found that the appellant was estopped from proceeding with the malpractice claim because she had agreed to the settlement. <em>Id. </em>In reversing, the Michigan appellate court expressly rejected the appellee\u2019s argument that the appellant \u201cshould be estopped from suing [the appellee] because she \u2018knowingly and voluntarily\u2019 decided to settle the underlying suit, after having consulted with another attorney and an experienced insurance claims adjuster.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431. That court noted that the appellant became aware of the appellee\u2019s improper action \u201cso close to the trial date that it would have been very difficult, if not impossible, ... to obtain another attorney. Thus, [the appellant] was put in a position where settlement was her only reasonable choice despite her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>own reservations about the settlement and despite the advice of others.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">To be sure, <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Lowman </em>demonstrate that a party is not necessarily estopped from bringing a malpractice action even after deciding voluntarily to settle an underlying suit. In those cases, however, the parties became aware of the attorneys\u2019 negligence after the settlement or so close to the trial date that settlement was a virtual necessity. In contrast, the court here informed appellant that she could pursue additional discovery and then proceed to trial. There is no indication that the court was forcing appellant to trial immediately, or without a lawyer. Therefore, the rationale of cases like <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Lowman </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">As we see it, appellant comes to this court complaining about the divorce settlement, as if the wool had been pulled over her eyes. Although Vogel made a decision that she has come to- regret, it is hard to grasp how appellant can blame appellee for her decision to settle. And, if appellant had not settled, she might have secured a more favorable settlement from her spouse. Appellant\u2019s voluntary decision to proceed with the supplemental property agreement in her divorce case inescapably leads us to conclude that she knowingly and intentionally represented to the court that the settlement was \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d Moreover, she surely would derive an unfair advantage if permitted to renounce her statements to the divorce case.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Accordingly, we are persuaded that, if the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not apply here, appellant would reap the benefit of \u201c \u2018blowing hot and cold.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eagan, supra, </em>347 Md. at 88, 698 A.2d 1097 (citation omitted). The law does not countenance that result. Indeed, if the malpractice court were to find that the settlement agreement in the divorce case is unfair and inequitable, it would \u201cundermin[e] the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>New Hampshire, </em>532 U.S. at 755, 121 S.Ct. 1808.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
