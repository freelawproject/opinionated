Seldon, appellant, was convicted of possession with the intent to distribute more than 448 grams of cocaine and related violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. Appellant concedes that the evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses on July 13, 2000, but argues that the circuit court erred in denying his Motion to Suppress that evidence. Appellant now presents two questions for our review:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">I. DID THE LOWER COURT ERR WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS THE SEARCH OF HIS VEHICLE THAT OCCURRED ON OCTOBER 29,1999?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">II. DID THE LOWER COURT ERR WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS THE SEARCH OF HIS VEHICLE THAT OCCURRED ON JULY 13, 2000?</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall answer \u201cyes\u201d to each question, and we shall therefore reverse the judgments of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">I. The October 29, 1999 Search</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">On October 26, 1999, appellant drove his vehicle to Pohanka Mazda, an automobile dealership in Salisbury, Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 29, 1999, an employee of the dealership contacted the Wicomico County Police Department to report that something \u201csuspicious\u201d had been discovered in a vehicle that had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>brought in for service. Detective Carson Wentland of the Wicomico County Police Department received the call. Before proceeding to the dealership, he contacted the Maryland State Police and requested assistance. Maryland State Police Sergeant Michael Lewis was dispatched to the dealership. When Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland arrived, they were directed to appellant\u2019s vehicle by Bruce Willey, the mechanic who had made the repairs, and John Fiscus, a supervisor. At the time the officers arrived, appellant\u2019s vehicle had been repaired and was ready to be picked up.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Sergeant Lewis directed Mr. Willey to drive the vehicle into the service bay area. Once the vehicle was in the service bay, Mr. Willey pointed to the section of the vehicle where he had discovered the suspicious item. Sergeant Lewis then entered the vehicle, pushed back the front seat, lifted the carpet, and observed a secret compartment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He lifted the lid of the compartment and looked inside, but found nothing. Upon further examination of the vehicle, Sergeant Lewis discovered a second secret compartment which was located in the gas tank. This compartment, which was electrically and hydraulically powered, could not be opened by hand. Sergeant Lewis attempted to open the compartment by using his \u201calligator grips,\u201d but his attempt was unsuccessful. He then used a screwdriver to pry open the compartment \u201cslightly,\u201d and was able to determine that there was no contraband in the compartment. Sergeant Lewis reported his findings to the Wi-comico County Narcotics Task Force, and was told by a member of that organization that appellant was a suspected drug dealer in the area. Because no contraband was found in appellant\u2019s vehicle, the officers took no further action on this occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II. The July 13, 2000 Search</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">On July 13, 2000, Sergeant Lewis spotted appellant\u2019s vehicle traveling eastbound on Route 50 near Annapolis, Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>and stopped the vehicle because it was traveling at the speed of 71 m.p.h in a posted 55 m.p.h. zone. Appellant was the sole occupant of the vehicle. Sergeant Lewis approached the passenger side of the vehicle and, through an open window, asked for appellant\u2019s license and registration. According to his suppression hearing testimony, at this point Sergeant Lewis noticed: (1) a strong odor of air freshener coming from the interior of the vehicle; (2) law enforcement decals affixed on the vehicle\u2019s windshield; (3) the \u201cdefinitive odor of cocaine;\u201d and (4) a large \u201cwad\u201d of money that came protruding out of appellant\u2019s pocket as appellant reached for his driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sergeant Lewis also testified that appellant seemed to be \u201cextremely nervous,\u201d that appellant\u2019s \u201ccarotid pulse was pounding,\u201d and that all of these observations were consistent with illegal drug activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">When Sergeant Lewis examined appellant\u2019s license and registration, he realized that appellant was under investigation by the Wicomico County Narcotics Task Force, and recognized appellant\u2019s vehicle as the vehicle searched nine months before at Pohanka Mazda. Sergeant Lewis returned to his vehicle and placed a call to determine the status of appellant\u2019s license. After being informed that the license was valid, Sergeant Lewis called Sergeant Michael Kenhart of the Wi-comico County Narcotics Task Force. During this conversation, Sergeant Lewis stated that he had stopped appellant for a traffic violation and that he \u201chad enough to do him,\u201d but wanted to know whether the arrest of appellant might adversely affect any Task Force investigation. Sergeant Ken-hart responded that appellant was still under investigation, and he would call back with an answer. A few minutes later, Sergeant Kenhart called back, and told Sergeant Lewis that the Task Force had no objection to appellant\u2019s arrest. At this point, Sergeant Lewis called for backup and requested a canine unit,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and activated a video and audio recording system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>that provided the suppression hearing court with the ability to review the stop from that point forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Sergeant Lewis again approached appellant\u2019s vehicle, and asked appellant to step out. Sergeant Lewis then asked appellant for permission to search the vehicle. Appellant refused that request. Sergeant Lewis continued to converse with and question appellant until the backup unit arrived. Once the backup unit arrived, Sergeant Lewis patted down appellant to search for any weapons.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sergeant Lewis then proceeded to search the vehicle. Almost immediately, he located the two steel compartments that he had previously searched at the dealership.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The compartment located underneath the front passenger seat was empty. A search of the second compartment turned up what appeared to be one package of cocaine and two packages of marijuana, each of which was covered by a fabric softener secured by saran wrap and clear packaging tape.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant was arrested and charged accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">III. The Circuit Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">After a hearing on appellant\u2019s Motion to Suppress, the circuit court filed a Memorandum and Order that included the following findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Two separate searches occurred as previously outlined. The Court will therefore separately examine the constitutionality of each search.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">\n<em>July 13, 2000</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">In assessing the constitutionality of the search of Defendant\u2019s vehicle, the Court must first determine whether Sergeant Lewis\u2019 stop of the vehicle was reasonable. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Maryland Court of Special Appeals reiterated the Supreme Court guidelines that \u201cthe level of suspicion required for a stop is considerably less than the proof needed for probable cause.\u201d <em>Lawson v. State, </em>120 Md.App. 610, 618, 707 A.2d 947 (1998)(citing <em>Quince v. State, </em>319 Md. 430, 433, 572 A.2d 1086 (1990)); <em>United States v. Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. 1, 7, 109 S.Ct. 1581, 104 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The initial stop of Defendant\u2019s vehicle for speeding was legitimate and reasonable. Sergeant Lewis testified that while traveling behind Defendant\u2019s vehicle, he paced Defendant speeding at approximately 71 m.p.h. in a 55 m.p.h. zone. Consequently, Sergeant Lewis was justified in stopping Defendant for a traffic infraction, which has been acknowledged by Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The Fourth Amendment protects against unlawful searches and seizures including seizures that involve only a brief detention. <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 551, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980). A traffic stop is a detention that implicates the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985). The Supreme Court has made it clear that a detention should only last as long as it [sic] necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. <em>Ferris v. State of Maryland, </em>355 Md. 356, 369, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(1999)(quoting Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983)). As previously discussed, the stop, of Defendant implemented the Fourth Amendment but was a valid seizure based on probable cause-the Defendant was speeding. There are numerous cases that discuss when it is appropriate for an officer to detain a driver for further investigation, once the purpose of the traffic stop has been fulfilled. In two instances the detainment is constitutionally permissible under the Fourth Amendment: (1) the driver consents to the continuing intrusion; (2) the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime is being or is about to be committed. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 372, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(citing United States v. Sandoval, </em>29 F.3d 537, 540 (10th Cir.1994)). To determine whether a seizure has oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>curred under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 376, 735 A.2d 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Before addressing the issue of consent and reasonable suspicion, the Court must determine whether the stop of Defendant constituted one or two stops. The Court is assisted by the video tape which provides a minute by minute recordation of the stop. Sergeant Lewis stopped Defendant at. approximately 1:50 p.m. and activated the recording system immediately thereafter. At 1:53 p.m. Sergeant Lewis received confirmation that Defendant\u2019s license was valid. At 2:00 pm. Sergeant Lewis received, information regarding the registration of the vehicle. Sergeant Lewis testified that in this time period he began to prepare a warning citation for the speeding offense. Sergeant Lewis returned to Defendant\u2019s vehicle at 2:03 pm. It is inferred that if this had been a routine traffic stop without incident, Sergeant Lewis would have returned Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and vehicle registration, issued the warning and Defendant would have been on his way. The stream of events did not occur. Defendant was not given his license, registration or a citation. Sergeant Lewis had already determined before he approached Defendant\u2019s vehicle for the second time that he was going to search the vehicle. It is evident that Sergeant Lewis removing Defendant from his vehicle was not justified by the first stop for speeding. The Sergeant\u2019s initial purpose in stopping Defendant was to enforce the laws of the roadway and to investigate the manner of driving with the intent to issue a citation or warning. Once the purpose of the stop was fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and occupant amounted to a second detention. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 735 A.2d 491; <em>See Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319. Consequently, at 2:03 pm. the initial stop concluded and a second and separate stop began. The Court must, therefore, determine whether Defendant consented to the questioning outside the vehicle or if Sergeant Lewis had a reasonable and articulable suspicion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>support the second detainment of Defendant. A consensual encounter is defined as the voluntary cooperation of a private citizen in response to non-coereive questioning by a law enforcement official. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 373, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(citing United States v. Werking, </em>915 F.2d 1404, 1408 (10th Cir.1990)). In this type of encounter, a private citizen is not seized under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, because he is free to leave at any time. <em>Id. </em>Questioning an individual is allowed as long as the officer does not convey a message that compliance with the request is required. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 375, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(quoting Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 U.S. 429, 434-35, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991)). The test is objective, not subjective, therefore the Court must decide whether a reasonable person would have believed that he was free to end the conversation or encounter. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 375, 735 A.2d 491. The Court looks at a variety of factors including: the time and place of the encounter, the number of officers present and whether they were uniformed, whether the police removed the person to a different location or isolated him or her from others, whether the person was suspected of a crime, whether the police retained the person\u2019s documents, and whether the police exhibited threatening behavior or physical contact that would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she was not free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 377, 735 A.2d 491. Sergeant Lewis walked to the driver\u2019s side of Defendant\u2019s vehicle and stated to Defendant, \u201cCome on back here. I wanna talk to you for a minute-come back here.\u201d The parties proceeded to a location away from the side of the road and between the two vehicles. As evidenced by the video tape, Sergeant Lewis stood two to three feet from Defendant. At that time, Sergeant Lewis was still in the possession of Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration, had not yet issued any type of citation, and suspected Defendant of committing a crime-possession of CDS. Defendant did not voluntarily exit the car, did not consent to the questioning and he was not free to leave at any time. A reasonable person in the position of Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>would not have felt free to leave, consequently a seizure occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The Court, therefore, must determine whether the detainment of Defendant was based on reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal conduct to determine whether it was a constitutional seizure. The United States Constitution requires that \u201cthe police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(quoting Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)). The standard is objective as to whether a reasonably prudent person in the officer\u2019s position would have been warranted in believing that Defendant was involved in criminal activity that was afoot. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 384, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(citing Derricott v. State, </em>327 Md. 582, 588, 611 A.2d 592 (1992)). Any determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on the totality of the circumstances-the whole picture. <em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 385, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(citing Sokolow, </em>490 U.S. at 8, 109 S.Ct. 1581, <em>quoting United, States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 417, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)). The suspicion is less that the level of probable cause. <em>Ferns, </em>355 Md. at 385, 735 A.2d 491 <em>(citing Graham v. State, </em>325 Md. 398, 408, 601 A.2d 131 (1992)). \u201c[I]t is not enough that law enforcement official can articulate reasons why they stopped someone if those reasons are not probative of behavior in which few innocent people would engage-the factors together must serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers before the requirement of reasonable suspicion will be satisfied.\u201d <em>Karnes v. Skrutski, </em>62 F.3d 485, 493 (3rd Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">When Sergeant Lewis approached Defendant\u2019s vehicle and asked for his license and registration, he made numerous observations. He observed a strong odor of air fresheners emitting from the vehicle; Defendant was extremely nervous in that his carotid pulse was pounding and he did not make eye contact; Defendant produced a large \u2018wad\u2019 of cash from his pocket as he retrieved his license and registration; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the car was very clean; the windshield was affixed with stickers indicating support for the police. All of these observations caused Sergeant Lewis to be suspicious that Defendant might be in the possession of CDS. He also believed that he smelled the \u201cdefinitive odor of cocaine.\u201d In addition, he recalled Defendant\u2019s name as a suspected drug dealer and remembered the observations he made in October 1999 of the concealed compartments in the vehicle. Considering Sergeant Lewis\u2019 observations in the aggregate, the Court finds that he had reasonable, articulable suspicion to continue to detain Defendant for further investigation. Consequently, the Court finds that the second detainment was not an unconstitutional seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The final issue for the Court to decide is if the search of Defendant\u2019s vehicle was based upon probable cause. Maryland Code, Article 27, \u00a7 594B(c) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">A police officer may arrest a person without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed or attempted and that such person has committed or attempted to commit a felony whether or not in the officer\u2019s presence or view.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Probable cause requires less evidence \u201cthan would justify conviction but more evidence than that which arouse a mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 584, 774 A.2d 420 (2001). \u201cBecause many situations which confront officers in the course executing their duties are more or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their part. But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusion of probability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 774 A.2d 420.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">Sergeant Lewis questioned Defendant outside the vehicle. Defendant did not consent to the search. Defendant denied that he was transporting any illegal substance including cocaine. Sergeant Lewis patted down Defendant to check for weapons; no weapons or other contraband were found. Among his observations, Sergeant Lewis believed that he smelled the \u201cdefinitive odor of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Odors gained from the unaided human senses may furnish evidence of probable cause. <em>Ford v. State of Maryland, </em>37 Md.App. 373, 378, 377 A.2d 577 <em>(1977)(citing Johnson v. United States, </em>333 U.S. 10, 13, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948)). Knowledge gained from the sense of smell alone may be of such character as to give rise to probable cause for a belief that a crime is being committed in the presence of an officer. <em>Ford, </em>37 Md.App. at 379, 377 A.2d 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In <em>Ford, </em>the officer testified that he smelled an odor of marijuana emanating from within the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Consequently the Court found that the officer had probable cause to believe that the vehicle contained marijuana and probable cause for the Defendant\u2019s arrest existed. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 377 A.2d 577. Therefore, the search of the vehicle was valid as a search incident to an arrest, <em>Ford, </em>37 Md.App. at 380, 377 A.2d 577 <em>(citing Chimel v. California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969)), or under the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment. <em>Ford, </em>37 Md.App. at 380, 377 A.2d 577; <em>See Carroll y. United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543 (1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">The facts before this Court also contemplate the same principle-whether smell plus the aggravating factors constituted probable cause. Sergeant Lewis did not observe any illegal substance in plain view in the vehicle or on the body of Defendant pursuant to the frisk. The basis of his articu-lable suspicion was comprised of his observations including what he perceived to be the \u201cdefinitive odor of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The cocaine confiscated from Defendant\u2019s vehicle weighed 497 grams without the packaging and was cut with caffeine. It was wrapped with fabric softeners, saran wrap and clear packaging tape. It was concealed in an electronically and hydraulically controlled steel compartment below the floorboards of the vehicle, which also contained 854 grams of marijuana similarly packaged. Sergeant Lewis testified that he smelled air fresheners mixed with the \u201cdefinitive odor of cocaine.\u201d When asked to describe what cocaine smells like he responded, \u201ccocaine smells like cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Based on the testimony, it is apparent that some of the witnesses associate a particular smell with the odor of eocaine-'cocaine smells like cocaine\u2019. It is, however, scientifically impossible that the confiscated drug could be detected because the cocaine seized and the caffeine with which it was cut had no detectible odor. Although Sergeant Lewis stated that he smelled the definitive odor of cocaine, the Court finds that it was impossible for him to have done so. The Court, however, finds that Sergeant Lewis believed that he smelled cocaine from the odors with which he associated it. The cocaine was wrapped in layers of masking agents.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Notwithstanding Sergeant Lewis\u2019 belief that he smelled cocaine, based on the totality of the circumstances, the Court finds that all of the observations and prior knowledge of the police officer of Defendant and the vehicle created a reasonable and articulable suspicion to investigate further, and amounted to probable cause to search the vehicle. Defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be protected from illegal searches and seizures was not violated. The Court finds that the search of the vehicle and the seizure of the cocaine and marijuana was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">\n<em>October 26,1999</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">.... The question becomes whether the bailee, the dealership could consent to a search by Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Once Defendant delivered the vehicle to the dealership for service, the vehicle was in the control and possession of the dealership. Mr. Willey testified that he worked on the vehicle and noticed a suspicious item that was not considered a feature of the Mazda MPV or any Mazda vehicle. Mr. Willey reported the suspicious item to his supervisor who reported the finding to the authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland arrived at the dealership and Mr. Willey described to them what he had observed. The vehicle was driven to the service bay by Mr. Willey and the officers were directed to the area of the vehicle where the suspicious item had been located. Thus the bailee, the dealership, consented to the search. Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland moved the seat and lifted the carpeting to view what was ultimately determined to be the concealed compartments. The first compartment was opened and nothing was found. The second compartment could not be opened because it was hydraulically and electronically controlled. Sergeant Lewis attempted to open the compartment using wires but was unsuccessful; he peeked in the compartment using a screwdriver.... The actions by Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland did not exceed the scope of the search. The suspicious item identified by the dealership was located beneath the floorboards near the gas tank. The officers did not search any other area of the vehicle-i.e. the trunk or glove box-except where they were directed to search by the dealership employees. The Court finds that the search of Defendant\u2019s vehicle at the dealership was not an illegal search under the Fourth Amendment. The bailee\u2019s consent made it a reasonable search.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">For these reasons, the Court will deny the Motion to Suppress relating to the incident that occurred on July 13, 2000, and deny the Supplemental Motion to Suppress relating to the incident that occurred on October 26, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"AG4\">Appellant was thereafter convicted and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">While we are persuaded that the circuit court did not make any clearly erroneous finding of fact, we are also persuaded that the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion for suppression.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Fourth Amendment guarantees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>\u201cthe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend.

The <em>Matlock </em>Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Common authority is, of course, not to be implied from the mere property interest a third party has in the property. The authority which justifies the third-party consent ... rests on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection, in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u201cThe resolution of the issue of consent always turns on the facts of each case.\u201d <em>State v.

Professor LaFave\u2019s treatise on the Fourth Amendment explains that \u201cof obvious importance\u201d in determining whether a bailor assumes the risk that a bailee would consent to a search is \u201cthe extent to which the bailor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>made efforts to secure, even as against the bailee, the privacy of his effects.\u201d 3 W.

LaFave went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">Where possession of the car was given on the understanding that the bailee would subject it to general use, driving it about for his own purposes, then the bailee may give effective consent to a search of those portions of the car which he could be expected to make use of. If, for example, the owner hands over both the ignition key and trunk key, then the bailee may consent to a search of the trunk, for, as noted in <em>United States v. Eldridge, </em>\u201caccess to the trunk is a normal incident to the use of an automobile.\u201d But if the bailment of the car is for a special and limited purpose, then that purpose must be taken into account in assessing the extent of risk assumed by the bailor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added)(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Neither the Court of Appeals nor this Court has addressed the issue of whether a mechanic has the authority to consent to a search of a vehicle that the mechanic has been authorized to repair.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This issue, however, has been addressed by other appellate courts, including the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. In <em>United States v. Eldridge, </em>302 F.2d 463 (4th Cir.1962), the defendant loaned his automobile to a friend, who was driving the automobile when it was stopped because the police had been notified by a caller that there might be stolen guns in the automobile. The police asked if they could search the vehicle, and the friend gave them permission to do so, and voluntarily opened the trunk which revealed the presence of two stolen Coast Guard radios.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Prior to trial, the defendant unsuccessfully argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>evidence should be suppressed because \u201cthe protection of the Fourth Amendment was a personal right that could not be waived for him by ... a gratuitous bailee of the car.\u201d His motion was denied. The appellate court affirmed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ack\">On the merits of the constitutional issue we agree with the result reached by the District Court. Not every search made without a warrant is illegal. The Fourth Amendment prohibits only \u2018unreasonable\u2019 searches and seizures. Such decision as have been cited to us or discovered by research have only a peripheral bearing on the question to be decided in this case. Lower federal courts have deemed searches reasonable if consented to by the person in lawful possession of the articles seized, or the premises on which they are found, as where the defendant\u2019s partner consented to a search, where an office manager in sole control of the office and the corporate records consented to the search and seizure, where the owner-occupant of a house consented to search of the living room in which the defendant customarily slept on a couch, where the wife of the defendant consented to a search of their home, and where an owner consented to a search of his garage, and the article seized, which had been stored there by the defendant, was not packaged or otherwise concealed. These decisions do not furnish particularly helpful guides to the answer to the precise question raised here, namely, whether the bailor\u2019s constitutional immunities were violated in the search consented to by his bailee. The appellant mistakenly contends that the recent case of <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>365 U.S. 610, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828 (1961), supports him. That case is not analogous to this, for here consent was given by the bailee in actual lawful possession of the car, and it is the bailor who claims that his constitutional rights were violated by the search. If <em>Chapman </em>sheds any light whatever on the question that concerns us here, it is possibly in the indication it gives that authorization of the search may come from a person in actual lawful possession, and that his rights may not be waived by an owner who has the right to reclaim possession, but has not done so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>[The friend\u2019s] right to possession of the vehicle was less formal or durable than that of the tenant Chapman to occupancy of the house under his lease. Still, for the time being [the friend] was clothed with rightful possession and control and could do in respect to the automobile whatever was reasonable and not inconsistent with its entrustment to him. No restriction was imposed on him except to return with the car by a certain hour. Although the defendant knew of the presence of the stolen radios in the trunk, he apparently did not think it worthwhile to take the precaution of forbidding his bailee to open the trunk or permit anyone to look into it. He reserved no exclusive right of privacy in respect to the trunk when he delivered the key. In responding as he did to the police, [the friend] did not exceed the authority [the defendant] had seemingly given him. Using the key to open the trunk was not an unwarranted exercise of dominion during the period of his permissive possession and use. Access to the trunk is a normal incident to the use of an automobile. And if, when he voluntarily opened the trunk, [the friend] did not exceed proper bounds because he had to that extent at least concurrent rights therein with [the defendant], was the ensuing search by the police unreasonable? We think not. Had the police done more than look with [the friend\u2019s] consent into the trunk and observe what was readily visible and not covered over or concealed in package or wrapper\u2014if, for example, they had explored under the floor carpeting or behind the <em>upholstery\u2014we </em>might have a different case. <em>United States v. Lefkowitz, </em>285 U.S. 452, 52 S.Ct. 420, 76 L.Ed. 877 (1932); <em>United States v. Kir-schenblatt, </em>16 F.2d 202, 203, 51 A.L.R. 416 (2d Cir.1926). There is no suggestion that [the friend] obtained possession of the car with any deceptive purpose against [the defendant] or in collusion with the officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-5\"><em>Eldridge, </em>302 F.2d at 465-466 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In <em>State v. Farrell, </em>443 A.2d 438 (R.I.1982), the Rhode Island Supreme Court was presented with facts that are very similar to the facts of the case at bar. In <em>Farrell, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>defendant left a vehicle at a local garage, having authorized repairs to a dent on the left front fender of the car. A stolen vehicle investigation led police to the garage where defendant had dropped off his vehicle. An examination of the vehicle identification number of the defendant\u2019s vehicle revealed that the vehicle was stolen. At this point, an officer asked the owner of the garage for permission to tow the car to the police station. After some discussion, the owner of the garage consented. The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the owner of the . garage had no authority to consent to the car being impounded. The appellate court held that the trial court should have granted the motion for suppression, explaining:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The doctrine that recognizes the validity of third party consent to a search must be applied cautiously to prevent erosion of the Fourth Amendment protections. This is especially true because consent eliminates the requirement of probable cause. As the Supreme Court in <em>Stoner v. California, </em>[376 U.S. 483, 84 S.Ct. 889, 11 L.Ed.2d 856 (1964)]supra, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">\u201cOur decisions make clear that the rights protected by the fourth amendment are not to be eroded by strained applications of the law of agency or by unrealistic doctrines of \u2018apparent authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 84 S.Ct. at 892, 11 L.Ed.2d at 860.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqAk\">We hold that one who entrusts his automobile to another for the purposes of repair, or periodic inspection as required by law, does not confer the kind of mutual use or control which would empower that person to consent to a warrantless search and seizure. In view of our finding of no consent, coupled with the failure of the state to justify the warrant-less seizure on any other ground, the evidence obtained by the police as a result of the seizures is inadmissible and should have been suppressed. The defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\"><em>Farrell, </em>443 A.2d at 442. We agree with that analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">In the case at bar, the bailment of appellant\u2019s vehicle was for the limited purpose of replacing the fuel pump. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>order to replace the fuel pump, mechanics needed to access areas of the car where the secret compartments were located. Appellant never explicitly restricted access to those areas of the vehicle. Therefore, once appellant relinquished his keys, he assumed the risk that the mechanics might come across the compartments. Although the dealership acquired common authority over those portions of the vehicle that would be exposed during (1) the process of repairing the vehicle, and (2) the period of time during which the repairs were being made, the dealership was not authorized to consent to a search of the vehicle after the repairs had been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">There is a significant difference between (1) authorizing a mechanic to observe what is located in those portions of a vehicle being repaired, and (2) authorizing a mechanic to consent to a law enforcement officer\u2019s request for permission to conduct a post-repair examination of those portions of the vehicle that are no longer clearly visible. When Sergeant Lewis and- Detective Wentland arrived at the dealership, the authorized repairs to appellant\u2019s vehicle had been completed, the vehicle had been parked, and was ready to be picked up. A visual examination of the repaired vehicle did not reveal anything suspicious. Although Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland had been told that a mechanic noticed something \u201csuspicious\u201d located in the vehicle, that information did not justify a warrantless search of the vehicle involving the unbolting of seats, pulling up carpet, and using screwdrivers to pry open compartments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland had the right to (1) remain at the dealership until appellant arrived (or the right to return to the dealership at that time); (2) question appellant about the information they received from the mechanic; and (3) ask appellant for permission to search the vehicle. They did not, however, have the right to make a warrantless re-entry into\u2014and a minute examination of\u2014 those portions of the vehicle that were no longer clearly visible.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For these reasons, the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine is applicable to the October 29, 1999 search, and the information obtained by Sergeant Lewis as a result of that search cannot be used in any way to establish probable cause for the July 13, 2000 search.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 735 A.2d 491 (1999), appellant was stopped by an officer because he was traveling faster than the posted speed limit. The officer issued appellant a citation for speeding. Before allowing appellant to go on his way, the officer asked appellant to exit his vehicle so he could ask him a few questions. It was during this questioning that appellant eventually admitted that the vehicle he was driving contained marijuana. At a pretrial hearing, appellant moved to suppress all evidence and statements illegally obtained by the officers. The trial court denied his motion and appellant was convicted of speeding and possession of marijuana. This Court affirmed. The Court of Appeals reversed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, including seizures that involve only a brief detention. <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 551, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1875, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980). The Supreme Court has made clear that a traffic stop involving a motorist is a detention which implicates the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); <em>Berkemer v.

It is equally clear, however, that ordinarily such a stop does not initially violate the federal Constitution if the police have probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a traffic violation. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1772, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>also made it clear that the detention of a person \u201cmust be temporary and last no longer than is- necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>Florida v.

Indeed, Ferris does not contest the initial stop. The real issue lies in the actions taken by the officer after he had issued the speeding citation to Petitioner and had returned his driver\u2019s license and registration to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">[T]he officer\u2019s purpose in an ordinary traffic stop is to enforce the laws of the roadway, and ordinarily to investigate the manner of driving with the intent to issue a citation or warning. Once the purpose of that stop has been fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a second detention. <em>See Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. at 1325-26. Thus, once the underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded, a police-driver encounter which implicates the Fourth Amendment is constitutionally permissible only if either (1) the driver consents to the continuing intrusion or (2) the officer has, at a minimum, a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. <em>United States v. Sandoval, </em>29 F.3d 537, 540 (10th Cir.1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">When, as here, the purpose for which the investigatory stop was instituted has been accomplished and no other reasonable suspicion exists to support further investigation, there is no justification for continued detention and interrogation of citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\"><em>People v.

Many of these cases employing careful scrutiny if not skepticism over continued detentions in the context of traffic stops are consistent with the admonition of <em>Terry v.

Babwah, </em>972 F.2d 30, 33 (2nd Cir.1992). We conclude, after considering all the circumstances of the initial encounter between Trooper Smith and Petitioner, that the traffic stop essentially came to an end upon the trooper\u2019s delivery of the citation, and return of the driver\u2019s license and registration. Once Ferris signed and returned the citation in compliance with Maryland traffic laws, Maryland Code (1977, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 26-203 of the Transportation Article, he had completed all his duties pertaining to the traffic stop itself. Because the traffic stop had ended there, Ferris was lawfully free to drive away, as Trooper Smith himself acknowledged in his own testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\"><em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 369-373, 735 A.2d 491.

It is true that Sergeant Lewis testified that he smelled the \u201cdefinitive odor of cocaine,\u201d and that testimony\u2014if accepted as true\u2014would have established probable cause for both an arrest and a search.

There is no earthly way that a police officer can distinguish the nervousness of an ordinary citizen under such circumstances from the nervousness of a criminal who traffics in narcotics. An individual\u2019s physiological reaction to a proposed intrusion into his or her privacy cannot establish probable cause or even grounds to suspect. Permitting [a] citizen\u2019s nervousness to be the basis for a finding of probable cause would confer upon the police a degree of discretion not grounded in police expertise, and, moreover, would be totally insusceptible to judicial review. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 388, 735 A.2d 491 (quoting <em>Whitehead v.

The trial court gave more weight to Sergeant Lewis\u2019 determination that appellant was \u201cextremely nervous\u201d than <em>Ferris </em>permits. We take judicial notice that it is more likely so than not so that, when a uniformed law enforcement officer stops a motorist for speeding, the motorist will exhibit signs of nervousness.

That case, however, does not hold that the odor of an air freshener \u201ctaken together\u201d with the motorist\u2019s nervousness are sufficient grounds to justify an investigative detention. In <em>Nathan, </em>while checking for license and registration, the officer also observed that (1) the van\u2019s ceiling appeared new and lower than normal; (2) the van\u2019s occupants seemed very nervous and provided inconsistent stories about their trip; and (3) Nathan was unable to produce identification.

We are further limited to considering only those facts that are most favorable to the State as the prevailing party on the motion. <em>Riddick v.

In considering the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, we extend great deference to the fact finding of the suppression hearing judge with respect to the weighing and determining first-level facts. <em>Perkins v.

Even so, as to the ultimate conclusionary fact of whether an action taken was proper, we must make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. <em>Id.; Perkins, </em>83 Md.App. at 346, 574 A.2d 356.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">. Appellant\u2019s Motion to Suppress was founded on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which\u2014through the Fourteenth Amendment\u2014is applicable to state prosecutions. <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). The Fourth Amendment provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\">. \u201cThe waiver of Fourth Amendment rights by a third party most often involves a spouse, cotenant or co-owner, or a parent or guardian.\u201d <em>In Re Tariq A-R-Y, </em>347 Md. 484, 493, 701 A.2d 691 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b245-9\">. Officers were first drawn to the attention of the vehicle when the friend\u2019s mother-in-law called police and stated there was a stolen rifle in the back seat of the car. Officers obtained a warrant to search the vehicle, but because the friend was so cooperative in the stop, they never showed the warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">. In <em>Shipman v. State, 291 </em>Ala. 484, 282 So.2d 700 (1973), several individuals were detained by police after a store owner complained lhat the individuals were misbehaving. Police observed one individual transfer an object (clearly not a weapon) from his hand into the top of his boot. Police seized the object under the plain view rationale. It turned out that the object contained heroin. The individual was convicted, but the conviction was reversed on the ground lhat there was no probable cause to believe that the object seized contained contraband. The Supreme Court of Alabama explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">The reason for this rule is apparent. If the rule were otherwise, an officer, acting on mere groundless suspicion, could seize anything and everything belonging to an individual which happened to be in plain view on the prosped lhat on further investigation some of it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>might prove to have been stolen or to be contraband. It would open the door to unreasonable confiscation of a person's property while a minute examination of it is made in an effort to find something criminal. Such a practice would amount to the \u2018\u2018general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges\u201d which was condemned in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>[403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.E.2d 564 <em>(1971)]supra. </em>Ex post facto justification of a seizure made on mere groundless suspicion, is totally contrary to the basic tenets of the Fourth Amendment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWy\"><em>Shipman, </em>291 Ala. at 488, 282 So.2d 700.

If Officer Wentland and Sergeant Lewis had been called to the dealership at a point in time when (1) the vehicle was in the process of being repaired, and (2) the suspicious compartments were clearly visible, the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine would not require suppression of information they obtained by observing whatever the mechanic was able to observe at that point in time. Third party consensual searches, however, are limited to items that are clearly visible. <em>United States v. Block, </em>590 F.2d 535, 541 (4th Cir.1978). Therefore, had those circumstances been present in the case at bar, the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine would operate to exclude only information acquired by the officers during an examination of those portions of the vehicle (1) that were not clearly visible, and (2) that the mechanic would not examine in the process of completing the work that the owner had authorized.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\">. The \"fruit of the poisonous tree\u201d doctrine does not operate to exclude whatever information was received by Sergeant Lewis <em>before </em>he began to search the vehicle. \"|T]he exclusionary rule as to evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment comes into play only when the evidence is obtained by governmental action.\" <em>Herbert v.

In the case at bar, however, the non-clearly erroneous findings of fact made by the circuit court do not permit us to conclude as a matter of law that the July 13, 2000 search can be upheld by (1) excluding the fruits of the search conducted by Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland on October 29, 1999, and (2) combining (he <em>observations </em>made by Sergeant Lewis on July 13, 2000 with the <em>information </em>received by Sergeant Lewis <em>before </em>he searched the vehicle on October 29, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b254-5\">.

Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 274, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002), the United States Supreme Court again emphasized that suppression hearing courts must examine the \"totality of the circumstances\u201d when making a \"reasonable suspicion\u201d determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">When discussing how' reviewing courts should make reasonable-suspicion determinations, we have said repeatedly that they must look at the \"totality of the circumstances\u201d of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a \u201cparticularized and objective basis\u201d for suspecting legal wrongdoing. This process allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that \"might well elude an untrained person.\u201d Although an officer\u2019s reliance on a mere \"hunch\u201d is insufficient to justify a stop, the likelihood of criminal activity need not rise to the level required for probable cause, and it falls considerably short of satisfying a preponderance of the evidence standard.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\">.

In finding that \"Sergeant Lewis and Detective Wentland moved the seat and lifted the carpeting to view what was ultimately determined to be the concealed compartments,\u201d the circuit court also rejected Sergeant Lewis\u2019 testimony that it was an employee of the dealership rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>than a law enforcement officer who \"pulled [the seat] back\u201d to \"show me what they had found which prompted them to call the police.\u201d Because that testimony was rejected, and the record contains no other evidence of what was actually told to the law enforcement officers before they began searching the vehicle, we are unable to conclude that the July 13, 2000 search can be justified on the basis of (1) the <em>observations </em>made by Sergeant Lewis on that date, and (2) the <em>information </em>provided to Sergeant Lewis on October 29, 1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
