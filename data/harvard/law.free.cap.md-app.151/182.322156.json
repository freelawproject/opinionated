It began when the Department issued a solicitation for proposals to provide such services. In response, PHP, among others, submitted a proposal. That proposal was accepted, and the Department and PHP entered into a health services contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">During the course of that contract, it became apparent to PHP that the facilities housed, on an average, far fewer inmates than PHP anticipated. The miscalculation was costly for PHP. Because it was being paid on a \u201cper inmate\u201d basis, it faced substantially higher monthly costs of operation than it had planned. It blamed its predicament upon what it claimed were misrepresentations by the Department as to the total number of inmates it could expect to service under the contract. It pointed out that the Department had required it, in preparing its proposal, to use a substantially higher figure of inmates than it was inclined to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">After an exchange of letters failed to produce a solution to this problem, PHP filed a Notice of Claim with the Department\u2019s procurement officer, seeking an equitable adjustment in the amount the Department paid PHP for each inmate. It informed the Department that the per capita price PHP used to calculate its proposal \u201cwas based on a projection of a number of inmates that was significantly higher than the actual number of average daily populations calculated each month for the facilities in the region.\u201d The Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>denied PHP\u2019s claim, and PHP appealed that decision to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">When the Board also denied its claim, PHP filed a petition for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. So did the Department. While PHP challenged the Board\u2019s holding that it was not entitled to an equitable adjustment, the Department challenged the Board\u2019s finding that PHP had filed a timely claim. The circuit court agreed that PHP\u2019s claim was timely, but disagreed with the Board\u2019s finding that PHP was not entitled to an equitable adjustment. It therefore remanded this case to the Board for further proceedings on the issue of damages. The Department then noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">The Department presents three issues for our review, which we have reworded and consolidated into two. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">I. Whether the Board of Contract Appeals correctly ruled that PHP was not entitled to additional compensation because the Department had not misrepresented the inmate population and in any event, even if such a misrepresentation had been made, PHP did not reasonably rely on it in preparing its proposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">II. Whether the Board erred in ruling that PHP\u2019s claim had been timely filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall hold, as to issue I, that the Board did not err in denying PHP\u2019s request for an equitable adjustment. Because we do so, we need not reach issue II.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">In February 1996, the Department solicited proposals from health care providers to provide health care services to inmates and detainees in correctional and detention facilities located in Baltimore City. Responding to that request, PHP Vice President of Operations, Thomas W. Burden, sent a letter, dated February 29, 1996, to Myles Carpeneto, the Department\u2019s Director of Procurement Services, requesting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>among other things, that Carpeneto provide PHP with the \u201cexpected average inmate population count for each facility-covered by this [request for proposals].\u201d He further asked, \u201cWill the State guarantee a minimum population for each site or for the contract as a whole?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">\u2022After receiving Burden\u2019s letter, the Department issued Addendum No. 1, dated March 15, 1996. That addendum stated that the total available beds at the facilities in the Baltimore region was 7,246. It also stated that the number of beds \u201crepresent the available beds for each facility as identified by the Department and are not related to the billable population.\u201d It defined the \u201cBillable Population Count\u201d as \u201cthe sum of the average daily populations for the month for each of the facilities in the Region less\u201d a certain category of parolees and probationers and \u201c[i]individuals in the booking process.\u201d And, responding directly to Burden\u2019s inquiry about whether the State would \u201cguarantee a minimum population,\u201d the Addendum stated that \u201c[t]he State will not guarantee a minimum population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">After receiving Addendum No. 1, PHP submitted an \u201cOriginal Proposal,\u201d dated March 26, 1996. This proposal stated that PHP\u2019s per capita price was $2,915.03. PHP computed that price by adding its \u201cPrimary Services Price,\u201d \u201cSecondary Services Price,\u201d \u201cOperating Costs,\u201d and \u201cEquipment Costs\u201d to arrive at a \u201cTotal Health Services Price Proposal\u201d of $18,947,715 and then dividing that amount by 6,500, its estimate of the future number of inmates that would be housed in the Baltimore facilities. That estimate, according to PHP, was based on materials provided by the Department and its \u201cown investigation of historical inmate population data.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">PHP then submitted a \u201cBest and Final Financial Offer\u201d or a \u201cBAFO Proposal,\u201d dated April 18, 1996. In this proposal, PHP increased its Total Health Services Price Proposal from $18,947,715 to $19,071,846 and its estimate of inmates from 6,500 to 6,850. Dividing the former by the latter, PHP arrived at a new per capita price of $2,784.21. Shortly after that, PHP submitted a second BAFO Proposal, dated May 16,1996. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>In that proposal, the Total Health Services Price Proposal was decreased to $17,436,694 but the divisor remained the same\u2014 6,850. Consequently, PHP\u2019s new per capita price was $2,545.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">PHP increased its estimate from 6,500 to 6,850, according to Burden, based on his \u201cbest estimate effort, distilling all of the information available to [him], as to what the actual billable population would be.\u201d This information included, among other things, the number of beds reported in Addendum No. 1, talks with employees of the \u201cincumbent contractor,\u201d and \u201cworkload figures\u201d from contracts in other areas of the state. It also included the number of inmates previously serviced, as reported in copies of the incumbent contractor\u2019s contracts, furnished by Carpeneto. Still, when asked whether he obtained \u201chistorical average daily population figures for the [Baltimore] region,\u201d Burden replied, \u201cNo. The State wouldn\u2019t provide it to us.\u201d The reason was that \u201cthe region was undergoing change,\u201d Burden testified. Specifically, \u201cthe two contracts that [PHP] would be replacing were ... being consolidated into one program\u201d; also, the State was \u201copening up a central [booking] and intake facility,\u201d as well as a new prison. Given these changes, Burden stated, \u201call historical figures were not to be relied upon,\u201d in estimating the inmate population for PHP\u2019s proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">After receiving PHP\u2019s second BAFO Proposal, the Department decided that the prices in the proposals submitted by PHP and the only other offeror were too high. According to Carpeneto\u2019s testimony before the Board, he informed PHP, at a conference with the offerors, of the need to use a divisor of 7,266 inmates, the number of inmates that \u201cwas the budgeted figure [the Department] had been given by the legislature.\u201d Carpeneto further stated: \u201c[W]e told [them] ... [the 7,266 number] had a certain amount of reliability to it, however, we could not guarantee that figure, that it could be higher or that it could be lower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">At that conference, Burden questioned Dr. Anthony Swetz, the Department\u2019s Director of Inmate Healthcare Services, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>about the inmate population under the contract. Later, he claimed, at his deposition, that Swetz had assured him that the number of inmates would be the \u201cleast of your problems.\u201d But he also conceded that \u201cwe never for a minute believed that we would have any more than 6850.\u201d As to his confidence that the 7,266 number required by Addendum No. 5 would be the inmate population, Burden said it was \u201c[f]ifty percent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">After the conference, the Department issued Addendum No. 5, stating that \u201cthe Agency, is making changes and clarifications ... in order to have you reduce your Total Price and Per Capita Price.\u201d One such change and clarification was that the offerors were to use 7,266 as a divisor. In other words, Addendum No. 5 required the offerors to \u201cbase the Total Price and Per Capita Price on the figure of 7,266 inmates.\u201d PHP submitted a third BAFO Proposal, dated May 20, 1996, with a Total Health Services Price of $16,544,508 and a divisor of 7,266 inmates. PHP computed its per capita price as $2,276.98.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In June 1996, the Department awarded the \u201cBaltimore Inmate Health Care\u201d contract to PHP. The contract was for \u201cthe provision of inmate health services in the Baltimore Region for the period of July 1, 1996 through June 30, 1997.\u201d The contract provided that PHP would receive payments monthly, based on the \u201c[Per Capita Price] multiplied by the Billable Population Count.\u201d The contract defined the Billable Population Count as \u201cthe sum of the average daily populations for the month for the facilities in the Region.\u201d The contract stated that the \u201caverage daily population will be based on the figures from the Resident Population column of the Average Daily Population report generated monthly by the [Department], but [will] be calculated to exclude\u201d a class of \u201c[individuals in pretrial status\u201d and of \u201c[probationers and parolees.\u201d In June 1997, the Department \u201cexercised its option to renew the contract for an additional year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">Several months later, PHP Vice President and CEO, Michael D. Starr, sent a letter, dated November 22, 1996, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>Swetz. In the letter, Starr pointed out \u201cthe revenue shortfall resulting from a variance in the number of inmates and increased operating costs resulting from increased intake processing volumes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">With respect to the revenue shortfall, Starr asserted that \u201c[s]ince the inception of this contract on July 1, 1996, the billable population count has been significantly below the level of 7,266 required as the Per Capita Price Divisor in ... Addendum [No.J 5.\u201d He also noted that \u201cdue to our initial uncertainty regarding the population at risk, PHP\u2019s first bid submission used a figure of 6,850 inmates, and we revised this figure upward only after receipt of Addendum [No.] 5.\u201d According to Starr, the inmate population count was 6,644 for July, 6,572 for August, 6,457 for September, and 6,474 for October, resulting in an average inmate population for these four months of 6,536.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Noting that PHP\u2019s contract price was comprised of its Primary Care Service Price, Secondary Care Services Price, Operating Cost, and Equipment Costs, he explained that PHP\u2019s \u201cPrimary Care Service Price ... is comprised entirely of <em>fixed </em>labor costs resulting directly from the contractually required staffing levels.\u201d And \u201c[s]inee the level of staffing is fixed by the contract, PHP is unable to reduce staffing and [its] associated costs regardless of the billable count.\u201d Consequently, \u201cfor each inmate under the prescribed level of 7,266, PHP incurs,\u201d he asserted, \u201can unreimbursed cost of $113.16 per month.\u201d The \u201cinmate population shortfall,\u201d Starr claimed, had caused a total revenue shortfall of $330,087.72 for July, August, September, and October.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u201c[T]o avoid submission of a claim to the State for an equitable adjustment,\u201d Starr proposed in his letter that the Department consider adding a \u201cMonthly Population Adjustment\u201d to the contract. This adjustment would, according to Starr, \u201crepresent the revenue shortfall computed by multiplying the Population Shortfall times the [Primary Care Service Price].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>In a written response to Starr, dated December 19, 1996, Swetz stated that the Department issued Addendum No. 5 \u201cto fix the capita price divisor to eliminate differential pricing and identify the lowest [offeror].\u201d He further stated that the \u201cnumber represents the number of beds available within the Baltimore region in which the Department may house inmates/detainees. Each offeror had the same opportunity to staff its proposals and to establish its per capita price against that number.\u201d Swetz also questioned the accuracy of Starr\u2019s statement that PHP\u2019s primary care costs were fixed. He proposed that if \u201cPHP can reduce personnel costs and maintain the level of the delivery of treatment services, and amend [its] monthly staffing schedule to our mutual satisfaction, we may be able to reduce your revenue shortfall.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">On April 21, 1997, Starr filed, with Carpeneto, a \u201cNotice of Claim\u201d letter requesting modifications to the contract with respect to payment to the contractor and per capita price; and equitable adjustments, damages and other appropriate relief to cover underpayment made to the contractor by the agency because the per capita price was based upon a projection of a number of inmates that was significantly higher than the actual number of average daily populations calculated each month for the facilities in the region, because inmate intakes are substantially higher and therefore, associated expenses for those additional intakes are more costly than projected at the time of contracting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Following the notice of claim, Starr sent a follow-up letter, dated May 20, 1997, to Carpeneto. Among other things, the letter raised the issue of \u201cInmate Population Shortages\u201d and claimed that: \u201cBy mandating [7,266 as the divisor in Addendum No. 5] and accepting PHP\u2019s Total Price, the Department has <em>de facto </em>created a fixed per capita reimbursement rate for primary services\u201d and thus \u201c[f]or each inmate below the level of 7,266 PHP is inappropriately deprived of reimbursement for a fixed cost portion of the Primary Services Price.\u201d It further asserted that \u201cPHP\u2019s total Primary Services Price of $9,866,664 divided by 7,266 equals $1,357.92 or $113.16 per inmate per month.\u201d The letter included a chart that com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>pared the \u201cspecified\u201d inmate population of 7,266 with the \u201cactual\u201d populations from July 1996 to April 1997 and then calculated a \u201cshortfall\u201d number of inmates for each month. The chart showed a total shortfall of 6,848 inmates from July 1996 through April 1997. Thus, the letter requested an equitable adjustment to be calculated as follows: \u201c6,848 inmate X $113.16 = $774,919.68.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">In a letter, dated July 2, 1998, Carpeneto denied PHP\u2019s claim, stating that \u201c[a]t no time, either during the solicitation process or in the contract, did the Department state that your firm would be compensated for a specific number of inmates.\u201d He further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">[T]he Department specifically stated in the solicitation documents and during negotiations that, although the Department was providing information about the number of beds in the Baltimore Region, the inmate population in the Region and the divisor that the offerors were to use to determine the Per Capita Price, the Department would not guarantee a minimum population.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">After the denial of its claim, PHP filed a Notice of Appeal with the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a written opinion, the Board denied PHP\u2019s appeal. After resolving the issue of the timeliness of PHP\u2019s claim in PHP\u2019s favor, the Board declared \u201cthat the Department\u2019s representation in Addendum No. 5 or otherwise of the number of inmates in the Billable Population Count does not constitute an erroneous representation of a material matter that [PHP] was entitled to rely upon.\u201d It added that even if \u201cthe Department made a positive and affirmative representation as to the number of inmates to be housed in the Baltimore Region, ... [PHP] did not reasonably rely on that number, and may not, therefore, prevail on its claim for an equitable adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Following the Board\u2019s decision, PHP filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City for judicial review of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>decision; whereupon the Department filed a cross-petition for judicial review. After a hearing, the circuit court issued an order granting PHP\u2019s petition for judicial review, reversing the Board\u2019s denial of PHP\u2019s request for an equitable adjustment, and remanding the matter to the Board to determine the amount of that adjustment. The circuit court also denied the Department\u2019s cross-petition for judicial review, and affirmed the Board\u2019s finding as to the timeliness of PHP\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">From that decision, the Department noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">When reviewing an administrative agency decision, our role \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Dep\u2019t Of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v.

Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 58, 548 A.2d 819 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">In making this determination, we must give \u201c \u2018deference ... not only [to the Board\u2019s] fact-findings, but to the drawing of inferences from the facts as well.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Billhimer, </em>314 Md. at 59, 548 A.2d 819). We must also accord deference to the Board\u2019s \u201c \u2018application of law to those [factual findings], if reasonably supported by the administrative record, viewed as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>Berkshire Life Ins.

Thus, if the agency\u2019s decision \u201c \u2018is not predicated solely on an error of law, we will not overturn it if a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the agency.\u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>(quoting <em>Billhimer, </em>314 Md. at 59, 548 A.2d 819).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The Department contends that the Board correctly concluded that the Department did not misrepresent the Billable Population Count to PHP and, even if it did, PHP did not reasonably rely on that figure in preparing its proposal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>A contractor may pursue the Government for damages under a contract for a misrepresentation in contract documents. <em>T. Brown Constr., Inc. v. Pena, </em>132 F.3d 724, 728 (Fed.Cir.1997). To prevail on such a claim, however, \u201cthe contractor must show that the Government made an erroneous representation of a material fact that the contractor honestly and reasonably relied on to the contractor\u2019s detriment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201c \u2018[a] misrepresentation is material if it would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent, or if the maker .knows that it would be likely to induce the recipient to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 162(2) (1979)). But, an \u201cintent to mislead is not an essential element of actionable misrepresentation in the breach of contract context. An inadvertent misrepresentation stemming from negligence is fully as damaging as a deliberate one to the party, who relies on it to his detriment.\u201d <em>Womack v.

In the context of government contracting, such a standard is measured from the perspective of what the reasonable contractor would have done when charged with knowledge common within the industry. In general, the test of reasonableness focuses on whether through such knowledge, or through some affirmative signal from the government, the contractor was on notice <em>not </em>to rely on the utterance in issue, or that all such statements should be investigated for the reasons given. Failure to heed such warnings leaves any risk created by the alleged misrepresentation with the contractor, and renders a contractor unable to recover under a theory of misrepresentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number><em>Gregory Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>11 Cl.Ct. 489, 503 (Cl.Ct.1986) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">PHP contends that the Board erred in concluding that the Department \u201cmade no \u2018legally binding representation of the future Billable Population Count,\u2019 entitling PHP to an equitable adjustment.\u201d In support of that claim, PHP claims that \u201c[t]he Department, by requiring that the proposals be based on 7,266 inmates and defining that number as the \u2018Per Capita Price Divisor,\u2019 directly represented in Addendum [No.] 5 that the contractors should anticipate that the average Billable Population Count would be 7,266.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In its written opinion, the Board stated that \u201c[t]he number of inmates in the Billable Population herein significantly affects the Contract Price and is thus a material matter.\u201d Yet, the Board found that \u201cthe Department\u2019s representation in Addendum No. 5 or otherwise of the number of inmates in the Billable Population Count does not constitute an erroneous representation of a material matter that [PHP] was entitled to rely upon.\u201d The solicitation of bids, the Board noted, did not \u201cprovide any specifics concerning what the population count would actually be during the term of the [c]ontract.\u201d Instead, as the Board observed, \u201cthe [offerors] were left to determine their own number in submitting their proposals and were not provided with a minimum number of inmates that would be housed in the Baltimore Region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Nor did the Department\u2019s position on this issue vary during the bid solicitation process. In response to PHP\u2019s pre-proposal request for a \u201cbest estimate\u201d of the number of inmates, the Department issued Addendum No. 1. While indicating that the number of \u201cavailable beds\u201d in the Baltimore Region was 7,246, that addendum expressly stated that 7,246 \u201crepresents] the available beds ... and [was] not related to the billable population.\u201d And in direct response to PHP\u2019s inquiry, it declared, \u201cThe State will not guarantee a minimum population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">After Addendum No. 1 was issued, PHP submitted a proposal using an estimated population count of 6,500 as the divisor. Once PHP \u201cascertained the number prior [offerors] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>used in the region as a population count and the region\u2019s likely staffing needs,\u201d PHP submitted a proposal using 6,850 as a divisor. The Department, as noted earlier, thereafter decided that the proposals submitted by PHP and the other offeror were too high. It therefore issued Addendum No. 5, requiring that \u201c[t]he offeror ... base the Total Price and Per Capita Price on the figure of 7,266 inmates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">But the Department\u2019s Director of Procurement Services, Myles Carpeneto, explained to PHP that this number was not the Department\u2019s estimate of the average monthly inmate population but \u201cthe budgeted figure [the Department] had been given by the Legislature.\u201d In other words, the Department had been given, according to Carpeneto, \u201cmoney to handle 7266 inmates.\u201d Although Carpeneto stated that the figure \u201chad a certain amount of reliability,\u201d it reminded PHP \u201cthat it could be higher or that it could be lower\u201d and flatly stated that the Department \u201cwould not guarantee that figure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The Board acknowledged, however, that, at a conference, a PHP representative asked the Department\u2019s negotiating team if they expected 7,000 inmates to be in the Baltimore Region, to which the Department\u2019s Director of Inmate Health Care Services, Dr. Anthony Swetz, responded: \u201c \u2018Oh, you don\u2019t have to worry about that; we\u2019ll have plenty of inmates. As a matter of fact, that will be the least of your problems.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But the Board found that this statement was not \u201ca legally sufficient basis for [PHP] to rely on an average of 7,266 inmates per month in the coming year to forecast its profit picture under the Contract.\u201d We agree, particularly in light of the Department\u2019s repeated declarations that it was not guaranteeing the number of inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Finally, the Board found that, even if \u201cthe Department made a positive and affirmative representation as to the number of inmates ... [PHP] did not reasonably rely on that number, and may not, therefore, prevail on its claim for an equitable adjustment.\u201d In so finding, the Board cited many of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>the same facts it relied upon in determinating that there had been no misrepresentation by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The Board pointed out that \u201c[t]he procurement documents did not provide offerors with a prediction of the billable inmate population for the region.\u201d And, prior to awarding the contract to PHP, the Department declined to provide any estimate of the number of inmates that would be housed at the facilities in question, despite PHP\u2019s request to do so. In fact, the Department did not even provide, as the Board noted, \u201chistorical Average Daily Population figures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">According to the Board, PHP understood the Department\u2019s hesitancy in providing such figures. It noted that PHP\u2019s Vice President, Thomas W. Burden, testified, at his deposition, that \u201c \u2018all historical figures were not relied upon\u2019 because the population capacities of correctional facilities in the State were changing due to the opening of two new prisons, one in Baltimore and the other in Western Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The Board further observed that PHP conducted its own investigation of what the likely future inmate population would be, basing it on a \u201cprior offeror\u2019s experience in the region and the region\u2019s likely staffing needs.\u201d And that \u201cpre-award investigation determined that 6,850 was the likely population count for the region.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Furthermore, Burden testified that, until the issuance of Addendum No. 5 and Dr. Swetz\u2019s comments at the conference\u2014-the influence of which the Board discounted-\u2014\u201cwe never for a minute believed that we would have any more [inmates] than 6850.\u201d He confirmed that, after Addendum No. 5 was issued, his confidence in 7,266 as a proper estimate was \u201c[fjifty percent.\u201d And the Board found that Carpeneto\u2019s statement that the Department would not guarantee 7,266 as a floor, put PHP on notice not to rely on that figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">After addressing the reliance issue, the Board stated, \u201c[i]n summary we have before us a record that reflects that [PHP] seeks to recoup alleged losses sustained as a result of its business decision.\u201d It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>It is undisputed that when [PHP] submitted its cost proposal in response to Addendum No. 5, it was free to increase its proposal, i.e., the numbers comprising the numerator, to cover its uncertainty concerning the actual regional population that would be realized. However, the record reflects that [PHP], an experienced contractor whose representatives were intimately familiar with the importance of prison popu-lation [sic] and how such population affects correctional contracts, exercised its business judgment and chose not to increase the numbers comprising the numerator because it believed if it raised the numbers it would not obtain the Contract. Thus, in order to obtain the Contract, [PHP] assumed the risk that its Per Capita Price, submitted in response to Addendum No. 5, might undercompensate it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">In support of its conclusion that PHP \u201ccould have adjusted its final cost proposal to protect itself against the risk of population shortfall,\u201d the Board cited the following excerpt of Burden\u2019s deposition testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">Q. But you could have increased your fee in your final proposal, so as to give you a higher per-capita rate and, therefore, provide for the contingency of the population falling short of the 7266 number?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">A. We could have also not bid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">Q. I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">A. I\u2019m not sure that the results would have been any different. The goal was to achieve a winning price, making the best use of all the information provided us to the State and, you know, through some, you know, mathematical machination, come up with a\u2014an approach that basically shifted the cost from one place to another wouldn\u2019t have gotten you to a winning price. So why bother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Q. So its fair to say in preparing your final proposal, you\u2019re balancing your assessment of the risks involved in you winning the bid at the proposed price against having the low price and, therefore, being a successful [offeror]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>A. Oh, sure. That\u2019s the nature of the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Yet, PHP argues that it was \u201centitled to rely upon the [Department\u2019s] representations.\u201d It claims that \u201c[t]o the extent the Department now alleges that it may have verbally suggested that it would not guarantee its representation, even assuming that such a communication actually occurred, it would not approach the specific exculpatory and disclaimer provisions required to relieve the Department of its responsibilities associated with making erroneous representations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">In support of that argument, PHP invokes <em>Raymond International, Inc. v. Baltimore County, </em>45 Md.App. 247, 412 A.2d 1296 (1980) and <em>Joseph F. Trionfo &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Board of Education, </em>41 Md.App. 103, 395 A.2d 1207 (1979). In <em>Raymond, </em>PHP claims, this Court \u201cdeclined to relieve the Government of responsibility for inaccurate representations,\u201d despite \u201cextensive and direct exculpatory clauses intended to place the responsibility and risk of inaccurate information upon the contractor.\u201d And, in <em>Trionfo, </em>PHP maintains that we stressed \u201chow detailed and specific a release must be to absolve the procuring agency of responsibility for its representations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>Raymond, </em>a contractor entered an agreement with Baltimore County to repair the piers of a bridge. 45 Md.App. at 250, 412 A.2d 1296. After starting the repairs, the contractor claimed it discovered that the specifications provided by the County\u2019s engineer were inaccurate. Consequently, the contractor maintained, he had to perform additional work for which he should be compensated. <em>Id. </em>After a bench trial, the circuit court held, among other things, that Raymond International was not entitled to the extra compensation it sought and that the contract had placed the burden of reasonable inspection on it. <em>Id. </em>at 251, 253, 412 A.2d 1296.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">On appeal, we defined the issue as \u201cwhether [the contractor] was required to verify independently the information upon which [the contractor] based its bid, or whether [the contractor] was justified in relying on the information supplied by the County and its engineer as to the plans and specifications for the project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 253-54, 412 A.2d 1296. We concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that the contractor was not \u201creasonably able to discover the true facts for itself and was, therefore, entitled to rely on the representations made by the County and [engineer].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258, 412 A.2d 1296. We observed that specifications prepared by the engineer for the County were \u201cmaterially wrong and substantially inaccurate\u201d and that the conditions the engineer found and reported to the County and bidders \u201cwere substantially different than those encountered by [the contractor] when it began to perform the work required by the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257-58, 412 A.2d 1296. Furthermore, we noted that the County and engineer \u201cknew or should have known the representations ... were inaccurate\u201d as the engineer had been inspecting piers for the County for years. <em>Id. </em>at 258, 412 A.2d 1296. Given the nature of the information at issue and the expense and difficulty in acquiring it, we concluded that it would have imposed a substantial cost on the contractor to verify the specifications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\"><em>Raymond </em>obviously presents a fact pattern substantially different from the one presented by this case. In <em>Raymond, </em>an engineer, with many years experience in inspecting the County\u2019s piers, prepared inaccurate specifications which were then given to the contractor for its use and reliance. Moreover, in that case, it would have been too costly, we found, for the contractor to obtain the information on its own. But, in this case, the Board found, and we agree, that Addendum No. 5\u2019s requirement that the offerors use 7,266 as a divisor was not a specification nor was it intended as information upon which PHP could rely. Addendum No. 5, as the Board noted, \u201cwas issued for the purpose of obtaining, a lower per Capita Price from the two contractors then in competition by having them use the higher divisor.\u201d \u201cThe Agency,\u201d Addendum No. 5 stated, \u201cis making changes and clarifications ... in order to have you reduce your Total Price and Per Capita Price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Nor does <em>Trionfo </em>support PHP\u2019s reliance claim. In that case, a contractor was awarded a'bid to construct a school by a board of education. While excavating the site, the contractor\u2019s subcontractor encountered a \u201csubstantial quantity of rocks in the subsurface,\u201d which caused it more difficulty in excavating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>material from the site than originally contemplated. 41 Md. App. at 104, 395 A.2d 1207. After compensating the subcontractor for the additional work, the contractor sought reimbursement from the education board because of the \u201cinaccurate and misleading representations made by [the board] concerning the nature of the subsurface conditions on the site.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">The parties\u2019 contract placed the responsibility of excavation on the contractor and required that the contractor not rely on subsurface information provided by the owner and architect. The contract also required that bidders make their own investigations and that neither the owner nor architect would be responsible for additional compensation for excavation done under the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 395 A.2d 1207. In addition, the contractors obtained test boring data by submitting a written request which \u201crelease[d] the Owner and Architect from any responsibility or obligation as to its accuracy or completeness or for any additional compensation for work performed under the contract due to assumptions based on use of such furnished information.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Still, the contractor argued that it was entitled to rely on the subsurface soil data furnished by the education board, despite the release it executed to obtain the test boring data and the contracting provisions disclaiming its accuracy. <em>Id. </em>at 105, 395 A.2d 1207. We disagreed. We held that the contractor under the circumstances had no right to rely on the test boring data. <em>Id. </em>at 111, 395 A.2d 1207. We stated that \u201c[i]n exchange for the privilege of obtaining the subsurface soil data, compiled by appellee for its own use, appellant expressly released appellee from any responsibility for the accuracy of the information and from any liability for work which was unanticipated due to assumptions based on that information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We further pointed out that the excavation work under the contract included any subsurface material encountered, that the contract made no representation about subsoil conditions, that the test boring data was excluded from contract documents, and that test boring data could only be obtained by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>bidders in exchange for the release. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 395 A.2d 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">PHP observes that its contract with the Department contained no release provision similar to that found in <em>Trionfo. </em>But <em>Trionfo </em>does not stand for the proposition that, absent a provision releasing an owner from responsibility for the accuracy of information furnished to a bidder, a bidder is entitled to rely on such information. Although the contract at issue here does not contain such a provision, it was clear, from the verbal and written representations made by the Department to all offerors, including PHP, that it was assuming no responsibility for estimating or guaranteeing the number of inmates at its Baltimore facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">We therefore hold that the Board\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe Department\u2019s representation in Addendum No. 5 or otherwise of the number of inmates in the Billable Population Count does not constitute an erroneous representation of a material matter that [PHP] was entitled to rely upon\u201d is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE DECISION OF THE AGENCY; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\">.

With respect to this claim, the Board stated in its written opinion that while PHP \u201cin certain proceedings on appeal may have referred to this claim as one based on negligent misrepresentation, [PHP] agrees that this claim is not a tort claim but is a breach of contract claim based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>an alleged erroneous representation [by the Department].\" PHP does not dispute this.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">.
