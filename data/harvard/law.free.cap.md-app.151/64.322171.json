The court sentenced appellant to two consecutive twelve-year terms of imprisonment for his violations of Md. Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), Ait. 27, \u00a7 35C. This consolidated appeal followed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">From 1980 to 1985, appellant, then in his 30\u2019s, served as the chaplain, a teacher, and a \u201cHall Master\u201d at Saint James School (\u201cSJS\u201d or the \u201cSchool\u201d), an Episcopal boarding school near Hagerstown. In 1985, he moved to Illinois, where he served as rector of Saint Andrew\u2019s Parish until February 5, 2001. The victims, Miller and Curtis, were high school boarding students at SJS during appellant\u2019s tenure as chaplain.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">As to both trials, appellant asks us to consider whether the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence in Illinois pursuant to a search warrant. The warrant was issued about sixteen years after the alleged crimes occurred, and the search pertained to appellant\u2019s residence in Illinois, a location unrelated to the place of the alleged offenses. Therefore, appellant claims the search warrant was founded on stale information rather than probable cause. In addition, we are asked to resolve whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the court below erroneously admitted \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence at the Curtis trial by allowing Miller to testify to appellant\u2019s abuse of him. Finally, we must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion at the Miller trial by denying appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial after Miller alluded to appellant\u2019s abuse of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Behrel frames three questions for our review, which we have reformulated slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">I. With respect to both trials, did the circuit court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence recovered during the execution of the search warrant issued for appellant\u2019s residence in Illinois?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-7\">II. Did the trial court err in admitting \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence at the Curtis trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">III. Did the trial court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion , for mistrial in the Miller trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm appellant\u2019s conviction in the Miller trial, vacate appellant\u2019s conviction in the Curtis trial, and remand that case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">I. THE MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"A9z\">A. Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">On December 11, 2000, Behrel was charged with the sexual child abuse of both Curtis and Miller. Following appellant\u2019s indictments, the Maryland State Police contacted the authorities in Illinois, to obtain and execute a search warrant for 302 Buckingham Drive in Grayslake, Illinois, where appellant then resided. Louis Archbold, a special investigator with the Lake County prosecutor\u2019s office, was assigned to the matter. An Illinois search warrant was issued on February 2, 2001, and executed by the Grayslake, Illinois Police Department on February 5, 2001, in the presence of Trooper First Class (\u201cTFC\u201d) Michael Potter of the Maryland State Police. During the search, the police seized a footlocker that matched the description of a trunk provided by Curtis and Miller. Pornographic materials found inside the footlocker were also seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Claiming that the information supporting the warrant was stale, appellant moved in both cases to suppress the footlocker and the pornographic materials. He argued that the warrant did not establish probable cause, because the events described in the affidavit occurred some sixteen years earlier and in another state. At the joint hearing held on August 13, 2001, Potter testified for the State; appellant did not present any witnesses. What follows is a summary of the evidence adduced at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The investigation of appellant began on April 10,1998, when Curtis reported to the Flathead County, Montana Sheriffs Department that, from 1983 to 1985, while he was a high school student at SJS, appellant repeatedly subjected him to sexual abuse. During a recorded interview, Curtis claimed that the abuse began with fondling and progressed to oral sex and sodomy in appellant\u2019s SJS campus apartment. In addition, Curtis reported that appellant had sodomized another student named Jeff Miller. Further, Curtis disclosed that appellant stored pornographic material and sexual aids in a footlocker that he used as a coffee table in his campus apartment. Curtis\u2019s complaint and interview were forwarded to the Maryland State Police' for further investigation. After the matter was assigned to Potter, he met with Curtis. According to Potter, Curtis reiterated the claims that he had made to the Montana Sheriffs Department, including the information regarding appellant\u2019s sexual activities with Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Potter also stated that Miller was located in Alexandria, Virginia about six to nine months later. He obtained a formal statement from Miller on June 29, 2000. Miller told Potter that, while he was a student at SJS from 1981 to 1984, he was sexually abused by appellant in appellant\u2019s campus apartment. According to Miller, the abuse progressed from fondling to fellatio and sodomy. Further, Miller recalled that appellant had a \u201cfoot locker\u201d that he \u201cused as a coffee table ...,\u201d in which appellant stored photographs that he took of Miller \u201cin sexual positions against [his] will.\u201d Although Miller acknowledged that he knew of Curtis, he claimed he had \u201cno real dealings with him,\u201d and the two were not friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>On cross-examination, Potter admitted that the alleged abuses occurred in Maryland; there were no allegations that any of the offenses had occurred at appellant\u2019s residence in Illinois. Moreover, Potter acknowledged that the abuse had occurred some fifteen to twenty years prior to the execution of the warrant. Potter also conceded that he had no \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of anything in appellant\u2019s residence in 2001 that would constitute evidence of the alleged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The Complaint for Search Warrant (\u201cthe Complaint\u201d) was admitted in evidence, along with the supporting affidavit executed by Archbold. The items sought in the search included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">\n<em>[A] footlocker and/or storage trunk, photographs and videos depicting child pornography, inhalants (i.e.: \u201cRush\"), written correspondence, computers, computer hardware, computer disks, and all items related to the offenses of criminal sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual abuse and aggravated criminal sexual abuse and child pornography.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In his affidavit, Archbold relied entirely on information provided to him by Potter. Because the content of the affidavit is central to the issue of staleness, we quote from it at length:</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\n<em>Your affiant states that he was contacted by Trooper First Class, Michael Shane Potter, a member of the Maryland State Police, regarding Father Kenneth K. Behrel of St. Andrew Parish in Grayslake. Trooper Potter has been with the Maryland State Police for 27 years. He completed the Maryland State Police Academy and is certified as a police officer in the State of Maryland. Trooper Potter has an Associates [sic] Degree in Administration of Justice from Hagerstown Junior College and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice from the University of Baltimore. In addition Trooper Potter has attended numerous training courses including courses dealing with child abuse, crimes against persons and child pornography. Trooper Potter has been assigned to criminal investigations for the past twelve (12) years. During Trooper Potter[\u2019s] </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\n<em>police career he has been involved in the execution of W search and seizure warrants in Washington County, Maryland. Trooper Potter has investigated and assisted in over 300 crimes involving child abuse and sexual offenses. Trooper Potter has also attended in-service schools with the Maryland State Police, seminars and other classes dealing with child abuse and sexual offenses. Trooper Potter has learned through his training that sexual offenders tend to keep mementoes of prior acts along with pictures and videos.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\"><em>Your affiant states that Trooper Potter related, the following facts regarding Father Kenneth K Behrel; [sic] On April 10, 1998, victim Matthew Curtis made a complaint to investigators at the Flathead County, Montana Sheriffs Department that he had been the victim of sexual assaults in Washington County, Maryland. A recorded statement of the victim was taken and fonvarded to the Hagerstown Barracks of the Maryland State Police. In his statement, the victim alleged that he lived on campus as a student at St. James School. He attended classes at the school between September 1982 and June 1986. The victim said the sexual abuse by Father Kenneth Behrel, a priest who lived in the apartment on campus, began around January or February 1983. The last sexual encounter between Behrel [and Curtis] was sometime in 1985. </em>As <em>the school priest and instructor at the school, Behrel was responsible for the care and supervision of the students, including the victim. The abuse began with Behrel fondling the victim\u2019s penis. The abuse always occurred in Behrel\u2019s campus apartment. The abuse progressed to Behrel performing oral sex on the victim, the victim performing oral sex on Behrel, and Behrel performing sodomy on the victim. On many occasions, Behrel masturbated the victim and on at least one occasion the victim masturbated Behrel. During these sexual encounters, Behrel would get a pornographic video movie from a footlocker that he used as a coffee table stand in his apartment. This footlocker was kept locked by Behrel [and] also contained lubricant he used just prior </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>to sodomizing the victim. The footlocker also contained pornographic magazines. During these sexual encounters, Behrel told the victim that he had also sodomized another student at the school and he identified that student as \u201cJeff\u2019 Miller. The victim did not know Miller personally but knew of him. Miller was two years ahead of him at the school. The victim has never talked to Miller about any topic including the allegations of abuse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\n<em>A check of school records at St. James School revealed that both victims, Curtis and Miller, had attended school there during the tenure of Father Behrel. Records indicated that Behrel had been a priest at the school between September 1980 and June 1985. Both victims were involved in a select group of males assigned to Behrel for training in religious functions at the school such as sacristans.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\n<em>Victim Jeffrey Miller was located living in Alexandria, Virginia in the Spring of 1999. He was reluctant to be interviewed because he was now married and had a family. After several months, Miller consented to be interviewed. He said he was a student at St. James School between September 1981 and May 1984. He. was a live on campus student. Miller said that he became acquainted with Father Behrel from his participation in religious functions at the school beginning as a[n] acolyte. Behrel allowed him to come to his campus apartment and watch television in the evenings because of his association in religious functions. In 1982, Miller found himself being treated \u201cspecial\u201d by Behrel and was allowed to watch television alone after hours in Behrel\u2019s apartment. Behrel began giving him back massages under his clothing. Behrel also gave alcoholic beverages to Miller during this time. These massages progressed until Behrel was massaging his genital area. During this time, Behrel fondled Miller\u2019s penis. The events escalated over a short period of time to Behrel taking off Miller\u2019s clothes, masturbating him, and performing oral sex on him. The sexual abuse continued during the remaining years that Miller attended the school with Miller </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\n<em>always told to come to Behrel's apartment one day a week. During that time, Behrel would engage in sexual activity with Miller. The activity escalated to include Behrel performing sodomy on Miller. During the sexual activity, Behrel would show Miller pornographic movies which he obtained from a footlocker that he used as a coffee table in his apartment. He also obtained a lubricant from the same locker. During the sexual activity, Behrel also took photographs of Miller. Some of the photographs were of Miller nude and others were taken as Behrel was performing sodomy on Miller, taking a picture of the sexual act. The photographs were kept in a stack held by a rubber-band and kept in the footlocker which was always locked and Behrel had the key. Miller also took several trips with Behrel during his time as a student at St. James including trips to Chicago, Illinois and Michigan. During these trips, Behrel also engaged in sexual activity with Miller to include oral sex and sodomy at various locations in various states. Trooper Potter advised your affiant that an indictment has been issued in Maryland for Kenneth K Behrel for the above listed offenses.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">(Boldface added; italics in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Urging the court to suppress the evidence, appellant\u2019s attorney said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">All we have in the complaint for a search warrant is Trooper Potter\u2019s belief that some sexual offenders sometimes keep mementoes. I submit that that is not sufficient probable cause. The cases cited by the State for longer periods than say eleven months ... involve business records and where people have gone to see those business records or see file cabinets in the person\u2019s home shortly before the affidavit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">I would submit, [Y]our Honor, that if probable cause is found in this case, probable cause can be found in any case by someone merely submitting [sic]. I know of no on-going activity than the incisive nature of drug trafficking. And I submit that it would be more than reasonable for an officer to state that, \u201cIt\u2019s my experience that a previous drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>offender ... unless he gets treatment will continue in drug trafficking and probably would have something in their apartment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-6\">[W]e don\u2019t even have a search of the residence at Saint James. <em>We have a search of a residence after someone has moved and I don\u2019t agree with [the Prosecution] that twenty years later we may have the same furniture after moving on different occasions. You might. You might not.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\"><em>But more importantly, it wasn\u2019t furniture they were looking for. </em>But ... and ironically no mementoes of Mr. Curtis or Mr. Miller were found in the search. There were no such photographs or mementoes found of them. But nevertheless the State, I assume, wishes to bring in these items to argue that the defendant is a bad person and leads a contrary lifestyle than most of us would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">But in any event, I believe there is simply [a] lack of probable cause in the warrant. I don\u2019t believe the magistrate should have issued it....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">The State countered that, as to the footlocker and its contents, the information was not rendered stale by the passage of time. It argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-11\">[U]nlike drugs or lottery tickets, which may be contraband per se[,] this trunk is not contraband per se. <em>It\u2019s an item of furniture. And it\u2019s not unreasonable to believe that this item of furniture that [appellant] had while he was in Saint James School is an item of furniture that he would continue to keep throughout his life. And so while this may be a significant number of years after the fact, I would ask the court to consider the special character of the piece </em>... of the item that was sought and to look at that item not as contraband per se but as <em>furniture and something that the defendant would hang on to, which in fact, we know that he did.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Your Honor____As we know ... the police are encouraged to seek search warrants. And so did the magistrate, did the issuing judge in Illinois have a substantial basis for issuing the search warrant that he did? And I would submit to the Court that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Evaporation of probable cause may well occur with a drug case, with lottery tickets but here it is an on-going item ... or it is an item which he continues to have in his presence. <em>It\u2019s furniture and it has a special character that these other items don\u2019t have. </em>And so, I submit to the Court that there was in fact probable cause to issue this search warrant for this property.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Concluding that \u201c[pjrobable cause was not stale,\u201d the court denied the suppression motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">Well I have read both of the interviews that form the basis of the statement of probable cause upon which the search warrant was issued in Illinois. Just as a matter of reference, Page 6 of the interview with Curtis... <em>Mr. Curtis talks first about the footlocker. </em>[Curtis said:] <em>\u201cI remember another specific incident ivhen he had a footlocker at the base of his couch </em>and it had a lock on it. Inside was the porno magazines and a porno tape ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-10\">And <em>in the statement of Jeffrey [Miller] it first talks about the locker </em>on Page 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-11\"><em>\u201cI recall furniture as a footlocker, ah which was used as a coffee table to the sofa, </em>which in fact was laying on that particular sofa at the time and it certainly had some things in it which we will later come across.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>He then goes on to graphically describe the activities. He talks about photographs, Page 10. The type photos he was talking about, \u201cWere they Polaroid photos?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-5\">Yes they were.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">So you could see them immediately after it was done. Did he show them to you?[\u201d]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Jeffrey\u2019s answer, \u201cI don\u2019t know if they were in an album but he would ... bundle ... them together and <em>I recall seeing that in his footlocker </em>that I told you about acted as a coffee table in his apartment....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">It was a black footlocker, kind of a dark with some beading, a standard kind of footlocker____\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">That was part of the information that became the statement of probable cause to believe that there was evidence of crime, evidence of methodology, evidence of instruments, specifically \u25a0 the footlocker. The complaint for the search warrant was not general in nature. It requests the search warrant for the purpose of seizing the following described instruments, articles and things: <em>a footlocker and/or storage trunk, </em>photographs and videos depicting child pornography, inhalants\u2014i.e. rush, written correspondence, computers, et-cetera that would be relating to the offenses of sexual abuse, criminal sexual abuse, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, child pornography.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AA1\">1. Probable Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">Appellant contends that the court erred in failing to suppress the footlocker and its contents, claiming \u201cthat there was no probable cause to believe that the defendant\u2019s home in [Illinois in] 2001 contained evidence of alleged offenses which occurred in another state some 15-20 years earlier.\u201d According to appellant, \u201cthe search was so far removed from the date of the alleged crimes some fifteen years earlier that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>warrant would have been defective as a result of this staleness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The State counters:</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Given [the] allegations of sexual misconduct and of storing pornography, sexual aids and explicit photographs of one of the victims, in conjunction with the averment of Trooper Potter\u2019s knowledge that \u201csexual offenders tend to keep mementoes of prior acts along -with pictures and videos,\u201d the judge\u2019s decision to issue the warrant was supported by a substantial basis to believe that evidence would be found at Behrel\u2019s apartment in Grayslake, Illinois.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution proscribes the issuance of any warrant \u201cbut upon probable cause, supported by Oath and affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const. Amend. IV. To be sure, \u201c[a] judicially authorized warrant is the cornerstone of the Fourth Amendment....\u201d <em>Wiegmann v.

State, </em>7 Md.App. 491, 493, 256 A.2d 333 (1969) (citation omitted); <em>see Braxton, </em>123 Md.App. at 622, 720 A.2d 27. Nevertheless, to effectuate the preference for warrants, deference is accorded to the issuing judge\u2019s determination. <em>See Gates, </em>462 U.S. at 236, 103 S.Ct. 2317; <em>McDonald v.

The Court explained in <em>Peterson v.

In his treatise discuss<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ing search and seizure law, LaFave noted that \u201c \u2018a highly incriminating or consumable item of personal property is less likely to remain in one place as long as an item of property which is not consumable or which is innocuous in itself or not particularly incriminating.\u2019 \u201d 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.7(a), at 348 (3d ed. 1996) (\u201cLaFave\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v.

Judge Moylan, for the Court, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">The ultimate criterion in determining the degree of evaporation of probable cause, however, is not case law but reason. <em>The likelihood that the evidence sought is still in place is a function not simply of watch and calendar but of variables that do not punch a clock: </em>the character of the crime (chance encounter in the night or regenerating conspiracy?), of the criminal (nomadic or entrenched?), of <em>the thing to be seized (perishable and easily transferable or of enduring utility to its holder?), </em>of the place to be searched (mere criminal forum of convenience or secure operational base?), etc. The observation of a half-smoked marijuana cigarette in an ashtray at a cocktail party may well be stale the day after the cleaning lady has been in; the observation of the burial of a corpse in a cellar may well not be stale three decades later. The hare and the tortoise do not disappear at the same rate of speed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\"><em>West, </em>137 Md.App. at 347-48, 768 A.2d 150, is also instructive. Writing for the Court, Judge Thieme said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">In <em>Clayton v.

See, e.g., United States v. Hemandez-Escarsega, </em>886 F.2d 1560 (9th Cir.1989) (probable cause not stale when last event occurred almost one year before the warrant issued, but there was evidence of protracted criminal activity); <em>United States v. Craig, </em>861 F.2d 818 (5th Cir.1988) (when affidavit described criminal activity of long standing, information need not be regarded as stale even if fairly long periods of time have elapsed between information and the issuance of the warrant).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">In analyzing the issue of staleness, \u201cthe expertise and experience of the officer are to be taken into account in applying the Fourth Amendment probable cause test\u201d, even if \u201cthe officer would not qualify as an expert witness on the subject.\u201d 2 LaFave, \u00a7 3.2(c), at 38-39, 38 n. 70 (citing <em>United States v.

Moreover, the warrant involved a search in Illinois, not Maryland. But, contrary to appellant\u2019s suggestion, the mere passage of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>and change of residence are not dispositive, because \u201c[t]he likelihood that the evidence sought is still in place is a function not simply of watch and calendar.... \u201d <em>Andresen, </em>24 Md.App. at 172, 331 A.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Although we have not uncovered any Maryland cases addressing the issue of staleness in the context of the circumstances attendant here, other jurisdictions have done so. The State refers us to <em>State v. Kirsch, </em>139 N.H. 647, 662 A.2d 937 (1995), to support its contention that probable cause was not defeated by the passage of time or appellant\u2019s change of residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In <em>Kirsch, </em>the defendant was the leader of pre-teen groups at his church; he was suspected of sexually assaulting several children between 1978 and 1987. <em>Id. </em>at 939. In 1990, the police obtained a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s home, based on interviews of two victims. During the search, the police seized pornographic materials and school photographs of various children, including some of the victims. <em>Id. </em>The defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress the evidence and was convicted. On appeal, he argued \u201cthat the warrant was not supported by probable cause in that it was based on stale information,\u201d because the most recent alleged incident of abuse occurred six years prior to the warrant application. <em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In assessing whether there was \u201ca substantial likelihood that contraband or evidence of crime will be found in the place to be searched\u201d, the New Hampshire Supreme Court upheld the finding of probable cause. Relying on cases from other states, it found \u201cthat an appreciable lapse of time was no bar to a finding of probable cause to issue a search warrant, in light of the nature of the offense and of the items sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-8\">Here, the affidavit recounted sexual abuse of children over a period of six years. During that period the [appellant] photographed the children and displayed pornographic movies during some of the assaults.... A \u201ccommon-sense inference\u201d about the longevity of child pornography for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>sexual abuse of children may reasonably be drawn from the nature of the items themselves, such as the photographs taken of the children. \u201cPhotographs guarantee that there will always be an image of the child at the age of sexual preference.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 940-41 (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, the court determined that \u201cit [was] reasonable for a magistrate to conclude that all the items sought were reasonably connected to the suspected criminal activity and likely to have been retained by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>People v. Russo, </em>439 Mich. 584, 487 N.W.2d 698 (1992), cited in <em>Kirsch, </em>is also instructive. There, the Michigan Supreme Court reversed the lower court\u2019s finding that \u201cthe passage of time negated an inference of probable cause\u201d in connection with a search warrant issued for the defendant\u2019s home more than six years after the last alleged incident of sexual abuse had occurred at that location. <em>Id. </em>at 700, 704. Finding probable cause, the appellate court stated, <em>id. </em>at 710-11, 711:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-7\">[U]nlike the possession of contraband or the situation in which the criminal activity incidentally and sometimes unwittingly creates evidence of crime, where the reasonable inference is that a person will get rid of incriminating evidence, the case at bar involves a situation in which the individual intentionally created evidence of his criminal activity and displayed it over the course of years. Moreover, the evidence was not simply created and used, it was stored with a degree of care indicative of its continuing value to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-8\">Finally, it is possible to infer that the items might have ceased to have value for the defendant when his molestation of the victim ceased. But just as the possibility that there was an innocent explanation for the behavior of the defendants in <em>Gates </em>did not negate the majority\u2019s finding that there was a fair probability that they were engaged in criminal activity, [ ] we think that the magistrate here could conclude that there was a \u201cfair probability\u201d of the presence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of evidence which had sexual, historical, and perhaps even sentimental, significance for its possessor and creator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">We hold only that where suspicion of criminal activity has focused on a specific individual by a standard more probable than not, and it is alleged that the evidence sought was created, retained, and employed in ongoing criminal activity over a four-year period, the magistrate could reasonably conclude that there was a \u201cfair probability\u201d that the evidence would be retained in the residence of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">The Supreme Court of Iowa\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Woodcock, </em>407 N.W.2d 603 (Iowa 1987), is also illuminating. The defendant challenged his third-degree sexual abuse convictions, claiming that the court erred in admitting evidence obtained from his home during the execution of a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 603. The defendant argued that the search was not based on probable cause because the underlying information was stale, in that it was more than a year old. <em>Id. </em>at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">The supporting affidavit stated, in part, 407 N.W.2d at 605:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">Your affiant has had conversations with [a] Special Investigator ... who has received training in the area of child Sexual Exploitation and pedophiles and [he] and your affiant both have received training that indicates that pedophiles and others who sexually exploit children by taking erotic photographs are inclined to not destroy such photographs but to save them for future use and gratification and that such individuals maintain lists by way of documents and computer lists of children they are sexually active with including the names, ages, addresses and birth dates of such children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">Rejecting the defense\u2019s contention, the Iowa court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-10\">[T]he nature of the offense is a factor bearing on a claim of staleness, and it would be reasonable for an issuing magistrate to conclude that a person charged with sexual exploitation of children through photographs and similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>items would be likely to retain them for an indefinite period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-4\"><em>% </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">Thus, in contrast to theft or robbery cases where the evidence would be expected to be moved fairly rapidly, and in contrast to drug cases where the evidence would likely have been sold or consumed in a year and a half, the types of material involved here would be more likely to be retained. Their perceived usefulness to the suspect would be of a continuing nature, through gratification obtained by him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">We are also guided by <em>State v. Jannetta, </em>355 N.W.2d 189 (Minn.Ct.App.1984). There, the police received information regarding the appellant\u2019s sexual misconduct, but waited two years before applying for a search warrant. <em>Id. </em>at 192-93. Nevertheless, the court determined that the information was not stale. <em>Id. </em>at 194. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-8\">In any application for a search warrant, a gap of two years from the source of the information to the application for a warrant is of great concern. In the narrow circumstances of this case, however, the gap is less critical than it might be. The; juvenile informant gave information about photographs, books and magazines containing photographs he saw in appellants\u2019 possession two years earlier. As the trial court noted, these items might be expected to be retained by a person engaged in ongoing criminal sexual conduct. The photographs would likely have enduring utility to the perpetrator for his own sexual gratification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-9\"><em>Id.; see also Gregg v. State, </em>844 P.2d 867, 873, 875 (Okla.Crim. App.1992) (finding that information regarding taking and possessing obscene photographs and videos of children was not stale, despite passage of three years since material was last seen in defendant\u2019s possession; affiant averred that he knew from \u201ctraining and experience\u201d that \u201cindividuals who are involved with the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography, rarely, if ever, dispose of their sexually explicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>materials\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>1993 Okla.Crim.App. LEXIS 3 (1993); <em>People v. Osborn, </em>122 Mich.App. 63, 329 N.W.2d 533, 535 (1982) (finding that the \u201caffidavit\u2019s allegations of a long history of sexual abuse between the child and defendant and the victim\u2019s personal knowledge of the existence and location of the photographs ... constituted probable cause sufficiently fresh to presume that the photographs were in defendant\u2019s residence,\u201d although photographs were last seen forty-five days earlier; magistrate did not err in concluding \u201cthat defendant would not quickly dispose of pictures but would retain them for his own future perverse enjoyment\u201d); <em>State v. Jones, </em>299 N.C. 298, 261 S.E.2d 860, 865 (1980) (concluding that, as to gloves and hatchet used in murder, probable cause existed five months after offense because items \u201cwere not particularly incriminating in themselves and were of enduring utility to defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We are mindful that the places that were searched in the cases cited above were the same locations where the alleged abuses occurred. In contrast, the residence searched in this case was located hundreds of miles from the residence where the alleged crimes occurred. We also recognize that, in the cases mentioned above, none involved a lapse of time as lengthy as the period here. Certainly, as LaFave recognizes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5y\">|tjhe nature of the place to be searched and the suspect\u2019s relationship to it cannot be ignored.... If the offender has relocated his residence between the time of the crime and the time of the search this will sometimes add weight to the argument that the information has become stale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">2 LaFave, \u00a7 3.7(a), at 353-54 <em>&amp; </em>n. 55 <em>(citing Kasold v. Cardwell, </em>393 F.Supp. 197 (D.Ariz.1975), <em>rev\u2019d without op., </em>554 F.2d 1069 (9th Cir.1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Nevertheless, we are satisfied that, in the context of this case, the information was not stale. Significantly, it was the items sought in appellant\u2019s residence, not the residence itself, which were of critical importance here. Therefore, this case is unlike those in which the particular place sought to be searched is critical to the determination of probable cause. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>illustrate, when a person is a murder suspect, and the police seek to recover microscopic samples of the victim\u2019s hair or blood, a suspect\u2019s change of residence would obviously be of great significance in the probable cause analysis. In this case, however, the exact location of appellant\u2019s residence was not dispositive of the issue; probable cause was not defeated merely because appellant had moved to Illinois. <em>See </em>2 La-Fave, \u00a7 3.7(a), at 354 n. 55 (noting that probable cause is not necessarily defeated where the items sought are \u201c \u2018of a sexual nature which it is reasonable to believe the defendant intended to keep.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>State v. Kasold, </em>110 Ariz. 563, 521 P.2d 995, 998 (1974)); <em>see also United States v. Agosto, </em>43 M.J. 745, 747, 748, 749 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1995) (finding probable cause for search of airman\u2019s dormitory room for photographs and telephone numbers of young girls, even though airman had changed dorm rooms after allegedly committing a rape; stating that \u201ca reasonable person would conclude that appellant moved all of his personal papers, like photographs and telephone numbers, to his new residence____\u201d; noting items \u201cwere not necessarily incriminating in themselves\u201d and \u201cwere not consumable over time\u201d), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>46 M.J. 389 (C.A.A.F.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Instead, it was the nature of what was sought that was important here. According to the affidavit, both victims indicated that a footlocker in Behrel\u2019s campus apartment served as both a coffee table and a repository for sexual aids and pornographic materials. To the extent that the footlocker functioned as a piece of furniture and a repository for pornographic materials, it never lost its utility. Nor was it perishable. Furthermore, possession of the trunk was not incriminating in itself, so that it would not have been disposed of as contraband. And, the footlocker was readily transportable from one state to another. <em>See Andresen, </em>24 Md.App. at 172, 331 A.2d 78; see <em>also </em>2 LaFave, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3.7(a), at 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Additionally, the affiant averred that Potter had special training with regard to child abuse and sexual offenses, and had participated \u201cin over 300 crimes involving child abuse and sexual offenses.\u201d Potter indicated that, based on his training, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>he knew \u201cthat sexual offenders tend to keep momentos of prior acts along with pictures and videos.\u201d As noted, both victims indicated that appellant used the footlocker for that purpose. The issuing judge was entitled to conclude from the affidavit that a person charged with the sexual abuse and exploitation of children would be likely to retain pornographic material and lewd photographs indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Considering the nature of the items sought and the experience of Potter, we are satisfied that the finding of probable cause was not erroneously based on stale information.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">2. The Good Faith Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Alternatively, even if the warrant were not supported by probable cause, we are satisfied that the good faith exception applies here. At the hearing below, the State relied on <em>United States v. Leon, 468 </em>U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, <em>supra, </em>to support its good faith claim. The State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-8\">[E]ven should you determine that the probable cause was stale[,] I would ask you to consider the matter of <em>U.S. v[.] Leon, </em>which is that 1984 Supreme Court decision which granted a good faith exception where it is demonstrated that an officer has an objectively reasonable belief as a matter of law that he has a facially valid search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">Again, that is a legal decision this court has to make. In fact, you heard during the course of the testimony here today from \u2019Trooper Potter, that he has participated in perhaps twenty search warrants, some of which occurred years after the fact and that property was recovered. I would submit to the Court therefore that under the terms of <em>Leon </em>even if you should determine that there was no probable cause or that the probable cause was stale these officers, who I submit based upon what you\u2019ve heard, what\u2019s contained in the warrant, is a reasonably well trained officer. And he would know ... he would not have known ... he would not have known that this search was illegal because he had the magistrate\u2019s authorization and it was a facially valid search warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>There has been no testimony raised here today that any of the officers acting in their capacity when this search warrant was executed had in any manner misled the magistrate ....</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">There is no evidence to suggest that the magistrate has wholly abandoned his judicial role in this proceeding. And there\u2019s no showing, [Y]our Honor, that this warrant ... was lacking, so lacking in probable cause that these officers would have had no objectively reasonable belief that they could utilize the power given to them by the search warrant to execute that search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">And further, [Y]our Honor, that warrant is not so facially deficient, in other words it identifies the place to be searched, it identifies the things to be seized that the officers knew what they were going to size or what place they were going to search and what place ... what items they were looking for when they executed that search warrant. So I would submit to the Court that under <em>Leon ... </em>that four prong test which is enunciated in that decision, should you find that the probable cause was stale, nevertheless renders a good faith exception to the execution of that warrant and it permits this Court to deny the motion to suppress....</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Appellant never addressed the good faith exception at the suppression hearing. Nor did the suppression court reach that issue. Nevertheless, because the issue of good faith was raised below and renewed on appeal, and the question is a legal one, we may consider it. <em>See McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 470 n. 10, 701 A.2d 675; <em>Coley, </em>145 Md.App. at 523 n. 14, 805 A.2d 1186; <em>Braxton, </em>123 Md.App. at 631-32, 720 A.2d 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In <em>Connelly, supra, </em>322 Md. at 735, 589 A.2d 958, the Court recognized that because the \u201capplication of the good faith exception to the allegations of the affidavit presents an objectively ascertainable question, it is for the appellate court to decide whether the affidavit was sufficient to support the requisite belief that the warrant was valid.\u201d When the record does not contain a finding as to the good faith question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>however, \u201cwe are confined to the language of the affidavit in reviewing the applicability of the good faith exception.\u201d <em>State v. Darden, </em>93 Md.App. 373, 397, 612 A.2d 339, <em>cert. denied, </em>328 Md. 447, 614 A.2d 974, and <em>cert. denied, </em>508 U.S. 957, 113 S.Ct. 2459, 124 L.Ed.2d 673 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Appellant contends that the good faith exception does not apply, because \u201cno reasonably well trained officer should have relied on this warrant.\u201d He asserts: \u201cThis is not a case where the officers had personal knowledge sufficient for probable cause but inadvertently failed to specify any date of the claimed criminal activity.\u201d Further, Behrel argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">At the suppression hearing, Trooper Potter admitted that he had no direct evidence from any source that there was anything in Mr. Behrel\u2019s residence in 2001 that would supply evidence of the offenses fifteen to twenty years earlier. No one had gone in his residence to claim that any evidence was inside. The affidavit failed to mention any surveillance of the Behrel residence nor does it appear that any was done. All that existed was Trooper Potter\u2019s belief that if Behrel was a sexual offender, he might keep memen-toes. The request to search for computers and computer hardware (when neither Curtis nor Miller nor anyone else indicated that Behrel even owned a computer) is indicative that the search request was based on hunches rather than probable cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The Supreme Court promulgated the good faith exception in <em>United States v. Leon, supra, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, and the companion case, <em>Massachusetts v. Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. 981, 104 S.Ct. 3424, 82 L.Ed.2d 737 (1984). Notwithstanding the importance of the exclusionary rule to Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, the Supreme Court determined in <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 918, 104 S.Ct. 3405, that \u201csuppression of evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant should be ordered only on a case-by-case basis and only in those unusual cases in which exclusion will further the purposes of the exclusionary rule.\u201d Moreover, in <em>Sheppard, </em>468 U.S. at 989-90, 104 S.Ct. 3424, the Supreme Court \u201crefuse[d] to rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>an officer is required to disbelieve a judge who has just advised him ... that the warrant he possesses authorizes him to conduct the search he has requested.\u201d Thus, the cases provide for the admissibility of \u201cevidence seized under a warrant subsequently determined to be invalid ... if the executing officers acted in objective good faith with reasonable reliance on the warrant.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 467, 701 A.2d 675; <em>see Nero v. State, </em>144 Md.App. 333, 351-52, 798 A.2d 5 (2002).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">As we explained in <em>State v. Riley, supra, </em>147 Md.App. at 130, 807 A.2d 797, \u201c \u2018[e]ven when the warrant is bad, the mere exercise of having obtained it will salvage all but the rarest and most outrageous of warranted searches.\u2019 \u201d (Citation and emphasis omitted). <em>See Ashford v. State, </em>147 Md.App. 1, 23, 807 A.2d 732, <em>cert. denied, </em>372 Md. 430, 813 A.2d 257 (2002). Nevertheless, <em>Leon </em>made clear that there are circumstances when exclusion of evidence remains the appropriate sanction, even if an officer \u201chas obtained a warrant and abided by its terms.\u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405. This is because \u201cthe officer\u2019s reliance on the magistrate\u2019s probable-cause determination ... must be objectively reasonable, and it is clear that in some circumstances the officer [ ] will have no reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant was properly issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922-23, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (citations and footnotes omitted). <em>See Malley v. Briggs, </em>475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986) (stating that police officers \u201cwill not be immune if, on an objective basis, it is obvious that no reasonably competent officer would have concluded that a[n arrest] warrant should issue; but if officers of reasonable competence could disagree on this issue, immunity should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>recognized.\u201d); <em>Minor v. State, </em>334 Md. 707, 715, 641 A.2d 214 (1994) stating that \u201cthe question is whether a reasonably well-trained officer would have known \u2018that his affidavit failed to establish probable cause----\u2019\u201d; officer has a duty \u201cto withhold from presentation [sic] an application for a warrant that a well-trained officer would know failed to establish probable cause.\u201d (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The <em>Leon </em>Court recognized four situations that justify the sanction of exclusion. They include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">(1) if the magistrate, in issuing a warrant, \u201cwas misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for a reckless disregard of the truth,\u201d or (2) \u201cin cases where the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his judicial role ... [so that] no reasonably well trained officer should rely on the warrant^]\u201d or (3) in cases in which an officer would not \u201cmanifest objective good faith in relying on a warrant based on an affidavit \u2018so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable^]\u2019 \u201d or (4) in cases where \u201ca warrant may be so facially <em>deficient\u2014ie., </em>in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized\u2014that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume [the warrant] to be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-8\"><em>McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 468-469, 701 A.2d 675 (citing <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Accordingly, despite judicial \u201cauthorization\u201d to search, good faith does not apply if a \u201creasonably well trained officer would have known that the search was illegal.... \u201d <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 922 n. 23, 104 S.Ct. 3405; <em>see United States v.

The affiant averred that Potter \u201clearned through his training that sexual offenders tend to keep mementoes of prior acts along with''pictures and videos.\u201d Moreover, Curtis and Miller both told Potter that appellant kept pornographic movies, magazines, photographs, and sexual aids in a footlocker that he used as a coffee table. In our view, it was reasonable for Potter to believe that, even if appellant moved out of state, he might have taken the footlocker with him, because it was not perishable; it would not have been difficult to transport; and it would not lose its utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Accordingly, we are satisfied that a reasonably well-trained officer would not have known that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search for the footlocker and pornographic materials stored in it. Therefore, we conclude that, even if the affidavit was not based on probable cause, the good faith exception applies here.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>II. THE TRIALS</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">A. THE CURTIS TRIAL<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AqA\">1. Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Curtis was born on November 27, 1967; at the time of appellant\u2019s trial in February 2002, Curtis was thirty-four years old. From the fall of 1982 until the spring of 1986, Curtis was a boarding student at SJS. During that time, appellant served as the School\u2019s chaplain.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">At trial, Curtis recalled that he was sent to SJS, in part, because he did not have a good relationship with his stepfather and was acting out in school. Curtis explained that he became involved in church activities at SJS because he \u201cwas kind of looking for something comforting in [his] life, and the church seemed to be ... willing to provide that for [him].\u201d Through his involvement in church activities, Curtis had close contact with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">During his first year at SJS, Curtis became an acolyte, which is \u201ca person [who] helps the priest run the service.... \u201d In his second year at SJS, Curtis was elevated to the position of sacristan, a select group of six or seven students who assisted the chaplain. Curtis described the role of the sacristan as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">... [I]n terms of function at Saint James, they would go lay out the robes, the different dressings for different religious holidays. They put the chalice, the wafers, the wine, so on and so forth on the alter [sic] in preparation for the following day\u2019s service, and they would also participate in the service by overseeing the acolytes during the service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">According to Curtis, his relationship with appellant began to change in February 1983, when he was fifteen years old. Curtis recalled that one night, he and a group of students had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>been watching a movie in appellant\u2019s campus apartment. Curtis remained after the other students left, \u201ctalking about the ... church and so on and so forth.\u201d According to Curtis, while he and appellant were sitting together on the couch, watching television, appellant \u201cslid his foot into my lap.\u201d When Curtis did not resist, appellant used his hand to rub Curtis\u2019s \u201ccrotch area.\u201d The activity progressed to oral sex that night and, within a month and a half, to sodomy. Curtis estimated that, over a two year period, continuing until \u201cprobably half way through [his] junior year\u201d of high school, he was subjected to about twenty-five or thirty incidents of abuse. Then, Curtis stopped going to appellant\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">During Curtis\u2019s sexual encounters with appellant, Behrel showed him pornographic magazines and movies that he stored in a footlocker that functioned as a coffee table in the apartment. Appellant also' kept sexual aids in the trunk. Curtis identified the footlocker or \u201ctrunk\u201d recovered from appellant\u2019s Illinois residence as the same one that appellant kept in his School apartment. The trunk was later introduced in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Curtis acknowledged that he was very ashamed of what happened. Responding to the State\u2019s inquiry as to why he \u201csubmitted\u201d to appellant, Curtis said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">[T]hat\u2019s a good question. I ..., I ask myself that probably twenty-five times a day. I\u2019m really not sure, you know, at the base of me, but I feel like I was having trouble with my step father, my family relationships, and I think kids have a couple of ways of going at that time. They can either act out or kind of, you know, stay by themselves. I chose to stay by myself, and one of the other reasons my mother sent [me to] Saint James was to find some good role models. You know, I wasn\u2019t getting along with my step father. So I ..., I feel like I needed love so bad, I would have taken it any way that I could have gotten it at that time. You know, I just needed male companionship, the church, [appellant] showing an interest in me in what I did and, you know him wanting me to join the club, you know, the church, and so on and so forth. I just think I really needed somebody to help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>me along. Plus I was, you know, I was a farm kid at Saint James, you know, which is a rather prestigious prep school, and I was pretty [much] not at home. You know, I was very nervous, very lonely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Curtis claimed that he never told anyone at SJS about the abuse. In 1998, however, after Curtis told his therapist what had happened, he reported the matter to law enforcement officials in Montana. Shortly thereafter, Curtis began working with TFC Potter. In connection with that investigation, Curtis made a recorded telephone call to appellant in March 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Although Curtis knew Miller, he maintained that he and Miller were not friends. Defense counsel established, however, that Curtis and Miller both played on the School\u2019s lacrosse and football teams, and Curtis identified himself and Miller in a team photograph in the 1984 School yearbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Curtis admitted that he was never physically forced to participate in sexual activity with appellant. Appellant\u2019s counsel also established that Curtis performed oral sex and anal sex upon appellant, and invited appellant to his graduation party.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">Trooper First Class Charles Faith of the Maryland State Police testified that he arranged for Curtis to make a recorded telephone call to appellant on March 16, 2000.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The tape of the conversation was then played for the jury and admitted in evidence. The following portions of the conversation are of particular interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">[CURTIS]: Well, uh, you sodomized me. You, uh, abused me. Do you remember that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">[CURTIS]: You don\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-12\">[APPELLANT]: (Silence.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[CURTIS]: ...

I need to come to a conclusion that it wasn\u2019t my fault, Father Behrel. You know, I\u2019ve spent fifteen years believing that it was my fault, and that I was dirty and nasty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">[APPELLANT]: Well, if you were fifteen, it couldn\u2019t be your fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">[CURTIS]: WeU, it wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-13\">[APPELLANT]: And I mean to be fifteen and to blame yourself fifteen years later when you\u2019re thirty, and it\u2019s not your fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>[CURTIS]: Well ..., why would you do that?

Following an evidentiary hearing held during trial, the court denied the motion. Accordingly, the State presented Miller\u2019s testimony as to appellant\u2019s sexual abuse of him. After several preliminary questions, the court gave the following limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Counsel, let me interrupt at this time and instruct the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, the testimony that you may hear is being admitted for a limited purpose. You must not consider this testimony to prove that [appellant], to prove that if [appellant] committed a prior bad act or criminal act that he would be prone or have a propensity to commit another bad or similar act, or criminal act, or that the defendant is a bad person. So you\u2019re not to consider it for that purpose. The testimony is being offered, once again, for a limited purpose and that is the State is, I believe, attempting to prove that the defendant utilizes a particular method in committing acts of a similar nature. That is part of the case, or part of the issue that is presented in this case, and that is the only purpose for which this testimony is being admitted. You may proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Miller testified that he entered SJS in the fall of 1981 for the tenth grade. During his first year, he and appellant lived in the same dormitory. Miller became an acolyte in his first year at the School, which brought him into contact with appellant. Then, in eleventh grade, appellant selected him to become senior sacristan, a position described by Miller as \u201cthe highest figure ... in the church as far as the student body goes.\u201d As a result, he worked \u201cin a closer fashion\u201d with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In his junior year, Miller lived in a dormitory room directly next to appellant\u2019s apartment. According to Miller, appellant counseled him regarding his parents\u2019 divorce. Miller also testified that he and other students \u201cregularly\u201d visited appellant\u2019s apartment. He identified the footlocker seized in the search of appellant\u2019s residence as the \u201cchest ... used as a coffee table in the living room\u201d of appellant\u2019s apartment at SJS. Miller claimed that appellant kept pornographic materials in the footlocker, such as \u201cexplicit\u201d magazines and movies, and \u201cinhalants\u201d and \u201cother drug paraphernalia,\u201d such as \u201c \u2018rush\u2019 or \u2018poppers,\u2019 \u201d which appellant provided to Miller. In addition, Miller claimed that appellant photographed him in the nude and kept the pictures in the footlocker.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>Miller recalled that appellant began to abuse him sexually during his first year at SJS, when Miller was fifteen. The abuse began with a \u201cmassage\u201d of Miller\u2019s \u201cgroin,\u201d and appellant then \u201cproceeded to massage\u201d Miller \u201cunderneath [his] clothes.\u201d According to Miller, the sexual contact \u201cprogressed to oral sex and then to, uh, anal sex.\u201d Moreover, Miller claimed that appellant abused him \u201con a regular basis,\u201d in \u201cexcess of fifty\u201d times.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Miller conceded that appellant never physically forced him to engage in sexual activity. He also testified that, until he spoke with Potter in 2000, he had not revealed the abuse to anyone, not even his wife. Acknowledging that he was \u201cashamed\u201d of what happened, Miller explained why he submitted to appellant. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">I was manipulated, coerced through the relationship that I had developed with him, a period of my life where I was relatively young, trusting in him, naive. Uh, and I think he took advantage of that and gained control of me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">The following testimony is also illuminating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">[STATE]: During the time you were at Saint James, did [appellant] have power to discipline you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">[STATE]: Did he have the power to effect [sic] your status at the school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">[STATE]: Who chose the sacristans at Saint James? [MILLER]: Father Behrel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">[STATE]: Who chose the senior sacristan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">[MILLER]: Father Behrel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">[STATE]: Did [appellant] have the ability to reward you while you were at Saint James?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-16\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-17\">[STATE]: Did he reward you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-18\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>[STATE]: Did he have the power to shield you from discipline there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">[STATE]: Did he do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">Further, Miller explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ab-dedup-0\">When I had come back from the [spring break] into my junior year, uh, I tried to stay away, and when I\u2019m referring to [being] coerced and manipulated, that was the time period where he, uh, it\u2019s hard to kind of put into words the, the way ... he would make my life more difficult. At that time I was on his hall in my junior year in the room adjacent to his apartment, and he made my life more difficult.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Appellant sought to impeach Miller\u2019s credibility by showing that Miller knew Curtis, even though he had told Potter in June 2000 that he did not; Saint James was a small school of about 150 students when Miller and Curtis attended; Miller and Curtis were on the football and lacrosse teams together, although they were not in the same grade; and, while Miller was in college, he visited appellant several times in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">As part of his defense, appellant presented several character witnesses who were members of appellant\u2019s parish in Illinois.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But, the witnesses did not know appellant when he served at SJS.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">Appellant also testified in his own behalf. Although Behrel admitted that he is a homosexual, he denied having any sexual contact with Curtis. He also denied that he knew of Curtis\u2019s home situation, and claimed he did not attend Curtis\u2019s graduation party. Appellant further testified that, during the summer of 1987, two years after he left the School and relocated to Illinois, he planned a visit to Maryland. According to appellant, when Curtis learned of his impending visit, Curtis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>contacted him and the two had dinner. As a result of the charges, appellant claimed that he lost his position as a pastor.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Appellant explained the recorded conversation that he had with Curtis on March 16, 2000, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: And with regard to the phone conversation that was played in here, when Mr. Curtis said, \u201cyou sodomized me, you abused me. Do you remember that?\u201d, and what did you reply? Did you reply that you remembered that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">[APPELLANT]: I said, \u201cI didn\u2019t[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay, and when he was saying ..., this is on the first page, \u201chow can you say that you spent two ..., how can you say that? You spent two years abusing me[,]\u201d do you remember what you replied then? Did you remember ...., did you know what he was saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">[APPELLANT]: Yeah, um, in regard to abusing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOy\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Right. Do you remember what you replied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: It was played for the jury, uh, but let me ask you this, after denying remember[ing] sodomizing him, there is a part where you say, \u201cwell better than sorry, I can ask your forgiveness[,]\u201d why did you ask him ..., his forgiveness, if you didn\u2019t do these things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7K\">[APPELLANT]: Well saying you\u2019re sorry is sort of a secular term, forgiveness is more of a religious term, and since, you know, we were talking about more religious things and stuff, and uh, um, I just ..., it\u2019s just a natural thing to go from saying I\u2019m sorry to asking forgiveness, and the church, just like love has a different meaning in the world than it does in the church.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">Appellant also acknowledged that he knew Miller, and recalled that Miller was a senior sacristan when appellant was the chaplain of SJS. But, he denied having any sexual contact with Miller. According to appellant, the choice of senior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>sacristan was \u201csomething always discussed amongst the [sacristan] group.\u201d Appellant noted that Miller visited him several times in Illinois after he graduated from SJS.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In closing argument, the prosecutor sought to demonstrate a common scheme and plan by appellant with respect to his victims. The State also relied on Miller\u2019s testimony to support Curtis\u2019s version of events. The State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Now [appellant] has admitted, taken the stand and admitted that he\u2019s a homosexual. Well that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s fine, but why did he keep all this heterosexual stuff. Why did he keep this heterosexual magazine and ... these tapes with heterosexual acts in them? What purpose could he have for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">[T]o set a trap, and we know that this trap was set and that there was a pattern, a scheme, and preparation that [appellant] chose his victims and molded them the way he wanted. How do we know that? By the testimony of Jeff Miller. It\u2019s clear when you look at the testimony of Matt Curtis and Jeff Miller that these guys mirror each other. Both of them were fifteen when they went to Saint James. Both of them were in their first year at Saint James when all of this started. Again, [appellant] befriended them, encouraged them both in the church. Both boys were very vulnerable, isolated, and had family problems, divorces, and [appellant] counseled them about it. Both boys trusted [appellant]. Both boys became acolytes and then sacristans in the church, which exposed them even more to [appellant]. They held a position of honor in that ...., in the church at Saint James, and that was important. And ladies and gentlemen, he was responsible for them. He had the ability to discipline them. He shielded them from discipline. He rewarded them. And in both cases, all the abuse took place in [appellant\u2019s] room on campus in the students\u2019 dorm. And both boys said they went there voluntarily. Both boys described pornography and inhalants. Both described this [foot]Iocker. The abuse in both cases started off as fon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dling, progressed to oral sex, then went on to anal intercourse. Both felt manipulated, controlled, and both submitted to [appellant]. They didn\u2019t lie to you. They consented. They weren\u2019t forced physically, and the abuse occurred on a regular systematic basis, and neither Jeff or Matt told anybody about this for years and years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">That taped phone call, you decide if those are the words of an innocent man. Talked about this [foot]locker and low and behold, there it is and the pattern of abuse that Jeff Miller was subjected to. Ladies and gentlemen, child abuse is always wrong always, but when it\u2019s committed by a priest who preys on vulnerable kids, it\u2019s even more hideous. This man has violated the trust and used his position in that church to satisfy his own desires, not caring at all about the impact that it would have on his victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">During its instructions to the jury, the court reiterated: \u201cYou have heard evidence that the defendant committed the crime of child abuse with regard to Jeffrey Miller, which is not a charge in this case. You may consider this evidence only on the question of common scheme or plan, preparation, or identity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">2. Motion <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">As we noted, two days prior to the Curtis trial, appellant moved to exclude Miller\u2019s testimony, claiming it constituted inadmissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. The court denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing at which Miller and several others testified. Miller\u2019s testimony at the hearing was substantively the same as the testimony he gave at the trial, and therefore we need not recount it here.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">In support of his motion, appellant presented the testimony of Eugene Brown, a parishioner at St. Andrew\u2019s Church in Grayslake, where appellant served as rector from 1986 until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>his arrest in March 2001. Brown recalled that Miller had visited appellant on two occasions, one in 1986 and the other in 1987 or 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Appellant also testified at the motion hearing. He denied having a sexual relationship with Miller, and denied ever using Miller\u2019s position as sacristan to coerce Miller to have sex. Moreover, according to appellant, Miller visited him in Illinois \u201cmaybe eight times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Thereafter, defense counsel urged the court to exclude Miller\u2019s testimony. Appellant\u2019s counsel said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">... Your Honor, ... there is a three-prong test, and I would argue that the first test is not met by the State in trying to get evidence of one act admitted into this case to prove a criminal act to another.... [E]vidence of another crime can be used to prove motive. Well there\u2019s no need upon the State, and there\u2019s no issue of motive here. The same way with intent. There\u2019s no requirement that the State prove intent in the child abuse statute. Absence of mistake or accident, well there\u2019s no clearly, you know, ..., no defense is being raised at all, \u201cgee, we did it, but we did it by accident[.]\u201d Then we come to identity. There\u2019s no, you know, there\u2019s no issue that whether, you know that Mr. Curtis can\u2019t positively identify who did this to him, and therefore needs some help by perhaps showing evidence of his signature or showing evidence of MO, <em>modus operandi, </em>and it was my understanding in chambers that the State was putting forth, well it\u2019s a pattern or <em>modus operandi, </em>and that\u2019s the exception they\u2019re seeking that it\u2019s some type of pattern, and the problem with that analysis is that the State does not have to prove any pattern in here. What the State is trying to do is produce evidence of a pattern to show that he\u2019s guilty in this particular act....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Secondly, ... we come to the next hurdle and that\u2019s whether or not ... the State can show by clear and convincing evidence that these acts occurred. Admittedingly [sic], Mr. Miller took the stand and said that, \u201cwell, yeah I said was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>[sic], you know, coerced and threatened[.]\u201d Well then we later learned that even after he\u2019s out of the Saint James School in college, in his third year of college, he\u2019s still visiting Father Behrel. I\u2019m saying it\u2019s not consistent ... with a finding that the act did occur. Could it have occurred? Sure. Is the State gonna be able to go forward on that on another day? Yes, but they should not be allowed to bring in evidence of this alleged other crimes in order just to prove that it occurred here. And that brings us to the third issue, you know, the balancing test of unfair prejudice, and I do believe that it\u2019s unfair prejudice to bring in testimony about another crime in order to prove the crime at hand especially when there\u2019s no special or heightened relevance of his testimony, Mr. Miller.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In response, the State argued, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">I think Mr. Miller was extremely credible on the stand, and he was truthful to the Court, and the Court even has an independent entry in [Miller\u2019s] yearbook that supports Mr. Miller\u2019s testimony. I certainly think there is clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Miller was in fact abused by the defendant. As to the issue of unfair prejudice, Your Honor, ... [appellant\u2019s counsel] has indicated that in this situation, it would be unfair for the State to prove propensity evidence, and we admit <em>that----The State is not trying to prove that the defendant has a propensity to have sex with young boys. The State is trying to prove that there is a pattern and a choice of victims in this case, and that pattern contains a clear common scheme and plan.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">The State continued, acknowledging that Miller\u2019s testimony was crucial to the matter of Curtis\u2019s credibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">Your Honor, in [appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] opening argument to the Court, he indicated specifically that the credibility of the victims, or the victim, and the long delay in reporting were things that he wanted the jury to focus on. Those are going to be the defense issues, and Your Honor, <em>in this situation where it\u2019s clear the credibility of Matt Curtis is in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number><em>jeopardy, and where there\u2019s been a long delay in reporting, the need, for this evidence and the value of this evidence is even greater.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">[Tjhe <em>Merzbacher \\v. State, </em>346 Md. 391, 697 A.2d 432 (1997) ] case really has the most to do with the instant facts. Clearly the delay must be explained by the witnesses. The delay in reporting is a common thread here, and the Court has heard the manipulation, the confusion, the vulnerability of the victims, and all that goes to the credibility of the victims, and it goes into evidence pursuant to the Court\u2019s ruling, the Court of Appeals ruling in <em>Merzbacher.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">In addition, the State relied on the claim that the evidence as to Miller demonstrated a common pattern or scheme, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">In this case, both boys were between fourteen and fifteen when the abuse started.... Both were in their first year of Saint James when the abuse started. Both of them had family problems and divorce issues, which they believe, made them isolated and vulnerable. Both were encouraged to become involved in the church. They were counseled by [appellant]. He shielded them from discipline. The abuse took place, according to testimony you heard today, on campus at Saint James, but there was no physical force used in either case. That the abuse started as fondling then progressed to fellacio [sic] and then sodomy in both cases. That there was a footlocker that both witnesses identified as being in ... [appellant\u2019s] apartment contained [sic] pornography and inhalants and were given to the witnesses. Both had prestigious positions at school being acolytes and then sacristans at Saint James and that the abuse occurred on a regular and systematic basis, and that both waited for years before reporting, and they told the Court why that was and what had happened to them.... Your Honor, the State is not introducing evidence that the defendant has a propensity to have sex with boys. <em>What the State is seeking to show </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>is that there was a pattern of abuse, a systematic pattern that mirrors each other.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In denying appellant\u2019s motion, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">Well, you know in a case like this, it\u2019s easier to deal with the second prong than with anything else. Of course everyone acknowledges that Rule 5^104 prohibits the use of evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts to prove the character of the person in order to show acts in conformity therewith. However, the Rule also states that, \u201chowever, such evidence may be admissible for other purposes such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or planned knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident[.]\u201d The testimony that I\u2019ve heard from Mr. Miller, I must admit, is extremely credible. Having observed him testify, the manner in which he testified, the apparent difficulty that he has in brining [sic] forth in a courtroom setting that perhaps what he feels now to be humiliating experiences in his life were extremely credible to me and believed by me to have taken place as he testified. I don\u2019t believe the testimony of [appellant] ... [about the] yearbook....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">There has been clear and convincing evidence that the events occurred as testified by Mr. Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">The main difficulty here is trying to have what the State wants to do fit into a special circumstance, an exception to the general rule [against the admission of other crimes evidence]. In this case we do have a lot of similarities. We have two young men, who allegedly began to be abused by the defendant, Mr. Curtis in 1983, I believe, in the winter of 1983 when he was fifteen years of age ... and Mr. Miller, who began to be abused allegedly in the spring of 1982, ... was fifteen years of age as well. Both of them had gone to the apartment of Mr. Behrel, Father Behrel, first with other people and then began to show up alone, extensively for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>gatherings. On other instances for conferences with regard to their religious services, or in other instances, simply to talk about some of the problems and issues involved in their lives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">Both of them were interested in the religious activities involved at Saint James. Both of them were borders [sic] at Saint James. Both of them were encouraged by [appellant] to become acolytes and then sacristans. And both as well felt that their positions within the Saint James community particularly that of sacristan and Mr. Miller, the senior sacristan, were positions of honor that could have in some way been effected [sic] by the actions of [appellant] at that time. He was in charge of this particular religious activity within the community as testified by both. Both of them also testified that they were having severe difficulties in their lives, their personal lives, because their parents were separated and obtaining divorces____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In addition, the court found that both victims \u201cwere particularly vulnerable because of their similar experiences with their home and family lives.... \u201d The court observed that \u201ctheir home situations were known by [appellant] at that time or were disclosed to him during the course of their conversations with [appellant].\u201d Moreover, both victims testified that they \u201cdeveloped a close relationship with [appellant], going there to watch movies, to talk about their issues in their lives.\u201d The court added: \u201cBoth of them also described the initial physical contact as fondling leading to fellatio and then leading to anal sex with the defendant. Both of them also described feeling subtle pressures to ... continue with this relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">[Although the State could prove by other methods, for instance identity, or for instance opportunity ... there\u2019s nothing wrong with the State trying to bolster its proof of such issues that are critical to the ... fact finder. <em>And in this case, the identical or the very similar method of the alleged abuse, the method by which the defendant allegedly </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number><em>groomed, people, young men fifteen years of age, identical in age, who had the same or identical type of home situations, who had the same vulnerabilities, may be sufficient to show a method of the crimes to earmark them as the handy work of the accused who had, certainly plenty of opportunity to know about the backgrounds, the difficulties of these young men and the need for them to gain acceptance from someone such as someone in a position of power in their lives, such as, once again, [appellant].</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">So I find that based on all that I\u2019ve heard the similarities between the preparation and the grooming of the victims for the abuse, similarities in the abuse itself, the identical ages, in fact the overlapping time periods when these offenses occurred, the identical placement of the alleged abuses, the Court finds that it does fit within a niche, and I\u2019m not sure what it should be called, whether it\u2019s identity, opportunity, preparation, identical method earmarking of the handy work of the accused, whatever you may want to call it, there seems to be a niche within the Rules that creates an exception for testimony such as this, once again, to allow the State to show the identical method of the grooming of young men, fifteen years of age, under the circumstances presented here for the abuses alleged in this case. That leads to the question of prejudice. There is prejudice here, but in all cases there is prejudice when the State attempts to prove evidence that may lead to circumstantial or even direct evidence of the guilt of the defendant. But whether it\u2019s unfair prejudice or not is a weighty question for a Court to consider.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-9\">... I think the need for the State to prove the methodology, the handy work of the accused, and the earmarking of that handywork [sic] is that of the accused in this case as to make it more probative than prejudicial; and therefore, based on what I can see here because I find that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>some exception to the general rule in this case, the court is going to allow the testimony of Mr. Miller, but only for the limited purpose of not, of course, not proving propensity of the defendant to commit the crime of a similar nature but to prove identical methodology earmarking the handy work of the accused, preparation of similar crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">3. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Appellant contends that the court erred in admitting Miller\u2019s testimony at the Curtis trial, because it constituted inadmissible \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence under Maryland Rule 5-404(b). He maintains that \u201c[t]here was simply no special or heightened relevance in Miller\u2019s testimony as to what [appellant] did to him to prove any element of the Curtis child abuse offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The State counters that the evidence of Behrel\u2019s sexual abuse of Miller \u201chad special relevance with regard to preparation, and to establish a common scheme or plan.\u201d Moreover, the State contends that any prejudice was cured by the court\u2019s curative instructions to the jury regarding its consideration of Miller\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Clearly, \u201cevidence of a defendant\u2019s prior [or other] criminal acts may not be introduced to prove guilt of the offense for which the defendant is on trial.\u201d <em>Ayers v. State, </em>335 Md. 602, 630, 645 A.2d 22 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1130, 115 S.Ct. 942, 130 L.Ed.2d 886 (1995); <em>see Borchardt v.

Put another way, such evidence may not be introduced \u201c \u2018to suggest that because the defendant is a person of criminal character, it is more probable that he committed the crime for which he is on trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Streater v. State, </em>352 Md. 800, 806, 724 A.2d 111 (1999) (citation omitted). Indeed, \u201cthere are few principles of American criminal jurisprudence more universally accepted than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>rule that evidence which tends to show that the accused committed another crime independent of that for which he is on trial, even one of the same type, is inadmissible.\u201d <em>Cross v. State, </em>282 Md. 468, 473, 386 A.2d 757 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The foregoing principles are embodied in Maryland Rule 5-404. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">(b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts.\u2014Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in' order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The \u201cother crimes\u201d rule reflects a \u201cfear that jurors will conclude from evidence of other bad acts that the defendant is a \u2018bad person\u2019 and should therefore be convicted, or deserves punishment for other bad conduct and so may be convicted even though the evidence is lacking....\u201d <em>Harris v. State, </em>324 Md. 490, 496, 597 A.2d 956 (1991); <em>see Merzbacher v.

State, </em>101 Md.App. 5.85, 602, 647 A.2d 1243 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>337 Md. 90, 651 A.2d 855 (1995) (citation omitted; emphasis suppled); <em>see Terry, </em>332 Md. at 334, 631 A.2d 424; <em>Wilkerson v.

As Rule 5-404(b) indicates, evidence of \u201cother crimes\u201d is admissible when the evidence tends to establish motive, intent, absence of mistake, a common scheme or plan, identity, opportunity, preparation, or knowledge. <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896. But, the list of exceptions is merely a \u201c \u2018representative list.\u2019 \u201d <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. at 407, 697 A.2d 432 (citation omitted); <em>see Harris, </em>324 Md. at 501, 597 A.2d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">A three-pronged test governs the admissibility of other crimes evidence. <em>Borchardt, </em>367 Md. at 132-33 n. 7, 786 A.2d 631; <em>Streater, </em>352 Md. at 807-08, 724 A.2d 111; <em>Wynn v.

First, the trial court must determine if the evidence fits within one or more of the exceptions to the rule. That decision does not involve any discretion on the part of the trial court, <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896; <em>Oesby, </em>142 Md.App. at 159, 788 A.2d 662. Therefore, no deference is extended to the trial court in regard to its determination. <em>Emory, </em>101 Md.App. at 604, 647 A.2d 1243. Second, if the evidence fits within one of the exceptions, then the trial court must determine \u201cwhether the accused\u2019s involvement in the other crimes is established by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d 896. Third, the trial court must carefully balance the necessity for, and probative value of, the other crimes evidence against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 552 A.2d 896. This is a discretionary determination on the part of the trial court. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As Judge Moylan stated for the Court in <em>Oesby, </em>142 Md. App. at 163, 788 A.2d 662: \u201cWhat matters is that the evidence of the \u2018other crimes,\u2019 however it might be categorized or labeled, enjoyed a special or heightened relevance in helping to establish\u201d a contested issue in the case. Here, the trial court found that Miller\u2019s testimony was relevant because it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tended to establish a common scheme or plan, or \u201cidentical earmarking of the handy work of the accused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">To be sure, a ruling on relevance is \u201cquintessentially\u201d within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Best v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 241, 259, 556 A.2d 701, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 70, 562 A.2d 718 (1989); <em>see Grandison v.

Absent an abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s decision to admit relevant evidence will not be reversed. <em>White v. State, </em>324 Md. 626, 637, 598 A.2d 187 (1991); <em>Hunt v. State, </em>321 Md. 387, 425, 583 A.2d 218 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 835, 112 S.Ct. 117, 116 L.Ed.2d 86 (1991); <em>Shemondy v.

In our view, Miller\u2019s testimony did not fit within a recognized exception for other crimes evidence, nor was it relevant to a contested issue. Therefore, we conclude that the court erred or abused its discretion in admitting Miller\u2019s testimony. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">For the most part, other crimes evidence is admissible when relevant to the issue of identity. <em>See Oesby, </em>142 Md.App. at 163, 788 A.2d 662 (stating that \u201ca \u2018signature\u2019 modus operandi---- is just one particular way of proving \u2018identity.\u2019 \u201d). Identity was not the issue here, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">The State relies on <em>Merzbacher, </em>346 Md. 391, 697 A.2d 432, to support its claim that Miller\u2019s testimony was properly admitted at the Curtis trial. <em>Merzbacher </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-10\">There, the victim claimed that beginning in 1972, when she was eleven years old, and continuing until 1975, the defendant, a lay teacher at a parochial middle school, subjected her to sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 396, 697 A.2d 432. At trial, the State offered the testimony of numerous witnesses describing various acts of alleged physical and sexual abuse for which the appellant was not on trial, and evidence of the defendant\u2019s \u201cpersistent and vicious conduct,\u201d which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u201ccreated a threatening environment [and] suggested that [the victim] had little choice but to acquiesce----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411, 697 A.2d 432. The \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence was introduced to negate any inference of consent and to explain the victim\u2019s delay of twenty years in reporting the abusive conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 697 A.2d 432. On appeal, the defendant challenged the admission of the testimony with respect to \u201cwrongful acts\u201d and \u201cother crimes\u201d involving other students. <em>Id. </em>at 406, 697 A.2d 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence, the Court of Appeals noted \u201cthe unique circumstances of [the] case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 697 A.2d 432. The Court recognized that \u201c[s]uch testimony was highly relevant\u201d to the issue of the victim\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 411, 697 A.2d 432. In the Court\u2019s view, the evidence also showed a pattern and common scheme. Moreover, the Court considered the evidence relevant to explain the victim\u2019s long delay in reporting the abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 409, 697 A.2d 432. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">[The appellant] defended himself by attacking the credibility of [the victim], pointing to the over two decades it took for her to come to the authorities. By doing so, he forced the State into showing the jury that [the appellant\u2019s] rape took place in a larger, more invidious context. [The victim] testified, corroborated by other witnesses, that [the appellant] used a combination of frivolity and fright to run his classroom. In part, this served to explain and was particularly relevant to why [the victim], either reasonably or unreasonably, waited so long to reveal her story....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">... [The victim\u2019s] sexual abuse was not an isolated incident devoid of setting. It took place over the course of a three year period in a very specific relationship and highly intimidating atmosphere. The other crimes or bad acts evidence introduced against [the appellant] were not for conduct \u201cwholly independent of that for which [the appellant] was on trial.... \u201d The jury was entitled to know the setting in which the alleged sexual misconduct took place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>because, under the facts of this case, the setting and the crime were so intimately connected as to be inseparable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"al-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 409, 410, 697 A.2d 432 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"ANO\">Unlike in <em>Merzbacher, </em>consent was not an issue here. <em>See </em>Art. 27, \u00a7 35C. Moreover, Curtis did not allege that he failed to report the crime because of a \u201chighly intimidating atmosphere\u201d at the School, nor did appellant impugn Curtis\u2019s veracity on that basis. Therefore, the jury had no need to know of the \u201csetting in which the alleged sexual misconduct took place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 697 A.2d 432. Rather, appellant attacked Curtis\u2019s credibility by denying that he (Behrel) had ever been involved in any sexual activity with Curtis.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">We believe <em>McKinney v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 111, 570 A.2d 360, <em>cert. denied, </em>320 Md. 222, 577 A.2d 50 (1990), is more on point. Following a consolidated bench trial, the defendant, a counselor at an outdoor education program, was convicted of third degree sexual assault of three victims, in violation of Art 27, \u00a7 464(a)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 114, 115, 570 A.2d 360. The victims, all female campers, alleged that the defendant had touched their breasts, buttocks, and vaginal areas, but the defendant \u201cconsistently denied\u201d any misconduct. <em>Id. </em>at 115, 570 A.2d 360. On appeal, the defendant claimed the trial court erred in consolidating the cases for trial. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 570 A.2d 360. We agreed and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The Court considered the \u201cother crimes rule\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe evidence as to each individual offense would not be mutually admissible at separate trials.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 126, 570 A.2d 360. It reasoned that the evidence did \u201cnot tend to establish\u201d any of the exceptions to the other crimes doctrine. <em>Id. </em>at 123, 570 A.2d 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Significantly, the <em>McKinney </em>Court determined that \u201cevidence of sexual contact\u201d with each of the alleged victims did not fit within the common scheme or plan exception to the other crimes rule, because identity was not in issue. <em>Id. </em>123, 124, 570 A.2d 360. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">The common scheme or plan \u201cexception\u201d might mean either of two things: (1) a <em>modus operandi, which is but one </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>means of establishing identity </em>and thus would not be material in the case <em>sub judice, </em>or (2) a plan to commit one offense as part of a grand scheme to commit others, such as a theft of nitroglycerine for use in blowing open such a safe. In the latter sense, <em>the other crimes evidence in a separate prosecution of appellant for sexual contact with one </em>child\u2014 <em>evidence of similar conduct with a different child\u2014would not be relevant because it would not tend to prove that kind of common scheme.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 124, 570 A.2d 360 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\"><em>Reidnauer v. State, </em>133 Md.App. 311, 755 A.2d 553, <em>cert. denied, </em>361 Md. 233, 760 A.2d 1107 (2000), is also noteworthy. There, the defendant was convicted at a consolidated bench trial of unrelated sexual offenses involving two prostitutes. We were \u201ccall[ed] upon ... to decide whether the credibility of the two victims ... as to the issue of consent, may be established by the corroborative effect of the testimony of the other.\u201d <em>Id. at </em>314, 755 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Both victims testified at the trial. One of the victims, Jones, testified that she was working as a prostitute on a street corner in Glen Burnie when the appellant solicited her to perform an act of oral sex. <em>Id. </em>at 315, 755 A.2d 553. After she agreed and got into his car, the appellant drove the victim to his place of employment. <em>Id. </em>Upon arrival, Jones requested payment in advance; appellant refused. <em>Id. </em>He also refused to allow Jones to leave, stating: \u201c \u2018You are going to do this.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Jones complied, explaining that the appellant forced her to engage in oral sex and vaginal and anal intercourse, used Vaseline while he conducted the sexual acts, and told her \u201cthat he would beat her if she did not act as if she was enjoying herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 755 A.2d 553. The appellant also said he had AIDS and was making sure that she contracted the virus from him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The other victim, McCauley, testified that the defendant solicited her for sexual acts and drove her to his place of employment, where he had also taken Jones. <em>Id. </em>Upon arrival, McCauley informed appellant of her fee. <em>Id. </em>After McCau-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ley performed, the defendant demanded intercourse and told McCauley to remove her clothes. When she refused, the defendant tore off her clothes and informed her that he was HIV positive and intended to infect every prostitute working in the area. The defendant also used Vaseline and penetrated the victim vaginally and anally. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">This Court reversed the convictions and remanded for new trials, concluding that the trial \u201cjudge erred in joining two cases involving separate victims of rape, sexual assault, and related offenses----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 755 A.2d 553. Writing for the Court, Judge Davis said: \u201cEven though the evidence indicates that the sexual assaults committed in this case were perpetrated in a similar manner, the similarities do not establish that the offenses were part of a common scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 755 A.2d 553. The Court defined the common scheme exception:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cWrongful acts planned and committed together may be proved in order to show a continuing plan or common scheme ... there must be evidence ... of one grand plan; the commission of each is merely a step toward the realization of that goal. The fact that the crimes are similar to each other or occurred close in time to each other is insufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 322, 755 A.2d 553 (quoting <em>Emory v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 585, 623, 647 A.2d 1243 (1994))(text and citations omitted in <em>Reidnauer).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">As we see it, this case fits within the principles set forth in <em>McKinney </em>and <em>Reidnauer. </em>As we have stated, neither identity of the assailant nor consent of the victims was in issue, so that Miller\u2019s testimony was not relevant as to those matters. Moreover, evidence that appellant\u2019s conduct with Miller was similar to his conduct with Curtis was not relevant to prove \u201ca plan to commit one offense as part of a grand scheme to commit others.\u201d <em>McKinney, </em>82 Md.App. at 124, 570 A.2d 360; <em>see Reidnauer, </em>133 Md.App. at 321-23, 755 A.2d 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">The central issue here was whether the abuse occurred at all, and the strength of the State\u2019s case rested largely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>jury\u2019s assessment of Curtis\u2019s \u00ab\u2018edibility and Behrel\u2019s veracity. The State clearly sought to enhance Curtis\u2019s credibility as to what occurred through the use of Miller\u2019s testimony, notwithstanding its characterization of Miller\u2019s testimony as probative of a common scheme or plan by appellant. Miller\u2019s testimony strengthened the State\u2019s case because the testimony suggested that, if appellant abused Miller, then he also must have abused Curtis. In other words, Miller\u2019s testimony was used to show that appellant had a propensity to commit the abuse, which is a classically improper use of \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. Indeed, it is fundamental that evidence of a defendant\u2019s conduct in one crime is not admissible to prove he committed another crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Certainly, there were similarities in the circumstances of the victims, as the State contended. For example, as the State noted, appellant pursued students who were new to the School, and who were emotionally needy and vulnerable because of personal difficulties at home. The State also suggested that appellant endeavored to gain the trust of these students by encouraging their involvement in church-related activities at School, where they became members of a select group that had close contact with appellant. But, this did not mean that Miller\u2019s testimony fit within the common scheme or plan exception to the rule barring \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">To be sure, on the basis of Curtis\u2019s testimony, the evidence was sufficient to convict, <em>if </em>the jury believed Curtis\u2019s account. Therefore, Miller\u2019s testimony was an important vehicle that, directly or indirectly, helped to influence the jury\u2019s assessment <em>of </em>Curtis\u2019s credibility. Although the court had bifurcated the Miller and Curtis trials, the use of Miller\u2019s testimony at Curtis\u2019s trial amounted to an end run around the bifurcation order.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Alternatively, the State argues that any prejudice from the error was cured by the jury instructions. We are not convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt. Clearly, \u201c \u2018there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rainville v. State, </em>328 Md. 398, 411, 614 A.2d 949 (1992) (quoting <em>Bruton v. U.S., </em>391 U.S. 123, 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968)). Clearly, Miller\u2019s testimony buttressed Curtis\u2019s account of abuse. In light of Miller\u2019s testimony, the jury may well have found it difficult to reject Curtis\u2019s version of events even though Behrel flatly contradicted Curtis\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting Miller\u2019s \u201cother crimes\u201d testimony at the Curtis trial. Therefore, we shall vacate the conviction in the Curtis trial and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">B. THE MILLER TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"AKm\">1. Factual Summary<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Miller was bom on April 4,1966; he was thirty-six years old at the time of trial. He transferred to SJS in the fall of 1981, during the tenth grade. When Miller became an acolyte, he assisted Behrel \u201cin religious ceremonies or prayers.\u201d Later, appellant \u201cselected\u201d Miller to serve as a sacristan.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Miller testified that, during his first year at SJS, his parents \u201cwere separating and going through a divorce,\u201d and he often discussed the situation with appellant. He also recalled that he and other students regularly watched television in appellant\u2019s campus apartment. Miller identified the footlocker recovered in the search of appellant\u2019s residence in Illinois as \u201cthe same trunk\u201d that appellant had in his campus apartment, in which he stored pornographic magazines.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">According to Miller, appellant \u201ccontinued to impress\u201d upon him\u201d that being \u201c \u2018one of [Behrel\u2019s] favorites\u2019 \u201d was a status that \u201centail[ed], you know, doing things of which I had no idea what he meant.\u201d Moreover, appellant told Miller that if he \u201cdidn\u2019t continue, uh, things would be taken away.\u201d Miller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>interpreted the comment to mean that he would be \u201cstripped of being a sacristan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Miller recalled that appellant began to abuse him sexually \u201csometime during [his] first semester\u201d at SJS, when he was fifteen years old. It was Miller\u2019s first sexual experience. The abuse progressed to sodomy \u201csome time in the second semester of [Miller\u2019s] tenth grade year,\u201d which would \u201chappen on a regular basis.\u201d Because of Miller\u2019s sexual involvement with Behrel, Miller received \u201cspecial benefits\u201d; he was allowed to \u201cstay up later than everyone else\u201d and was \u201cserved alcohol and drugs[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Miller testified that he was seriously injured during eleventh grade, when he \u201cfell off a cliff\u2019 while \u201cbackpacking with a friend.\u201d As a result of his injuries, he returned to school after a hospital stay with \u201ca body cast and an arm cast\u201d; he had broken both arms, his back, and his leg. Nevertheless, the abuse by appellant continued, despite Miller\u2019s \u201cprotest.\u201d The following testimony is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">[STATE]: What happened, Jeff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">[MILLER]: I had broken my back and, uh, continually trying to find ways not to partake in that activity, I said that it would ... hurt me, hurt my back, and uh, he continued to force himself on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">[STATE]: Was there a particular term that he used for the activity that took place while you were in the cast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">[MILLER]: He referred to the position as \u201cwalking on the ceiling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-11\">[STATE]: And what position is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-12\">[MILLER]: It\u2019s, uh, when you\u2019re laying on your back and your feet are in the air.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-13\">[STATE]: And anal intercourse, in that position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax3\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-14\">The State introduced pages from Miller\u2019s SJS senior yearbook. One of the pages contained appellant\u2019s handwritten inscription. It said, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Rung Pao ... Now who are you calling! ... hydrocolator ...

Or I would serve myself out of his cabinet. \u201cFB\u2019s glass pipe\u201d refers to a marijuana pipe that Father Behrel had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-12\">[STATE]: Does \u201cFB\u201d mean Father Behrel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-13\">[MILLER]: Yes. Um, there\u2019s another phrase right after that, that says, \u201cJeffs number of help and salvation\u201d, his phone number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-14\">[STATE]: You mean Father Behrel\u2019s phone number?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARx\">[MILLER]: Yes. And he references here a ..., \u201ca friendship that started in October of 1981 is forever\u201d, just a number of things in here that are references to all of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ay-dedup-0\">[STATE]: Jeff, is there a specific reference to the body cast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-15\">[MILLER]: Yes, towards the top.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-16\">[STATE]: What does it say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-17\">[MILLER]: It says, \u201cbody cast sponge bath[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-18\">[STATE]: What does that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-19\">[MILLER]: He would have washed me down in a body cast. In an arm cast I couldn\u2019t do it myself, so he referenced doing it for me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-20\">[STATE]: He did that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-21\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-22\">Miller also mentioned the reference in the yearbook about \u201cfoot rubs.\u201d He testified that his sexual relationship with appellant began with foot rubs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>When Miller was asked why he came forward with the allegations of abuse, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">[STATE]: Now, Jeff,- it\u2019s true that ..., that you were reluctant to become involved in this case, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANk\">[MILLER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">[STATE]: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">[MILLER]: That\u2019s a pretty good question. Uh, something I put behind me, never thought about, never wanted to think about it, and I thought I had done a pretty good job about that. Uh, thinking about it is something I didn\u2019t want to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">[STATE]: Why have you decided to come forward now, Jeff?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">[MILLER]: <em>I came forward because I was unfortunately naive enough to think that it began and ended with me. When I found out ..., when the police officer contacted me that </em>... <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>Objection, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-11\">THE COURT: <em>Sustained, sustained.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-12\">[STATE]: Just talk about what happened to you ok?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzA\">[MILLER]: Why did I get involved is the question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">[STATE]: Uhhum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-13\">[MILLER]: Because it became ..., <em>I became aware that it happened to somebody else, </em>and that\u2019s the....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayp-dedup-0\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: <em>Objection, Your Honor. May we approach the Bench?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b158-15\">At the bench, appellant moved for a mistrial. The following discussion ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: The State knew our position with regard to prior bad acts and apparently did not counsel the witnesses. Unfortunately now we have a statement by this witness saying, you know, that it happened another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>time, but the jury .... (inaudible) ...., <em>at this time I would make a Motion for a Mistrial.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">[STATE]: Your Honor, I think it\u2019s pretty apparent that I did not solicit this. I asked him why he came forward. The testimony was that he was very reluctant to come forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Thereafter, the court held a hearing as to the mistrial motion. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... When [Miller] was asked why he was coming forward and started to say, \u201cWell I, you know, I heard things or something[,]\u201d I stood up and objected, that was sustained, and then he was admonished by [the State], \u201cwell just talk about what\u2019s happened to, you[,]\u201d and then he blurts out, \u201cwell, I heard that he had done it to other people[.]\u201d I think that\u2019s not only inadmissible, it\u2019s highly prejudicial, and I think it\u2019s a statement that we can\u2019t get ..., you can\u2019t get ..., it\u2019s not one of those statements, \u201cwell just ignore that[.]\u201d I think it\u2019s ..., I don\u2019t think my client can get a fair trial under that basis and for that reason I would renew that Motion for Mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">[THE STATE]: Your Honor, I just want to say a couple of things. First of all, I certainly did not solicit this comment from Mr. Miller. In my previous dealings with Mr. Miller all throughout the investigation of this case, when we discussed his obvious reluctance and his real wavering on whether to even cooperate in this case at all, he always indicated to me that his reasons for coming forward were two-fold that he didn\u2019t want this type of abuse to happen to someone else and also because he had an obligation to his children, and certainly that was the ..., that was the flavor of the response that I anticipated coming from Mr. Miller. I certainly would not have elicited something that I knew obviously would be prejudicial. The Court must find that the statement is clear and egregious prejudice to the defendant, and I do understand, Your Honor, that certainly if the Court feels that a curative instruction is not applicable in this case, that a mistrial should be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Although the court agreed that Miller\u2019s statement was \u201cprejudicial,\u201d it denied the motion. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">[Wje\u2019re dealing with a case that relates to the offense and it concerns the victim, who is Mr. Miller in this case, Jeff Miller. The' comments occurred during a period of time when Mr. Miller was obviously emotionally distraught, almost in tears when he was testifying about the events that occurred, and there <em>was an objection, I think, before the actual ..., an actual statement as to having heard about prior victims. That was sustained, and once again, before any comments came out, </em>and then there was an objection immediately upon Mr. Miller saying words to the effect that he decided to reveal what happened to him because he had heard about others being subjected to abuse. That was objected to immediately, and the Court sustained the objection, and there was a Motion for Mistrial. There is prejudice, but the question is whether the prejudice at this time can be cured by an instruction, and the Court has to exercise its discretion in a situation like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Mindful of the danger of exacerbating the prejudice with a curative instruction highlighting the inadmissible evidence, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The Court is going to attempt, therefore, to give a curative instruction that will tell the jury that they are not to consider in any way any inadmissible or improper statements of Mr. Miller concerning any allegations of other incidences other than that which Mr. Miller testified concerning himself. So I\u2019m going to deny the Motion for Mistrial and give a curative instruction. But hopefully, it will not happen again.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In reaching that result, the court expressly considered \u201cthe quality of the jurors\u201d and their \u201cability,\u201d based on information gleaned during the <em>voir dire </em>examination, \u201cto put aside any personal prejudices or biases as they have stated to this Court....\u201d Thereafter, the court propounded the following curative instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, before we broke [for lunch], the Court sustained objections to certain testimony of Mr. Miller. I want to instruct you that the court has stricken the testimony of Mr. Miller as it relates only to any comments concerning other incidences other than that which he testified related to himself. The Court instructs you that you are not to consider any inadmissible or stricken evidence during any deliberation or for any reason whatsoever. So I instruct you that there has been evidence and testimony stricken and that you\u2019re not to consider it for any purpose whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Prior to the commencement of the Miller trial, appellant had filed a motion in limine, seeking to exclude testimony from Curtis concerning \u201cother crimes.\u201d The State agreed not to introduce evidence concerning the abuse of Curtis at the Miller trial. Accordingly, Curtis testified briefly at the Miller trial, without disclosing that he had been sexually abused by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Curtis stated that, although he and Miller served as sacristans and played on the football and lacrosse teams together, \u201c[they] weren\u2019t really friends.\u201d Nevertheless, he explained that \u201cthe school is very small, a hundred and twenty (120) students, so [he] knew Jeff, but [they] didn\u2019t associate.\u201d Curtis claimed, however, that appellant had disclosed information to him regarding appellant\u2019s relationship with Miller. Curtis said: \u201c[Father Behrel] told me that he could make Jeff cum<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> without touching him in having sex in a certain position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Appellant testified in his own defense and denied having \u201ca sexual relationship\u201d or \u201cany sexual contact\u201d with Miller. In regard to appellant\u2019s interpretation of what he wrote in Miller\u2019s yearbook, the following exchange is noteworthy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Alright, \u201cwalking on the ceilings!,]\u201d did that ..., did that apply to having anal sex with Mr. Miller in a body cast?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>[APPELLANT]: Well that was one of his expressions, um, and he had many different expressions, um, beyond \u201cwalking on ceilings[.]\u201d I wouldn\u2019t want to sign my name to it, um, because they were too graphic. Um, this [is] all coming from, you know, his girlfriends that were listed and, uh, you know, \u201cstud bolt\u201d and uh, uh,____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: \u201cSave a piece on the side for me[?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">[APPELLANT]: Jeff, yeah, I mean____, I don\u2019t know what that means, um, but here too, \u201cJeff introduces water melon shooters[,]\u201d that was something ..., a big thing in Georgetown. Um, and of course on his own page, I mean there\u2019s various references along with mine that he would drive into Georgetown without a license and with his girlfriends and____\u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\"><em>X </em>* <em>X</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY]: So there was nothing of a sexual nature that you\u2019ve written in the yearbook referring to any sexual contact you had with Mr. Miller?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">[APPELLANT]: No....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">* <em>X X</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">[STATE]: Did you write \u201cFB\u2019s glass pipe[?]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aff\">[APPELLANT]: Uh hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-12\">[STATE]: What did that mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-13\">[APPELLANT]: Well he had several, um marijuana pipes, uh, one was, um, um, wood and metal, uh, and these were actually the things I put in the trunk when he\u2019d bring them to school because I didn\u2019t want him to have it on campus, and the glass one had a very fancy, well I guess marijuana leaf on it, um and I always said that that was..., I thought that pipe was prettier than the other one, so that\u2019s why ..., I mean who would have thought that this was going to come out twenty years later when it was just a joke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-14\"><em>X </em>* <em>X</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-15\">[STATE]: So what you\u2019re saying is that \u201cFB\u2019s glass pipe\u201d does not mean Father Behrel\u2019s glass pipe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>[APPELLANT]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In its instructions to the jury, the court admonished the jurors that \u201c[inadmissible or stricken evidence must not be considered or used by you ... If after an answer was given I ruled that the answer should be stricken, you must disregard both the question and the answer in your deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">2. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Appellant contends that the court erred in denying his motion for mistrial after Miller\u2019s comment as to why he came forward. According to appellant, \u201c[w]ith credibility such a key issue at trial, [appellant] believes the prejudicial statement which was blurted out by Miller could not be erased in the jury\u2019s mind by a curative instruction after the lunch break.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The State responds that \u201cBehrel was not prejudiced and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial.\u201d It contends that \u201c[t]hough Jeff Miller was certainly the principal witness in the case, ... a good deal of other evidence existed to corroborate his account.\u201d Moreover, it maintains that any possible prejudice from Miller\u2019s statement was \u201cneutralized\u201d by the court\u2019s curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">In <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 555, 735 A.2d 1061 (1999), the Court recognized that the decision as to whether to grant a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See also Walker v. State, </em>373 Md. 360, 818 A.2d 1078 (2003); <em>Carter, supra, </em>366 Md. at 589, 785 A.2d 348. Therefore, our task is to decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the mistrial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">In <em>Hunt, supra, </em>321 Md. at 422, 583 A.2d 218, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-11\">\u201cThe declaration of a mistrial is an extraordinary act which should only be granted if necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u201d This Court has recognized that granting a motion for a mistrial lies within the discretion of the trial judge. The trial judge, who hears the entire case and can weigh the danger of prejudice arising from improper testimony is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the best position to determine if the extraordinary remedy of a mistrial is appropriate. We will not reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial unless the defendant was so clearly prejudiced that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Whether a mistrial is warranted hinges upon the question of prejudice to the defendant. <em>Rainville, supra, </em>328 Md. at 408, 614 A.2d 949; <em>State v. Hawkins, </em>326 Md. 270, 276, 604 A.2d 489 (1992). As Judge Moylan said for the Court in <em>Burks v. State, </em>96 Md.App. 173, 187, 624 A.2d 1257, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 381, 631 A.2d 451 (1993): <em>\u201cA </em>mistrial is not a sanction designed to punish an attorney for an impropriety. It is rather an extreme sanction that sometimes must be resorted to when such overwhelming prejudice has occurred that no other remedy will suffice to cure the prejudice.\u201d Noting that the purpose of a mistrial is remedial, not \u201cprophylactic,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 189, 624 A.2d 1257, the <em>Burks </em>Court added: \u201c[T]he decision as to whether a mistrial is called for is contingent upon the impact of an error and not upon the motivation behind the error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, 624 A.2d 1257. Moreover, the remarks must be \u201ca direct and contributing factor\u201d that resulted in \u201cegregious prejudice\u201d to the defendant. <em>Leak v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 353, 358, 579 A.2d 788 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">In <em>Guesfeird v. State, </em>300 Md. 653, 480 A.2d 800 (1984), the Court identified several factors relevant to the evaluation of the prejudicial effect of improper testimony. The factors include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">whether the reference to [inadmissible evidence] was repeated or whether it was a single, isolated statement; whether the reference was solicited by counsel, or was an inadvertent and unresponsive statement; whether the witness making the reference is the principal witness upon whom the entire prosecution depends; whether credibility is a crucial issue; [and] whether a great deal of other evidence exists....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 659, 480 A.2d 800. Nevertheless, the <em>Guesfeird </em>\u201cfactors are not exclusive and do not themselves comprise the test\u201d for determining whether the defendant received a fair trial. <em>Kos-mas v. State, </em>316 Md. 587, 594, 560 A.2d 1137 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The remarks at issue in <em>Guesfeird </em>concerned references to a lie detector test. The Court applied the same factors in <em>Rainville </em>to \u201ca different kind of inadmissible and prejudicial testimony.\u201d <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 408, 614 A.2d 949; <em>see also Coffey v. State, </em>100 Md.App. 587, 598-600, 642 A.2d 276 (1994)(applying the factors to an officer\u2019s statement that the defendant was found guilty at an earlier trial.) In <em>Rainville, </em>the disputed testimony involved a mother\u2019s statement that the defendant, who was charged with the sexual abuse of her seven-year-old daughter, had been \u201cin jail for what he had done\u201d to her nine-year-old son. 328 Md. at 407, 614 A.2d 949. The State\u2019s case in <em>Rainville </em>rested heavily on the credibility of the child victim\u2019s testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 409-410, 614 A.2d 949. The <em>Rainville </em>Court concluded that the mother\u2019s remark was \u201cparticularly prejudicial because the defendant had not been convicted of any sexual <em>offense... ,\" Id. </em>at 407, 614 A.2d 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em>Kosmas, supra,, </em>316 Md. 587, 560 A.2d 1137, is also instructive. There, the defendant was accused of murdering his wife. At trial, the defendant adamantly denied any involvement in the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 590-91, 560 A.2d 1137. Although the State offered testimony that the defendant had declined to take a lie detector test, the court denied the mistrial motion, relying instead on a curative instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 591-92, 560 A.2d 1137. The Court reversed the murder conviction. It recognized that the reference was isolated, and noted that the question as to the State\u2019s fault made \u201cno difference in [the] ultimate determination of prejudice....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595, 560 A.2d 1137. But, applying the <em>Guesfeird </em>factors, the Court considered the weight of the other evidence against the defendant, <em>id. </em>at 596-98, 560 A.2d 1137, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-7\">More important, however, are the questions of whether credibility of the defendant was a crucial issue in the case, and whether the strength of the State\u2019s case was otherwise such that the prejudice resulting from the improper admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>sion of the evidence may be considered insubstantial. On the first issue, it is clear that the defendant\u2019s credibility was critical to the success of his case. Much of the strength of the State\u2019s circumstantial evidence case depended upon the jury believing that the defendant had repeatedly threatened and abused his wife, and had attempted to contract for her murder. The defendant adamantly denied the truth of those allegations. Informing the jury that the defendant had refused to take a lie detector test cut to the heart of the defense....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">... Overall it is fair to say that if [two of the testifying witnesses] are believed, the State has a strong circumstantial evidence case, but even then it is not overwhelming. If the defendant is believed in those areas in which his testimony conflicts with that of [those witnesses], the State\u2019s case is very weak. <em>Again, then, it is apparent that the issue of the defendant\u2019s credibility is a central and crucial factor in this case, and the State\u2019s evidence that does not hinge at least in part upon the determination of that credibility is hardly of sufficient strength to permit us to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not in any way influence the verdict.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Applying the principles of the above-cited cases here, it is significant that Miller never expressly said that appellant sexually abused another student at SJS. Rather, Miller said: 1) \u201cI came forward because I was unfortunately naive enough to think that it began and ended with me;\u201d and 2) \u201cI became aware that it happened to somebody else____\u201d Thus, Miller\u2019s remarks about so-called \u201cother crimes\u201d did not directly implicate appellant; the rather vague comments could have been interpreted by the jury as reflective of Miller\u2019s general awareness of the increased reporting of sexual abuse committed by clergy.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">Moreover, the court gave a curative instruction, which was essentially repeated during the final jury instructions. And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>appellant did not quarrel with the prosecutor\u2019s assertion that she did not deliberately solicit the comments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, the transcript reflects that the State specifically instructed Miller to speak only about events that happened to him, and the State expressed surprise as to Miller\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In weighing the strength of the State\u2019s case as part of a mistrial determination, evidence that depends for its value on a determination of credibility does not weigh heavily in the State\u2019s favor. <em>See Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 411, 614 A.2d 949. The Court has reversed the denial of a mistrial motion when \u201c \u2018the State\u2019s evidence that does not hinge at least in part upon the determination of [the defendant\u2019s] credibility is hardly of sufficient strength to permit us to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not in any way influence the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rainville, </em>328 Md. at 411, 614 A.2d 949 (citation omitted). Appellant urges us to hold that this case fits squarely within that principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">This is not a case in which the State relied only on Miller\u2019s testimony to prove its case. Curtis testified to a damaging admission by appellant; appellant told Curtis that \u201che (i.e., appellant) could make Jeff cum without touching him by having sex in a certain position.\u201d Additionally, a portion of Miller\u2019s yearbook was admitted in evidence, which contained appellant\u2019s handwritten inscription, supportive of Miller\u2019s testimony. Furthermore, the footlocker that Miller described as the coffee table in appellant\u2019s apartment was admitted in evidence. Additionally, it contained a pornographic magazine, also admitted in evidence; the magazine included a reference to the year 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Without question, credibility was crucial to each side\u2019s position. Miller asserted that appellant sexually abused him, and appellant flatly denied Miller\u2019s charge. Yet, the State pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>sented ample evidence independent of Miller\u2019s credibility. That evidence, coupled with the curative instruction and the jury instruction, leads us to conclude that the court below did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for mistrial. <em>See Walker, supra, </em>slip op. at 14; <em>see Lai v. Sagle, </em>373 Md. 306, 818 A.2d 237 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u201c \u2018[T]he grant of a mistrial is considered an extraordinary remedy and should be granted only \u201cif necessary to serve the ends of justice.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Carter, </em>366 Md. at 589, 785 A.2d 348 (citations omitted).

We discuss the Stale\u2019s good faith argument, <em>infra. </em>A reviewing court has discretion to decide the good faith issue without first resolving whether the warrant was supported by probable cause. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 924-25, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (1984); <em>McDonald v. State, </em>347 Md. 452, 469, 701 A.2d 675 (1997), <em>cert. denied, 522 </em>U.S. 1151, 118 S.Ct. 1173, 140 L.Ed.2d 182 (1998); <em>Braxton v. State, </em>123 Md.App. 599, 618 n. 7, 720 A.2d 27 (1998). Nevertheless, when a suppression motion presents a Fourth Amendment issue involving a \u201cnovel question of law whose resolution is necessary to guide future action by law enforcement officers\u201d and judges, it is appropriate for the reviewing court to resolve the probable cause issue. <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 264, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (White, J., concurring); <em>see McDonald, </em>347 Md. at 475-76, 701 A.2d 675 (Chasanow, J., dissenting); <em>Braxton, </em>123 Md.App. at 618 n. 7, 720 A.2d 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">.
