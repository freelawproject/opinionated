Appellant presents four questions for our review, which we have rephrased and reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-11\">I. Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of necessity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-12\">II. Did the trial court err in instructing the jury that proof that the defendant possessed a weapon with an obliterated serial number was presumptive evidence that he obliterated that mark, without explaining that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>such a rebuttable presumption did not shift the burden of persuasion to the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">III. Was the evidence legally sufficient to sustain a conviction of obliterating an identification mark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">IV. Did the trial court err in permitting the State to engage in improper closing argument by telling the jury of the presumption?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">We find no error in the instructions on the wearing, carrying, or transporting charge, but conclude that the trial court did err in its instructions on the obliteration charge. We therefore affirm appellant\u2019s conviction for wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun, and vacate appellant\u2019s conviction for obliterating a manufacturer\u2019s identification mark. We also find that if the jury had been properly instructed, there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant on the obliteration charge. In light of our decision to vacate, we need not separately address appellant\u2019s complaint about closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">Baltimore City Police Officer Scott Ripley testified that at approximately 12:25 a.m. on October 25, 2001, while he was riding in a marked police car in the 6200 block of Boston Street, he saw a man pointing a gun at another man and a woman. The woman was \u201clying on the ground face down\u201d and the man had his hands up in the air and was moving \u201cas if he was going to go down on the ground.\u201d According to Ripley, the assailant was holding a dark blue steel .38 caliber revolver. As the officer was driving down the street, the assailant holding the gun looked at him, then turned and \u201ctook off running.\u201d At trial, Ripley identified appellant as the man who had been holding the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Ripley called for back up. He chased appellant, first by car, then on foot, for about six blocks, but lost sight of him in the 1200 block of Tennant Way. At times while appellant was running, the officer could see the gun in his hand. The last <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>time the officer saw the gun was when appellant was turning onto Tennant Way.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">Sergeant David Hendricks testified that when he was in the area of Elliott Street, Travers Way, and Toone Street, near Tennant Way, he saw Ripley running between buildings. After a brief conversation with Ripley, he and other officers began to canvass the area for appellant. Hendricks heard noise coming from some shrubbery. He shined his flashlight on the shrubbery and saw appellant. After appellant came out of the shrubbery, Ripley arrived and identified appellant as the individual whom he had seen with the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Appellant was arrested. Ripley then returned to the 6200 block of Boston Street to find the man and woman at whom appellant had been pointing the gun, but they had left.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Detective Frank Monday found a blue steel .38 caliber handgun under a bush at 1200 Tennant Way, about 25 feet from where appellant was found. Hendricks retrieved the gun. According to Hendricks, the gun was distinctive because it was large-framed and short-barreled. Hendricks looked for the serial number on the gun, but was unable to find it. Hendricks handed the gun to Ripley. At trial, Ripley said that he had seen appellant holding that gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">Ted Turner, a crime lab technician employed by the Baltimore City Police Department, testified that the gun was operable. He also said that when he received the gun, the serial number had been \u201cscratched or obliterated,\u201d explaining that it was \u201caltered so that you could not clearly tell what the numbers were there.\u201d We shall set forth additional facts as they pertain to our discussion of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">Necessity Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">After appellant was arrested, he explained to Detective Monday how he came to have the gun. He told Monday that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>he had taken money out of his pocket because he was looking for bus fare. While he was counting his money, a man approached him and robbed him at gunpoint. A woman was with the man. Appellant grabbed the gun from the man to protect himself. He ran because he was scared when he saw the police. Appellant\u2019s tape-recorded statement was played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">At trial, defense counsel told the jury in her opening statement that appellant\u2019s defense was necessity. She said, \u201cthere was some physical force or circumstance that caused [appellant] to have the handgun at that time.\u201d She recited the elements of a necessity defense in her opening. When testimony concluded, defense counsel requested an instruction on \u201cnecessity,\u201d as enunciated in <em>State v. Crawford, </em>308 Md. 683, 698-99, 521 A.2d 1193 (1987). The trial court gave the pattern instruction on duress instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in refusing to give the necessity instruction. The State counters, first, that the record on appeal does not include the actual instruction that appellant requested, and second, that appellant did not specifically request the necessity instruction. In addition, the State maintains that it was not error for the trial court to use the duress instruction to instruct the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Failure To Include Instruction In The Record</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">At trial, defense counsel told the trial court that she had given a request for an instruction on necessity to the court\u2019s law clerk. When the court commented that it was a pattern jury instruction, defense counsel explained, \u201cIt\u2019s in the notes. It\u2019s under that rule of duress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">In the comment to the Maryland criminal pattern jury instruction for duress, the committee discusses the relationship between duress and necessity. <em>See </em>MPJI-Crim. 5:03 (2001). Quoting <em>Crawford, </em>308 Md. at 698-99, 521 A.2d 1193, the comments set out the five elements of a necessity defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>listed by the <em>Crawford </em>Court, which are the same factors that defense counsel listed in her opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">After the court gave the pattern instruction on duress, defense counsel excepted, saying that she had asked for the necessity instruction. The trial court responded that \u201c[t'lhe necessity exception is really the duress instruction.\u201d Defense counsel then asked that a copy of the necessity instruction be marked as an exhibit and included in the court\u2019s file, which it was. In these circumstances, the record does include the instruction that defense counsel requested, and the exception was preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">Md. Rule 4-325(c) provides that \u201c[t]he court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law[.]\u201d Upon request, the trial court is required to give an instruction that correctly states the applicable law if it has not been fairly covered in other instructions. <em>See State v. Martin, </em>329 Md. 351, 356, 619 A.2d 992, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 855, 114 S.Ct. 161, 126 L.Ed.2d 122 (1993); <em>Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 592, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984). If the requested instruction is fairly covered by the instructions actually given, however, it need not be given. <em>See Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 211, 670 A.2d 398 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1027, 117 S.Ct. 581, 136 L.Ed.2d 512 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Defense counsel requested the following necessity instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-9\">Necessity is a valid defense to the crime of unlawful possession of a handgun when five elements are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-10\">(1) the defendant must be in present!,] imminent, and impending peril of death or serious bodily injury, or reasonably believe himself or others to be in such danger;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-11\">(2) the defendant must not have intentionally or recklessly placed himself in a situation in which it was probable that he would be forced to choose the criminal conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(3) the defendant must not have any reasonable, legal alternative to possessing the handgun;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\">(4) the handgun must be made available to the defendant without preconceived design; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-6\">(5) the defendant must give up possession of the handgun as soon as the necessity or apparent necessity ends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-7\">The duress instruction that the trial court gave instead was:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ans-dedup-0\">You\u2019re instructed of the following, is that there will be claimed or argued, if you will, or that evidence before you has been heard[,] that the defendant acted under the influence of a overpowering force. This is called \u201cduress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9u\">Duress will excuse an act that would otherwise be criminal. You\u2019re required to find the defendant not guilty if all of the following four factors are present:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">(1) that the defendant actually believed that duress placed him in immediate and impending danger of death or serious bodily harm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-9\">(2) that the defendant\u2019s belief was reasonable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-10\">(3) that the defendant had no reasonable opportunity for escape; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-11\">(4) that the defendant committed the crime because of the duress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-12\">The defense of duress is not established by proof that the defendant had been threatened with violence at an earlier time, but must have been under a present threat at the time of the actual commission of the crime charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-13\">According to the Maryland pattern jury instruction comment, necessity is not listed as a separate instruction because of the interrelationship between duress and necessity. <em>See </em>MPJI-Crim. 5:03 <em>&amp; </em>cmt. The comment explains that duress is the result of pressure by a person, and necessity is the result of pressure from circumstances. The \u201cNotes on Use,\u201d indicate that the trial court should use the duress instruction \u201cif the defendant is charged with an offense other than escape, murder or assault with intent to murder and there is an issue of excuse generated by evidence of duress or necessity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The instruction that the court gave was sufficiently broad that, if the jury believed appellant, it could have found him not guilty of possessing a handgun. If the jury believed appellant\u2019s claims that the couple threatened him using the gun, the jury would have applied this instruction to reach a not guilty verdict. The trial court did not err in failing to give the necessity instruction that appellant sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Citing <em>Crawford </em>as reason to reverse, appellant contends that his version of events, \u201cwhich was far more straightforward and likely than Crawford\u2019s, clearly generated the defense of necessity.\u201d In <em>Crawford, </em>however, the problem was not that the trial court gave the duress instruction, rather than the necessity instruction, but that the trial court gave no necessity or duress instruction at all. <em>See Crawford, </em>308 Md. at 691, 521 A.2d 1193. Here, the trial court recognized that necessity was a valid defense and gave an appropriate instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">Instructions On \u201cPresumptive Evidence\u201d Of Obliteration</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">Appellant contends that his conviction for obliterating an identification number on the handgun must be vacated. He argues that the trial court\u2019s instructions unconstitutionally permitted the jury to conclude that a statutory presumption that a person who possesses a gun with an obliterated serial number is the person who obliterated the mark, shifted the burden of proving that he obliterated the mark from the State to the appellant. The error, he contends, was that the court refused defense counsel\u2019s request that it \u201cexplain to the jury what \u2018rebuttable\u2019 means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The State counters that the trial court correctly instructed the jury that the presumption was rebuttable. It asserts that \u201cthe presumption is not \u2018mandatory\u2019 and the presence of a rebuttable presumption does not alter the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d For that reason, the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to define the term \u201crebuttable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">The Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">When the trial court instructed the jury regarding the charge of obliterating the identification mark, it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">In this case, the second charge is whether or not the defendant, Paul Graham, did obliterate from the gun, remove or change or alter, the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark on the firearm, whether from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt it proves that the defendant here in court, as charged, did, in fact, cause the obliteration, removal of the identification mark from the said firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Although the trial court had not told the jury about the statutory presumption, the prosecutor was permitted to argue it in his closing. He advised jurors that, \u201c[ujnder the law in the State of Maryland, a person in possession of a handgun with an obliterated serial number is presumed to be the person who obliterated the serial number.\u201d Defense counsel objected, but the trial court overruled that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">After both counsel had completed their closing arguments, the trial court told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-10\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, Madam Forelady, you have heard in argument as to what the law is. The Court instructs you that obliterating a firearm is under Article 27, Section 444. It reads, as follows: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for anyone to obliterate, remove, change, or alter the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number on any firearm. Whenever on trial for a violation of this section the defendant is shown to have or have had possession of any such firearm, such fact shall be presumptive evidence that the defendant obliterated, removed, changed or altered the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-11\">The Court further instructs you that the word \u201cpresumption\u201d is a rebuttable presumption and that must be reviewed as to the evidence as before you. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>At a bench conference, the court denied defense counsel\u2019s request for an explanation of \u201cwhat \u2018rebuttable\u2019 means!,]\u201d and noted her exception for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Jury Instructions Regarding Evidentiary Presumptions And Inferences</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u201cInferences and presumptions are a staple of our adversary system of factfinding\u201d because they are \u201coften necessary for the trier of fact to determine the existence of an element of the crime\u2014that is, an \u2018ultimate\u2019 or \u2018elemental\u2019 fact\u2014from the existence of one or more \u2018evidentiary\u2019 or \u2018basic\u2019 facts.\u201d <em>County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 156, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2224, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979). These \u201cstaples\u201d are not without important constitutional limits, however. \u201c[I]n criminal cases, the ultimate test of any device\u2019s constitutional validity in a given case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinder\u2019s responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by the State, to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The Supreme Court has made it clear in a series of cases that, regardless of whether an evidentiary presumption or inference is constitutional on its face, jury instructions regarding such a presumption or inference can be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d This \u201cbedrock, \u2018axiomatic and elementary\u2019 [constitutional] principle,\u201d prohibits the State from using evidentiary presumptions in a jury charge that have the effect of relieving the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of a crime....

Other instructions might explain the particular infirm language to the extent that a reasonable juror could not have considered the charge to have created an unconstitutional presumption. This analysis \u201crequires careful attention to the words actually spoken to the jury ..., for whether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sandstrom, </em>442 U.S. at 514, 99 S.Ct. at 2454) (citation omitted). In these instruction cases, \u201c[t]he federal constitutional question is whether a reasonable juror could have understood the [challenged language in the instruction] as a mandatory presumption that shifted to the defendant the burden of persuasion on the [contested] element ... once the State had proved the predicate acts.\u201d <em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 316,105 S.Ct. at 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">In <em>Sandstrom v. Montana, </em>442 U.S. at 523-24, 99 S.Ct. at 2459, the Supreme Court explained that jury instructions are unconstitutional when a reasonable juror might understand them to create either an irrebuttable presumption, or to create a mandatory but rebuttable presumption that shifts the bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>den of persuasion on any element of the offense to the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sandstrom confessed to killing a young woman, but argued that his personality disorder, aggravated by alcohol consumption, prevented him from doing so \u201cpurposely or knowingly.\u201d <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 512, 99 S.Ct. at 2453. The trial court instructed the jury that a competent person\u2019s acts are presumed to be the product of the person\u2019s will, and that such persons are presumed to intend the consequences of their acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The Supreme Court reversed Sandstrom\u2019s murder conviction because the jury might have misunderstood and misapplied that instruction. <em>See id., </em>442 U.S. at 524, 99 S.Ct. at 2459. The Court reasoned that, as given, the instruction might have led jurors to incorrectly conclude that once the prosecution showed that the defendant was \u201cof sound mind and discretion,\u201d the defense bore the burden of disproving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>evidentiary presumption that he intended to kill the victim. <em>See id., </em>442 U.S. at 517-24, 99 S.Ct. at 2455-59. Whether the instructions were viewed as creating an unrebuttable presumption, or as creating such a rebuttable, burden of proof-shifting presumption, Sandstrom had been deprived of his right to due process of law. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In <em>Francis v. Franklin, </em>the Supreme Court followed <em>Sand-strom </em>and its earlier decisions in disapproving a similar instruction on evidentiary inferences regarding homicidal intent, even though the jury was told that the presumption was rebuttable. During a prison escape, Franklin shot and killed a man as he tried to enter his house with a hostage whom Franklin was holding at gunpoint. Franklin was charged with \u201cmalice murder.\u201d At trial, his lack of malice defense was that when the victim slammed his front door, the gun accidentally fired through the door. The trial court instructed the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">[t]he acts of a person of sound mind and discretion are presumed to be the product of the person\u2019s will, but the presumption may be rebutted. A person of sound mind and discretion is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts but the presumption may be rebutted. A person will not be presumed to act with criminal intention but the ... Jury may find criminal intention upon a consideration of the words, conduct, demeanor, motive and all other circumstances connected with the act for which the accused is prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\"><em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 311-12,105 S.Ct. at 1969-70 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The Supreme Court affirmed the reversal of Franklin\u2019s conviction. <em>See id., </em>471 U.S. at 311-13, 105 S.Ct. at 1969-70. The Court concluded that jurors reasonably could have interpreted this instruction as creating a mandatory rebuttable presumption that shifted the burden of persuasion on the critical state of mind element of the crime. The Court compared the \u201cpresumed\u201d language in the instruction to similar language in the <em>Sandstrom </em>instruction:</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The challenged sentences are cast in the language of command.... These words carry precisely the message of the language condemned in <em>Sandstrom </em>[.] The jurors \u201cwere not told that they had a choice, or that they <em>might </em>infer that conclusion; they were told only that the law presumed it. It is clear that a reasonable juror could easily have viewed such an instruction as mandatory.\u201d The portion of jury charge challenged in this case directs the jury to presume an essential element of the offense\u2014intent to kill\u2014upon proof of other elements of the offense\u2014the act of slaying another. In this way the instructions \u201cundermine the fact-finder\u2019s responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by the State, to <em>find </em>the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d ... A mandatory rebuttable presumption is perhaps less onerous [than a mandatory conclusive presumption] from the defendant\u2019s perspective, but it is no less unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 316-17, 105 S.Ct. at 1972-73 (quoting <em>County Court of Ulster County </em>)(emphasis added in <em>Franklin; </em>other citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Significantly, the <em>Franklin </em>Court rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that the trial court\u2019s instruction that the presumption was rebuttable \u201ccured\u201d its unconstitutionality. <em>See id. </em>Acknowledging that \u201c[t]he language challenged here differs from <em>Sandstrom </em>... in that the jury in this case was explicitly informed that the presumptions \u2018may be rebutted[,]\u2019 \u201d the Court nevertheless concluded that \u201c[t]his distinction does not suffice ... to cure the infirmity in the charge.\u201d <em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 316, 105 S.Ct. at 1972. It then explained why:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">When combined with the immediately preceding mandatory [\u201cpresumed\u201d] language, the instruction that the presumptions \u201cmay be rebutted\u201d could reasonably be read as telling the jury that it was required to infer intent to kill as the natural and probable consequence of the act of firing the gun unless the defendant persuaded the jury that such an inference was unwarranted. The very statement that the presumption \u201cmay be rebutted\u201d could have indicated to a reasonable juror that the defendant bore an affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>burden of persuasion once the State proved the underlying act giving rise to the presumption. Standing alone, the challenged language undeniably created an unconstitutional burden-shifting presumption[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\"><em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. at 1973. <em>See also State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 823 A.2d 664, 2003 Md. LEXIS 251, *57-63, No. 91, Sept. Term 2002 (filed May 9, 2003) (Raker, J., concurring)(citing <em>Franklin </em>and collecting authorities).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In <em>Diaz v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 51, 740 A.2d 81 (1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 482, 745 A.2d 436 (2000), we applied the lessons of <em>Sandstrom </em>and <em>Franklin </em>to section 444. The trial court used the statutory language in instructing the jury that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4B\">possession of ... a firearm [with the manufacturer\u2019s mark obliterated, removed, changed, or altered] is presumptive evidence that the defendant obliterated, removed, changed, or altered the identification mark or number. Do you understand presumptive evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">That if you find that the defendant had possession of that firearm then it is presumptive, it is presumed true that the defendant obliterated, removed, changed or altered the identification mark or number.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 63, 740 A.2d 81. Like the instruction in <em>Sandstrom, </em>this instruction was unconstitutional because \u201cgiving a jury the bare statutory language, without explaining to them that the presumption may be overcome, in this context effectively turns a rebuttable presumption into an irrebuttable presumption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66, 740 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">This case differs from <em>Sandstrom </em>and <em>Diaz </em>in that the trial court explicitly told the jury that the evidentiary presumption was \u201crebuttable.\u201d In that regard, however, it resembles, and is governed by, <em>Francis v. Franklin. </em>We explain, by first examining the challenged portion of the instruction, and then considering \u201cthe potentially offending words ... in the context of the charge as a whole.\u201d <em>See Franklin, </em>471 U.S. at 315, 105 act. at 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">We think that reasonable jurors might conclude from the given instruction that they were obligated to infer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>appellant obliterated the mark unless he proved otherwise. As in <em>Franklin, </em>the challenged instruction was \u201ccast in the language of command[.]\u201d <em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 316, 105 S.Ct. at 1972. The jury was told that evidence showing that the defendant \u201chad possession of any such firearms . .. shall be presumptive evidence that the defendant obliterated ... the manufacturer\u2019s identification mark or number.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As in <em>Franklin, Sandstrom, </em>and <em>Diaz, </em>\u201cthe \u2018jurors were not told that they had a choice, or that they <em>might </em>infer that conclusion[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>471 U.S. at 316, 105 S.Ct. at 1972 (quoting Sandstrom). Thus, \u201c \u2018[i]t is clear that a reasonable juror could easily have viewed such an instruction as mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Sandstrom).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We see no substantive difference between the constitutionally suspect term \u201cpresumption\u201d and the phrase \u201cpresumptive evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, in this instance, the court used both terms interchangeably in its instruction. Either term could mislead jurors into believing that if they concluded that appellant possessed the obliterated weapon (the basic fact), they also had to conclude that appellant obliterated the mark on the weapon (the ultimate fact).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Nonetheless, such a mandatory presumption might still pass constitutional muster if the jury also was instructed that the presumption was rebuttable and that it did not shift the burden of persuasion to appellant. <em>See Franklin, </em>471 U.S. at 314 n. 3, 105 S.Ct. at 1971 n. 3. Both instructions, however, did not happen in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Here, the trial court instructed the jury only that the presumption \u201cis ... rebuttable[.]\u201d We think that a reasonable juror might conclude from the language used by the trial court that appellant had the burden of disproving that he obliterated the identification mark on the gun. As in <em>Franklin, </em>\u201c[w]hen combined with the immediately preceding mandatory language, the instruction that the presumption [is rebuttable] could reasonably be read as telling the jury that it was required to infer\u201d that appellant obliterated the mark unless he could persuade them \u201cthat such an inference was unwarranted.\u201d <em>See Franklin, </em>471 U.S. at 318, 105 S.Ct. at 1973. The trial court\u2019s statement that the \u201cpresumption\u201d was \u201crebut-table\u201d actually might have strengthened that perception, by \u201cindicating] ... that the defendant bore an affirmative burden of persuasion once the State proved the underlying act giving rise to the presumption.\u201d <em>Id.; cf. County Court of Ulster County, </em>442 U.S. at 161 n. 20, 99 S.Ct. at 2227 n. 20 (trial court\u2019s instructions made \u201cit clear that the presumption was merely a part of the prosecution\u2019s case [and] ... that it could be ignored ... even if there was no affirmative proof offered by defendants in rebuttal\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">We are not persuaded that other instructions given by the trial court \u201cexplained] the particular infirm language to the extent that a reasonable juror could not have considered the charge to have created an unconstitutional presumption.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. at 315, 105 S.Ct. at 1971. We see nothing in the court\u2019s instructions explaining that the State retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the burden of proving that appellant obliterated the serial number.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Although flawed instructions regarding presumptions are subject to harmless error review, <em>see Rose v. Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 579-80, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 3106-07, 92 L.Ed.2d 460 (1986), we cannot say that the instructions here were harmless. This presumption was the fundamental component of the State\u2019s case. <em>Cf. Gates v. Zant, </em>863 F.2d 1492, 1502 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 945, 110 S.Ct. 353,107 L.Ed.2d 340 (1989)(\u201ca <em>Sandstrom </em>error is harmless when the evidence of the element of the crime to which the instruction relates is overwhelming or when that element is not in issue\u201d); <em>see generally </em>5 Lynn McClain, <em>Maryland Evidence </em>\u00a7 303:2, at 461 &amp; n. 39 (2d ed.2001)(collecting cases discussing harmless error analysis after <em>Sandstrom </em>error).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The record shows that jurors might have viewed these instructions as direction to treat the presumption as a shift in the burden of persuasion on the critical question of whether appellant was the person who obliterated the mark. By telling jurors only that the presumption was rebuttable, without explaining what \u201crebuttable\u201d means, the trial court may have unconstitutionally shifted to appellant the burden of doing the rebutting, and thereby cast upon him the risk of non-persuasion. Following <em>Franklin, Sandstrom, </em>and <em>Diaz, </em>we shall vacate Graham\u2019s conviction under section 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Sufficiency Of The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Although we conclude that the trial court erred in instructing the jury about the statutory inference, we shall address appellant\u2019s alternative contention that the evidence was not sufficient to convict on the obliteration charge, because if appellant is correct, principles of double jeopardy preclude retrial on that charge. <em>See, e.g., Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 324, 765 A.2d 97 (2001)(appellate courts \u201cnormally address the sufficiency issues even when [it] decides to reverse ... on another ground[,]\u201d because \u201c[i]f ... the evidence admitted at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>trial was insufficient to sustain the ... conviction, then double jeopardy prohibits the retrial\u201d necessitated by the trial court\u2019s original error).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Appellant\u2019s sufficiency argument is based on two distinct premises. This first premise is a factual one\u2014that the State relied solely on the section 444 presumption to convict him on the obliteration charge. The second premise is a legal one\u2014 that the presumption is unconstitutional on its face because there is no rational connection between the fact proved (possession) and the fact presumed (obliteration). <em>See County Court of Ulster County, </em>442 U.S. at 157, 99 S.Ct. at 2225 (permissive inference is unconstitutional if \u201cthere is no rational way the trier of fact could make the connection permitted by the inference\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We reject the threshold factual premise underlying appellant\u2019s sufficiency challenge. Appellant contends that the State presented \u201cabsolutely no evidence that [he] removed a serial number,\u201d and instead relied solely on the section 444 presumption. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Here, in addition to the evidence that appellant possessed the gun, the State presented evidence that appellant used that gun to assault two people on a public street in Baltimore. From this evidence, a jury rationally could conclude that appellant removed the serial number on the revolver he used to commit that crime. Specifically, we think that jurors reasonably might infer from appellant\u2019s deliberate use of the obliterated handgun to commit a violent crime, in a location and manner where there were witnesses and a need to escape quickly into the cityscape, that appellant destroyed the serial number to prevent the gun from being traced to him in the event he had to \u201cditch it\u201d after the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">We need not decide whether, in these circumstances, the section 444 presumption creates an unconstitutional inference. <em>See, e.g., County Court of Ulster County, </em>442 U.S. at 162-63, 99 S.Ct. at 2227 (intermediate appellate court erred in holding statutory presumption unconstitutional \u201con its face\u201d when it could have determined constitutionality based solely on jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>instructions); <em>Tauber v. Montgomery County Council, </em>244 Md. 332, 337, 228 A.2d 615 (1966)(courts \u201cwill refrain from deciding constitutional questions not essential to the proper disposition of the case on the record\u201d). Even if there were no statutory presumption, we would still find that there was sufficient evidence from which a properly instructed and rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant removed the serial number from the revolver. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>White v. State, </em>363 Md. 150, 162, 767 A.2d 855 (2001). We shall remand for a new trial on the obliteration charge, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">CONVICTION AND SENTENCE FOR WEARING, CARRYING, OR TRANSPORTING A WEAPON AFFIRMED. CONVICTION AND SENTENCE FOR OBLITERATING IDENTIFICATION MARK ON FIREARM VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS ON THAT CHARGE ONLY. COSTS TO BE PAID% BY APPELLANT,y\u00a1 BY MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-6\">. In contrast, jury instructions making it clear that the presumption shifts only the <em>burden of production </em>may be constitutional. For example, in <em>County Court of Ulster County v. Allen, </em>442 U.S. 140, 160-61, 99 S.Ct. 2213, 2226-27, 60 L.Ed.2d 777 (1979), the Supreme Court approved a New York court\u2019s instructions regarding a permissive statutory presumption that all persons occupying a vehicle in which an illegal firearm is discovered jointly possess the weapon unless it was found \"upon the person\u201d of one occupant. The Court held that, as given, the instructions ma[d]e it clear that the presumption was merely a part of the prosecution\u2019s case, that it gave rise to a permissive inference available only in certain circumstances, rather than a mandatory conclusion of possession, and that it could be ignored by the jury even if there was no affirmative proof offered by defendants in rebuttal.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">With respect to mandatory presumptions, the <em>Ulster County </em>Court recognized that they are \"far more troublesome evidentiary devicefs]\u201d than permissive presumptions. <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 157, 99 S.Ct. at 2225. The Court noted, however, when a mandatory rebuttable presumption \"merely shiftfs] the burden of production to the defendant, following the satisfaction of which the ultimate burden of persuasion returns to the prosecution,\u201d it might be constitutional if it \"never totally removed the ultimate burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt from the prosecution.\u201d <em>Id., </em>442 U.S. at 159 n. 16, 99 S.Ct. at 2226 n. 16. Moreover, when the mandatory presumption \"imposes an extremely low burden of <em>production\u2014e.g., </em>being satisfied by \u2018any\u2019 evidence\u2014it may well be that its impact is no greater than that of a permissive inference, and it may be proper to analyze it as such.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-7\">.

After Ms. Shipp stopped payment on a $30.20 check for car repairs, Autoville pressed criminal charges against her. At trial on Shipp's malicious prosecution claim against Autoville, the trial court directed a verdict in favor of Autoville, either because it erroneously believed that the statutory presumption was conclusive, or because it erroneously treated the presumption as a rebuttable presumption that shifted the burden of proof to Shipp. <em>See id. </em>at 574-75, 328 A.2d 349.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-5\">.
