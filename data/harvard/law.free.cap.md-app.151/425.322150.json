Following a trial in June 2002, appellant Charles Stewart, Jr. (sometimes referred to as \u201cJunior\u201d or \u201cNookie\u201d), was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County of numerous offenses, including first degree murder of John Butler, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, first degree assault of Omega Nunley, second degree assault of John Nunley, and related charges. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder conviction, and a consecutive term of thirty-five years for the other convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions for our consideration, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">I. Did the trial court err in excluding a declaration against penal interest made by appellant\u2019s father, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Charles Stewart Sr., in which Stewart, Sr., implicated himself and exculpated appellant?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in permitting the State to re-open its case at the suppression hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">For the reasons discussed below, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">FACTUAL SUMMARY<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">On March 5, 2001, Deputy Clayton Safford of the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriffs Office responded to a call for a shooting and found the deceased victim, John Butler (\u201cFats\u201d), lying on Pegg Road, near the Pegg\u2019s View Apartments. Within two to three feet of Butler\u2019s body, Deputy Safford located a kitchen knife. John Nunley (\u201cSnowman\u201d) and Omega Nunley (\u201cMegatron\u201d) were found a short distance away. Both had been severely beaten but were still alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">At the scene, Deputy First Class Mark Beckman found an unfired bullet and a shell casing in the gutter. In front of the apartments, he observed a puddle of blood, a live bullet, and a set of keys. Deputy Thomas Hedderich, the third officer to arrive at the scene, described the appearance of the Nunley brothers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-10\">[T]hey were both laying on the ground in the area of the apartments on the grass. Both of them were swollen, bleeding, cuts about the head and face. And they was just laying there. I asked them if you are all right, are you all right. I got no response, however, their eyes were opened, they were breathing, they were moving around, trying to get up----I noticed a lot of blood, a lot of eyes swollen almost shut, things like that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-14\">James Locke, M.D., an assistant medical examiner, testified as an expert in forensic pathology. He opined that Butler, who was twenty-seven, died as a result of a gunshot wound to the back of the neck. The bullet severed the spinal cord, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>passed through the floor of the mouth, and lodged in the victim\u2019s right cheek. A large caliber metal jacketed bullet was recovered from the cheek. Butler also suffered abrasions to his face, left hand, and right shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Gerald Apollon, M.D., an emergency room physician at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, testified that on the morning in question he treated both John and Omega Nunley. A CT scan revealed that John \u201chad fractures of the skull and also bleeding around the brain as well as -within the brain.\u201d Because of the life threatening injuries, John was transferred to Washington Hospital Center. A drug screening indicated that John was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">John was hospitalized for about three months as a result of the injuries he sustained. A photograph of John, depicting his condition, was admitted into evidence. With regard to John\u2019s current condition, his mother, Joanne Nunley, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">At the moment he had to start back over again to know his ABCs, his colors, his\u2014it\u2019s just like first grade in the way of speaking. He got to learn everything back over again. We are teaching him to know his ABCs, his times. And he had forty stitches in his head. He\u2019s going to therapy twice a week now for ... his right arm, and to learn how to move his arm the right way. And he just, like\u2014I mean, like he know who you are, but he cannot say your name and everything. He just had to start all over again from the beginning as a child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">According to Dr. Apollon, Omega \u201chad some obvious injuries. He had a lot of swelling\u201d and \u201clacerations.\u201d In addition, a CT scan revealed that Omega had a fracture of the right eye socket, fractures of the skull, and bleeding around the brain. As a result, Omega was transferred to Shock Trauma. He tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, and an intoxicating level of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Omega testified that he did not remember what happened on March 4 or March 5 of 2001. He recalled only that his brother picked him up that day and they \u201cwent down to Butler\u2019s.\u201d He added: \u201c[Ajfter that I don\u2019t remember noth-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ing____\u201d Omega was hospitalized for about two months as a result of his injuries, and suffered the loss of eighty percent of the vision in his right eye. He continues to experience headaches and pain in his legs and back.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">John Barnes was with appellant and his father on the evening of March 4 and the morning of March 5, 2001. He testified that in the late hours of March 4, he was at home when appellant and his father, Charles Stewart, Sr. (\u201cSenior\u201d), stopped by to ask him if he wanted to go out. Barnes\u2019s brother-in-law, William Somerville, was also present. Senior drove them in his gray, four-door Oldsmobile to a \u201cclub\u201d called Butler\u2019s Place in Lexington Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">According to Barnes, the group arrived at Butler\u2019s Place shortly after midnight on March 5, 2001, where they drank beer and danced. As the morning wore on, more patrons arrived and people were crowding the dance floor. Barnes testified: \u201cI just saw Charles, Jr., and Fats [i.e., the victim] like face-to-face talking or whatever. I didn\u2019t really pay it no mind. Then it was just a little scuffle had broke out, and they broke everything up, and we left out of there.\u201d Barnes claimed that they were \u201c[p]ushing and shoving\u201d and then \u201cFats tried to pick [appellant] up by his legs, and somehow or another they fell down on the floor, then everybody just broke them up.\u201d Barnes believed that Senior was also involved in the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Appellant struck the bouncer who forced him to leave the club. Barnes and Somerville told appellant, \u201c[L]et\u2019s go home, kill it, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d When Senior exited the establishment, appellant was still upset. At appellant\u2019s suggestion, they drove to the home of appellant\u2019s friend, Stuart Gough. Appellant and Senior went inside. When Barnes went inside to use the bathroom, he saw appellant with a handgun and Gough with a plastic bag. Thereafter, Robert Scriber, Benjamin Hebb, and Nathan Schindler all arrived in Schindler\u2019s Ford Bronco.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Upon leaving Gough\u2019s residence, Barnes, Gough, and Junior entered Senior\u2019s car; Sommerville went with the group in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Bronco. Barnes assumed that they were going to get gas and then go home. He apparently \u201cdozed off\u2019 and, when he awoke, they were heading back to Butler\u2019s Place. At appellant\u2019s direction, Senior went inside. He determined that no one was present.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The group then proceeded to Church\u2019s Chicken to get gas. While there, Barnes went inside to use the restroom and, when he exited, the Bronco pulled up. Barnes still thought they were going home, but he was wrong. He explained: \u201cAnd right when we get up on the turn by Pegg Road, they decided they want to turn up\u201d into the Pegg\u2019s View apartment complex. According to Barnes, it was appellant who stated, \u201cturn on Pegg\u2019s View.\u201d Schindler followed, driving the Bronco. Shortly after the two vehicles parked at the apartment complex, Barnes observed a black Ford Taurus come around the corner, \u201creal fast,\u201d driven by John Nunley. Appellant and Senior immediately \u201cjump[ed]\u201d out of the car and ran to the Taurus. Barnes also recalled that Somerville, Scriber, and Hebb exited the Bronco, but he could not remember if Schindler got out.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">From inside the vehicle, Barnes saw that Senior was \u201cholding\u201d an aluminum baseball bat. According to Barnes, \u201c[t]he tip of the bat\u201d was \u201ccoming down repeatedly.\u201d Barnes \u201ccould hear a little bit of noise,\u201d which he described as \u201ca pinging sound.\u201d He \u201cfigure[d]\u201d the noise came from the bat. Then, Barnes saw Butler exit the apartment building and walk toward the commotion. Barnes heard someone yell, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d At that point, Barnes decided he \u201cwas going to try to get out [of] the car, get away from there.\u201d It was then that Barnes heard a gunshot. Barnes did not know who had the gun, and he quickly \u201cjumped in the car\u201d because he was \u201cscared.\u201d Gough returned to the car and moved it a short distance to another parking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Appellant and Senior ran back to the car; Senior was carrying the bat. While in the car, Barnes saw appellant hand a small black gun to Gough. He also heard appellant say that he had to \u201cgo get rid of the stuff.\u201d When the group arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Lexwood Apartments, Senior \u201cjump[ed] out real fast, ran towards the wooded area[,]\u201d and threw the bat in the woods. Gough also ran into the woods, but headed in a different direction from Senior. When they returned to the car, Barnes thought it was Senior who stated: \u201c[N]obody know nothing.\u201d Barnes was then dropped off at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">At about 5:00 a.m., the police came to Barnes\u2019s house and transported him to the police station, where he was interviewed by Detective David Yingling. Later, the detective informed Barnes that his story was not consistent with other information that had been obtained. According to Barnes, Detective Yingling told him to \u201cjust get it straight, get it right,\u201d so Barnes \u201cgave him the truth.\u201d Barnes explained that he did not tell the truth initially because he was frightened.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">On cross-examination, Barnes agreed that he was somewhat \u201cconfused\u201d about \u201cthe details.\u201d In one of his statements on March 5, for example, he had indicated that he saw Gough hand his gun to Senior, but he acknowledged at trial that he was \u201cnot sure\u201d if that was accurate. Nor did he know who had the gun when the group returned to Senior\u2019s car at Pegg\u2019s View. He also acknowledged that, at the scene, he was in the car with his head down, and so he \u201cmissed a lot of the details there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">On redirect, Barnes claimed that appellant had the gun at Gough\u2019s house. Moreover, when asked if he was \u201cabsolutely sure\u201d that appellant had the gun, Barnes responded, \u201cyes.\u201d In addition, Barnes said that he first saw the bat at Pegg\u2019s View, and claimed that Senior had it and used it. Barnes stated: \u201cI just seen- the tip of the bat just coming up, coming down.\u201d And, according to Barnes, when Senior and appellant ran to the car, Senior was carrying the bat. He also reiterated that, while in the car, he saw appellant \u201chanding [the gun] over ... [to] Gough.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">On re-cross, the defense attorney reviewed Barnes\u2019s statement to the police on March 5, 2001. In that statement, Barnes indicated that Gough said he wanted to bring his \u201cpiece.\u201d Barnes understood that term to mean that Gough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>wanted to bring his gun. In addition, Barnes had said that, while the group was at Gough\u2019s residence, Gough retrieved a bag. Apparently, the gun was in the bag, and Barnes stated that the bag was handed to Senior.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Detective First Class David Yingling testified that, at approximately 10:45 a.m. on the morning of the occurrence, Barnes took him to the area in question and pointed out where the bat had been thrown. Yingling recovered a baseball bat from a wooded area on Lexwood Drive. Detective Yingling also found one RP .380 round from Gough\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">On March 8, 2001, Detective Yingling located a black Davis .380 semiautomatic handgun in the woods near Lexwood Drive. It had one live round in the clip and one in the chamber. The detective estimated a distance of 75 to 100 yards separated the places where the gun and bat were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Gary Dicks, a crime lab technician with the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriffs Office, arrived at the scene of the shooting at about 3:00 a.m. An expended round was found near Butler\u2019s body. Dicks also attended the autopsy of John Butler; a bullet was retrieved from his body. Although a fingerprint was recovered from the knife found near Butler\u2019s body, Dicks indicated that it was not readable. No fingerprints were recovered from the handgun or the shell casing, and the bat also tested negative for fingerprints and blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">Gary Phillips, a firearms examiner, testified that the expended shell casing recovered near Butler\u2019s body, and the bullet recovered from his body, were fired from the handgun found by Detective Yingling. According to Detective David Alexander of the St. Mary\u2019s Sheriffs Office, the handgun was registered to an elderly woman who had no connection to anyone in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">Numerous other witnesses testified for the State, including Benjamin Hebb, Robert Scriber (Senior\u2019s nephew and appellant\u2019s cousin); William Somerville (a relative of the Stewarts and John Barnes); Steven Maddox (the bouncer and cousin of the decedent); Rufus Butler, the owner of the club; Katrina Fenwick, the decedent\u2019s girlfriend; and Kevin Barnes, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>decedent\u2019s friend. Because their testimony was largely consistent with that of John Barnes, we shall only recount select portions.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">According to Hebb, appellant and Senior confronted the Nunleys at 'Pegg\u2019s View. Then, he \u201cheard somebody hit something, and it\u2019s like ting, and you heard that.\u201d At that point, Butler came outside. Hebb stated: \u201cHe [i.e., Butler] went down there, and no sooner he went down there, you just heard a pow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Scriber recalled that Butler and Junior exchanged words on the dance floor at Butler\u2019s Place. He stated: \u201cButler started throwing elbows, and he was hitting Junior with them, and then something happened. I think he pushed Nookie, and then they start the fighting, and then they broke it up.... \u201d According to Scriber, Butler also tried to slam Junior to the ground. Scriber did not see the Nunleys join the fight. At Pegg\u2019s View, Scriber saw appellant hit someone. He also saw Senior with a bat and heard sounds \u201c[j]ust like metal hitting concrete.\u201d Scriber also saw Butler and Kevin Barnes approach the scene. As Butler ran behind a building, appellant and Senior pursued him. Then, Scriber heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Kevin Barnes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified that he, his girlfriend, Katina Jenkins, Butler, and Butler\u2019s girlfriend, Katrina Fenwick, were at Butler\u2019s Place when a fight broke out between Butler and the Stewarts. According to Barnes, Senior' displayed a knife during the fight. Barnes claimed that Senior \u201ckept acting like he was trying to stab [Butler], but I kept grabbing his arm telling him stop, put the knife away.\u201d Barnes eventually pushed. Butler into the pool room, and did not see where Junior and Senior went after the fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Kevin left the club with Butler, Jenkins, and Fenwick; they went to Fenwick\u2019s residence at Pegg\u2019s View Apartments. Upon hearing a commotion outside, Butler left the apartment, followed by Barnes, Jenkins, and Fenwick. Barnes saw two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>people on the ground, their faces covered \u201cwith so much blood, you couldn\u2019t tell who they were.\u201d Barnes observed Junior reaching into an injured man\u2019s pockets, screaming at him, \u201c[Wjhat you got in your pocket, what you got in your pocket[?]\u201d He also saw Butler push Junior away, stating: \u201c[G]et off, that\u2019s my boys, get off.\u201d When Senior tried to hit Butler with the bat, Barnes intervened and was struck in the leg. Barnes recalled that Butler ran around the building, with Junior and Senior chasing him. Somerville told Barnes to get back. As he, Jenkins, and Fenwick ran toward Fenwick\u2019s apartment, they heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">William Somerville testified that he saw Butler throw an elbow while at the club. Butler also pushed appellant and grabbed him. When the Nunleys arrived at Pegg\u2019s View, appellant and Senior got out of the car. Appellant approached Omega, while Senior, who was carrying a bat, approached John. Appellant wrestled with Omega, and Senior struck John with the bat once. He then began to hit Omega. Somerville stated that it sounded like Senior \u201cwas hitting the concrete.\u201d During the fight, Kevin Barnes and Butler came outside and approached Senior. Butler ran, with Senior and appellant in pursuit. Then, Somerville heard a gunshot. But, he did not see anyone in possession of a gun. Later that morning, Somerville telephoned appellant and asked who had the gun. Appellant responded that Senior had it. Appellant also stated that he and Senior were the only people involved in the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Schindler recalled that, at Pegg\u2019s View Apartments, he was sitting in the Bronco with Scriber, Hebb, and Somerville when they heard some noise. They exited their vehicle and walked \u201creal slow\u201d toward the commotion. Schindler saw \u201csilhouettes of a bat swinging and people jumping around, just look like fighting.\u201d But, he did not know who wielded the bat. Then, Butler came outside, followed by Kevin Barnes. When Butler \u201cgot down there,\u201d Schindler heard someone say, \u201c[T]here he is[.]\u201d Schindler then saw \u201cpeople take off running behind that comer[,]\u201d but Schindler could not see who they were. Mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>ments later, Schindler heard a gunshot. Then, Senior ran toward his car, carrying a bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Rufus Butler<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified that he saw appellant \u201cswinging at\u201d the bouncer, Steven Maddox. Rufus attempted to help Maddox, but Senior intervened and told appellant not to fight. However, Senior asked Butler to identify the people who had been fighting with Junior. Senior also pulled out a gun, but he put the gun in his pocket when appellant stood at the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Maddox recalled that, when Senior returned to the club, he \u201casked where the fellas was at.\u201d Maddox told him that they were gone. Senior reached into his pocket, pulled out a gun, and stated: \u201c[T]his is what I got for the fellas[.]\u201d Maddox described the weapon as a small, black handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Katrina Fenwick, the victim\u2019s girlfriend, testified about the \u201cscuffle\u201d at the club involving Butler, appellant, and an older man who brandished a knife. Soon after arriving at Fenwick\u2019s apartment, they heard a commotion and Butler \u201cstormed out of the door[.]\u201d Barnes also went outside, because Fenwick asked him to get Butler. Fenwick testified: \u201cSo when Kevin went down the stairs, at that point I was nervous, I didn\u2019t know what to do. I went to the dishwasher and grab a knife. I didn\u2019t know if they were going to come up to my apartment, so I grabbed a knife, went outside.\u201d Once outside, Fenwick found John and Omega Nunley on the ground. Then, Fen-wick heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Appellant, who was bom on September 5, 1977, was arrested by Detective William Raddatz on March 21, 2001. As the detective read the indictment to appellant, he interjected: \u201c[D]amn, all I did was beat the boy.\u201d Appellant had not yet received his Miranda<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> warnings, because Detective Raddatz had not intended to question appellant at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>Detective Steven Hall interviewed appellant at approximately 3:00 p.m. on March 5, 2001. The detective advised appellant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights; appellant agreed to provide a taped statement,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which was played for the jury. In his statement, appellant informed the detective that he was with his father, Somerville, and John Barnes at the club. \u201cFats, Snowman and Omega\u201d were also present. According to appellant, \u201cFats was throwing elbows\u201d while they were dancing. An altercation erupted involving appellant, Senior, John Barnes, and Somerville; \u201csomebody hit [appellant]\u201d causing him to fall to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">After leaving the club, they went to Gough\u2019s house and obtained a gun. He thought the people in the Bronco \u201calready had the baseball bat in the ... truck.\u201d When they went to Pegg^ View, they were \u201clooking for\u201d Butler to \u201cfight one on one[.]\u201d John and Omega Nunley arrived, and appellant said he and Senior \u201cran after \u2019em.\u201d Senior struck Snowman first, with a baseball bat; appellant was fighting with Omega. Then, Senior hit Omega. When Butler came outside, appellant said they \u201ccracked his bones, well we cracked him with the baseball bat.\u201d Then, while appellant and Omega were \u201con the ground fighting,\u201d appellant \u201cheard a gunshot.\u201d At that point, \u201c[everybody ran [back] to the car.\u201d When asked, \u201cwho shot the gun,\u201d appellant replied: \u201cMy dad did.\u201d Appellant claimed that his father threw the gun in the woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defense did not present a case. We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ARN\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">As we noted, Senior was charged in this incident but was tried separately. At issue here are the statements that Senior made to various police officers, which were incriminating as to him and exculpatory as to appellant. Because the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>refused to admit Senior\u2019s statements at appellant\u2019s trial, as declarations against penal interest, appellant urges us to reverse. We discern neither error nor abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Prior to trial, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to exclude Senior\u2019s statements. In connection with that motion, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing during the trial, outside the presence of the jury. Senior invoked his right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment. Therefore, it is undisputed that Senior was unavailable within the meaning of the declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Corporal Terence Black testified that, on March 5, 2001, while Senior was in the holding cell, he commented \u201cthat he had shot that man, and that his son didn\u2019t have anything to do with it.\u201d The corporal asked Senior if he remembered being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and Senior remarked that he did. Corporal Black testified: \u201cAnd then he again stated to me that ... this was all my fault, my boy didn\u2019t have nothing to do with it.\u201d Corporal Black again read Senior his <em>Miranda </em>rights, escorted him to the police cruiser, and transported him to the detention center.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">En route to the detention center, Senior reiterated to Black that \u201chis boy didn\u2019t have anything to do with this, and that he [Senior] was responsible for it, and that it was all his fault.\u201d Corporal Black asked Senior \u201cwhat happened down there last night[,]\u201d and Senior responded \u201cthat he shot that man, he shouldn\u2019t have been messing with those young boys down at the bar.\u201d Senior explained that \u201cthe individual ran from him. The individual bent down, when he bent down, he [i.e., Senior] shot him in the back of the head.\u201d According to Black, when Senior made the statements he knew he was facing a considerable amount of jail time. The defense also elicited that Senior said, \u201cI guess I\u2019m going to be here a long time this time for killing a man, but I got to pay for what happened, it was my fault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The trial court then conducted the folio-wing inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>THE COURT: Was your thinking, Officer Black, that there was at least a possibility that the declarant, Stewart, Sr. was making it up so that he could help his son?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">[BLACK]: At first I thought he was being sincere with me, but then he made a comment that kind of changed my opinion a little bit when he said, you know, I got to pay for what\u2019s been done, and it\u2019s all my fault. And I even asked him\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">THE COURT: As if he instigated the proceedings, but may not have been the actual actor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">[BLACK]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">THE COURT: That was your mental impression?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">[BLACK]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Additionally, the court asked: \u201cOfficer Black, would you characterize this statement as one that you are not going to the bank with?\u201d Black responded: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d The court promptly ruled that Senior\u2019s statements to Corporal Black were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Appellant then called Officer John Bartlett, III, of the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriffs Office. He testified that, on March 9, 2001, at approximately 10:30 a.m., while at the detention center, Senior asked the officer to read aloud to him a newspaper article about Butler\u2019s death. As Officer Bartlett read the article, Senior interrupted and said: \u201cWhat else was I supposed to do.\u201d Senior also told the officer that Butler had \u201cstarted the fight with him\u201d and that he, Senior, \u201cfired a weapon,\u201d but that \u201che just fired one shot.\u201d Moreover, Senior claimed he \u201cnever meant to kill anyone.\u201d In addition, Senior claimed: \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t killed him, he was going to kill me. He was bigger and younger than me.\u201d Senior added: \u201cHe hit me upside my head with a bottle\u201d and \u201cI had to protect myself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">According to appellant\u2019s counsel, Senior had no \u201cmotive to falsify\u201d in regard to his statement to Bartlett. The court disagreed, concluding that this hearsay statement was not sufficiently trustworthy. The court stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>[W]hen he [Senior] makes the statement to the correctional officer, he says, well, what was I supposed to do, as if suggesting that he did it all right, but it was self-defense. Also suggesting that maybe at the time Nunley had a bottle and was going to attack him. <em>So while he says he did it, he\u2019s also offering the officer, the correctional officer his defenses. </em>And what that brings up in the Court\u2019s mind is that it\u2019s\u2014it just doesn\u2019t appear that the statement is trustworthy enough to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">\n<em>[M]y conclusion would be that Senior is operating here to shield his son, but also to some degree looking after his own interest.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">So I don\u2019t believe, and my'ruling is that that statement by the correctional officer should not be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">Appellant also called Detective William Raddatz. He noted that Senior voluntarily went to the sheriffs headquarters on the morning of March 5, 2001, and orally admitted that he shot Butler and struck the Nunleys with a baseball bat. He was then arrested and subsequently provided two tape recorded statements. According to Detective Raddatz, after Senior provided his first statement, he (Raddatz) checked on the progress of the investigation and discovered \u201cinconsistencies\u201d between Senior\u2019s statement and what the other officers had learned. Therefore, a second taped statement was obtained from Senior about an hour later. Both tapes were played for the court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">The first statement was taken at 11:00 a.m., after Senior was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In that statement, Senior acknowledged that he was involved in an altercation at Butler\u2019s Place, \u25a0 and then he \u201cgot in a fight\u201d with \u201cthree boys\u201d at Pegg\u2019s View. He claimed that two of the \u201cboys\u201d were \u201ctrying to hit [him] with bats,\u201d so he hit each of them \u201cone time.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Senior also said that \u201canother boy had a knife,\u201d and he \u201cthought\u201d that person also \u201chad [a] gun.\u201d Senior recalled that when \u201che [i.e., Butler] reached down for a gun,\u201d Senior \u201cshot the other boy.\u201d Senior did not know, however, who gave him (Senior) the gun. According to Senior, \u201ceverybody\u201d got out of the vehicles to fight because the others \u201cswung on [Senior] with a bat, and another boy had a knife throw [sic] at me.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Senior related in his second statement that he had been involved in a fight at the bar, and claimed \u201ceverybody in the whole bar got fighting.\u201d According to Senior, after his group left the bar, they \u201cstopped\u201d at Gough\u2019s place. When Senior was asked why he went to Gough\u2019s house, and what he got at Gough\u2019s residence, he responded: \u201cI didn\u2019t go there for nothing. ... I didn\u2019t get nothing from him.\u201d Senior added: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether the gun was gotten or not. All I seen was a white paper bag.... \u201d Moreover, Senior claimed that he did not know who had the bag, adding: \u201cOne of them other boys [in the Bronco] had it.... \u201d Senior insisted that he \u201cnever touched no bag,\u201d nor did he \u201cknow what\u2019s in the bag.\u201d The following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">THE COURT: Stop the tape there for a minute. Officer, at this point you know that when Senior says to you, in effect, he didn\u2019t get anything from Stuart Gough\u2019s house, you know he\u2019s lying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: He had already told me earlier, we weren\u2019t being taped, that he got\u2014the gun was in a white paper bag. He got the gun from Stuart Gough\u2019s house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">THE COURT: Right. He\u2019s clever enough when he gets on tape he doesn\u2019t want to repeat that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">THE COURT: Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-14\">THE COURT: That was your assessment also. So his plan is, first of all, if he can lie his way out of it, he\u2019s going to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">THE COURT: But if you catch him in Court in a lie, then he is going to try to make a justification or rationale] for what he did, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: I think he was trying to minimize certain things, certain aspects of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">THE COURT: Right. <em>So he was, he was trying to reduce his own culpability if you really nailed him doum?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"agm-dedup-0\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">The tape was re-started, and the Detective asked Senior to identify the individuals involved in the altercation at Pegg\u2019s View Apartments. Senior responded that he did not know the \u201cthree boys,\u201d but he described one as \u201cshort, fat\u201d and two as \u201ctall and skinny.\u201d The court stopped the tape again, and the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">THE COURT: Officer, he surely knows the boys; does he not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: It was my assessment that he did, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">THE COURT: He did. And when he describes them to you, you ask him could you describe them, his answer is short, fat, and tall and skinny, two of them is tall and skinny. You knew right then he was lying to you; didn\u2019t you officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-13\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">With respect to the altercation at Pegg\u2019s View, Senior said: \u201cI know I done everything.\u201d He explained: \u201cWell, I hit [the] boys with the bat and cause they had a bat at me I hit the boys ... with a bat.\u201d He added: \u201cThey swung at me with a bat and I snatched back, I hit them back, I hit them with a bat. Cause they swung at me with a bat and I hit the other one with a bat, cause he swung at me.\u201d Senior, born in 1956, acknowledged that the Nunleys, in their 20\u2019s, are considerably younger than he is. He maintained that he hit Omega and John Nunley just \u201cone time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>At that point, according to Senior, \u201canother boy come around there with a knife or gun.... \u201d Senior told Butler that he (Senior) had a gun, and Butler \u201cturned around.... \u201d According to Senior, Butler threw the knife at him, and Senior \u201cducked.\u201d Senior continued: \u201cHe (Butler) tried to stab me \u25a0with it, he threw it at me.\u201d When Raddatz asked, \u201cAnd then what did you do?\u201d, Senior replied: \u201cI shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Senior maintained that, at the time of the shooting, Butler \u201cwas coming towards me.\u201d Senior added that Butler had \u201creached down ... beside the curb like he was going to get another gun.\u201d Further, Senior stated that \u201csome other boys were around there shooting to[o].\u201d The court interrupted and the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">THE COURT: Officer, at this point he seems to be suggesting that it\u2019s an all-out gun battle with numerous people shooting at one another, and he\u2019s just one of the combatants, but you knew that wasn\u2019t true; didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVl\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ!: Well, his earlier statements were inconsistent with this and appeared to me that he was trying to minimize things as he went along to try to make up excuses. This part of his testimony was incredulous because of the way he told it happened initially was completely inconsistent with the way he was telling me is happening now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">THE COURT: What do you gather is his motive when he\u2019s talking with you at this point in the tape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">[DETECTIVE RADDATZ]: I think he knows that he\u2019s already told us that he did this, and it\u2019s going to have to go to trial, and he\u2019s going to have to come up with some sort of defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">In his statement, Senior \u201cforgot\u201d who gave him the gun, nor did he know if it was someone who came to the area with him. Moreover, he could not identify the other people who were shooting. Afterwards, according to Senior, \u201csomebody snatched the gun out of [Senior\u2019s] hand.\u201d When questioned about an inconsistency concerning the disposal of the gun, Senior responded: \u201cMy mind is all mixed up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>On cross-examination, Raddatz noted that, prior to the taped interviews, Senior had stated he was alone during the incident. The following exchange is noteworthy.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2-\">[PROSECUTOR]: And you ask him about the shooting, and reading from your report, he also did not reveal where he got the gun. He said someone at the scene in a fight gave it to him. He gave details about how he hit one of the victims with the bat and the other one in the head, correct? [RADDATZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: At that point you tell him that John Barnes told you he and Stewart, Jr. were the people that beat the Nunley brothers. And he said he did it all, he said Stewart, Jr. didn\u2019t have anything to do with it, with the shooting or beating, he did it all, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">[RADDATZ]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: This is still all prior to the taped statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-8\">[RADDATZ]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Okay. And at that point you say in your report he admitted that his son, Charles Henry Stewart, Jr., was present during the fight; however, he said that he [i.e., appellant] did not do anything. So this is the first time that he even acknowledges that Charles Stewart, Jr. was with him, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-10\">[RADDATZ]: Correct, after we told him that John Barnes had told us that we knew he was there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The defense attorney reiterated that the statements were trustworthy because they were against Senior\u2019s penal interest. In particular, as to the statements of March 5, she maintained that Senior had \u201cvery little time to think of a way to falsify.\u201d Claiming that all the statements were corroborated, she urged the court to admit the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">The court disagreed, characterizing Senior\u2019s statements as \u201cuntrustworthy.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-13\">What the defense wants me to do is to take only that portion of [the statement], I shot the fella, and exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>everything else, and that would leave in the jury\u2019s mind that Senior is telling the truth. And the Court would be said to say earlier in this <em>Matusky </em>hearing that the statement made by Stewart, Sr. complies with the standards set forth in that case. I just don\u2019t see how that\u2019s possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">Stewart, Sr. is a gentleman of extraordinarily limited education. Apparently he could not read. On the other hand, he is obviously very streetwise. Now, he is laboring, apparently, under the false belief that he can admit to his culpability, but at the same time minimize the consequences for himself and his son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">So here you are having Charles, Sr. say yeah, I shot the boy, but it really was in self-defense. Oh, yeah, I shot the boy, but he was going to use a bottle on me. Or rather yeah, I shot the boy, but he was going to use a knife on me. Then he wants to say that, well, I shot the boy, but after all, it was only part of a large gun battle and I\u2019m just a mutual combatant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Relying on <em>State v. Matusky, </em>343 Md. 467, 682 A.2d 694 (1996), the court determined that Senior\u2019s statements were not admissible. It reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">Now, we believe that Mr. Stewart had a motive to misrepresent what the actual facts were. It is true that he was admitting shooting someone, but he also is asserting his own self-defense to that shooting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Secondly, he\u2019s trying to mitigate the extent of what he had cause[d] to happen. We consider the character of the speakert his being held by the police. Although not educated, he\u2019s streetwise, he is trying his desperate best to get himself out of what he perceives his situation to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">Whether the statement was made spontaneously. Well, of course, this statement was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">You know it\u2019s entirely possible the Court thinks what\u2019s going on in Senior\u2019s mind is a very simple proposition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Both of them are going to be charged with these heinous crimes, they are going to be tried separately. So when the son is tried, he, Senior can say that he [i.e., Senior] did it. And when the son gets off, the son comes in the second trial and says that he, the son, did it.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">This statement and other statements made by the father, the Senior, in my judgment are not admissible under <em>State v. Matusky, </em>and the Court so rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">As we noted, appellant contends that the trial court improperly excluded Senior\u2019s statements, which were exculpatory as to appellant. Relying on <em>Gray v. State, </em>368 Md. 529, 796 A.2d 697 (2002), decided after appellant\u2019s trial, appellant contends that Senior\u2019s statements constituted declarations against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">We begin our analysis with a review of Maryland Rule 5-804, pertaining to the admissibility of declarations against penal interest. In part, the rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">Rule 5-804. Hearsay exceptions; declarant unavailable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">(a) Definition of unavailability. \u201cUnavailability as a witness\u201d includes situations in which the declarant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">(2) refuses to testify concerning the subject matter of the declarant\u2019s statement despite an order of the court to do so[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-14\">(b) Hearsay exceptions. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">* ^ H: .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">(3) Statement against interest. A statement which was at the time of its making so contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, so tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or so tended to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. <em>A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Maryland Rule 5-804 (2003) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">As we recently explained, under Rule 5-804(b)(3), the trial court must determine whether: \u201c1) the declarant\u2019s statement was against his or her penal interest; 2) the declarant is an unavailable witness; and 3) corroborating circumstances exist to establish the trustworthiness of the statement.\u201d <em>Roebuck v.

But, \u201cthere is no litmus test that courts must follow to establish adequate corroboration or trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roebuck, </em>148 Md.App. at 580, 813 A.2d 342. Ultimately, it is \u201cwithin the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether the evidence was sufficiently reliable for admissibility.\u201d <em>Wilkerson, </em>139 Md.App. at 577, 776 A.2d 685; <em>see West, </em>124 Md.App. at 166, 720 A.2d 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Several Maryland cases have elucidated the interrelated issues of corroboration and trustworthiness, usually in the context of declarations offered by the State. In <em>State v. </em>Standifur, 310 Md. 3, 526 A.2d 955 (1987), for example, the Court of Appeals considered the admissibility of a declaration against penal interest offered <em>against </em>the accused, not <em>by </em>the accused. The <em>Standifur </em>Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\"><em>The circumstances surrounding the making of the statement must be carefully analyzed to determine the likelihood that the statement was truthful. Critical to this analysis is the state of mind of the declarant at the time the statement was made. </em>Unless the declarant then believed the statement to be against his penal interest, there is no basis for presumed reliability. However, because of the unavailability of the declarant and other problems of proof, the party urging this exception is not required to prove the actual state of mind of the declarant but must prove sufficient surrounding facts from which the trial judge may inferentially determine what the state of mind of a reasonable person would have been under the same or similar circumstances.....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">... The more important criterion is that a reasonable person, in the situation of the declarant would have perceived the statement as disserving at the time he made it....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">In summary, a trial judge considering the admissibility of a hearsay statement offered as a declaration against penal interest must carefully consider the content of the statement in light of all known and relevant circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and all relevant information concerning the declarant, <em>and determine whether the statement was in fact against the declarant\u2019s penal interest </em>and whether a reasonable person in the situation of the declarant would have perceived that it was against his penal interest at the time it was made. The trial judge should then consider whether there are present any other facts or circumstances, <em>including those indicating a motive </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>to falsify on the part of the declarant, that so cut against the presumption of reliability </em>normally attending a declaration against interest that the statements should not be admitted. A statement against interest that survives this analysis, and those related statements so closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy, are admissible as declarations against interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 12,13,17, 526 A.2d 955 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The Court of Appeals also addressed the admissibility of a statement against penal interest in <em>State v. Matusky, supra, </em>343 Md. 467, 682 A.2d 694, on which the trial court relied in excluding Senior\u2019s statements. Matusky was charged with two counts of first degree murder; one of the victims was the estranged wife of Richard White, Matusky\u2019s friend. <em>Id. </em>at 470, 682 A.2d 694. The police questioned Matusky, White, and White\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Rebecca Marchewka. White told the police that he knew nothing about the crimes, claiming that he had spent the entire day shopping with Marchewka. She initially corroborated White\u2019s account. <em>Id. </em>at 471, 682 A.2d 694. Three months later, in a conversation with Marchewka, White implicated Matusky in the murders. Marchewka contacted the police and retracted her prior statement. <em>Id. </em>At Ma-tusky\u2019s trial, White invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 682 A.2d 694. Through Marchewka, the State sought to introduce White\u2019s declaration against penal interest. Upon finding White unavailable, the trial court determined that Marchewka could testify as to White\u2019s declaration. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Marchewka testified that White told her that Matusky had killed the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The <em>Matusky </em>Court explained that, after the proponent of the evidence establishes the first criterion\u2014the unavailability of the witness\u2014the trial court must \u201c \u2018carefully consider the content of the statement ... and determine whether the statement was in fact against the declarant\u2019s penal interest....\u2019\u201d <em>Matusky, </em>343 Md. at 479, 682 A.2d 694 (quoting <em>Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d 955). If the hearsay statement satisfies the second step, the trial court must next determine whether the facts establish that the declarant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>\u201c \u2018a motive to falsify,\u2019 \u201d which \u201c \u2018cut[s] against the presumption of reliability normally attending a declaration against [penal] interest....\u2019\u201d <em>Matusky, </em>343 Md. at 480, 682 A.2d 694 (citation omitted). The Court concluded: \u201c \u2018A statement against interest that survives this analysis, <em>and those related statements so closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy, </em>are admissible as declarations against interest.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matusky, </em>343 Md. at 482, 682 A.2d 694 (citation omitted) (emphasis added in Matusky).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The Court concluded, however, that the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s entire testimony should not have been admitted. <em>Id. </em>at 484, 682 A.2d 694. In its view, the trial court \u201cerroneously permitted [the fianc\u00e9e] to testify to the entire conversation she had with White.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 492, 682 A.2d 694. Instead, it should have \u201cparse[d] the hearsay declaration to admit only those individual statements that were contrary to White\u2019s penal interest.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485, 682 A.2d 694. The Court explained that the \u201ccollateral portions of White\u2019s account should [have been] redacted,\u201d including the \u201cportions of White\u2019s declaration identifying Matusky as the murderer.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>In its view, the parts of the declaration that \u201cdid not directly incriminate White\u201d were \u201cnon-incriminating statements\u201d as to the declar-ant, \u201cbecause they serve[d] to shift blame from White to Matusky.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the Court observed that the statements were \u201cnot as trustworthy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Recently, in <em>Gray v. State, </em>368 Md. 529, 796 A.2d 697 (2002), the Court of Appeals discussed both <em>Standifur </em>and <em>Matusky. </em>However, in contrast to <em>Standifur </em>and <em>Matusky, </em>in which the State was the proponent of the declaration against penal interest, it was the defendant in <em>Gray </em>who sought admission of the declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 796 A.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Gray was convicted of the first degree murder of his wife, Bonnie. The theory of Gray\u2019s defense was that his wife was murdered by her lover, Brian Gatton; he allegedly told a woman named Evelyn Johnson that he had killed Bonnie. When Gatton refused to testify at trial, Gray sought to offer Gatton\u2019s statements through Johnson, as declarations against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>penal interest. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 796 A.2d 697. Claiming that Johnson was not credible, the State objected. On appeal, Gray challenged the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit Gatton\u2019s statements as declarations against penal interest. The Court of Appeals agreed with Gray. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 796 A.2d 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The <em>Gray </em>Court considered it significant that the defendant was the one who sought to introduce the declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 796 A.2d 697. Consequently, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses <em>against </em>him is not implicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis in original). In contrast, in <em>Ma-tusky </em>and <em>Standifur </em>the declarations were offered by the State <em>against </em>the defendants. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Court observed that it was not the trial court\u2019s function to assess Johnson\u2019s credibility as the relator of Gatton\u2019s statements. <em>Id. </em>at 545, 796 A.2d 697. It noted that in <em>Standifur, </em>the trustworthiness assessment concerned the statement made by the unavailable declarant, not the trustworthiness of the in-court relator of the out-of-court declaration. <em>Id. </em>at 543, 796 A.2d 697. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">The holding in <em>Standifur </em>(and in the cases generally) is concerned with assessing the trustworthiness of the out-of-court statement that inculpates, not exculpates, a defendant.[ ] There is nothing in <em>Standifur, </em>or in any of our cases of which we are aware, that in a jury trial specifically permits a trial court to make a factual assessment of the trustworthiness of the in-court relator of the out-of-court declaration that exculpates a defendant. The credibility of the witness in such cases is normally to be assessed as witness credibility is generally determined\u2014by the trier of fact.[ ] An in-court relator of what she has heard outside the courtroom is, normally, as to whether she actually heard the declaration, in the same witness situation as an' in-court relator of what they have seen outside the courtroom. Generally, credibility is tested by examining the witness, especially by cross-examination of the witness by the opposing party, which in the present case at the pre-trial hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>was vigorous and extensive. In a jury trial, it is, generally, not the court\u2019s function to assess that type of credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHtM\"><em>Gray, </em>368 Md. at 544-45, 796 A.2d 697 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The <em>Gray </em>Court reiterated, however, that Rule 5-804(b)(3) requires corroboration of \u201ca declarant\u2019s inculpatory statement that exculpates an accused____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545 n. 11, 796 A.2d 697. But, it found that corroboration from the fact that Gatton and the victim were involved in a love triangle; Gatton possessed jewelry similar to that worn by the victim; Gatton had Johnson pawn some of the jewelry; Gatton displayed a hunting knife and a small handgun when he made the statements; and the victim was shot and stabbed. <em>Id. </em>at 545-46, 796 A.2d 697. Accordingly, the Court concluded, at 368 Md. at 547, 796 A.2d 697:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">Under the circumstances here present, petitioner was entitled to present his defense, <em>i.e., </em>that Gatton killed Bonnie Gray. When Gatton, through the invocation of his right to remain silent became unavailable, petitioner was, under the facts of this case, entitled to present to the jury Gatton\u2019s declarations against penal interest through the person that allegedly heard the declarations, Evelyn Johnson. Under the circumstances here present, it was error to deny their admission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">After <em>Gray </em>was decided, this Court was faced with a similar issue in <em>Roebuck, supra, </em>148 Md.App. 563, 813 A.2d 342. There, the young victim died as a result of numerous knife and gunshot wounds. Roebuck and his cousin, Rolston James, Jr., were both charged with the murder. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 813 A.2d 342. During a custodial interrogation, Roebuck admitted that he gave the gun to James but claimed James killed the victim. In his custodial statement, James admitted to the crime, but claimed that Roebuck \u201cphysically\u201d tried to \u201cstop\u201d him during the attack. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 813 A.2d 342. At James\u2019s murder trial, the State used James\u2019s statement against him to secure a conviction. Then, at Roebuck\u2019s trial, James refused to testify because his appeal was pending. Accordingly, Roebuck sought to introduce in evidence the statement James gave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>police, claiming it was a declaration against penal interest. The trial court ruled that James\u2019s statement was not trustworthy and refused to admit it at Roebuck\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 575, 813 A.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Relying on <em>Gray, </em>we concluded that the trial court erred. <em>Id. </em>at 590, 796 A.2d 697. We found corroboration of James\u2019s statement in the State\u2019s theory of the case, which was that Roebuck gave the gun to James. In addition, James\u2019s statement was corroborated by the testimony of a key State witness who had driven the group to and from the area where the murder occurred. Further, we considered it significant that the State itself evidently regarded James\u2019s statement as trustworthy, because it relied on the statement at James\u2019s trial to establish James\u2019s culpability. <em>Id. </em>at 592-94, 796 A.2d 697. Concluding that the trial court erred, we said, <em>id. </em>at 594, 796 A.2d 697:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">In reaching our conclusion, we are mindful that \u201cthe exclusion of a statement exculpating an accused could result in an erroneous conviction.\u201d <em>[Slate v. Anderson, </em>141 Wis.2d 653, 416 N.W.2d 276, 280 (1987)]. Moreover, given a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense, <em>id. </em>at 279, a defendant should not be subjected \u201cto an insurmountable evidentiary hurdle\u201d to obtain admissibility of a hearsay statement that is central to the defense and has been sufficiently corroborated. <em>Id. </em>at 280. Ultimately, it is for the fact finder to assess the veracity of the declaration. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">As we see it, this case is more akin to <em>Gray </em>and <em>Roebuck </em>than to <em>Matusky </em>and <em>Standifur, </em>because it was the defendant, not the State, who sought admission of Senior\u2019s putative declarations against penal interest. That is where the similarities with <em>Gray </em>and <em>Roebuck </em>end, however. The errors that led to the reversals in those two cases are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In <em>Gray, </em>the Court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court usurped the jury\u2019s function in assessing the credibility of the \u201crelator\u201d of the declaration against penal interest. That did not happen here. In <em>Roebuck, </em>the Court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial judge erroneously overlooked the corroboration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>of James\u2019s declaration, including the State\u2019s own use of James\u2019s statement at James\u2019s murder trial. In addition to these distinctions, other factors lead us to uphold the trial court. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">With regard to a statement against penal interest that is offered by the defense to exculpate the accused, some courts have recognized a \u201cspecific concern\u201d that \u201cthe accused or the declarant, or both, may have a motive to fabricate the statement.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>141 Wis.2d 653, 416 N.W.2d 276, 280 (1987); <em>see Roebuck, </em>148 Md.App. at 582-83, 813 A.2d 342. In <em>United States v. Camacho, </em>163 F.Supp.2d 287 (S.D.N.Y. 2001), the federal court undertook a thorough review of the statement against penal interest hearsay exception to elucidate the various factors that generally pertain to corroboration and trustworthiness. <em>See also United States v. Desena, </em>260 F.3d 150, 158-59 (2d Cir.2001) (focusing corroboration analysis on the trustworthiness of the out-of-court statement, and not on that of the declarant or the witness who related the statement); <em>United States v. Doyle, </em>130 F.3d 523, 544 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201c \u2018It is the statement, not the -witness or the declarant, that must be trustworthy\u2019 \u201d . \u201c \u2018The corroboration requirement should not be used as a means of usurping the jury\u2019s function\u2019 \u201d of assessing the credibility of witnesses) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Among the factors identified by the court in <em>Camacho, </em>the relationship between the declarant and an accused is a key consideration. <em>Camacho, </em>163 F.Supp.2d at 306-07; <em>see, e.g., United States v. Duke, </em>255 F.3d 656, 658-59 (8th Cir.2001) (involving statement by defendant\u2019s brother), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1022, 122 S.Ct. 550, 151 L.Ed.2d 426 (2001); <em>United States v. Katsougrakis, </em>715 F.2d 769, 777-78 (2d Cir.1983) (upholding admission of testimony of wife of declarant, because declarant \u201chad no motive to lie to his wife\u201d in describing declarant\u2019s participation in defendant\u2019s arson scheme), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1040, 104 S.Ct. 704, 79 L.Ed.2d 169 (1984); <em>United States v. Silverstein, </em>732 F.2d 1338, 1346 (7th Cir.1984) (stating that certain \u201cstatements are suspect because of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>long-standing concern\u2014whether or not well-founded\u2014... that a criminal defendant might get a pal to confess to the crime the defendant was accused of ...\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. Ill, 105 S.Ct. 613, 83 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). Certainly, in a murder case in which a father and son are both implicated, the close familial bond of father and son raises the specter that Senior had a motive to fabricate to protect his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The <em>Camacho </em>court also observed that, when \u201ca statement directly inculpates the declarant, <em>and no one else,\u201d </em>that circumstance is a factor \u201cin favor of its reliability.\u201d <em>Camacho, </em>163 F.Supp.2d at 305 (emphasis added). Here, the declarant did not fully inculpate himself. To the contrary, Senior sought to exculpate both himself <em>and </em>his son; he stated that he (Senior) committed the crimes, but claimed, in effect, that he acted in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">In addition, the consistency of a declarant\u2019s statement is an important factor for the court to consider. <em>See Roebuck, </em>148 Md.App. at 584, 813 A.2d 342; <em>see also United States v. Bahadar, </em>954 F.2d 821, 829 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[Repeated changes in [the declarant\u2019s] story ... would properly make any [court] suspicious of the statement\u2019s reliability.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 850, 113 S.Ct. 149, 121 L.Ed.2d 101 (1992). In this case, there were several inconsistencies in Senior\u2019s various accounts, which engendered the trial court\u2019s skepticism as to the trustworthiness of the declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">We are amply satisfied that the trial court carefully complied with the directive announced in <em>Standijur </em>and reiterated in <em>Gray: </em>\u201c \u2018The circumstances surrounding the making of the statement ... must be carefully analyzed to determine the likelihood that the statement was truthful.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gray, </em>368 Md. at 543, 796 A.2d 697 (quoting <em>Standifur, </em>310 Md. at 12, 526 A.2d 955). In regard to the matter of trustworthiness, the court recognized that Senior\u2019s statements were made when he knew that his son was either being sought by the police or had already been arrested. It is also noteworthy that Senior attempted to assume full responsibility for all three attacks. The court apparently regarded Senior\u2019s claim that he acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>alone as entirely implausible, given that three people, almost half Senior\u2019s age, were either seriously wounded or killed. Nor did the court credit Senior\u2019s assertion in one of his statements that he did not know the identity of the three victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">With regard to trustworthiness, it is also significant that Senior repeatedly suggested in his statements that he acted in self-defense. For example, Senior claimed that the Nunleys had the baseball bat and swung at him. Senior also contended that he hit each of them just \u201cone time.\u201d He also asserted that Butler came at him with a knife or gun and \u201ctried to stab\u201d him. Further, Senior said that it seemed as if Butler was reaching for a gun and, in response, Senior \u201cshot him.\u201d Senior\u2019s effort to characterize his own actions as defensive in nature rendered his statements self-exculpating, not self-incriminating. Therefore, they were less trustworthy within the meaning of the hearsay exception in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Moreover, by the time the court conducted the evidentiary hearing, it had heard virtually all of the evidence. That evidence simply did not corroborate Senior\u2019s assertions that he acted alone in striking the Nunleys and shooting Butler.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Finally, even if the evidence was not entirely clear as to whether it was appellant or Senior who pulled the trigger, Senior\u2019s statements were not exculpatory as to appellant. There was evidence that appellant obtained the gun from Gough; both father and son intentionally went to Pegg\u2019s View seeking revenge; they both chased Butler around the building as he fled; and appellant had possession of the weapon immediately after the shooting. Based on principles of accomplice liability, which the State advanced, Senior\u2019s statements did not necessarily exculpate appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">In our view, this case is not controlled by <em>Roebuck </em>or <em>Gray. </em>Senior\u2019s attempt to paint himself as the sole combatant, with Goliath power, involved in a melee in which he acted in self-defense, understandably led the court to regard his declarations as untrustworthy. We decline to second guess the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Claiming that his statement to the police was the result of an illegal, warrantless arrest, for which there was no probable cause, appellant moved to suppress. On appeal, he complains because the court allowed the State to re-open its case to establish the probable cause for the arrest. This claim is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">At the motion hearing, Detective Russell Trow testified that, on March 5, 2001, based on Senior\u2019s statement and information obtained from other witnesses, the Sheriffs Office believed that Junior had participated in the crimes. The detective testified, however, that he did not know the names of these witnesses, because he had obtained this information from other officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Sergeant Lyle Long directed Detective Trow to apprehend appellant. At approximately 2:00 p.m. on March 5, the detective found appellant at his girlfriend\u2019s residence and, without a warrant, arrested him for the crimes of homicide and assault. The detective also gave appellant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. At the time of the arrest, Detective Trow knew that Senior had told the police that appellant was not involved in the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Detective David Alexander was the lead investigator in the case. He was asked if he could recount the information that the Sheriffs Office had obtained prior to appellant\u2019s arrest, but the detective was unable to do so. He stated: \u201cNo, sir, I can\u2019t, because I\u2014it may have been after that that I found the whole\u2014all the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Detective Raddatz testified that Senior had informed him that appellant was at the scene of the homicide and had been in a vehicle with Senior. The detective also recalled that other officers had obtained information from Somerville, indicating that appellant was involved in the homicide. But, Detective Raddatz had not interviewed Somerville. Further, Detective Raddatz recalled that, in Senior\u2019s second statement, he indicated that someone in his party had given the gun to him and that, after the shooting, he had given the gun to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>someone in his group. Moreover, he said that appellant was with him that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Detective Steven Hall testified that he interviewed appellant at approximately 3:00 p.m. on March 5, 2001, and advised him of his constitutional rights. Appellant indicated that he understood his rights and was willing to make a statement about the incident. During Detective Hall\u2019s testimony, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">All this is fine, but this is beside the point that we are here to deal with initially, and that is the quantum of the information that the police department had on or before March 5, 2001 at 2:00 p.m. Because that is going to determine whether or not probable cause existed for that arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">Now, here you are going out on tangents having nothing to do with that issue. And that might have to do with a different issue, but we deal with one issue at a time. Now, if you got a witness that\u2019s going to talk about that subject, now is the time to call him and let this officer stand down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Sergeant Long was then called to testify. He stated that, at about 8:00 a.m. on March 5, 2001, information had been obtained from Somerville that Junior and Senior were both involved in the incident. According to Long, Detective Hall, who had interviewed Somerville, informed him that Somerville had stated that appellant had fought with the Nunleys.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Detective Steven Hall, who was recalled, testified that he interviewed Somerville prior to 2:00 p.m. on March 5, 2001. During the interview, Somerville stated that, while the group was at Church\u2019s Chicken, they decided to go to Pegg\u2019s View Apartments, where the victim lived. According to Somerville, after they parked, \u201c[t]hey shot past us in a car, a car was before them with two people in there. And when the two guys got out, they started fighting, you know, with bats and stuff.\u201d Somerville identified Senior as the one holding the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">The following exchange between Detective Hall and the court is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>THE COURT: So all William Somerville is saying\u2014and I want you to correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2014is that Charles Stewart, Jr. was present?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">[HALL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">THE COURT: But he didn\u2019t see him attack the victims? [HALL]: He indicated that there was a fight, but that the only person involved in the melee with a bat was Charles, Sr. And I tried to make sure that that was clear in the interview, that Charles, Sr. was the only person holding a bat, but there was apparently quite a melee outside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">THE COURT: What information do you have that Junior did something, I mean used his fist, his hands, something to do injury to somebody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">[HALL]: I\u2019m trying to recall if\u2014the only information that I have that would have indicated that prior to me interviewing the Defendant would have probably been with Robert Maurice Scriber, and what that\u2014I would like to get a transcript of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">He was with Somerville trying to prevent Somerville from going down where the melee was occurring out of fear. And they could hear the ping, ping of the bat, but that the party, including Senior and Junior, were involved in the melee. But as far as I never had any information that he had hit anybody with a bat. I just know that based on what they were saying, that father and son were involved in the melee with both the Nunleys and when Mr. Butler came out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">That\u2019s all prior to the statement with the Defendant. And, of course, the situation initially started at Butler\u2019s Place where the Defendant and the victim were involved in an altercation that ultimately ended in the Defendant being kicked out of the bar. And then they went to Pegg\u2019s View in a gray Oldsmobile, and the Nunleys exited in another vehicle that was ahead of them, and the fight began.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">Detective Trow was also recalled. He identified Strawberry as Katina Bryant, a.k.a., Katina Jenkins. The detective testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>fied that he also interviewed Kevin Barnes, who informed him that he was in the apartment with the victim when they heard a commotion outside. Barnes related that Butler went outside, and Barnes followed a few moments later. Barnes saw two people on the ground, both with blood on their faces. Appellant was on top of one of the victims, asking the victim if he had any money, and going through the victim\u2019s pockets. Senior had a bat in his hand. Senior asked Butler if he had any money and, according to Barnes, they decided to \u201cget him too.\u201d As Barnes attempted to intervene, he was hit in the leg with the baseball bat. Somerville then pointed a gun at Barnes and told him to back off. Butler ran, but Junior, Senior, Somerville, and another individual chased him. While Barnes walked back to the apartment, he heard a gunshot.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Further, Detective Trow testified that, on March 7, 2001, Kevin Barnes was shown a photographic array and selected appellant as one of the participants. Although the detective believed that Barnes knew appellant, he claimed it was common practice to have a witness view a photo array. The detective could not explain, however, why only one photographic array was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">During argument on the probable cause aspect of appellant\u2019s motion, the court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">So the question is in all this voluminous information, so to speak, what was it there that says that Stewart, Jr. is more likely than not the person who committed a felony? And that\u2019s the question, and that\u2019s why the Court kept asking well, what exactly did you know or who said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">And you\u2019ve got to admit that it\u2019s very, very sketchy and generalized. Somebody\u2019s involved in a melee. Well, what\u2019s that mean?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The court then gave the parties five days to submit memo-randa on the issue of whether the police had probable cause to arrest appellant. Four days later, the State moved to reopen the hearing to present additional testimony or to supplement the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>At a second hearing, the court discussed the State\u2019s request to reopen. The defense attorney argued: \u201c[I]t is offensive to the rights of my client to allow [the State] to have a do-over.\u201d Pointing to the State\u2019s failure to seek a continuance, she added: \u201c[J]ustice is best served and being done when we are done.... \u201d The court responded that it had \u201cthought about this, balanced it out.\u201d The court observed that, despite a lengthy hearing, \u201cthe upshot of it was that [the State\u2019s] evidence fell short\u201d in establishing probable cause for the warrantless arrest. Nevertheless, while expressing \u201csympathy\u201d for the defense\u2019s position, it said that, \u201cas a practical matter,\u201d if the State\u2019s motion to reopen were denied, and appellant\u2019s motion to suppress were granted, the State \u201cwould enter a nol pros in the case, would recharge and start over and would be redoing the whole scenario.\u201d Therefore, it \u201creluctantly\u201d granted the State\u2019s request to reopen, stating: \u201c[T]he Court\u2019s analysis is that upon review by an Appellate Court to refuse to permit the reopening, would constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Thereafter, the State called Detective David Yingling, who testified that he interviewed John Barnes at approximately 7:80 a.m. on the morning of the shooting and obtained two taped statements from him. Transcripts of those statements were admitted as exhibits. After interviewing Barnes, Detective Yingling contacted Sergeant Long and Lieutenant Horne and advised them that appellant had possession of a firearm immediately after the shooting. Barnes subsequently took the detective to the wooded area, where the bat was recovered. Thus, the evidence showed that the State\u2019s interview of Barnes and the recovery of the bat both <em>preceded </em>appellant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Accordingly, the suppression court denied appellant\u2019s motion. It found that, based on Barnes\u2019s statement, appellant had possession of the gun after the shooting, and the State had probable cause to arrest him. In an opinion of July 27, 2001, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">The Court notes that the facts elicited by the State during the [first suppression] hearing, and standing alone, fell far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>short of probable cause to believe that defendant committed a felony. At that hearing, the State merely established that prior to defendant\u2019s arrest the investigating officers had the following facts within their collective knowledge: defendant was present during the beatings and murder; defendant was standing over a \u201csubject\u201d and going through that person\u2019s pockets; Stewart, Sr. shot Butler and gave the gun to an unidentified person. Today [at the second hearing], however, Detective Yingling\u2019s testimony, coupled with that from the previous hearing, provides specific and articulable facts which taken together with rational inferences permits the Court to conclude that probable cause existed to believe that defendant committed a felony. As such, defendant\u2019s warrantless arrest was legal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Appellant now contends that the court abused its discretion in permitting the State to' reopen its case. He claims that the State\u2019s failure to present all the necessary evidence at the first hearing did not constitute good cause to allow the State to reopen its case. Moreover, appellant observes that the court seemed inclined to deny the State\u2019s motion, but apparently did not do so out of fear of reversal. Thus, appellant claims that the court failed to exercise its discretion, in that it did not believe that it was free to deny the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Appellant relies on <em>Cason v. State, </em>140 Md.App. 379, 780 A.2d 466, <em>cert. denied, </em>367 Md. 89, 785 A.2d 1292 (2001), and <em>cert. denied, </em>370 Md. 269, 805 A.2d 265 (2002). There, the police responded to Cason\u2019s house when he called to report a burglary. Upon entering Cason\u2019s residence, the police observed no evidence of forced entry, but noticed, <em>inter alia, </em>an open tool box containing several hundred empty gelatin capsules in the dining room and a plastic bag containing a white substance. Vials and capsules were also found in the basement. Prior to trial, Cason moved to suppress the drugs seized from his residence. At the hearing, two officers testified for the State. Cason and his mother, who owned the residence where Cason lived, also testified. One officer testified as a rebuttal witness. The defense presented no surre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>buttal. The drugs seized in the search of the residence were not moved into evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 780 A.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">During closing arguments, Cason\u2019s counsel claimed that the police had acted improperly in going into the basement of the house. <em>Id. </em>at 389, 780 A.2d 466. Later, during the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the court asked about the items found in the dining room. The prosecutor stated that the officer\u2019s testimony indicated, in part, that there were gelcaps found in the toolbox. The court then wanted the prosecutor to \u201c[p]ut on that table the bag of narcotics [tjhat was found in the dining room.... I want to see the bag of narcotics from the dining room.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The prosecutor responded that the contraband had not been admitted into evidence. When the court learned that the contraband was in the prosecutor\u2019s office, it directed the State to retrieve it. The court also directed the police officer to indicate what part had been found in the dining room of Cason\u2019s residence. A second officer then identified the bag that had been sitting in the toolbox in the dining room. The trial court subsequently denied Cason\u2019s motion to suppress, finding that the police had lawfully entered the residence because the defendant had called them to the premises to investigate the alleged break-in. In addition, the court concluded that the officers properly searched the premises and found the contraband in plain view. <em>Id. </em>at 389-90, 780 A.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">On appeal, Cason argued that the trial court had assumed the role of a prosecutor. Further, Cason claimed that the court abused its discretion in reopening the evidence to take additional testimony that the State failed to introduce during its presentation of the case. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 780 A.2d 466. The Court was satisfied, however, that the trial judge \u201cdid not abuse his discretion in reopening the evidence in order to examine the bag of gelatin capsules, and did not take on the role of advocate in doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 780 A.2d 466. We pointed out that the State had not attempted to deliberately withhold evidence in order to present it at a later time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>gain an unfair advantage. Moreover, the evidence merely corroborated and clarified the officer\u2019s testimony describing the gelatin capsules found in the toolbox; the demonstration did not present entirely new evidence or cure a defect in the State\u2019s case. Nor was there any danger that a jury was unduly prejudiced, given that the proceedings were before the court. Furthermore, Cason had the opportunity to cross-examine and present rebuttal evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 392-93, 780 A.2d 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Writing for the <em>Cason </em>Court, Judge Deborah Eyler explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASt\">In general, the court has \u201cbroad discretion to reopen a case to receive additional evidence.\u201d <em>Dyson v. State, </em>328 Md. 490, 500, 615 A.2d 1182 (1992); <em>see also Spillers v. State, </em>10 Md.App. 643, 649, 272 A.2d 49 (1971) (stating that \u201c[o]rdi-narily, there is no abuse of discretion in permitting the State to reopen its case for the purpose of proving important or even essential facts to support a conviction....\u201d) The critical issue in determining whether a court abused its discretion in reopening the case is whether its doing so \u201cimpaired the ability of the defendant to answer and otherwise receive a fair trial.\u201d <em>State v. Booze, </em>334 Md. 64, 76, 637 A.2d 1214 (1994), <em>subsequent appeal at </em>111 Md.App. 208, 681 A.2d 534 (1996), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>347 Md. 51, 698 A.2d 1087 (1997).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">Usually, whether the reopening of evidence impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial \u201cis answered by reference to the State\u2019s intention in withholding the evidence, <em>i.e., </em>whether it did so in order to gain an unfair advantage from the impact later use of the evidence likely would have on the trier of facts, the nature of the evidence, and its relationship to evidence already in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 271, 368 A.2d 445 (1977)). In exercising its discretion, the court \u201cmust consider whether the State deliberately withheld the evidence proffered in order to have it presented at such time as to obtain an unfair advantage by its impact on the trier of facts. To this end the judge must see whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>proposed evidence is merely cumulative to, or corroborative of, that already offered in chief or whether it is important or essential to a conviction.\u201d <em>[Hepple v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 525, 534, 358 A.2d 283 (1976), <em>aff'd, State v. Hepple, </em>279 Md. 265, 368 A.2d 445 (1977)]. Other factors which have been identified as important to the assessment of the propriety of the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion to vary the order of proof include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cWhether good cause is shown; whether the new evidence is significant; whether the jury would be likely to give undue emphasis, prejudicing the party against whom it is offered; whether the evidence is controversial in nature; and, whether the reopening is at the request of the jury or a party.\u201d <em>Dyson v. State, </em>328 Md. 490, 615 A.2d 1182 (1992).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Cason, </em>140 Md.App. at 390-92, 780 A.2d 466 (alterations in Cason). <em>See also Collins v. State, </em>373 Md. 130, 142-143, 816 A.2d 919 (2003) (upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, which granted the State\u2019s request to reopen its case when an eyewitness in a murder case had been located).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Here, the issue arose during a suppression hearing, so there was no danger that a jury would give undue emphasis to the evidence. Moreover, there is no indication that the State deliberately withheld the evidence. Indeed, the State thought it had established probable cause, and it only sought to reopen because the court intimated otherwise. Furthermore, appellant had the opportunity to cross-examine. Therefore, we are not persuaded that the court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Nor are we persuaded that the court failed to exercise its discretion. Indeed, the court clearly recognized that it had discretion to reopen the case. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">We have, day one, insufficient evidence of probable cause. Day two, cleaning up their act, they [the State] finally get it together. That\u2019s what you have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">And the question here is whether or not, given that scenario, it would be an abuse of discretion by the Court not to permit the reopening. That\u2019s the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Although the court commented on the possibility of reversal by an appellate court if it did not allow the State to re-open, we do not construe that remark to reflect the court\u2019s belief that it had no choice but to grant the State\u2019s motion. Based upon the entire exchange, it is evident that the court struggled with the matter and, \u201con balance,\u201d opted to allow the State to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
