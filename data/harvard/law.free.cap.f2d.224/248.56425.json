While condensed, the main charge on the subject of character witnesses, to which no exception was noted, was correct as far as it went; and the request for an instruction \u201cthat in considering the character testimony offered by the defense, if believed by the jury, in and of itself that testimony may create a reasonable doubt where without it none would have existed,\u201d was too broad. True it is that evidence of good reputation may be deemed sufficient to engender a reasonable doubt, otherwise it would not be admissible on behalf of a defendant in a criminal trial. See Michelson v. United States, 1948, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168; Edgington v. United States, 1896, 164 U.S. 361, 17 S.Ct. 72, 41 L.Ed. 467. But such evidence must be considered in conjunction with all the evidence received at the trial, not \u201cin and of itself.\u201d Marzani v. United States, 1948, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 168 F.2d 133, affirmed 1949, 336 U.S. 922, 69 S.Ct. 513, 93 L.Ed. 1075; United States v. Frischling, 3 Cir., 1947, 160 F.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
