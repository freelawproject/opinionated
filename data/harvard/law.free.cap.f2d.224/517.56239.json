The policy lapsed for non-payment of the May premium. Parlington nevertheless made payments on July 2, August 8, October 1, October 8 and October 17, which would have taken care of premiums for May through September, if they had been timely made. He thereafter made payments on January 15, 1947, and two on March 31, 1947. He made no further payments until after he received two letters from the Veterans Administration. The first of these, dated May 7, 1947, replying to an inquiry from Parlington, correctly stated that his policy had lapsed on May 1,1946, that reinstatement was necessary if he desired to continue the insurance, and that there was a credit to his account of $56.80 (the eight payments above referred to made after the lapse). The second letter, dated November 28, 1947, repeated the information of the May letter, and also stated that the credit could be used for reinstatement and advance premiums after reinstatement. There was a postscript to the letter advising Parlington that in the alternative he could have a refund of his $56.80 upon his request. On January 29, 1948, Parlington filed a formal application for reinstatement on the form supplied by the Veterans Administration, stating that he wished his credit used for payment of reinstatement premiums \u2014one month\u2019s premium for the month of lapse and one month\u2019s premium for the month of reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">In the meantime, without the matter being in any way considered in connection with Parlington\u2019s insurance account, a letter notice was issued by the Assistant Administrator for Insurance dated November 8, 1946,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> obviously for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>purpose of alleviating hardship resulting in situations in which veterans (we may note that this was a time when some ten million veterans were readjusting their affairs upon being released from the military services) were commencing to make directly monthly payments for premiums which had theretofore been deducted from their pay, and where gaps in monthly payments had occurred and some payments were made late, but later caught up.</p>\n<p id=\"AV7\">Subsequently, this letter was \u201csuperseded\u201d by a letter of May 9, 1947, which repeated the identical four paragraphs, except for the date and the addition of the following clause to the last sentence in the third paragraph, \u201cand when corresponding with the insured care will be taken to avoid giving a contrary imprestion,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the dates in the last paragraph were changed by making each of them a date six months later. There was then added a significant paragraph.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"afk-dedup-0\">Then, finally, there was issued a so-called \u201cTechnical Bulletin\u201d known as TB 9 \u2014 53, on September 25, 1947, which, so far as claimed to affect this policy, merely had the effect of restating the provisions of the original letter, except that the liens required in that letter were cancelled, This TB sought to make mandatory the readjustment in accordance with the instructions therein contained,</p>\n<p id=\"arq-dedup-0\">When Parlington filed his application for reinstatement, it was processed and endorsed \u201creinstated 2-13-48.\u201d Under the validly existing regulations, this reinstated the policy as of the month of application, January 1948. In a letter addressed to Parlington, dated February 17, 1948, the Veterans Administration informed him (contrary to its advice to him on November 28, 1947, that he had a credit of $56.80) that \u201cby an administrative adjustment the credit of $56.80, as shown in our letter dated November 28, 1948 [sic] was in error. The credit which existed on your account was $21.30 and was applied to pay the cost of reinstatement and one month in advance, paying your account as shown above.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>No explanation of any kind was made as to what happened to the $35.50 that had been taken away by \u201can administrative adjustment of the credit of $56.80,\u201d an amount that would have kept his policy in force for an additional five months, or through August. Parlington died on April 29, twenty-nine days after expiration of the grace period, under the Administration\u2019s \u201cadministrative adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Of course, the Government cannot be estopped by its unbusinesslike handling of the deceased veteran\u2019s insurance account, but at first blush the beneficiary\u2019s claim here seems so clearly instinct with right that the court may well be expected to subject the record, and the plausible legal reasoning of the Government\u2019s brief to exceptionally careful scrutiny, if that should be found necessary, in order to serve the ends of justice without violence to legal principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The Veterans Administration based its rejection of the claim on the proposition that where a veteran has elected to reinstate a lapsed policy by paying two months\u2019 premiums, if it should happen that he has made irregular payments while the policy was lapsed \u2014 payments for which the Administration acknowledged he was entitled to restitution \u2014 the Administration could by unilateral action and without the veteran\u2019s consent debit his account for premiums during the lapse period so as to wipe out the credit; even though the policy conferred no such power on the Administration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Such a contention would sound fantastic if it were put forward by a commercial insurance company. Under normal legal principles if an insurance policy lapses for non-payment of premiums and the .former assured continues to make payments, the insurer, of course, holds the money for the former policyholder. The Government recognized this principle when it wrote Parlington that it held $56.80 as a credit to his account. Then by what legal principle could the Veterans Administration appropriate part of this money? It claims the right under a letter of instructions or a Technical Bulletin, which it claims has the force of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">The solution of this problem lies, it seems to us, in two answers to the Administration\u2019s argument. The first is that the series of instructions did not, by their terms, touch the particular policy here in question; the second is that if they purported to do so in a manner that adversely affected the policyholder\u2019s rights, they would be void to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-13\">As to the first proposition, we should say at the outset that the standard of strict construction is required by the- instruction letter itself. The letter of May 9,1947, specifically stated: \u201cWhile it cannot be too strongly emphasized that the conditions outlined above must be strictly observed when applying the principles set forth in this letter, etc.\u201d Now what ar\u00e9 the conditions under which the Government claims it was required to apply the $35.50 to create the fiction that Parlington had been insured for five months in 1946 ? The letter of November 8,1946, which set out the conditions<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provided (1) there had been a failure to notify the insured of lapse: This condition was satisfied; (2) an absence of information indicating that the state of assured\u2019s health would have precluded reinstatement : This condition was satisfied; (3) not more than three monthly premiums are missing: This condition was satisfied; (4) premiums have been paid regularly each month for the last three months including the current month (November 1946): This condition was <em>not </em>satisfied. The \u201clast three months,\u201d including November, are September, October and November, 1946. No payment was made in September; three were made in October; and none was made in November.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>It may be argued that the language does not mean that payments must be paid regularly during each of the last three months if they <em>average </em>one each month. But the letter does not speak in terms of averages. It says \u201cpaid regularly <em>each month </em>for the last three months, etc.\u201d Thus the condition is not fulfilled if payments are irregularly made for the last three months. The requirement that there be a payment each month is expressed both in the expression \u201cregularly,\u201d which in the context of monthly payments must mean each month, and also in the express requirement that the payments not only be \u201cfor the last three months,\u201d but that they be paid \u201ceach month.\u201d In its effort to justify the appropriation of Parlington\u2019s money, the Veterans Administration will not be heard to say that it did not mean what it said.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Now, lest this be considered as too technical an interpretation, it must be remembered that the very document requiring the adjustment required strict construction; furthermore, when the court is called upon to determine whether an administrative action, intended as an act of grace, has in a particular case the result of wiping out the rights of a member of the class it seeks to benefit, every rule of construction would favor that interpretation that would not defeat the salutary purpose of the administrative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">We, therefore, hold that Parlington\u2019s policy did not meet the tests or conditions laid down in T.B. \u2014 53, and that the Veterans Administration had no right or power to make the administrative adjustment that deprived him of the full credit of $56.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The second answer need not be discussed, except for the reason that it is an answer to the proposition most strongly urged on us by the Government in its brief. How or why the position of the Veterans Administration is any different from that of a private insurance company, if it saw fit voluntarily to extend benefits to lapsed policy holders under similar circumstances, completely escapes us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We, therefore, say that unless there is some provision of the policy or the statute that permits the Administration to convert this policy holder\u2019s credit balance to the payment for insurance for a long past period then this action by the Administrator is completely without justification. The Government calls no such provision of either policy or statute to our attention. There is none.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">To be sure, the Government\u2019s brief contends that this action by the Administration is justified under the power of the Administration to \u201cmake rules and regulations\u201d to \u201cdetermine the terms and conditions of such insurance,\u201d and to \u201cprescribe the time and method of the payment of the premiums.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>specious argument. Of course, the Administrator was given the power to \u201cdetermine and publish the terms and conditions of the five year level premium term policy\u201d (which was the policy here in question); but once having fixed the terms of the policy he had no power to change those terms to the detriment of a policy holder. For us to hold that, when an administrative officer is authorized by statute to determine on the terms of a contract, this confers on him the power to alter it unilaterally, would greatly impair the power of the Government to deal by contract with its citizens. No one would willingly deal with a Government that could arbitrarily repudiate its contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">There is nothing here said that is inconsistent with our opinion in United States v. Holley, 5 Cir., 199 F.2d 575, cited in the Government\u2019s brief. We have here quite a different case. There a veteran\u2019s beneficiary sought to come within the voluntary grace extended by TB 9-53, supra. Of course, it was proper to hold that in order to do so he had to come within its terms. This is not to say that an act intended as an act of grace to many policy holders can be construed or made effective to deprive a policy holder, without his consent, of the rights he holds without reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">It is moreover not necessary for us to pass on the effect of the Administrator\u2019s failing to publish these so-called rulings, instructions or Technical Bulletins in the Federal Register, since the rights of the parties to such an insurance policy could not be changed unilaterally even by statute. Lynch v. United States, 292 U.S. 571, 54 S.Ct. 840, 78 L.Ed. 1434.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The judgment of the trial court, was right and it is</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b566-11\">.

Any such administrative adjustment will necessitate the establishment of a lien to cover the amount of the missing premium or premiums, and that the insured be notified and requested to pay the amount due. Insurance which may properly be regarded as subject to this adjustment will not be considered to have lapsed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkR\">\u201cThe authorization to make administrative adjustments under the circumstances above outlined will expire December 31, 1946; that is, a lien may be established for the amount of missing premiums for December 1946 and prior months only. This does not preclude the making of administrative adjustments subsequent to December 31, 1946, involving the establishment of liens through that month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a8c-dedup-0\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzIV\">(signed) Harold W.

Set out in full in footnote 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b569-6\">. We recognize of course that the Government can exorcise broad powers under the standard provisions present in many of its contracts, such as the Termination for Convenience of the Government and Changes clauses, to cancel contracts without paying the usual contract measure of damages, and to require additional work to be done at prices to some extent fixed by the Government without the contractor\u2019s consent; and that the Government may constitutionally exercise some contractual powers even arbitrarily, as that of unilaterally determining facts under Disputes clauses, although certainly a private contracting party could not enforce such a provision. See United States v. Wunderlich, 342 U. S. 98, 72 S.Ct. 154, 96 L.Ed. 133. And we do not have to decide that even without a contractual provision or statutory authority the Government may never stand in a better position than a private contractor. Eor here there is not only no contractual or statutory provision which justified the action of the Veterans Administration; there is also no general equitable principle or public policy which could possibly be the basis of distinguishing the Government\u2019s position from that of a private insurer. Hence, we hold that under the facts of this case there is no rational ground to hold that tho Veterans Administration had any more power to take the action in question, than a private insurance company would have had.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b569-13\">.
