Allen, 344 U.S. 433, 503, 504, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469, called for the record of the Court Martial trial and received and examined (a) the record of the trial before the General Court Martial, and (b), the record of the proceedings of the Board of Review of the Army which examined and reviewed the record of the petitioner\u2019s trial. The court then made an order as follows: \u201cRecourse to certified copies of the entire record of the General Court Martial proceedings and careful examination of the same reveal the contentions of petitioner to be utterly without merit. Accordingly, the Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus is denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-16\">The record thus before the court discloses that the petition is groundless and that the trial court correctly denied it. That record discloses that \u201cthe members of the court and the personnel of the prosecution were then sworn\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-17\">The contention that petitioner was denied adequate representation of counsel is based upon his claim that the denial of a requested continuance oper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ated to deprive his counsel of sufficient time for preparation. It is sufficient to say that this claim was fully and carefully examined by the Board of Review which found not only that proceeding to trial at that time was required by military necessity but that in view of the fact that defense counsel had had four days for preparation, the denial of the motion for continuance was within the sound judicial discretion of the court and that there was no showing of an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We hold therefore that under the rule of Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137, 73 S.Ct. 1045, 97 L.Ed. 1508, the trial court properly denied the petition and the order of that court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-18\">. Apparently counsel for petitioner has proceeded upon the erroneous impression that only the record of the Board of Review and not the record of the trial itself was before the trial court,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
