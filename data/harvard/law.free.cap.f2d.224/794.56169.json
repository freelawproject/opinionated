So holding, he denied the injunction prayed for and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s suit, and it is here insisting that the judgment was wrong and may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">We do not think so. On the contrary, of the clear opinion that for the reasons stated by him the district judge was right in dismissing the suit, we approve his opinion and affirm his judgment, without prejudice, of course, to the maintenance of, or any action taken or to be taken, or judgment rendered or to be rendered in, the pending suit, State of Texas ex rel. Southwestern Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Upshur Rural Electric Cooperative et al., No. 99,812 in the District Court of Travis County, Texas, 126th Judicial District, or in any other suit brought or to be brought in the Texas courts on the relation of Southwestern Gas &amp; Electric Company.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-9\">.
