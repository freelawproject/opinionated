Taking advantage of his position at the bank Jaynes wrote a cashier\u2019s cheek for $10,000 payable to a fictitious person and delivered the check to his contractor. However, Jaynes falsely entered the amount of this check iu the bank\u2019s permanent record as $1,000. There is testimony that the transaction was camouflaged because defendant felt that it was nobody\u2019s business but that of the defendant and the contractor,</p>\n<p id=\"AWJ\"> Jaynes contendg that he wag authorized by the bank president and vice president to make the falBe entry and that hig offer of f to ghow thig wag imp rly rejected. Authorization by the bank officials is no defense to a charge of making a false entry to deceive a bank examiner. United States v. Klock, 2 Cir., 210 F.2d 215 216. If believed, the rejected testimony might have constituted a defense to the charge of making a false entry with intent to defraud the bank. United States v. Klock, 2 Cir., 210 F.2d 217, 220</p>\n<p id=\"A6m\">However, under the statute, making either the false entry to deceive the examiner or to defraud the bank alone constitutes a crime. Count four charged the crime committed by both methods and the charge that there was intent to defraud ^ank may be disregarded as surplusage. This is not a case where a jury ^as found a defendant guilty on a count charging, for ^ instance, defrauding the bank <em>or </em>deceiving the bank examiner. In such a case, if a conviction was improper- ^ obtained as to one of the charges the reviewing court cannot know whether the jury found the defendant guilty on the charge wherein the error was committed and innocent on the other charge. Here we know that the jury had to find the defei\\dant gulltJ \u00b0? tbe+ cbafe \u00b0f mtent to deceive <em>and </em>intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"AtP\">There being no error in the exclusion of the offer of proof on the issue of intent to deceive the bank examiner or agent appointed to examine the affairs of the bank, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
