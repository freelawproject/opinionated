The District Judge having made the required finding of finality under Fed.Rule 54(b), 28 U.S.C.A., the appeal is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Appellant is the patentee of certain patents on windshield wiper components for motor vehicles on which it granted an exclusive license to the Anderson Company (\u201cAnco\u201d) to manufacture and sell under the patents. Appellant\u2019s sole interest in the patents is limited to its right to receive royalties on Anco\u2019s sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Appellee Trico is in competition with Anco in the manufacture and sale of windshield wipers and their components, and also engages in some experimental work and has an interest in certain patents on the devices it markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The count in the complaint with which we are concerned seeks treble damages alleging that appellant\u2019s royalties have been reduced by reason of Trico\u2019s selling its products upon condition that purchasers would not deal with Trico\u2019s competitors, including Anco. Judge Knight ruled that appellant had no standing to sue for treble damages because its loss was \u201cbeyond the limit of injuries cognizable under the anti-trust laws.\u201d We agree with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">The limited question here presented is: Is a patentee who has granted to another an exclusive license for the term of the patent, upon a royalty basis, a \u201cperson * * * injured in his business or property\u201d (within the meaning of Section 4 of the Clayton Act) so as to enable him to recover treble damages for loss of royalties on sales that might have been made by its licensee save for the anti-trust violations of defendant? We hold he is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Those harmed only incidentally by anti-trust violations have no standing to sue for treble damages; only those at whom the violation is directly aimed, or who have been directly harmed may recover. As stated by the Ninth Circuit in Conference of Studio Unions v. Loew\u2019s, Inc., 193 F.2d 51, at page 55:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2W\">\u201cRecovery and damages under the anti-trust law is available to those who have been directly injured by the lessening of competition and withheld from those who seek the windfall of treble damages because of incidental harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-11\">Shareholders and officers of corporations as well as creditors and landlords have been held not to have standing to sue for treble damages. Loeb v. Eastern Kodak Co., 3 Cir., 183 F. 704; Gerli v. Silk Ass\u2019n of America, D.C., 36 F.2d 959; Corey v. Boston Ice Co., D.C., 207 F. 465; Westmoreland Asbestos Co. v. Johns-Manville Corp., D.C., 30 F.Supp. 389, affirmed, 2 Cir., 113 F.2d 114. Undoubtedly, such persons suffer some financial loss when anti-trust violations are directed against the corporations in which they have an interest. But not every financial loss due to an anti-trust violation, however remote, gives a right of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The situation here presented is akin to the cases above cited, and we think falls squarely within the rule denying relief for incidental damages. In Harrison v. Paramount Pictures Inc., D.C., 115 F. Supp. 312, affirmed, 3 Cir., 211 F.2d 405, the owner of a theatre had leased it under a guaranteed rental plus a percentage of the profits derived from its operation. The owner brought a treble damage suit claiming diminution in rental because of defendants\u2019 conspiracy to deny profitable pictures to the theatre. Judge Kirkpatrick, in a reasoned opinion that was accepted by the Third Circuit, ruled that the owner had no \u201cright\u201d to increased rentals by the showing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>first-run pictures, but only a \u201chope\u201d that such pictures would increase the the-atre\u2019s income. Thus, any financial loss suffered by the plaintiff was only incidental to the acts complained of. Here, too, the appellant has no standing under the anti-trust laws to complain of the incidental loss of royalties by activities of Trico, not directed at it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">No hard and fast rule- can be laid down in these situations as the line- between direct and incidental damage is not always definable with clarity. All we here determine is that under the facts pleaded appellant has no right to recover treble damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-19\">. While we are not now called upon to decide, we must express considerable doubt as to two observations by Judge Knight in his opinion below: (1) if An-co recovers, it would be liable over to appellant for loss' of royalties, and (2) recovery by appellant would \u201cdoubly enrich\u201d the principal stockholder of Anderson (Anco). Neither observation seems to us to be valid as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
