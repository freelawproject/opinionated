Svejcar, doing business as Svejcar Construction Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a contract as the general contractor for certain construction work upon a certain building * * * in Crystal Lake, Mc-Henry County, Illinois, and, as such general contractor, * * * Svejcar employed * * * Aconomy * * * as a subcontractor to construct and weld certain steel beams in said construction work, which employment was evidenced by a contract not in writing, and that after the making of said contract * * * Aconomy * * * entered upon said premises and undertook to do said work as provided by said contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">The foregoing allegations were admitted by Aconomy\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The following allegation was denied by the answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">\u201c * * * all of the work provided for in said contract was completed by * * * Aconomy * * * long prior to said 5th day of September, 1953.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">As to the allegations that the decedent, John A. Green, had prior to September 5, 1953 entered into a contract with Svej-car to construct and supply certain concrete roofing for said construction work on said building, and to install the same, and that on said date Green was laying concrete slabs over the steel beams \u201cprior thereto installed and constructed by\u201d Aconomy, and while engaged in said work Green fell through the roof and sustained injuries causing his death, and that the fall resulted from \u201cimperfect and negligent construction of the welding and placing of the said steel beams by\u201d Acon-omy, the latter\u2019s answer neither admitted nor denied, but called for strict proof thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-14\">The complaint also alleged that Roy J. Green, as administrator of the estate of John A. Green, deceased, had commenced suit against Aconomy and others charging negligence of Aconomy in the constructing, welding and placing of said steel beams, and asking for damages, and that Aconomy asserted that said policy applied and plaintiff is obliged to defend said suit and pay any judgment entered therein against Aconomy, that plaintiff has declined to assume any liability or obligation in connection therewith, and denies that said policy covers said occurrence or said suit at law, for the reason that the \u201cproducts and completed operations or work of the defendant,\u201d Acon-omy, were not covered by said policy and that the alleged occurrence resulted from completed operations and work of said defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Aconomy\u2019s answer admitted the commencement of the lawsuit by Roy J. Green, and alleged that it is covered by the policy of insurance and plaintiff is obliged to defend that suit and pay any judgment entered against said defendant, that the work of Aconomy was not completed on September 5, 1953 and therefore defendant is entitled to coverage under the policy, and denied that the occurrence resulted from completed operations or work of Aconomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-16\">Aconomy\u2019s motion for summary judgment was accompanied by three affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">The affidavit of Bartley Walsh, Jr., in part, set forth:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">He is president of Aconomy and has full knowledge of the transactions here involved. On behalf of Aconomy he negotiated a verbal agreement with Svejcar for Aconomy to \u201cinstall certain steel beams, steel angles, bar joints, stair railings, steel roof hatch, steel door, steel toilet stalls and sky light openings and other work in connection with the erection\u201d of said building, which work of in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>stallation of steel angles started on September 2 and continued on September 3 and 4, 1953 \u201cand on that date was not completed.\u201d On September 5, when Green met his death there still remained to be completed on said building:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">\u201c(a) The installation of the angle irons on the roof to secure the sky light</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201c(b) The installation of the hatchway ladder and hatchway</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201c(c) The installation of the steel partitions and the installation of the sky light and whatever else was to be done under this contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The installation of the steel angles continued on September 8 and 10, 1953, and the sky light was completed. The installation of the hatchway ladder and hatchway was done on January 27, 1954, and the final work of installation of the steel railing was completed February 10, 1954 \u201cat which time the entire work required by the certain verbal contract was completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Carl S veje arts affidavit set forth that on or about August 3, 1953 he negotiated a verbal agreement with Bartley Walsh, Jr., president of Aconomy, \u201cfor the installation of certain steel beams and other work in connection with the construction of the said Moose Lodge Building,\u201d which \u201cwas not finally completed until the 10th day of February, 1954.\u201d; that on September 5, 1953 \u201cthere still remained other work to be done\u201d and \u201cthe last of said work under the said contract was not completed until February 10, 1954.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">John Vincent Anderson\u2019s affidavit set forth that \u201che was the architect who designed and drew the specifications for the construction of an addition to\u201d said building; that Svejcar was the general contractor who entered into an oral contract with Aconomy \u201cto do certain steel and ornamental iron work on said building\u201d; that pursuant thereto Aconomy \u201centered upon said building and proceeded to do certain steel and ornamental iron work thereon\u201d; that \u201cfollowing the injury and death of the said John A. Green, and on September 5, 1953, this af-fiant entered upon said building and made an inspection of all work done and yet to be done, that upon said inspection he found that the following steel and ornamental iron work provided for under the specifications and to be done by the said Aconomy Erectors, Inc.,\u201d had not been completed: installation of steel roof hatch, beams to support the same, hatchway ladder, stairway railing, steel toilet partitions, and additional welding in that mid span fillet welds to secure double angle purlins together to form \u201cTee\u201d section.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">In opposition to the motion for summary judgment plaintiff filed the affidavit of Robert E. Harlow, which set forth that he is claim manager of plaintiff in Chicago ; that upon receipt on September 11, 1953 of notice of the accident in question, he caused an investigation to be made, including an interview with Bartley Walsh, Jr., who signed a written statement dated September 14, 1953, and that on September 5, 1953 at a coroner\u2019s inquest on the body of John A. Green, deceased, Carl Svejcar testified, the transcript of his testimony being annexed to the affidavit. In part, Walsh\u2019s signed statement set forth that Aconomy\u2019s welding job took about one hundred man hours and was completed prior to September 5, 1953; the roof angles of steel were welded onto steel bar joists; these constituted the steel framework that was to support the roof of the building; its employees did this welding work \u201cat the location of the building;\u201d after the steel structure was complete, other workmen were laying composition blocks on the structure; when they were placed on the tack welded angle, it came loose and John Green, who was putting the block in place, fell 12 feet to the cement floor below; the only way this can be explained is that one of the men missed this particular spot which he should have welded.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">Svejcar\u2019s testimony was, in part, that he and Green were present when the Aconomy welders started and also when they completed the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-14\">Plaintiff contends that defendant\u2019s affidavits did not properly establish facts entitling it to a summary judgment and that under the pleadings, affidavits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>counter-affidavit, together with the documentary evidence filed in support thereof, there is a genuine issue as to the material facts in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">1. Both by their pleadings in the district court and by their briefs in this court, the parties have assumed that the obligation of plaintiff as to the Green accident depends upon whether the work of Aconomy was or was not completed at the time of said accident. If this be the right assumption, we believe that plaintiff is correct in its contention that there is a genuine issue as to the material facts in the case. In 598 Cases, Each Containing 24 Cans, More or Less of Tomatoes v. United States, 7 Cir., 211 F.2d 249, at page 251, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">\u201cFactual issues are not to be tried or resolved by summary judgment procedure. Once it is determined that there exists a genuine and material factual issue, summary judgment may not be granted. In making this determination doubts (of course the doubts are not fanciful) are to be resolved against the granting of summary judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">It will therefore be necessary to reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\"> 2. A careful reading of the policy raises another question which might be controlling in this case. The true meaning of the policy is difficult to determine. An examination of it involves a physical effort of no mean proportions. Starting out with three printed pages, the first of which consists largely of a form which is filled in on a typewriter, the reader is confronted also with six physically attached supplements, or riders, inconveniently assorted into different sizes. If he is possessed of reasonable physical dexterity, coupled with average mental capacity, he may then attempt to integrate and harmonize the dubious meanings to be found in this not inconsiderable package. A confused attempt to set forth an insuring agreement is later assailed by such a bewildering array of exclusions, definitions and conditions, that the result is confounding almost to the point of untelligibleness. To describe the policy as ambiguous is a substantial understatement. To ascertain its meaning we are forced to seek refuge in the well settled rules that insurance contracts are to be construed liberally in insured\u2019s favor and strictly against the insurer, Aschenbrenner v. U. S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 292 U.S. 80, 54 S.Ct. 590, 78 L.Ed. 1137; Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Ins. Co. v. Kearney, 180 U.S. 132, 21 S.Ct. 326, 45 L.Ed. 460; and conditions and stipulations in the policy are to be construed most strictly against the insurance company, First Nat. Bank of Kansas City v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 95 U.S. 673, 24 L.Ed. 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Guided by these rules, it might reasonably be claimed that there emerges through the confusing language and the shapeless masses of words before us, an intention to protect Aconomy from the commonplace risks incidental to the business of a construction contractor. Was that the protection for which Aconomy paid a premium? If it could be deduced that the meaning of the policy is that the building under construction, to the extent that it was controlled by Aconomy in doing its work under contract with Svejcar, was the premises covered by the policy, and the work done there by Aconomy constituted the operations, the hazards of which were insured, it might be seriously contended that Aconomy was and is entitled to the protection of the policy insofar as the Green accident is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">It might be in good faith argued that there were no \u201cproducts\u201d insured by this policy, because the word \u201cproducts\u201d was intended to refer to articles made by an insur'ed and offered for sale, and further, that there is therefore no occasion to consider the argument of plaintiff in regard to the definition of \u201cproducts hazard\u201d contained in the policy, and, for the same reason, the question of whether the operation of Aconomy had been completed at the time of Green\u2019s accident, is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Inasmuch as plaintiff\u2019s contention in regard to the time of completion of Acon-omy\u2019s operation is based largely upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>policy\u2019s so-called definitions above set forth, it might be urged that the \u201c(c) Products Hazard\u201d provision is divided into two paragraphs, (1) and (2). (1) (c) speaks of an accident occurring after the insured has relinquished possession \u201cthereof\u201d (goods or products) to others and away from the premises owned, rented or controlled by the insured, while (2) (c) refers to an accident occurring after operations have been completed or abandoned at the place of occurrence thereof and away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the insured, with certain exceptions stated. Does the placing of these two paragraphs in the policy under the heading of \u201cProducts Hazard\u201d, as well as the language of the paragraphs themselves, indicate that the language in question has nothing to do with the case before us because the policy expressly eliminates from coverage \u201cProducts (Including Completed Operations)\u201d? The undisputed facts show that the accident to Green resulted from an operation by Aconomy\u2019s workmen, and certainly, at the time they performed their work, its contract was in the course of performance. In view of these provisions of the policy can it be said that their acts were a part of the operations covered by the policy and took place on premises likewise covered ?</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">We look upon these questions as material. We express no opinion as to how they should be answered. They have not been raised by counsel. Neither that fact nor the fact that the point was not raised in or passed upon by the district court prevents us from passing upon such questions when they appear from a reading of the record before us. If we were to decide these questions in such a-way as to call for an affirmance of the district court, we would have a right so to do. In Reinstine v. Rosenfield, 7 Cir., 111 F.2d 892, at page 894, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">\u201cFrom time immemorial Courts of Appeal have been authorized to affirm the rulings of lower courts for any valid reason based upon the evidence, although not assigned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">To the same effect see 5 C.J.S., Appeal and Error, \u00a7 1464, p. 72 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">However, on these questions we have not the benefit of a decision of the trial court or the views of counsel in this court, and we therefore believe it would be unwise to make a decision based wholly upon our own efforts. Inasmuch as there must be a reversal and remandment for further proceedings, because of our conclusion in paragraph number 1 hereof, we refrain from any further decision herein. Upon a remandment either party may, if desired, by proper procedure raise in the district court the additional questions which we find presented by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">We hold that the district court erred in entering a summary judgment against the plaintiff. That judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">FINNEGAN, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-27\">.
