M. Henderson of Farwell, Tex., also a reported visitor below the border.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-12\">\u201cHenderson and Marteney teamed to form the Garden Grain and Seed Company at Garden City, a venture that in less than four years was worth $1,000,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-20\">\u201cFatzer said Marteney went into Mexico at El Paso, Tex., but gave no additional details.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-21\">The first, third and sixth paragraphs of the dispatch were false. The fourth paragraph was false, in so far as it related to Marteney.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-22\">Marteney did not allege special damages. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of United Press on the ground that the publication was not libelous per se and entered judgment for United Press.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-23\">Whether a publication is libelous per se is a question of law to be determined by the court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-24\">In determining whether the alleged defamatory matter is libelous per se the court should give to the words used their plain and natural meaning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It should determine what would be the natural and probable effect upon the mind of the average lay reader.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-25\">In some jurisdictions a publication to be libelous per se must be fairly susceptible of but one meaning and that an opprobrious one.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its opinion in Jerald v. Houston, 124 Kan. 657, 261 P. 851, 855, the Supreme Court of Kansas indicates that it follows that doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-26\">In determining whether the publication is libelous per se it must be read and considered as a whole.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-27\">The news dispatch stated that Mar-teney was charged with seven violations of the Kansas Warehouse Law and was free under a $5,000 bond; that he had crossed the border into Mexico at El Paso, Texas; and the Attorney General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>had said, \u201cEfforts are being made to return Marteney, and the case will be taken to the State Department if necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Considering the publication as a whole, we think the plain and natural meaning it would convey to the average lay reader is that Marteney, having been charged with seven violations of the penal laws of Kansas and being free under bond, had fled to Mexico to avoid prosecution, and that it was not fairly susceptible of any other meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the publication as a natural and immediate consequence would cause injury to Marteney and is, therefore, libelous per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">At the trial Marteney tendered in evidence the headlines written by newspapers to the articles which they published based on such press dispatch. The Lamar Daily News (a Colorado newspaper) headlined its article, \u201cMarteney Jumps Bond, Goes Into Mexico.\u201d The Great Bend Daily Tribune (a Kansas newspaper) headlined its article, \u201cHead of G. C. Grain Company Skips to Mexico.\u201d The Wichita Eagle (a Kansas Newspaper) headlined its article, \u201cMarteney Now in Mexico, Fatzer Says.\u201d The court sustained an objection to the proffered evidence of the headlines. We think the trial court ruled correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">It is a well known fact that many newspapers indulge in extravagant and sensational headlines to news dispatches which they publish. In Jerald v. Houston, 124 Kan. 657, 261 P. 851, at page 855, the court said: \u201cIt is the practice of some newspapers deliberately to put poison in a headline and follow it with a weak antidote in the body of the article.\u201d A press association has no control over the headlines which a newspaper uses in connection with its press dispatches. The headline, is the independent act of the newspaper publisher. We think it would be manifestly unfair to a press association to hold it accountable for the headlines which a newspaper uses in connection with a press dispatch sent out by the press association. Full dissemination of important news should not be subjected to that hazard. The press association should be held responsible only for its own acts and the defamation which it disseminates.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">The judgement is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\">.
