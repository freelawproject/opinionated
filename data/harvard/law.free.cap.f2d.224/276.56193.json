The relator may rest assured that his rights have been fully and conscientiously preserved and safeguarded by these able counsel. On the merits, however, we are constrained to hold that he cannot prevail. His attempt to establish a denial of equal protection of the laws in the nonuniform enforcement of the Connecticut multiple offender laws is fatally defective for failure to allege any purposeful or malicious discrimination in the administration thereof. Saunders v. Lowry, 5 Cir., 58 F.2d 158; Sanders v. Waters, 10 Cir., 199 F.2d 317. The fact that relator was sentenced as a second and an habitual offender on aai information separated from that part thereof which alleged the second substantive crime is irrelevant so long as relator had notice that he would be so charged. The procedure, designed to facilitate the taking of separate pleas, was that prescribed by \u00a7 340 of the Connecticut Practice Book of 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
