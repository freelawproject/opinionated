Mitchell, a cargo Liberty ship owned and operated by appellee. The decisive issues are solely questions of fact, which were determined in ap-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>pellee\u2019s favor after a full and fair trial. We have reviewed the voluminous record, in the light of able arguments and briefs of counsel, and we are unable to say that the findings of fact by the district court are erroneous, certainly not clearly erroneous. See McAllister v. United States, 348 U.S. 19, 20, 75 S.Ct. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The judgment is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
