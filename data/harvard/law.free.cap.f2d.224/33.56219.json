The policy provided for an additional $10,-000.00 \u201caccidental means death benefit (double indemnity).\u201d The insured was an airline pilot for Regina Air Lines, a non-schedule air line. He was one of the two crew members of a Regina plane killed in a fatal accident in the State of Washington on September 1, 1953, at a time when the policy (taken out August 20, 1952) was in full force and effect. The others aboard, also killed in the crash, were 19 soldier passengers being transported by Regina on a chartered flight from an Army post in California to one in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-16\">The appellant paid to Mrs. Jones, the beneficiary, the single indemnity, or face of the policy in the amount of $10,000.00, and this action followed to recover the double indemnity or accidental means death benefit in the amount of $10,000.00 for the death of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-17\">Motions for summary judgment were filed by both parties, and that of the defendant, New York Life Insurance Company, was denied by the trial Court. The motion for summary judgment of the plaintiff-appellee, Mrs. Jones, was granted, and judgment in her favor for $10,000.00 together with $1,500.00 attorneys fees (under Florida Statute, F.S.A. \u00a7 625.08) and costs was entered below. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-18\"> We reach only the first question raised: Did the Court below correctly determine that the aviation exclusion clause of the policy was ambiguous, and hence under prevailing Florida law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be construed against the insurer ? Finding that this question should be answered in the negative, as we do, determines this case, and renders unnecessary a decision of the other questions raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\">In the policy as originally printed, the exclusion clause under accidental means death benefit read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-21\">\u201cprovided, however, that such Accidental Means Death Benefit shall not be payable if the Insured\u2019s death resulted from any one or more of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>following: \u2014 suicide, whether sane or insane; war, declared or undeclared, or any act incident thereto; service, travel or flight in any kind of aircraft (including falling or otherwise descending from or with any such aircraft in flight) except travel or flight as a passenger in a passenger aircraft operated by an incorporated and governmentally certificated Scheduled Air Carrier; illness or disease; any bacterial infection other than that occurring m censeace f/11 ?\u00edterl\u00b0\u00ed of the body effected solely through external, violent and accidental means'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\">_ _ _ Adjacent to this clause is a vertical printed line: \u201cSee indorsement hereon.\u201d By printed indorsement on the outside of the policy this provision was modified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0L\">\u201cModification of Accidental Means Death Benefit</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ax-dedup-0\">\u201cThe aviation exclusion in the provisions hereof for Accidental Means Death Benefit, reading</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARi\">\u201c 'service, travel or flight in any kind of aircraft (including falling ,, , \u00ab or otherwise descending from or with any such aircraft in flight) except travel or flight as a passenger m a passenger aircraft operated by an incorporated and gov-ernmentally certificated Scheduled .. <em>r </em>.

Each use of the words \u201csuch aircraft\u201d clearly refers to the words \u201cany kind of aircraft.\u201d There arf ^wo conditions recited (each^ modifying service, travel or flight in any kind of aircraft ) in <em>either </em>of which do\"Me \u2018\"\u201c\u2018i wil1 \"ot ?e We \u201de that in orckr to adopt appellees construction, the disjunctive \u201e \u201e ,, , , , \u2019 : , \u00b0r would have to be disregarded, and tbe. con^nctive and read m its place. ... \u201e , tor+\u00dc\u00b0n \u00b0f anfUaf used\u2019 and may be resortad to/or tbe PurP\u00b0se fe; atmg an ambiguity where none m fact \u00ab , exists.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay0\">, \u201e ,. . The language of the modified exclusion clause is clear. It means exactly what ^ gayS_ There is no double indemnity coverage if insured\u2019s death resulted from \u201cservice, travel or flight in any bind of aircraft,\u201d under either of two separate and distinct conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A25\">While the insured is Partlci' Patm\u00ae in nation training in such aircraft,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am1\">\n<em>or</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYr\">(2) \u201cWhile he is a pilot, officer or other member of the crew of such aircraft;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Without dispute, the insured\u2019s death resulted while he was a pilot, officer, or member of the crew in \u201cany kind of aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">It follows that the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment was erroneously granted, and that the appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment should have been granted in the trial Court. The judgment is, therefore, reversed and remanded with directions to the trial Court to enter judgment for appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-22\">. Firemans Fund Ins. Co. v.
