For the reasons stated by this court in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Pittsburgh &amp; Weirton Bus Company, 4 Cir., 219 F.2d 259, we think that this holding was erroneous and that the Tax Court did have jurisdiction to decide the issue raised by the Commissioner. See also Martin Weiner Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 223 F.2d 444, rehearing denied; Willys-Overland Motors v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 219 F.2d 251; Packer Publishing Co. v. Commissioner, 8 Cir., 211 F.2d 612; City Machine &amp; Tool Co. v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 194 F.2d 535; H. Fendrich, Inc., v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 192 F.2d 916. The order of dismissal will accordingly be reversed and the case will be remanded to the Tax Court for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-20\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
