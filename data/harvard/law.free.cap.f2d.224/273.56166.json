See York v. United States, 6 Cir., 299 F. 778; United States v. Spradley, D.C., 65 F. Supp. 136, opinion by District Judge Swinford, affirmed 6 Cir., 162 F.2d 203; Crawford v. United States, 6 Cir., 214 F.2d 313; to the effect that the fact that both charges relate to and grow out of one. transaction does not make a single offense where two are defined by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">It is well established that it is unnecessary that a defendant be present at the hearing of his motion to set aside a judgment of conviction and sentence, where no issue of fact is presented for consideration. United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232. Here, we are confronted with the issue of our right to review a jury verdict determining a fact issue; and it is thoroughly established that a motion to vacate sentence is not to be employed as a substitute for appeal. Goss v. United States, 6 Cir., 179 F.2d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed;- and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
