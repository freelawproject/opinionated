The facts are fully stated in the report of the Trial Examiner and the decision of the Board and need not be repeated here. The issues involved are pure questions of fact and the findings of the Board with regard thereto, cannot be said to be without substantial support in the record considered as a whole. The order of the Board will accordingly be enforced, as it is elementary-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>that it is not the province of this court, in Labor Board cases, to weigh the evidence or to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Order Enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
