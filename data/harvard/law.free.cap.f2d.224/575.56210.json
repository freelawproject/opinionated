The wall between the bathroom and kitchen taken out and a new wall built, enlarging the bathroom. A laundry outside the \u25a0 apartment and a roof garden were constructed for the tenants\u2019 use and a hallway adding to the apartment\u2019s privacy. However, there were no rooms added to the apartment and it remained the same dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The landlord failed to file with the Area Rent Director her petition for increase of the maximum rent in the proceeding provided in the regulations, until after she had charged and collected the $125.00 monthly rental for the period of a year before the tenants\u2019 instant suit was filed. The landlord contends that though no dwelling unit was added, more extensive structural changes involving substantial alterations, brought her within the exception of the underlined portions of the following Rent Regulations under the Act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-4\">\u201cPart 825 \u2014 Rent Regulations Under the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">\u201cSec. 1 \u2014 Definitions and scope of this regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201c(2) Decontrolled housing to which this regulation does not apply. This regulation does not apply to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">\u201c(ii) Accommodations created by new construction or conversion, (a) Housing accommodations the construction of which was completed on or after February 1, 1947, or which are additional housing accommodations created by conversion on or after February 1, 1947: *' * * and the word \u2018conversion\u2019 means (1) a change in a structure from a non-housing to a housing us\u00e9 or (2) <em>a structural change in a residential unit or units involving substantial alterations, </em>or remodeling and <em>resulting'in the creation of additional housing accommodations.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">We do not agree. We are controlled by the contrary interpretation of Sec. 1(2) [ii] (a) by the Housing Administration, the Supreme Court holding in Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, at page 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, at page 1217, 89 L.Ed. 1700, a price regulation case, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-10\">\u201cThe intention of Congress or the principles of the Constitution in some situations may be relevant in the first instance in choosing between various constructions: But the ultimate criterion is the administrative interpretation, which becomes of controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. The legality of the result reached by this process, of course, is quite a different matter. In this case the only problem is to discover the meaning of certain portions of Maximum Price Regulation No. 188. Our only tools, therefore, are the plain words of the regulation and any relevant interpretations of the Administrator.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-14\">The interpretation construes the words \u201cresulting in the creation of additional housing accommodations\u201d as applying to \u201csubstantial alterations\u201d, and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-15\">\u201c5. <em>Requirement that additional housing accommodations result from the alterations or remodeling. </em>Where there has been a structural change involving substantial alteration or remodeling, decontrol occurs only if additional housing accommodations result from this work. This determination is made with a respect to the dwelling unit or dwelling units which are necessarily involved in the creation of additional housing accommodations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-16\">* * * * * ' *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-17\">\u201c6. <em>Basis for determining whether additional housing accommodations have been created. </em>In determining whether additional housing accommodations have been created, the primary test is not whether there are more tenants in occupancy than before the conversion, nor whether there is more floor space. The determination is made by comparing the number of dwelling units before and after the conversion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-18\">We cannot say of this interpretation that it is \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\u201d and we accept it as we did in the analogous case of Feeley v. Woods, 9 Cir., 190 F.2d 228, 233. Since there was no dwelling unit added to the apartment the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
