The Tennessee rule is that, where the joint negligence of the plaintiff and the defendant constitute the proximate cause of an accident, there can be no recovery by the plaintiff. We reiterate what we said in our opinion, that proximate contributory negligence of a plaintiff will defeat his recov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>ery, though the negligence attributed to a defendant consists in the violation of an ordinance. McCampbell v. Central of Georgia Railway Co., 194 Tenn. 594, 599, 253 S.W.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">With this added expression of the instruction intended to be conveyed in our opinion and mandate remanding the case to the district court for a new trial, the petition for rehearing filed by the appellant railroad herein is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
