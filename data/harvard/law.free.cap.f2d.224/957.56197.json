However, after considering confidential information relating to the respondent, as is provided for under 8 CFR 244.8, it is concluded that the respondent\u2019s case does not warrant favorable action and that his application for suspension of deportation be denied.\u201d We think that this is a statement to the effect that the hearing officer was considering the confidential information under the circumstances, upon the conditions, and in the manner provided by the regulation. He considered it \u201cas is provided for\u201d under the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-15\">The discretionary power granted the Attorney General is- limited only by the latter\u2019s self-imposed regulations. United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 265, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681. Here it is apparent that the officer complied with the regulation as a matter of substance. We agree with the trial court that the regulations require no special finding in any particular words or language. We have no authority to review the discretionary determination here made. Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
