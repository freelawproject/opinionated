His appeal is based upon the claim that the actual punishment imposed rather than the maximum punishment provided by statute determines whether a given offense is a felony or a misdemeanor. The law is to the contrary. \u201cCongress by statute passed in 1909, Sec. 541, 18 U.S.C.A., declared: \u2018All offenses which may be punished by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year shall be deemed felonies. All other offenses shall be deemed misdemeanors\u2019, and it has been uniformly held that it is not the actual punishment imposed but that which the statute authorizes which determines whether a crime is a felony or a misdemeanor.\u201d Cartwright v. United States, 5 Cir., 146 F.2d 133, 135. There was nothing unlawful in the sentence of the court that each of the sentences was to be served consecutively rather than concurrently, and gives no rise to any meritorious contention that such a sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution, as claimed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-20\">The order of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
