Dulles, 9 Cir., 219 F.2d 413 and Chow Sing v. Brownell, 9 Cir., 217 F.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">In Ly Shew and Chow Sing this Court held that it appeared that the District Court proceeded on the theory that the burden of proof resting on the appellants in those cases \u201cwas different from and heavier than the ordinary burden of proof resting on plaintiffs in civil actions \u2014a theory which was and is untenable.\u201d In the said cases the judgments were vacated and the cases remanded with instructions to make findings in the light of the opinions of this Court in said cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-14\">The judgment in the Ly Shew case was rendered February 18, 1953 and in the Chow Sing case on February 19, 1953\u2014 and the judgment in the instant case was rendered May 22, 1953. No action had been taken by this court relative to the Ly Shew and Chow Sing cases at that time. Hence we are persuaded that the District Court applied, in the instant case, the standard of proof which had been held to be necessary in other cases decided in the same court.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">On authority of Ly Shew and Chow Sing the judgment in the instant case is vacated and the cause remanded with directions to make findings as to whether Wong Hie is the father of Wong Gong Fay, such findings to be made in the light of the decisions of this court, supra, and thereupon enter such judgment as may be proper.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
