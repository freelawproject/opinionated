But on appeal this court ruled \u201cthat the relator must be afforded the opportunity to prove the allegations set out in his petition for habeas corpus insofar as they relate to the alleged atmosphere of hysteria and prejudice prevailing at his trial, including any issues raised by Judge Boyer\u2019s asserted visits to the courtroom during Darcy\u2019s trial, since the undisputed and incontrovertible facts as shown by the record do not countervail the allegations of hysteria and prejudice.\u201d 3 Cir., 203 F.2d 407, 409. Accordingly, the case was remanded to the district court for a full hearing on the indicated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">In compliance with our mandate the district court permitted the parties to make an elaborate showing of the circumstances under which the relator was tried in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for felonious homicide in the commission of an armed robbery. Although the relator had been contesting his conviction for more than six years, this was the first opportunity given him to introduce evidence to establish facts not apparent on the face of the original trial record which, in his view, would make clear that the trial was fundamentally unfair. In affording this opportunity, the district court devoted eight days to the testimony of more than thirty witnesses and the introduction of much documentary evidence. As a result, that court and this reviewing court now for the first time have been able to exercise fully informed judgment as to the essential fairness of the murder trial. It was specially important that this be done because there had been no taking of testimony on the relevant circumstances of the trial before any Pennsylvania state court in which the conduct of relator\u2019s trial had been challenged as essentially unfair. We emphasize this because we believe it is a virtue of our system of justice, as implemented by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, that it does not send a convicted person to his death without according him one full opportunity to prove charges of unfair trial which are not patently frivolous. The important thing here is that relator has now had that chance.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">After full hearing and consideration of all of the evidence the district court was satisfied that relator's new proof was insufficient to establish that his trial had been fundamentally unfair. 130 F.Supp. 270. We agree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Relator has attempted to show that he was tried in a community so aroused against him that a fair trial was impossible, or at best so unlikely that a decent legal system must permit a second trial. Such a conclusion has been reached where the physical presence of a mob or a threat of mob violence has dominated a criminal trial. Frank v. Mangum, 1915, 237 U.S. 309, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969; Moore v. Dempsey, 1923, 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543; Powell v. State of Alabama, 1932, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158. But on the evidence adduced in the district court it is clear, as that court found, that relator\u2019s trial was conducted with dignity and decorum and without any hostile congregation or demonstration at or near the place of trial. Indeed, during much of the trial the courtroom was not crowded. Certainly, the trial was not attended by any threat of violence or manifestation of mass hysteria. Moreover, a clear and elaborate showing was made to the district court that throughout relator\u2019s trial the jury was kept under strict guard, apart from other persons and without access to newspapers, radio, television or any other source of news or opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">However, the relator suggests that even though the jury was segregated and the community was outwardly calm during the trial, antagonism and hostility toward him were so great and widespread \u25a0 during th\u00e9 period immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>preceding the trial, that the probability of a prejudiced verdict from any jury of the vicinage was a greater risk than a society which insists upon equal justice under law can take. A combination of unchallenged facts has made it very difficult for the relator to establish such extreme and pervasive hostility. The record of the original trial, which is before the court in this collateral proceeding, shows that each of the prospective jurors was subjected to a searching <em>voir dire </em>examination. The questioning of the fourteen persons who became the jurors and alternates for this trial takes up some seventy pages of the typewritten record. Their responses indicated that they were capable of making and disposed to make a fair and objective evaluation of the evidence. Beyond that, original counsel for the relator was sufficiently satisfied with the responses of these veniremen so that he used less than half of the peremptory challenges available to him. And he did not at any time ask for a change of venue. Concerning the significance of this, see Stroble v. State of California, 1952, 343 U.S. 181, 194, 72 S.Ct. 599, 96 L.Ed. 872; United States v. Rosenberg, 2 Cir., 1953, 200 F.2d 666, 669. While to a majority of this court these facts alone have not seemed so compelling as to preclude an independent showing that the trial was dominated by prejudice and hostility, they certainly make the undertaking very difficult. To meet this difficult burden of proof relator has relied largely upon the daily newspaper accounts and editorial comments published in the community during the trial of two of relator\u2019s alleged confederates, which ended only three days before he himself was required to stand trial. We have examined all of this material. The evidence does not indicate, as relator would infer, that the jurors who tried relator were waiting in or near the courtroom during the period of the trial of his confederates. At most it indicates that during the two weeks immediately preceding relator\u2019s trial the community in general had experienced a revival and quickening of interest in the homicide attended by many expressions of indignation against its perpetrators. But it does not appear that feeling ran so high or that hostility toward the relator was so intense and so general as to make it seem incredible that the search for a satisfactory jury would yield twelve persons as open minded about this case as the jurors here claimed to have been. The situation certainly would have justified a decision to wait a while before trying the relator, or else to try him in another community if trial immediately after the conviction of his confederates was deemed important. We may be persuaded that in the circumstances it would have been wise to take such precautions, yet not be convinced that failure to follow the wiser course was a denial of the essence of fair trial. The due process concept does not embrace all that a very careful and perceptive judge might do to protect a trial against emotional factors. It covers no more than the minimum protection which, consistent with our present ideas of justice, every court must afford. In this view of the reach of due process, we can not say that trial of relator at the time and place in question was a denial of constitutionally required protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Relator makes a second contention. Judge Hiram Keller presided over relator\u2019s trial. But another judge of the same court, Honorable Calvin Boyer, was much in and about the courtroom during the course of this trial. Judge Boyer had just completed a trial at which relator\u2019s confederates had been convicted of first degree murder without recommendation of mercy and, according to the press, he had commended the jury for its verdict. It is relator\u2019s contention that Judge Boyer\u2019s participation in and influence upon the trial were so unfair and prejudicial as to amount to a denial of due process of law. Here too the facts are now for the first time fully disclosed in the record. Relator\u2019s trial began June 7 and he was convicted June 14. There were daily morning and afternoon sessions. It now appears that every day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>of this trial Judge Boyer spent some time, on occasions several hours, in the courtroom. He even attended an evening session. At times during the trial Judge Boyer joined Judge Keller on the bench for whispered consultations within view of the jury, although there is nothing to suggest that the jury could hear what was being said. It is also admitted that at least one such consultation was designed for the guidance of Judge Keller in the making of a trial ruling. However, there is no claim that any erroneous or prejudicial ruling resulted from consultation between the presiding judge and his colleague. Finally, during Judge Keller\u2019s charge to the jury, Judge Boyer sat facing the jurors within the enclosure reserved for members of the bar and participants in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">It seems to be agreed that the jurors knew who Judge Boyer was. The evidence makes it very probable that they also knew that he had just completed the trial at which relator\u2019s co-defendants had been convicted and sentenced to death. Moreover, it had been reported in the press that' Judge Boyer had commended the jury for the first degree verdict against the co-defendants with its mandatory death penalty. Relator also makes the point that, while his trial was in progress, the press quoted statements of Judge Boyer in another case reasonably calculated to indicate that the jurist was engaged in an effort to make it clear that the community would deal very sternly with wrongdoers from Philadelphia, a category which included the relator. But this last incident could not have affected the jury in relator\u2019s case, because the jurors had no access to any source of news. Nevertheless, relator argues that the overall effect of this situation was to make Judge Boyer\u2019s impressive record of attendance at this trial an intolerably coercive influence upon the trial jury. But we think this is attaching too much significance to the jury\u2019s observation that a judge other than the trial judge was showing much interest in the ease. Certainly Judge Boyer was privileged to attend and observe proceedings of the court of which he was a judge. His presence in itself was not an impropriety. Even if the jurors identified him as an official who was hostile to the relator, we think it would be necessary to show that he had said or done something prejudicial to the defendant during his stay in the courtroom before the fact of his presence and manifest interest could raise a substantial due process question.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"> The present petition charges one such act and this allegation has given us great concern. The relator alleged and attempted to prove that during the trial Judge Boyer actively helped the prosecutor. Specifically, there wasi testimony from witnesses who may well not have been unbiased that on one occasion Judge Boyer passed a written message to the prosecutor with the result that the prosecutor made a point to the presiding judge about an item in the charge. The government introduced evidence for the purpose of disproving this contention. The government\u2019s showing was less than overwhelming. Yet it was not unsubstantial. There was a sufficient conflict of testimony to make it necessary for the district court as the trier of facts in this habeas corpus proceeding to resolve the factual question whether Judge Boyer did or did not coach and advise the prosecutor as alleged. The district court made a specific finding that this alleged occurrence 'did not take place. On the record we think that we are not justified in disturbing that finding. And absent some \u2022 such improper partisan participation by Judge Boyer in the trial, we cannot say that his rather striking manifestation of extraordinary interest in the proceedings constituted a denial of due process of law. It is established constitutional doctrine that our limited function in correcting fundamental impropriety in state trials challenged under the due process clause makes it necessary that we leave alone many dubious occurrences in state procedure which we would proscribe if they should happen in a federal court. With Betts v. Brady, 1942, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595, contrast John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>son v.

In doing so it must ever be kept in mind that \u201c \u2018due process of law\u2019 in the enforcement of a state\u2019s criminal law * * * expresses a demand for civilized standards of law\u201d and \u201cjudicial review of that guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment inescapably imposes * * * an exercise of judgment upon the whole course of the proceedings in order to ascertain whether they offend those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples <em>even toward those charged with the most heinous </em>offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">In my opinion the majority has failed to discern and assess the impact of Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct in the Darcy trial <em>from </em>the point of view, at the minimum, of the jury\u2019s role in determining Darcy\u2019s fate \u2014 life or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">I am of the opinion, too, that the majority erred in another important respect \u2014 in treating Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct as an \u201coccurrence\u201d, albeit \u201cdubious\u201d, \u201cin state procedure\u201d, immune as such, from federal judicial remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">Let us first consider the issue of Judge Boyer\u2019s role in the Darcy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-17\">Bucks County, where Darcy was tried, at the time had a population of approximately 144,000 \u2014 75 percent rural, 25 percent urban. Judge Boyer, <em>then </em>72 years of age, was a native of Bucks County and had spent his entire life in the community. He had been a judge of the Bucks County Courts for some eighteen years. The extent to which he was known in the county is demonstrated by the fact that he had been its district attorney, twice by appointment and once by election; he had twice been elected for 10-year terms as judge (once in 1931 and again in 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-18\">Judge Boyer had presided at the trial of Darcy\u2019s two confederates which terminated Friday, June 4th with a verdict of guilty and the imposition of death sentences by the jury. Judge Boyer had complimented the jury on its action, stating: \u201c7 <em>don\u2019t see how you could, </em>under the evidence, <em>have reached any other verdict. </em>Your verdict may have a very wholesome effect on other young men in all vicinities who may come to realize the seriousness of the folly in which so many young men indulge in these days. <em>The only hope of stemming the tide of such crime by youth is to impose the law which you have indicated by your decision.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-19\">Three days later, Darcy was placed on trial in the same court house in spite of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>the fact that he had previously been granted a \u201cseverance\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While I agree with the majority that this circumstance, standing alone, did not constitute denial of due process, it merits most serious consideration in evaluating the impact of Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct in the Darcy trial since the trial of the confederates had been widely reported not only in the local newspapers and via radio but in nearby Philadelphia newspapers which had a considerable circulation in Bucks County.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">President Judge Hiram H. Keller of the Bucks County Court presided at Darcy\u2019s trial. He had, at the time, served some eighteen years as president judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">It may be well at this point to advert to the factual findings which the majority made on the score of Judge Boyer\u2019s presence in the courtroom during Darcy's trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\"><em>\u201cHonorable Calvin Boyer was much in and about the courtroom during the course of this trial </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u201c * * * <em>every day of this trial Judge Boyer spent some time, on occasions several hours, in the courtroom.

Jurors look, figuratively speaking, to every spoken word, <em>to </em>every nuance and inflection, to every gesture, no matter how slight or unintentional, to the extent and tenor of'judicial participation in examination or cross-examination, to anything which could conceivably be construed as a straw in the wind as to the judicial \u201cattitude\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">The United States Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and other appellate courts, have time and again emphasized the existence of this significant judge-jury relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u201cIt is obvious that under any system of jury trials <em>the influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and that his lightest word or intimation is received with deference, and may prove controlling.\u201d </em>Starr v. United States, 1894, 153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 923, 38 L.Ed. 841; Quercia v. United States, 1933, 289 U.S. 466, 470, 53 S.Ct. 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has similarly appraised the judge-jury relationship, stating, in the leading case of Commonwealth v. Myma, 1924, 278 Pa. 505, 508, 123 A. 486, 487: \u201cThe practice of a judge entering into the trial of a case as an advocate is emphatically disapproved. The <em>judge occupies an exalted and dignified position; he is the one person to whom the jury, with rare exceptions, looks for guidance, </em>and from whom the litigants expect absolute impartiality. <em>An expression indicative of favor or condemnation is quickly reflected in the jury box and at the counsel table. </em>To depart from the clear line of duty through questions, expressions, or conduct, contravenes the orderly administration of justice. <em>It has a tendency to take from one of the parties the right to a fair and impartial trial, as guaranteed under our system of jurisprudence.\u201d </em>To the same effect see Commonwealth v. Trunk, 1933, 311 Pa. 555, 566, 167 A. 333; Sorrentina v. Graziano, 1941, 341 Pa. 113, 119, 17 A.2d 373; Schlesinger\u2019s Petition, 1951, 367 Pa. 476, 81 A.2d 316; Commonwealth v. Claiborne, 1953, 175 Pa.Super. 42, 50, 102 A.2d 900.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">Evidencing its insistence upon strict conformity with these expressed standards governing judicial office, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that their breach constitutes a deprivation of \u201cdue process\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">It did so in DiBona v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 1947, 356 Pa. 204, 216, 51 A.2d 768, 774, stating: \u201cJudges should never forget that \u2018the first and most essential element in a jury trial is a wise, learned, impartial and competent judge.\u2019 See Martin v. Philadelphia Gardens, Inc., 348 Pa. 232, 236, 35 A.2d 317, and Commonwealth v. Brown, 309 Pa. 515, 521, 164 A. 726, 86 A.L.R. 892. <em>A litigant who is denied, this \u2018essential element\u2019 is deprived of \u2018due process of law.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">It may be said that the foregoing is inapposite in the instant case because Judge Boyer was not the \u201cpresiding judge\u201d at Darcy\u2019s trial. On that score it need only be pointed out, as the majority found, that Judge Boyer time and again \u201csat\u201d on the bench with Judge Keller during the course of the trial and that he \u201cAt times * * * joined Judge Keller on the bench for whispered consultations within view of the jury\u201d and further, \u201cat least one such consultation was designed for the <em>guidance of Judge Keller in the making of a trial ruling.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Coming now to the majority\u2019s statement that in the absence of proof that \u201c[Judge Boyer] had said or done something prejudicial * * * during his stay in the courtroom\u201d, there could be no finding of denial of due process:</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">In my opinion the record more than amply demonstrates that Judge Boyer \u201chad done something prejudicial\u201d to Darcy. The majority\u2019s own finding of his \u201crather striking manifestation of extraordinary interest in the proceedings\u201d and its implicit recognition of the jury\u2019s identification of Judge Boyer as \u201chostile\u201d establish that Judge Boyer \u201chad done something prejudicial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">If more is needed the record supplies it. The jury \u201cknew\u201d who Judge Boyer was. They \u201cknew\u201d he had presided at the trial of Darcy\u2019s confederates and they knew that he had praised the jury for finding them guilty and sentencing them to death.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They \u201cknew\u201d Judge Boyer \u201cwas showing much interest in the case\u201d. They \u201cknew\u201d the extent of his \u201cinterest\u201d from the fact that he was in daily attendance at the trial and that \u201che' even attended an evening session\u201d.

The implication of such an occurrence could scarcely escape an experienced prosecuting attorney and the event would have been indelibly inscribed upon his memory. But curiously here the district attorney had \u201cno recollection\u201d as to whether <em>it had happened or had not happened. </em>And even more curiously, lightning seems to have struck twice, because the assistant district attorney who was admittedly sitting by his side also has \u201cno recollection\u201d whether <em>it had happened or had not happened.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">It seems to me that the thread of a man\u2019s life, no matter how \u201cheinous\u201d his crime, should not be snapped asunder by the erratic, dulled blade of \u201cno recollection\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">My resolution in this respect is reinforced by the admitted but unexplained circumstance that the district attorney and his assistant, when the trial judge began his charge to the jury, saw fit to leave their customary places at the Commonwealth table, close to the bench and only four feet from the jury, and to seat themselves some 15 feet away at the press table, which, as they said, was some eight feet from \u201cJudge Boyer\u2019s chair\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">In conclusion I will dwell but briefly with the majority\u2019s view that Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct was an \u201coccurrence \u2014 -in state procedure\u201d, immune, as such, from the reach of the due process guarantee. Implicit in the majority\u2019s discussion on this score<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is its recognition that Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct was \u201cdubious\u201d and its indication that it would have \u201cproscribed\u201d it had it happened in a trial in a federal court and would have considered it as a compelling basis for granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">Shaken down to its hard core the majority\u2019s position \u2014 bluntly stated \u2014 is this: Darcy was grievously hurt by Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct but we cannot help him because he was hurt on the other (the State) side of the street; otherwise stated, there is no constitutional redress for Darcy despite the fact that he was unfairly tried because it was his fate to be tried in a State court instead of a Federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-16\">I cannot draw as fine a line as the majority has drawn when the terminus of that line is death.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-17\">The mere circumstance that what happened to Darcy occurred in a State and not in a Federal court cannot operate to deprive him of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-18\">Judge Boyer\u2019s extraordinary and unprecedented conduct was totally foreign in every respect to the normal procedural course of a criminal trial in the Pennsylvania courts. It was not in any sense within the periphery of what may be described as the customary and normal procedure in Pennsylvania criminal trials. Its significance in its compelling impact upon the jury was of such proportion and vitality as to take it out of the category of \u201cstate procedure\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>It is not' incidental to \u00e1ny accepted standard of state procedure for a\" judge to conduct himself as Judge Boyer did in the Darcy trial. It is not incidental in Pennsylvania for a judge who has just completed a trial of a defendant\u2019s confederates and praised the jury which found them guilty and fixed death as their penalty, to participate, as Judge Boyer did, in the trial of a third confederate, presided over by the president judge of his court. It is not incidental for a judge to have a \u201cspecial chair\u201d placed for his use on the front row of the courtroom where he is in full view of the jury and it is within his full view and for him to sit there as an extra-curricular judicial overseer.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">And it is not incidental in' Pennsylvania criminal trials for a judge \u201cto pass a note\u201d to the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In my opinion it can fairly be said of Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct that \u201cThis is conduct that shocks the conscience\u201d in violation of the due process guarantee.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Its inevitable effect was to distort the trial process to the extent at least that Darcy was deprived of a possible unprejudiced jury determination that justice required only the imposition of a life sentence instead of death.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">Of Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct it can also be said, as the Supreme Court of the United States said in Chambers v.

It is interesting to note that the majority in noting that Darcy had been placed on trial only three days after conclusion of the trial of his confederates had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-12\">\u201cThe situation certainly would have justified a decision to wait a while before trying the relator, or else to try him in another community if trial immediately after the conviction of his confederates was deemed important.

The brutal crime committed by Darcy, Foster, Zeitz and Capone had angered the citizens of Bucks County. By editorials, news stories and comments the press prejudged Darcy\u2019s case and prejudiced the minds of the citizenry against him. I cannot believe that all members of the jury remained uninfluenced by these publications.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Though Darcy had been granted a separate trial pursuant to the Pennsylvania Act of March 31, 1860, 19 P.S.Pa. \u00a7 785, the severance was rendered worthless when his trial was proceeded with only three days after that of Foster and Zeitz. Under the circumstances a change of venue or a delay in putting Darcy on trial was requisite to fairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Judge Boyer\u2019s preoccupation with Darcy\u2019s trial was intense. He had been on the bench for many years and was a man of great weight in the community. He had complimented the jury at the close of the trial of Foster and Zeitz for imposing the death penalty and this fact had been widely publicized immediately preceding the commencement of Darcy\u2019s trial. From his repeated visits to and his behavior in the courtroom the members of the Darcy jury, with reason, could have inferred that he desired to indicate his belief and his desire that Darcy, like Foster and Zeitz, should be found guilty and that the penalty of death should be imposed upon him by the jury: that such was the belief and the desire of the judicial authorities of Bucks County. Though in theory a judge does not control the decisions of juries, judicial attitudes have great influence on jurors. Fairness cannot condone Judge Boyer\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">The foregoing amounts to a denial of due process. A writ of habeas corpus should issue in this case and Darcy should be granted a new trial. The grant of the writ will not prevent him from being tried again for he cannot successfully plead double jeopardy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
