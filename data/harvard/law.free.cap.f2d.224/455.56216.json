We shall speak of the respondent, \u201cInternational Longshoremen\u2019s Association, Independent,\u201d as the \u201cIndependent\u201d; of \u201cLocal 807,\u201d a truck drivers\u2019 affiliate of the \u201cAmerican Federation of Labor,\u201d as \u201c807\u201d; of the New York Shipping Association as the \u201cAssociation\u201d ; and the \u201cAmerican Federation of Labor\u201d as \u201cAFL.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In 1953 the \u201cAssociation\u201d was a combination of about 170 employers in the Port of New York who operated steamships, stevedoring companies, warehouses and the like. The \u201cIndependent,\u201d a longshoremen\u2019s labor union, had been preceded by an earlier union of the same name which was an affiliate of \u201cAFL,\u201d and consisted of a group of \u201clocals,\u201d comprising substantially all the longshoremen in the Port. For reasons not here relevant, in the fall of that year \u201cAFL\u201d expelled this affiliate, and chartered in its stead another longshoremen\u2019s union, which was an affiliate, which we shall speak of as \u201cAFL-ILA,\u201d and which at once began to try to draw members away from the \u201cIndependent\u201d in the hope of getting itself certified as the representative of all the longshoremen in the Port. On October first the \u201cIndependent,\u201d not being able to come to any agreement with the \u201cAssociation,\u201d called a longshoremen\u2019s strike, which the district court enjoined for 80 days under \u00a7 208 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 178, upon the motion of the Attorney General. In obedience to that order the \u201cIndependent\u201d went back to' work; but \u201cAFL-ILA,\u201d believing that it had secured the adherence of a majority of the longshoremen, filed a petition with the Labor Board for certification as their representative. An election was held on December 23 and 24, at which the \u201cIndependent\u201d got a majority; but the Board refused to grant it a certificate because of the methods that \u201cAFL-ILA\u201d alleged it to have employed. While the Board was conducting hearings on these objections, the district court on March 4, 1954 granted ex parte the injunction,, whose disobedience was the subject of the prosecution now at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">The occasion for that injunction was as follows. One, McMahon, a longshoreman, had been a member and \u201cshop steward\u201d of one of the locals of the original International Longshoremen\u2019s Association; but he had resigned, had joined \u201cAFL-ILA,\u201d and had been employed on Pier 32 by the Moore-MacCormack Line. The longshoremen at that pier who were members of the \u201cIndependent\u201d refused to work with McMahon and struck. He was then discharged and the striking members went back to work. However, McMahon picketed the pier, wearing a tabard with the customary legend; and the drivers of most of the trucks that fetched shippers\u2019 goods to and from Pier-32, who were members of \u201c807,\u201d refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>to cross McMahon\u2019s picket line, in protest against his discharge. Thereupon the \u201cIndependent\u201d refused to serve any trucks driven by members of \u201c807,\u201d at any of the piers in the Port, which resulted in an almost complete tie-up. This situation induced the petitioner to bring the proceeding here in question; the first step in which was the ex parte injunction, disobedience of which is the subject of this appeal. After the order was obtained the longshoremen belonging to the \u201cIndependent\u201d went on a general strike all over the Port.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Nearly all the respondents deny that they knew of the terms of the order, which forbade, not only the conduct described, but allowing it to continue after the order had been entered; but we shall assume, arguendo, that there was enough evidence to support a finding, not only that they did learn of it, but that they either actually counselled or directed the men to continue to refuse to serve the trucks, and eventually to strike against the \u201cAssociation.\u201d Although there is nothing in the record to show that the \u201cAssociation\u201d had any contract with the trucking companies, or that the shippers of goods to and from the piers did not deal directly with them, it is common ground that the \u201cAssociation\u201d was \u201cdoing business\u201d with the companies, and that the shippers were their \u201ccustomers.\u201d Again, there is no evidence that the \u201cAssociation,\u201d under compulsion of the \u201cIndependent,\u201d broke off any business that it was doing with the trucking companies, or that the shippers did the same. Indeed, it does not appear that there were no other than \u201c807\u201d drivers available to carry goods to the piers; but it is to be assumed that there were not as many available as were necessary, so that the \u201cIndependent's\u201d refusal to serve the \u201c807\u201d drivers as we have said effected a substantial tie-up of the Port, before the strike which occurred after the ex parte injunction had been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The evidence is that the refusal to serve the trucks was a reprisal and retaliation against the \u201c807\u201d drivers for their refusal to cross McMahon\u2019s picket line; but obviously, both the drivers\u2019 refusal at Pier 82 and the longshoremen\u2019s refusal to serve the trucks at all the piers were steps in the contest for control of the Port, because it will be remembered that \u201c807\u201d was an affiliate of \u201cAFL,\u201d like \u201cAFL-ILA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The judge told the jury that the refusal to serve the trucks, taken independently of the strike, was unlawful, if its \u201cobject was to force the employers of the men working on the piers to cease doing business with trucking concerns employing 807 drivers\u201d; or if it had the \u201cobject\u201d of forcing \u201ccustomers of the trucking concerns employing 807 drivers to cease doing business\u201d with them. In that case they should convict; but if on the other hand they found that the strike was not a subterfuge to cover the refusal, they should acquit. We are therefore to assume that the jury found that the strike was a \u201csubterfuge\u201d; and that they had acted upon the ruling that the refusal to serve the trucks was of itself a disobedience of the order. We shall for the moment assume that whatever was a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A), 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(b) (4) (A), was disobedience of the order and address ourselves to whether the refusal was such a violation. It was not, we think, within the three most recent decisions of the Supreme Court construing the section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the first place it was not a \u201csecondary boycott\u201d in the usual meaning of that term; for that presupposes a labor dispute between the employees of one employer, with whom another employer has business relations, as a customer, or as the source of his material, or the like. It further presup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>poses that the employees of the second employer, wishing to make common cause with those of the first, strike, or threaten to strike, against their own employer, unless he will discontinue his relations with the first, by this means putting pressure on the first to come to terms with his own employees. Section 8(b) (4) (A) does indeed go further than that; for in the three decisions that we have cited, the employees were not helping the employees of another employer in a dispute between them and him. Nor had they any dispute with their own employer as to the conditions of work or bargaining representative. On the contrary, their only \u201cobject\u201d was to promote the general solidarity of unionism by refusing to work with non-union men, even though these were in a different craft from theirs. In the case at bar it is true that the \u201c807\u201d drivers were in a different craft from the longshoremen; but the \u201cobject\u201d of the \u201cIndependent\u2019s\u201d refusal to serve their trucks was not to advance the union solidarity, but a move against \u201c807\u201d for taking part in the dispute between itself and \u201cAFL-ILA.\u201d If this was within the statute it means that a union may not advance its own cause in a dispute with another to gain representation, if the step it takes causes a cessation of business between its employer and a third person, or between two third persons. It is one thing to say that such interference is unlawful when its \u201cobject\u201d is the promotion of unionism in general, and a very different thing to forbid such a sanction as part of the contest for control. We start therefore with the premise that, if the section goes so far, it ought to appear very plainly in the text, and we do not think that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">Turning then to the text, we are to ask whether it was an \u201cobject\u201d of the \u201cIndependent\u2019s\u201d refusal to serve the trucks to force the \u201cAssociation\u201d \u201cto cease doing business with the trucking concerns\u201d or to force \u201ccustomers\u201d of \u201cthe trucking concerns\u201d to \u201ccease doing business\u201d with them. It is indeed true that this was one of the probable, nay perhaps inevitable, consequences of the refusal; but the liability imposed by the section is much more limited than the usual liability for a tort, which extends to any damage that the tortfeasor should reasonably have expected to result from his act. All strikes and \u201cconcerted refusals\u201d to work involve some cessation of business; that is the only sanction they can have. When Congress limited the wrong to occasions when the cessation was an \u201cobject\u201d of the conduct, it excluded much indeed that the ordinary law of tort would have included. If it had not done so, it would have made nearly all strikes unlawful. The \u201cobject\u201d of an action is the concluding state of things that the actor seeks to bring about: that which satisfies his aim. Hence it is a term relative to the whole sequence of steps that he proposes; and it does not apply to those that are only intermediate to it. If I wish to enter my house, but can do so only by passing through my garden, my \u201cobject\u201d is to enter the house, and it is not a subsidiary \u201cobject\u201d to pass through the garden. On the other hand, if I find the garden gate locked, and I take out my key, the \u201cobject\u201d of my doing so is to open the gate, though it is still only a step towards entering the house. So in the case at bar, if the respondents\u2019 refusal to serve the trucks was merely to cause a cessation of business between the \u201cAssociation\u201d and the trucking companies or between those companies and their customers, that may have been within the section, though not even that is perfectly certain as will appear. On the other hand, if the refusal was a part of the struggle for control of the Port, that was the only \u201cobject\u201d in the sense that that term is used in the section, unless it is to cover all acts in a labor dispute that are known and intended to result In a cessation of business between others. When therefore the judge left no question to the jury, except whether the strike was a subterfuge for continuing the refusal, it necessarily followed, regardless of whether the refusal was a step or move in the contest for power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that it was within the section. With that.we do not agree for the reasons we have given. It was not within the section unless it affirmatively appeared that the refusal was not part of the struggle; and that did not appear from the fact that it was an act of reprisal. Reprisals are a customary part of all sorts of warfare. Indeed, not only might it be a move in .the contest; but it almost inevitably was one, for the \u201cIndependent\u201d had no dispute with the trucking compa\u00f1\u00edes,. or for that matter with the \u201cAssoeiation itself.</p>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">We have just said that it is not perfectly certain, even though the \u201cobject\u201d of the refusal had been to break up the business of the \u201cAssociation\u201d or the \u201ceustomers\u201d with the trucking companies, that the plaintiff would have proved his case. It so happens that in all the three cited decisions the union forced its employer to put a subcontractor off the job; it did not merely refuse to assist the work of the non-union men. We do not say that it should make a difference whether the cessation'of business between third parties is brought about without the mediation of one of the parties affected; but we do wish to leave that question undetermined, and that we may for the reasons we.have tried to state.</p>\n<p id=\"az-dedup-0\">The only remaining question is whether if the respond\u00e9nts\u2019 conduct was not a violation of the section, it necessarily follows that it was not in disobedience of the order, because we of course agree that the order had to be obeyed, whether it was right or wrong. In the statement of the \u201cobjects\u201d that made the conduct unlawful the order followed the language phrase of subsection (A) : that is, the ban was upon forcing an employer \u201cto cease doing business with any other person.\u201d It only substituted the names of the \u201cAssociation,\u201d the trucking companies and their \u201ccustomers\u201d \u2014 presumably the shippers. We do not forget the recital that there was \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d that the respondents had violated the section; but that left open what meaning the court ascribed to the words that had been lifted without change from the section. \u201cObject\u201d and \u201cdoing business\u201d the order did not attempt to define; and, dealing as we are with a criminal prosecution, we must assume that no more was forbidden than the section itself forbade,</p>\n<p id=\"adg-dedup-0\">it follows from what we have said that the offence was not proved, because the plaintiff did not show that the refusal was not a part of the struggle for power in the Port; as indeed it appears inevitably to have been. We' do not say that if it had been shown to have had no connection with that struggle, that is, to have been a mere act of malice not intended to have any effect upon the re-suit, a verdict could not have stood; but the fact was not proved and without that the offence was not proved. Possibly if the cause be tried again it may be proved, but on this record the order must be reversed.' There may of course have been criminal incidents accompanying the refusal and the strike; but, if so, their punishment was a matter for the state courts. The losses occasioned to others \u2014 the \u201cAssociation,\u201d the trucking companies and their \u201ccustomers\u201d \u2014 by the refusals themselves were, however, incidents for which per se the law in its present form dops not furnish any relief, Whether it should do so is of course not ^or us to say*</p>\n<p id=\"ACd\">Order reversed; new trial ordered if the petitioner so desires,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\">. \u00a7 160(1) of Title 29 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-10\">. \u201cNow, therefore, upon the above, it is ordered that respondents International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, Independent, and Locals 791, 856, 824, 874, 895, 920, 975 and 1258, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, Independent, and each of them, their agents, servants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>employees, attorneys and all other persons in active concert or participation with them, be and they hereby are enjoined and restrained until March 9, 1954, at 5:00 p. m., and not longer, without further order of this Court, from: \u201cEngaging in, or, by orders, directions, instructions, appeals, or other means, or by permitting any such to remain in existence or effect, inducing or encouraging the employees of members of New York Shipping Association and of other employers to engage in, strikes or concerted refusals in the course of their employment, to use, process, transport or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials or commodities, or to perform services for tlieir employers, where objects thereof are (1) to force or require members of New York.
