The summons read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-15\">\u201cSummons to Appear, to Testify, and to Produce Books, Etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-16\">\u201cIn the matter of the tax liability of Donald Daniels</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASt1\">\u201cDistrict of New York for the years 1948 and 1949</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-18\">\u201cThe Commissioner of Internal Revenue</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-19\">\u201cTo Donald Daniels, Pres.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-20\">International Commodities Corp.

Y., on the 10th day of January 1955, at 10:00 o\u2019clock in the forenoon, to give testimony in the matter of the tax liability of the above-named person for the years designated, and directed to bring with you the following books and papers: bank statements and cancelled checks of the International Commodities Corp., check stub book of the International Commodities Corp., cash book, general ledger, purchase &amp; sales book and any other books of account maintained by the International Commodities Corp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-23\">\u201cFailure to comply with this summons will render you liable to proceedings in the district court of the United States for the district in which you reside, to compel your attendance, testimony, and production of books, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-24\">\u201cIssued under authority of Section 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code, this 22nd day of December, 1955.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-25\">\u201cSidney S.

As the order terminated that suit, it is final and appealable. Ap-pellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">'The summons was directed to \u201cDonald Daniels, Pres., International Commodities Corp.\u201d If directed to the company, not to Daniels as an individual, (a) it would not have said, as it did, <em>\u201cYou </em>are summoned, etc. * * * to give testimony,\u201d and (b) would have said \u201cbring * * * <em>your </em>bank statements and cancelled checks,\u201d and not <em>\"the </em>bank statements, etc., of the International Commodities Corp.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
