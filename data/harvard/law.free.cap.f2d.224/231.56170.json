See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1292. However, a motion is pending before us for leave to file a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 for a writ of mandamus directed to Judge Day, in which proceeding we are asked to review this unappealable order of June 2, 1955, and to direct Judge Day to vacate the same and to grant a motion filed in the district court by the present movants to restore the actions to the trial list without reference of any issues to a special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Upon consideration of the motion for leave to file, and movants\u2019 memorandum in support thereof, together with the proposed petition for writ of mandamus annexed thereto; and upon consideration also of the brief of the intervenors herein in opposition to the pending motion; and it appearing to the court that no exceptional circumstances are present which would necessitate, or render it appropriate for, an anticipatory review of the unappealable order of June 2, 1955, by way of \u201caid\u201d to our purely potential jurisdiction to review any eventual final decisions which may be rendered by the district court in these eight pending cases, it follows that the motion must be denied. We thought we had sufficiently indicated our attitude toward applications of this sort under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651 in a number of recent cases. See In re Chappell &amp; Co., Inc., 1 Cir., 1953, 201 F.2d 343; In re Previn, 1 Cir., 1953, 204 F.2d 417; In re Josephson, 1 Cir., 1954, 218 F.2d 174; In re Sylvania Electric Products Inc., 1 Cir., 1955, 220 F.2d 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">An order will be entered denying the motion for leave to file petition for writ of mandamus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
