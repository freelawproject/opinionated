While it is true, as appellant states in his brief, that the motions were filed to obtain, and the principal relief sought in them was the return of the seized property, this is not the situation which prevailed at the time the court entered his orders on the motions. At that time, because of the action of the government in \u201cfiling a libel of information civilly seeking forfeiture, pursuant to which the property was ordered seized and taken into the custody of the court\u201d, the whole aspect of the proceedings had changed. The motions to quash, if not made moot by, became ancillary to, the forfeiture proceeding and, though the court stated, \u201cSince the property seized obviously is not needed by the government as evidence, we would order it returned to its lawful owner\u201d, he also correctly added, \u201cSuch an order properly may not be issued. The merits of the government\u2019s right to effect this will be determined in due course according to law.\u201d Cf. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2461, 2462 and 2463. Raffaeli v. Granger, 3 Cir., 196 F.2d 620; United States v. Cross Town Liquor Mart, D.C., 87 F.Supp. 896.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In view of the claim of the government in its brief that seizure of the liquors under the search warrant was necessary to obtain jurisdiction for forfeiture, Rule 21, Rules of Practice in Admiralty and Maritime cases, 28 U.S.C.A., Coffey v. U. S., 116 U.S. 427-435, 6 S.Ct. 432, 29 L.Ed. 681, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2461, we do not think that the search warrant proceedings were made moot by the seizure under libel. We think it clear, though, that the orders sought to be appealed from were not final but interlocutory and to the extent, if any, that the search has a bearing on the forfeiture proceedings, the orders sought to be appealed from will be open to reconsideration and change by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">The orders appealed from being interlocutory, the appeals are dismissed without prejudice to the right of movants, if they are so advised, to renew their motions and to appeal from actions with respect to them when the final judgment has been entered in the forfeiture proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-9\">. \u201cRuling on Motion to Quash Search Warrant and Affidavit, to Suppress as Evidence and to return Property</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">\u201cLooking at the entire affidavit, upon which the search warrant was issued herein, and not treating it \u2014 as movant\u2019s counsel would have us to \u2014 as dismembered segments, we find that the Commissioner, acting as a reasonable\u2019 man, had ample justification to conclude that the alleged violations had occurred, and were occurring. There was entirely adequate \u2018probable cause\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">\u201cThe facts shown in the, affidavit need not \u2019 be sufficient to convict. The statements denominated as \u2018hearsay\u2019 by movant\u2019s counsel, while; not .admissible in a trial, are valid for the purposes of a search warrant affidavit, especially since they constituted official information, officially obtained. Surely it is not necessary that law enforcement officers personally examine distant official, records in cases such as this. To require that would be to hamper unduly their lawful operations, especially when speedy action is required to serve the ends of enforcement processes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-18\">\u201cOn the authority of Brinegar v. U. S., 338 U.S. 160, 174, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879, and Washington v. U. S., 92 U.S.App.D.C. 31, 202 F.2d 214, the motion to quash the search warrant and the affidavit upon which it was issued, and the motion to suppress as evidence the property seized pursuant to the search, must be DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-19\">\u201cSince the property seized obviously is not needed by the Government as evidence, we would order it returned to its lawful owner but for the fact that the Government today has filed a libel of information, civilly seeking its forfeiture, pursuant to which the property has been ordered seized and taken into the custody of the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-20\">\u201cTherefore, such an order properly may not be issued. The merits of the Government\u2019s right to effect this will be determined in due course according to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-21\">\u201cFiled Dec. 23, 1954.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-22\">\n<em>\u201cJudgment\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-23\">\u201cFor reasons signed in writing and filed on 23 December, 1954, the demands of the Movers, C.
