He cites our opinion in Bledsoe v. Johnston, 9 Cir., 154 F.2d 458, 459 in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-12\">\u201cThe controversy here is whether the sentences were to be served concurrently or consecutively. Each sentence signed by the district judge read that it is \u2018to run consecutive <em>with\u2019 </em>the other. Obviously here is no effective judgment for consecutive sentences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">The word \u201cwith\u201d in the Bledsoe case is not used along with the phrase \u201cand not concurrently\u201d. We think the intent to create successive sentences is adequately stated. The controlling principle is announced in United States v. Daugherty, 269 U.S. 360, 46 S.Ct. 156, 70 L.Ed. 309, in which the same argument as here presented was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">The judgment in that case read so far as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">\u201c * * * said defendant be confined * * * f0r the term of five (5) years on each of said three counts, and until he shall have been discharged from said penitentiary by due course of law. Said term of imprisonment to run consecutively and not concurrently.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-18\">\u201cSentences in criminal cases should reveal with fair certainty the intent of the court and exclude any serious misapprehensions by those who must execute them. The elimination of every possible doubt cannot be demanded. Tested by this standard the judgment here questioned was sufficient to impose total imprisonment for fifteen years made up of three five-year terms, one under the first count, one under the second and one under the third, to be served consecutively and to follow each other in the same sequence as the counts appeared in the indictment. This is the reasonable and natural implication from the whole entry. The words, \u2018said term of imprisonment to run consecutively and not concurrently\u2019 are not consistent with a five year sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
