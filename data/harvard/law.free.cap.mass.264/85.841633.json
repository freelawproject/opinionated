The bill in substance alleges that, pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 25 and amendments thereto, the town of Falmouth, on April 20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>1926, adopted a zoning by-law which was duly approved by the Attorney General on May 3, 1926, and published and in full effect on June 5, 1926. The defendant, at the time the by-law became operative, was the owner of a large wooden outdoor advertising sign located in a section of Falmouth zoned as a single residence district. The defendant began the construction of a new sign or \u201cbillboard\u201d to take the place of the existing old one without obtaining a permit from the plaintiff or the sanction of the board of appeals constituted under the zoning by-law, and completed its construction although notified to cease work thereon because the billboard was being built in violation of the by-law. The defendant\u2019s answer, while denying that a new billboard was constructed, also alleged that in so far as the zoning laws purported to prevent the defendant from making such repairs or reconstruction as were reasonably necessary to maintain the structure in a safe and workmanlike condition, they were illegal, unconstitutional and unenforceable under the laws of this Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">The defendant, however, excepted to the refusal of the court to rule, in accordance with its request, that, upon all the evidence, the plaintiff was not entitled to relief, and also to the denial of the defendant\u2019s request that in so far as the zoning by-law \u2014 which was adopted by the inhabitants of the town and approved by the Attorney General under the provisions of G. L. c. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 25-30, inclusive \u2014 applied to billboards and other advertising devices, it was illegal and unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">It is unquestioned that the Legislature has inherent authority to regulate buildings, structures and premises in the interests of public safety, health, morals and welfare. <em>Welch </em>v. <em>Swasey, </em>193 Mass. 364. <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Revere House, </em>232 Mass. 88. By art. 50 of the Amendments to the Constitution, \u201cAdvertising on public ways, in public places and on private property within public view may be regulated and restricted by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The question is whether the word \u201cstructures\u201d added to the zoning act by St. 1925, c. 116, \u00a7 1, includes billboards. In <em>Small </em>v. <em>Parkway Auto Supplies Inc. </em>258 Mass. 30, 33, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>word \u201cbuilding\u201d is defined. Under that definition, which we adopt, it is plain that the word building as used in the zoning act does not include billboards; but by St. 1925, c. 116, \u00a7 1, \u201c structures and premises \u201d were added. The amendatory act was approved March 17, 1925, and when it took effect G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30, coexistent with G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 25, had not been repealed. By G. L. c. 93, \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30, advertising signs and devices within public view were placed under the supervision and control of the division of highways of the department of public works which was directed in \u00a7 29 to make, amend or repeal rules and regulations for the proper control and restriction of billboards, signs and other devices on public ways or on private property within public view of any highway, public park or reservation, except as provided in \u00a7 32, which relates to signs or other devices on or in the rolling stock, stations, subways or structures of or used by common carriers. \u201cSaid rules and regulations may require that said billboards, signs or other devices be licensed in accordance therewith and with this section, . . . and need not be uniform throughout the Commonwealth.\u201d If it seems necessary or expedient, in the opinion of the division, public hearings may be given. It also provides that, subject to the approval of the commission, cities and towns \u201cmay further regulate and restrict said billboards or other devices within their respective limits by ordinance or by-law not inconsistent with sections twenty-nine to thirty-three, inclusive, or with said rules and regulations.\u201d By \u00a7 31, jurisdiction in equity is given to the court on complaint of the Attorney General, of any town or any officer thereof, or of any interested party, to restrain the violation of any rule, regulation, ordinance or by-law established or adopted under \u00a7 29. By \u00a7 33, the violation of any rule, ordinance or by-law established under \u00a7 29 is punishable by fine. General Laws, c. 93, \u00a7 29, was amended by St. 1924, c. 327. By the amendment the division was directed that, before establishing or amending rules or regulations it should hold duly advertised public hearings in so far as may be deemed necessary or expedient, and \u201cCities and towns may further regulate and restrict said billboards or other devices within their respective limits by ordinance or by-law not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>inconsistent with sections twenty-nine to thirty-three, inclusive, or with such rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">It is plain, however, that, when the words \u201cstructures and premises\u201d were added to the zoning act, a well coordinated and complete system for the establishment and regulation of billboards located on a public way \u2014 as the billboard in the case at bar was located \u2014 had been established and was in force. The Legislature had conferred upon the division authority over the erection and maintenance of billboards with the subordinate right of cities and towns by ordinance or by-law to make further regulations or orders not inconsistent or at variance with the regulations promulgated by the division.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">It is the contention of the plaintiff that the by-law is valid and enforceable under the zoning act as amended. While statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed as corroborative of each other, <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Loxdale, </em>Burr. 445, 447, and that principle was followed in <em>Church </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>3 Mass. 17, we are of opinion that the Legislature did not intend by the amendment to the zoning act to include billboards and by implication to supersede and repeal G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29. A statute is not to be deemed to supersede a prior statute in whole or in part in the absence of express words or clear implication. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>8 Met. 172, 174. <em>Copeland </em>v. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Springfield, </em>166 Mass. 498, 504. <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>200 Mass. 8, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The by-law being invalid as to billboards, the defendant\u2019s request \u2014 that, upon all the evidence the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for \u2014 should have been given, and a decree is to be entered dismissing the bill with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
