The case was referred to an auditor whose findings of fact, by agreement of the parties, were to be final. After stating the transactions between the plaintiff and the testator, the auditor found for the plaintiff in the sum of $2,650, but the trial judge found and ordered judgment for the defendants and reported the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The auditor finds that the plaintiff, who was engaged in the \u201cprinting business\u201d in Dedham, undertook at the testator\u2019s request to perform personal services for the testator, and he was to be ready to answer all calls by him, day or night, even if he was obliged to leave his business. While no definite compensation was named, it was agreed by the testator that the plaintiff, if required to leave his business, should be paid the amount he would have received if not called upon, which was about $50 a week; if the plaintiff accompanied the testator on trips or vacations and extra workmen were hired in the printing establishment because of the plaintiff\u2019s absence, the expense of such employment to the extent of $50 a week, the testator also agreed to pay. The testator moreover said \u201cthat he would compensate the plaintiff and pay him for his trouble and expenses.\u201d The services which the plaintiff performed under the contract are fully described in the report. The testator paid,the amount stipulated for extra help but he did not make any payment for the plaintiff\u2019s special services. The seventh item of the testator\u2019s will is in these words: \u201cTo Mr. John F. Biley, if living at the time of my decease, Sexton of said St. Mary\u2019s Church, for services faithfully rendered, I give and bequeath the sum of one thousand (1000) dollars.\u201d The plaintiff brought suit May 10, 1924, and the writ'was served May 22, 1924. The executors on June 12,1924, voluntarily made an , unconditional payment of the legacy to the plaintiff of $950, which the plaintiff accepted June 18, 1924.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The defendants contend that the testator intended the legacy to be in full settlement of his indebtedness to the plaintiff and that the plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the legacy was an election to take the legacy in full satisfaction of any claim he had against the testator. <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>17 Pick. 303, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>308. While this defence is not open under the answer, the record states that no question of pleading was raised at the hearing. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Noyes, </em>224 Mass. 125, 134. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 31. Lack of such defence in the answer, therefore, cannot be raised in this court. <em>Oulighan </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>189 Mass. 287, 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">The intention of the testator is to be ascertained from the frame of the will in connection with all the circumstances when he made it. <em>Aldrich </em>v. <em>Aldrich, </em>172 Mass. 101. The wording of the bequest indicates that the legacy was in recognition and appreciation of \u201cservices faithfully rendered\u201d as \u201cSexton of said St. Mary\u2019s Church.\u201d It was a gift, if the legatee were living at his death, wholly disconnected with the contract which the auditor has found, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim also was a \u201cjust debt\u201d directed by the testator to be paid before the legatees received their respective legacies. We find no intention of the testator that the plaintiff, if living, should surrender his claim in exchange for the legacy, and the doctrine of election relied on by the defendants should not be applied. <em>Lovering </em>v. <em>Balch, </em>210 Mass. 105, 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The plaintiff accordingly is entitled to judgment for $2,650, with interest from the date of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
