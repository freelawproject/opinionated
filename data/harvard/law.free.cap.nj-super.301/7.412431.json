The case against the IOL manufacturer was dismissed on grounds of federal preemption. The hospital was granted summary judgment based on its lack of duty to obtain \u201cinformed consent.\u201d The case against Dr. Newman was dismissed on statute of limitations grounds because the trial judge concluded after a <em>Lopez </em>hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the plaintiffs cause of action accrued \u201cno later than 1987.\u201d The judge who dismissed the action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Newman reasoned that plaintiff \u201cwas well-aware that she had a problem, she was well-aware that it came- from the surgery,\u201d became \u201cdissatisfied with the treatment by Dr. Newman\u201d shortly after the surgery, and \u201cswitched to other physicians\u201d by 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">We reverse the grant of summary judgment to each defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">In 1988, Eleanor Baird (plaintiff) consulted Dr. Newman, an ophthalmologist, because she was \u201chaving trouble\u201d with the vision in her left eye. Upon examination, Dr. Newman explained to her that she had a cataract in her left eye. Plaintiff testified that, upon diagnosis, Dr. Newman \u201csaid [she] was going to need an operation, have the cataract removed and an implant put in.\u201d Plaintiff further testified that aside from arrangements to go to the hospital, \u201c[n]othing much\u201d was explained to her about the implant. According to plaintiff, Dr. Newman never asked if she would \u201cparticipate in a study to determine if the lens is safe.\u201d Plaintiff maintains that she would not have \u201cparticipated,\u201d if she had been asked. She also asserts that the doctor never \u201ctold [her] that the lens was not approved,\u201d and that she would not have \u201csubmitted to the surgery\u201d if she knew that.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">Dr. Newman removed the cataract on November 8, 1983 and implanted the IOL in plaintiff\u2019s left eye. Plaintiff testified that after the surgery Dr. Newman advised plaintiff and her husband that she \u201cwould have to stay [in the hospital for] at least three days because there was a problem. He never told me what the problem was or anything.\u201d Plaintiff continued to have problems with her eye, consulted other doctors and ultimately learned in the late 1980\u2019s that the sight in her left eye \u201cwas gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">One of plaintiff\u2019s daughters, who attended to her during the surgery and related hospitalization and on subsequent visits to Dr. Newman, testified that the doctor never told her mother that the lens was not FDA approved; that her father would never have allowed her mother to receive an experimental lens in her eye, and that Dr. Newman never told her that anything was wrong with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lens. Another daughter testified that she \u201cnever thought Dr. Newman would ... give her the lens that wasn\u2019t approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">On March 24, 1991, plaintiff read an article in the <em>Bergen Record </em>regarding problems with IOLs. Because the problems \u201csounded so much like what [she] had experienced,\u201d she contacted an attorney. Upon subsequent inquiry, plaintiff learned that an experimental IOL had been implanted in her eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">It is uncontested that plaintiff signed an \u201cInformed Consent Form for Cataract Operation and/or Implantation of Intraocular Lenses\u201d indicating the risks of the implant surgery and detailing alternatives. Plaintiff signed the line \u201cI wish to have a cataract operation with an intraocular implant.\u201d The form contained information to the effect that plaintiff understood she was \u201ctak[ing] part\u201d in a \u201cclinical investigation.\u201d At the <em>Lopez </em>hearing, plaintiff acknowledged signing the form, but said she did not \u201cremember\u201d doing it and insisted that neither the doctor nor the nurse explained the form to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We reverse the grant of summary judgment to Dr. Newman for the reasons detailed in <em>Lombardo v. Borsky, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>658, 690 A.2d 150 (App.Div.1997). We remand for further consideration of the informed consent claim against him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Lombardo </em>involved a similar claim and we reversed on discovery-rule grounds. In this case, as in <em>Lombardo, </em>there is no contest as to when plaintiff learned of the implantation of an experimental lens. The motion judge expressly found that plaintiff \u201cwas very candid ... [and] straight-forward with the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">It is undisputed that plaintiff was not aware the implanted lens was an experimental IOL until March 1991 and her complaint was filed within a year thereafter. Under these circumstances, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>statute of limitations does not bar plaintiffs action against Dr. Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We have found no cases, and are cited to none, in which the courts of New Jersey have recognized the obligation of a hospital to obtain informed consent before permitting surgery at its facility. <em>See Lombardo v. Borsky, supra, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 661 n. 1, 690 A.2d 150. The hospital must generally rely on the relationship between a patient and his or her physician and not interfere with or intervene in that relationship. However, plaintiff argues that there is such a duty when a hospital elects to permit an FDA experimental investigation to go forward on its premises. <em>See Friter v. Iolab Corp., </em>414 <em>Pa.Super. </em>622, 607 A.2d 1111 (1992); <em>but see Kershaw v. Reichert, </em>445 <em>N.W.2d </em>16 (N.D.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Whether the duty exists may depend on the facts, the relationship between the hospital and doctor and the ultimate findings regarding the doctor\u2019s conduct. We therefore conclude that the issue should be .decided after development of a full record. <em>See Wolfsbruck v. Dow Chemical Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>252, 501 A.2d 924 (1985); <em>Salomon v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>58, 61, 484 A.2d 320 (1984); <em>Jackson v. Muhlenberg Hospital, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>138, 249 A.2d 65 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">A motion judge held \u201cthat plaintiffs cause of action for manufacturing and design defects is preempted.\u201d He similarly held with respect to plaintiffs claims of breach of warranty and fraudulent misrepresentation claims. We find no basis for dismissing plaintiffs complaint against AMO on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The federal Medical Devices Amendments of 1976(MDA) to the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 (FDCA) \u201cclassifies medical devices in three categories based on the risk they pose to the public.\u201d Class I devices \u201cpresent no unreasonable risk of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>illness or injury\u201d and \u201care subject only to minimal regulation.\u201d 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 360c(a)(l)(A)(ii)(II). <em>Medtronic, Inc. v.

Class II devices are \u201cpotentially more harmful\u201d and must comply with additional federal regulations known as \u201c[sjpecial [ejontrols.\u201d 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 360e(a)(l)(B); <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2246, 135 L.Ed.2d at 709-10. Class III devices are those \u201cthat either present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or which are purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life or for a use which is of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health. 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 360c(a)(l)(C).\u201d <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 S.Ct at 2246,135 L.Ed.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">IOLs are products classified and regulated by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Class III medical devices. 21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 886.3600(b). \u201cBefore a new Class III device may be introduced to the market, the manufacturer must provide the FDA with \u2018a reasonable assurance\u2019 that the device is both safe and effective.\u201d <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2246, 135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 710, 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 360e(d)(2) (\u201cAction on application for premarket approval\u201d). This process for establishing \u201creasonable assurance\u201d is known as the \u201cpremarket approval\u201d or PMA process. <em>Medtronic, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2246-47, 135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 709-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">It is undisputed before us that in order to obtain an investiga-tional device exemption (IDE) incident to the PMA process, a manufacturer must apply to the FDA and receive permission to undertake investigations. 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 360j(g)(2)(A) (\u201cexemption for device for investigational use\"). To that end, the FDA has promulgated specific regulations regarding the development and use of IOLs. <em>See generally </em>21 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 813.20 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-18\">The parties agree that in advance of plaintiffs surgery, the FDA granted AMO an IDE, permitting it to conduct a \u201cclinical investigation\u201d of the type of IOL implanted in this case. It is also undisputed that incident thereto Valley Hospital formed an Inves-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>tigational Review Board (IRB) to monitor the investigational study to be conducted at the hospital. Various eye surgeons, including Dr. Newman, took part in the clinical investigation as \u201cinvestigators.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The MDA specifically addresses \u201cstate and local requirements\u201d with respect to medical devices. Section 360k(a) provides in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">[N]o State or political subdivision of a State may establish or continue in effect with respect to a device intended for human use any requirement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">(1) which is different from, or in addition to, any requirement applicable under this chapter to the device, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">(2) which relates to the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-11\">[ 21 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 360k(a)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">In <em>Medtronic, </em>decided after the orders under review were entered, the United States Supreme Court held that a plaintiffs state common-law \u201cdesign claims\u201d and \u201cmanufacturing and labeling claims\u201d resulting from an allegedly defective pacemaker regulated as a Class III device were not preempted by section 360k. \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2240-58, 135 L.Ed.2d at 700-26. That case dealt with a provision of the MDA that grandfathered devices which had been marketed before the MDA was enacted in 1976, and provided that devices \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d thereto could \u201cbe marketed without the rigorous PMA review\u201d by the filing of a \u201cpremarket notification\u201d to the FDA. <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2247, 135 L.Ed.2d at 710-12. The Court was divided in its approach to resolution of the preemption issue, and the opinions emphasized that the \u201cdesign claim\u201d had to be evaluated on the basis that the \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d devices had \u201cnever been formally reviewed [by the FDA] under the MDA for safety or efficacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2254,135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 720-21; <em>see also id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2263-64, 135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 731-34 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring and dissenting). However, the Court was unanimous in finding no preemption of the \u201cdefective design claim,\u201d and a majority found no preemption of the \u201cmanufacturing and labeling claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Thus, under <em>Medtronic </em>all state common-law claims are not preempted. Moreover, we read five members of the <em>Medtronic </em>Court to find preemption only to the extent that the FDA has adopted a regulation inconsistent with or in conflict with a requirement of state law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In Part IV of the four Justice <em>Medtronic </em>plurality opinion, which Justice Breyer did not join, Justice Stevens concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">The legislative history ... confirms our understanding that \u00a7 360(k) simply was not intended to pre-empt most, let alone all, general common-law duties enforced by damage actions. There is, to the best of our knowledge, nothing in the hearings, the committee reports, or the debates suggesting that any proponent of the legislation intended a sweeping pre-emption of traditional common-law remedies against manufacturers and distributors of defective devices.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\"><em>[Id </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2253,135 <em>L.Ed2A </em>at 719.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Justice Breyer appears to disagree, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">I believe that ordinarily insofar as the MDA pre-empts a state requirement embodied in a state statute, rule, regulation or other administrative action, it would also pre-empt a similar requirement that takes the form of a standard of care or behavior imposed by a state-law tort action. It is possible that the plurality also agrees on this point, although it does not say so explicitly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at --, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2260,135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 727 (Breyer, J. concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-12\">Justice O\u2019Connor in her concurring and dissenting opinion on behalf of four members of the Court concluded \u201cthat state common-law damages actions do impose \u2018requirements\u2019 and are therefore pre-empted where such requirements would differ from those imposed by the FDCA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 135 L.Ed.2d at 730. She disagreed with the plurality that \u201ccommon-law claims [would be] almost never pre-empted.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-15\">In Part VI of <em>Medtronic </em>the plurality declined to \u201cdirectly\u201d pass upon the argument that the MDA \u201cnever pre-empts common-law actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at 726. It did so because none of the claims involved in the case were pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>empted and because it was \u201capparent that few, if any, common-law duties have been pre-empted by this statute.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In his concurrence Justice Breyer, like those joining Justice O\u2019Connor, also disagreed with this observation. Justice Breyer specifically said, \u201cI do not join Part VI, because I am not convinced that future incidents of MDA pre-emption of common-law claims will be \u2018few\u2019 or \u2018rare.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2262, 135 L.Ed.2d at 731. It is clear, therefore, that Justice Breyer, although joining portions of the plurality opinion, also joined the dissenters to forge a majority for the proposition that state common-law claims can be pre-empted by the MDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">In a portion of part V of the plurality opinion regarding \u201cmanufacturing and label claims,\u201d in which Justice Breyer joined to form a majority, <em>id </em>at---, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2261-62, 135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 729-31, Justice Stevens wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">Although we do not believe that [the] statutory and regulatory language necessarily precludes \u201cgeneral\u201d federal requirements from ever pre-empting state requirements, or \u201cgeneral\u201d state requirements from ever being pre-empted, see Part VI, infra [which, as noted, Justice Breyer did not join], it is impossible to ignore its overarching concern that <em>pre-emption occur only where a particular state requirement threatens to interfere with a specific federal interest. </em>State requirements must be \u201cwith respect to\u201d medical devices and \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d federal requirements. State requirements must also relate \u201cto the safety or effectiveness of the device or to any other matter included in a requirement applicable to the device,\u201d and the regulations provide that state requirements of \u201cgeneral applicability\u201d are not pre-empted except where they have \u201cthe effect of establishing a substantive requirement for a specific device.\u201d Moreover, federal requirements must be \u201capplicable to the device\u201d in question, and, according to the regulations, pre-empt state law only if they are \u201cspecific counterpart regulations\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d to a \u201cparticular device.\u201d The statute and regulations, therefore, require a careful comparison between the allegedly pre-empting federal requirement and the allegedly pre-empted state requirement to determine whether they fall within the intended pre-emptive scope of the statute and regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at---, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2257-58, 135 <em>L.EcL2d </em>at 724-25 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">Moreover, the plurality joined by Justice Breyer noted that \u201cthe general state common-law requirements involved in <em>Medtronic </em>\u201cwere not specifically developed \u201cwith respect to\u201d medical devices\u2019 and were, therefore, not the kinds of requirements that Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>and the FDA feared would impede the ability of federal regulations to implant and enforce specific federal requirements,\u201d <em>id. </em>at -, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">We conclude from the foregoing analysis that Point V of the <em>Medtronic </em>plurality opinion embodies the prevailing approach governing preemption of design claims (with respect to a new as well as a \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d device to which the above-quoted language was addressed), manufacturing and labeling claims, and all other state-law claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Furthermore, recent cases have not read <em>Medtronic\u2019s </em>holding to be limited to \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d devices. The Missouri Supreme Court recently found no pre-emption of state law claims for negligence, strict liability, failure to warn, failure to obtain informed consent and fraud against another manufacturer of an intraocular lens. <em>See Connelly v. Iolab Corp., 927 </em>S.W.2d 848, 854 (Mo.1996). After analyzing the opinions in <em>Medtronic, </em>the Missouri Court concluded that \u201cnone of plaintiffs claims are preempted\u201d under either the plurality or concurring opinions. <em>Ibid. </em>See also Judge Brochin\u2019s thoughtful discussion of <em>Medtronic </em>in distinguishing between the analysis necessary to resolve preemption issues under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Act (FIFRA) and the MDA. <em>Lewis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>58, 682 A.2d 724 (App.Div.1996).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In sum, we find no bar to plaintiffs state-law claims on this record. Defendant AMO points to no element of any cause of action nor to any proofs offered in support of plaintiffs state-law claims which conflict with or are inconsistent with a requirement imposed by federal law or FDA regulation. In the absence of such a showing, there is no basis for the assertion of preemption as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">We agree with the reasoning and conclusion of the California Court of Appeals regarding the absence of federal preemption of negligence and strict liability defect and warranty claims related to the implantation of an IOL:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-8\">The negligence claim is not preempted for two reasons. First, as ORC [the manufacturer] acknowledges, it is subject to FDA regulations with respect to the functions and duties underlying Armstrong\u2019s claim (e.g., manufacturing, labeling). To the extent the negligence claim parallels federal requirements or is based on a violation of FDA regulations, it is not \u201cdifferent from, or in addition to\u201d the duties mandated by federal law [citing <em>Medtronic, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at---, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2255-66, 135 L.Ed.2d at 721-23]. Second, the state law requirements imposed by the negligence claim (e.g., the duty of a manufacturer to avoid foreseeable dangers in making a product or to inform users of potentially dangerous products of the risks involved) \u201cwere not specifically developed \u201cwith respect to\u2019 medical devices.\u201d [Citing <em>Medtronic, </em>\u2014\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2258,135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 725.] \u201cThese state requirements therefore escape pre-emption ... because their generality leaves them outside the category of requirements that \u00a7 360k envisioned to be \u201cwith respect to\u2019 specific devices____\u201d [Citing <em>Medtronic, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at 725-26.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-15\">As with Armstrong\u2019s negligence claim, her theory of strict liability as to a manufacturing defect is based on general principles of state tort law which were not specifically developed with respect to medical devices. Thus it is not preempted. [Citing <em>Medtronic, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at \u2014, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2258, 135 L.Ed.2d at 725-26].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Further, section 360k \u201cdoes not preempt a State or local requirement prohibiting the manufacture of adulterated ... devices\u201d unless the prohibition would establish \u201ca substantive requirement for a specific device\u201d which conflicts with a federal requirement. Armstrong\u2019s principal contention, as disclosed in the parties\u2019 briefs, is that OEC failed to follow the manufacturing protocol approved by the FDA, resulting in the manufacturing defect. Plainly, if the manufacturing defect was the result of an error ORG made when producing Orcolon for commercial use, and not the result of a defect inherent in the FDA-approved manufacturing protocol, Armstrong\u2019s claim will not impose a requirement on the manufacture of Orcolon that conflicts with any federal requirement. Indeed, the gist of Armstrong\u2019s claim is that ORC did not comply with federally imposed manufacturing requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">As the plurality opinion noted in <em>Medtronic: </em>\u201c[N]owhere in the materials relating to the [MDA\u2019s] history have we discovered a reference to a fear that product liability actions would hamper the development of medical devices.

Even if it may be necessary as a matter of Florida law to prove that those violations were the result of negligent conduct, or that they created an unreasonable hazard for users of the product, such additional elements of the state-law cause of action would make the state requirements narrower, not broader, than the federal requirement. While such a narrower requirement might be \u201cdifferent from\" the federal rules in a literal sense, such a difference would surely provide a strange reason for finding pre-emption of a state rule insofar as it duplicates the federal rule. The presence of a damages remedy does not amount to the additional or different \"requirement\" that is necessary under the statute; rather, it merely provides another reason for manufacturers to comply with identical existing \"requirements\" under federal law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at-, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2255, 135 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 722.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-16\"> With respect to preemption generally, <em>see Board of Trustees of Operating Eng\u2019rs Local 825 v.
