The July 26 order provided that \u201cdocuments previously produced by [defendant Sunshine Biscuits, Inc.] bearing Sunshine\u2019s production numbers [22-24] (a) are excluded from the protection of the attorney-client privilege, and (b) may be retained and used by [plaintiff National Utility Service (NUS) ] for any purpose which is permissible under the New Jersey Rules of Court and Rules of Evidence.\u201d The order also required Sunshine to \u201cproduce for <em>in camera </em>review by [the Law Division] the original unedited documents listed in Sunshine\u2019s \u2018privilege log,\u2019 \u201d and directed Sunshine \u201cto submit to discovery by NUS on the privilege issue____\u201d The September 27, 1996 order denied Sunshine\u2019s motion for reconsideration and stay and directed compliance with the July 26 order by October 4,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">We reverse and hold that a pre-litigation memorandum prepared by in-house counsel to defendant\u2019s Controller is neither discoverable nor subject to use by plaintiff, under the \u201ccrime-fraud\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege, merely,because it embodies advice inconsistent with a legal theory thereafter developed by litigation counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Plaintiff alleges that in 1980 it entered into a contract with defendant and, pursuant thereto, made energy audits and recommendations as a result of which defendant saved substantial energy costs and expenses. Plaintiff brought this action to recover fifty percent of those savings pursuant to the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">During discovery Sunshine delivered to plaintiff copies of documents including the so-called \u201cBarbieri memorandum,\u201d a three page written communication from Sunshine\u2019s in-house counsel to its corporate Controller (numbered 22 through 24 in discovery). The memorandum discusses the basis for plaintiffs claims against defendant under the contract and makes \u201crecommendations\u201d for corporate action, investigation of the work actually done by plaintiff and consideration of a \u201cbuyout\u201d of the contract. When defendant realized that the documents were included in the discovery presented, it requested the immediate return of the memorandum. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Plaintiff thereupon moved for an order permitting it to retain the memo and to use it in connection with the litigation. The motion resulted in the order of July 26, 1996. Reconsideration was denied on September 27, 1996. Although no <em>in camera </em>review of the documents in the \u201cprivilege log\u201d ever occurred, we are told that the \u201cBarbieri memorandum\u201d is the only document now in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Defendant contends that the memorandum, dated December 28, 1992, written approximately three years before the litigation commenced,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is privileged and not discoverable, whereas plaintiff insists that it cannot be subject to the attorney-client privilege because it embodies evidence of a fraud. The alleged fraud flows from the assertion in the fifth affirmative defense that there was \u201cno contract\u201d despite corporate counsel\u2019s apparent acknowledgment in the memorandum to defendant\u2019s Controller that defendant had undertaken a contractual obligation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fifth affirmative defense provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">[t]he relief sought in the Complaint is barred, either in whole or in part, as the defendant has no contractual obligation to and never entered into a contract with National Utility Service, Inc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The motion judge held that the attorney-client privilege did not apply because of the \u201ccrime fraud\u201d exception. He concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">I am satisfied that the defense view of the crime fraud exception is a stunted view, is a tunnel-vision view, and is one that is crabbed in the sense of looking only at what was happening at the time of the execution of the so-called Barbieri memorandum. I think that this case, as all cases, must be looked at as part of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>continuum, as part of a matrix of process. I am satisfied that in that matrix the Barbieri memorandum plays a role in the claim of fraud or deceit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-6\">Although it becomes fashionable to cite the cliche I\u2019m about to cite, I think it\u2019s applicable here. The surest way to misread a rule or a statute is to read it literally, and that is the way I approach Rule 504. Read literally and in that crabbed fashion, I think Sunshine Biscuits is probably correct, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the intent or spirit is.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-20, embodied in the Rules of Evidence as <em>N.J.R.E. </em>504:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">[C]ommunications between lawyer and his client in the course of that relationship and in professional confidence, are privileged, and a client has a privilege (a) to refuse to disclose any such communication, and (b) to prevent his lawyer from disclosing it.... The privilege shall be claimed by the lawyer, unless otherwise instructed by the client or his representative [<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">There is no dispute that because the Barbieri memorandum was written as part of the duties of in-house counsel who was retained to provide professional legal advice to the corporation, and the memorandum was prepared in furtherance thereof, it is subject to the attorney-client privilege unless an exception applies. <em>See generally United Jersey Bank v. Wolosoff, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>553, 560-63, 483 A.2d 821 (App.Div.1984); <em>see also Jadlowski v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>199, 215-17, 661 A.2d 814 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>326, 670 A.2d 1066 (1996); <em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7\u00a7 118-122 (Proposed Final Draft No. 1, March 29, 1996). Thus, the only issue before us is whether the memorandum is subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the \u201ccrime fraud\u201d exception. That exception \u201cencompasses a type of communication that is alien to the fundamental reasons that underlie the privilege.\u201d <em>Fellerman v. Bradley, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>498, 503, 493 A.2d 1239 (1985); <em>see also In re Nackson, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>527, 535, 555 A.2d 1101 (1989); <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The Supreme Court has instructed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">[i]n deciding whether the \u201ccrime or fraud\u201d exception applies, the relevant factor to consider is whether the client consulted with the attorney in order (1) to aid the client \u201cin the commission of any crime\u201d; (2) to enable the client \u201cto avoid any criminal investigation or proceeding pending at the time the advice was given\u201d; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">(3) to assist the client to \u201cavoid lawful process in any proceeding pending at the time the advice was given.\u201d Undoubtedly, it can be often a close question whether \u201cthe legal service was sought or obtained to aid the client in the planning or perpetration of a crime or a tort.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\"><em>[In re Nackson, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 535, 555 A.2d 1101 (internal citations omitted).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">The Court has interpreted the exception broadly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">Confederating with clients to allow court and counsel to labor under a misapprehension as to the true state of affairs; countenancing by silence the violation of a court order and aiding and abetting the continued contempt of another, are all frauds within the meaning of <em>Evidence Buie </em>26(2)(a) [now <em>N.J.B.E. </em>403(2)(a)]. There is no reason to believe that the use of the word \u201cfraud\u201d in that rule is to be limited to conventional notions of tortious frauds. Acts constituting fraud are as broad and as varied as the human mind can invent. Deception and deceit in any form universally connote fraud. Public policy demands that the \u201cfraud\u201d exception to the attorney-client privilege as used in <em>Evidence Buie </em>26 [now <em>N.J.B.E. </em>504] be given the broadest interpretation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\"><em>[Fellerman, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 493 A.2d 1239 (quoting <em>In re Callan, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 496, 300 A.2d 868, (Ch.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>103, 312 A.2d 881 (App.Div.1973), <em>rav\u2019d o.g., </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>401, 331 A.2d 612 (1975)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The <em>Fellerman </em>Court also noted \u201cthat it was plausible to class \u2018any use of legal process for a purpose other than a \u201clegitimate\u201d one\u2019 to be tortious\u201d and, therefore, subject to the exception. <em>Fellerman, supra, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>at 503, 493 A.2d 1239 (quoting G. Harzard, \u201cAn Historical Perspective on the Attorney-Client Privilege,\u201d 66 <em>Calif. L.Rev. </em>1061, 1064 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">In this case, the motion judge found that it was fraudulent for defendant to affirmatively defend the contract action by asserting that there was no contract with NUS after in-house counsel had previously indicated in a memorandum that defendant did enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>into a contract with plaintiff. In other words, the judge found that by arguing in its defense that Sunshine did not enter a contract with NUS it \u201clied\u201d to the court, and that evidence of the lie is contained in the Barbieri memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">In his memo, Mr. Barbieri, Sunshine\u2019s General Counsel, considered correspondence with plaintiff as well as the terms and scope of the contract. He further recommended that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAj\">[biased upon the results of the above, consider making an offer to buy out the remainder of the contract, employing the sum currently due from Kansas City Bakery as proceeds. The answers to the above questions may provide legal bases for avoiding parts of the contractual obligations (e.g. if Oakland and Columbus never communicated with NUS, the contract may not apply to either).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Defendant insists that the memo was written in good faith and embodied sound legal advice. Defendant also asserts that the fifth affirmative defense was developed as a result of a further review of the merits and study of the law of Delaware which it contends controls under choice of law principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">According to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">[the] defense has two components. First, the defendant asserts that it has no contractual obligation to NUS____ In its Response to Plaintiffs First Set of Interrogatories, Sunshine explained that Paul Marino, a NUS employee, admitted in a letter to Edward Goldman of American Brands, Inc., the former owner of Sunshine Biscuits, Inc. that Sunshine Biscuits \u201cno longer wished to receive any NUS recommendations and thereby terminated the agreement.\u201d ... Thus, Sunshine <em>had no contractual obligation </em>to plaintiff as recognized by plaintiffs own employee, Paul Marino.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Defendant thus asserts that if, in fact, there was no contract there could be no fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Defendant explains the second basis for the fifth affirmative defense, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-14\">NUS never entered into an agreement with this Sunshine Biscuits, Inc---Sunshine appropriately interposed the defense that it \u201cnever entered into\u201d a contract with NUS because <em>this </em>Sunshine did not do so____ [W]hile NUS may or may not ultimately carry its burden and demonstrate that \u201cNew Sunshine\u201d can potentially be held liable for Old Sunshine\u2019s contract from a successor liability perspective it will <em>not </em>be able to demonstrate that it \u201centered into a contract\u201d with New Sunshine. A review of Delaware corporate law as applied to the facts of this case supports this conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>The determination of New Sunshine\u2019s successor liability for any contract between Old Sunshine and NUS should be left for a timely and proper summary judgment on another day after discovery has been conducted. Bespectfully, it has nothing to do with the application of the crime fraud exception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">According to Sunshine, \u201c[b]y means of a Stock Sale Agreement dated February 8,1988, as amended by an Agreement dated April 15, 1988, defendant American Brands agreed to sell and GF Industries, Inc. (\u2018GFI\u2019) agreed to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Sunshine Biscuits, Inc.\" Sunshine relies on the Delaware Code, 8 <em>DelCode Ann. </em>\u00a7 259, as interpreted by its state courts, to argue that the new corporate entity as a matter of law entered into no agreement with plaintiff and cannot be responsible for its predecessor\u2019s contractual liability-</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The trial court has not addressed these legal and factual issues. It may be that they will ultimately turn out to be meritless and that sanctions may even be imposed. <em>See R. </em>1:4-8. But the initial reaction of in-house counsel cannot be deemed to bind the legal and factual contentions raised by the attorneys retained to defend the litigation. The defenses asserted by litigation counsel appear to be made in good faith, <em>see R. </em>1:4-8; <em>R. </em>4:5-3; <em>R. </em>4:5-4, and plaintiff has not made a sufficient showing to the contrary. \u201cThe burden of establishing the elements of the [\u2018crime fraud\u2019] exception is upon the person seeking to overcome the privilege.\u201d <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 132, cmt. a; <em>see also id. </em>at cmt. e. \u201cThe person seeking access to the communication ... must present a prima facie case for the exception\u201d to apply. <em>Id. </em>at cmt. f. \u201cThe showing must be made by evidence other than the contested communication itself.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Plaintiff has not sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">We thus conclude that the Barbieri memorandum, prepared over three years before the litigation, by in-house counsel laying out an approach to be taken with respect to resolving a contract dispute, and not suggesting the development of false information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>or facts, is not discoverable or subject to use by plaintiff as a communication in furtherance of a crime or fraud merely because trial counsel asserted an affirmative defense arguably inconsistent with the legal position embodied in the memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The orders under review are reversed, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\"> The plaintiff refers to the filing of its First Amended Complaint on February 8, 1996. It does not note when the original complaint was filed. Defendant suggests that the complaint was filed in the fall of 1995. In any event, plaintiff acknowledges that \"[ijssue was joined on February 20, 1996, when Sunshine filed its Answer,\u201d affirmative defenses and counterclaim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-10\"> The parties agree that the inadvertent disclosure during discovery does not constitute a waiver by the client of its privilege. <em>State v.
