(\u201cLIAAC\u201d) to review, the NLRB\u2019s June 14, 2016 Decision and Order determining that LIAAC violated Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. ,\u00a7 158(a)(1), by promulgating an unlawful confidentiality agreement and by terminating an employee for his refusal to sign the unlawful confidentiality agreement. Because an employer violates Section 8(a)(1) when it terminates an employee for refusing to . sign an unlawful employment document, we enforce the order of the NLRB and deny the cross-petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">The remaining issues on appeal are disposed of in a summary order filed this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">LIAAC is a not-for-profit, non-union organization that provides services for HIV/ AIDS prevention and treatment at its facility in Hauppauge, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">LIAAC hired Marcus Acosta in February 2014 to work as part of a mobile outreach team conducting surveys about substance abuse and mental health. A few months after he was hired, Acosta became a prevention specialist on the mobile outreach team focusing on populations with a high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">When Acosta was hired, LIAAC had him read and sign a Confidentiality Statement, as it did with all of its employees. The Confidentiality Statement comprised primarily four operative paragraphs and a remedy paragraph. The first two paragraphs required employees of LIAAC to maintain the confidentiality of information protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and by a New York law regarding HIV testing. The third paragraph \u201cstrictly prohibited\u201d-employees from disclosing information with respect to all \u201cnon-public information intended for internal purposes\u201d of LIAAG, including \u201cadministrative information such as salaries [and the] contents of employment contracts.\u201d App\u2019x at 125. The fourth paragraph prohibited employees from being \u201cinterviewed by any media source, or answering] any questions from any media source regarding their employment at LIAAC\u201d or \u201cthe workings and conditions of LIAAC\u201d without permission from LIAAC. App\u2019x at 125. The final paragraph instructed employees that \u201cany breach of confidentiality will result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension- or termination of employment and criminal prosecution.\u201d App\u2019x at 125,</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u2022 During 2014, Acosta struggled with time management and documentation of his activities. As a response to his difficulties, Acosta was provided with a time log in order to help him manage his-time better. Acosta did not appreciate having to fill in the time log and testified that he entered the ingredients of his lunch into his time log at one point \u201c80 percent to help [him]self\u201d with an eating disorder and \u201c20 percent\u201d to be \u201csnippy with [his] supervisor.\u201d App\u2019x at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">In November 2014, Acosta read a News-day article which reported that Gail Bar-ouh, the CEO of LIAAC, had misappropriated public funds. Specifically, the article reported that an investigation had concluded that Barouh had misappropriated cost-of-living adjustment (\u201cCOLA\u201d) benefits intended for LIAAC employees. The day the article was published, Acosta received a letter from Barouh at his desk which \u201cexplained what happened and said that LI-AAC ha[d] resolved all the issues and we\u2019r\u00e9 going to be moving forward.\u201d App\u2019x at 13. Along with the letter, Acosta also received a fundraising packet from LI-AAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">According to Acosta, the other employees at LIAAC were upset abo,ut the. article because .many people told him that they had worked for years without raises. As a result, Acosta asked his supervisors and the Director of Human Resources, Robert Nicoletti, how wages and raises worked .at LIAAC and how COLA funds, were used at LIAAC. Nicoletti instructed Acosta to \u201cjust focus on [his] work and nothing else.\u201d App\u2019x at 21. Acosta testified that he decided to do just that. .</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In February 2016, Acosta\u2019s head supervisor, Michele Keogh, wrote in a&gt;Supervision Meeting Summary that Acosta had been insubordinate and negative. Specifically, Keogh recounted, that Acosta had been tasked with giving- a presentation, which Acosta refused to do and announced at a team meeting that \u201che did not get paid enough to fulfill this task.\u201d App\u2019x at 129. Keogh identified this as insubordination. Keogh also wrote that Acosta was being negative based on his informing her that \u201cother staff members were voicing their dissatisfaction with regards to salary and work environment to him,\u201d but then refusing to \u201cdisclose names of the individuals who [we]re reporting to him their negative feelings.\u201d .App\u2019x at 129. Nonetheless, Keogh also wrote that Acosta \u201ctakes pride in his work\u201d notwithstanding his concerns about management, and. Acosta wrote on the report;that he wants to \u201cfocus on the work and developing professionally\u201d in the work that he does as a prevention specialist. App\u2019x at 130-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">In March 2015, LIAAG asked all employees to sign its Confidentiality Statement again. Acosta signed, but indicated that he did so under duress and identified certain portions of the Confidentiality Statement with which he disagreed, specifically the third paragraph\u2019s prohibition, on discussing wages and the fourth paragraph\u2019s prohibition on talking to the media.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">On March 20, 2015, Acosta met with his direct supervisor, Sophia Noel, and requested a raise. Acosta explained that he had spoken to other employees who had told him they received raises,' and' so he felt he could ask for a raise based on his year of working at LIAAC. Noel laughed when he asked for a raise, but she told him 'that he had made great improvements in time management and that she would let Keogh know about his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">On March 24, 2015, Acosta met with \u25a0 Noel again. She told him that he had improved and was doing well, and the two of them made plans' for future events in which Acosta would participate for LI-AAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Acosta\u2019s meeting with Noel was cut a few seconds short by a co-worker who told Acosta to go see Nicoletti for a meeting. Ray Ward, the Chief Program Officer for LIAAC, and another Human Resources employee were also present at the meeting. Nicoletti opened the meeting by telling Acosta that \u201cthis is a yes or no conversation, there\u2019s no room for discussion.\u201d App\u2019x at 31-32. Nicoletti then gave Acosta the Confidentiality Statement to sign a second time, and told Acosta to sign it or get fired. Acosta signed the statement, but indicated that he did so \u201cunder duress\u201d three times at the bottom of the sheet. App\u2019x at 124. Upon receiving the Confidentiality Statement with Acosta\u2019s notations, Nicoletti informed Acosta that \u201cyou just terminated yourself.\u201d App\u2019x at 32. Acosta asked for a copy of the Confidentiality Statement that he signed, but this was denied. Acosta then called the police thinking it might help him get a copy of his signed Confidentiality Statement, but when Nicoletti yelled at Acosta, Acosta told the police there was no emergency and he hung up the phone. Acosta then left LIAAC\u2019s building.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">II. Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On March 26, 2015, Acosta filed a charge against LIAAC with the NLRB. In his charge, Acosta alleged that LIAAC had \u201cunlawfully prohibited employees from talking about their wages, hours, terms[,] and conditions of employment\u201d and that LIAAC had \u201cdischarged [Acosta] because he asserted his Section 7 rights and because he engaged in protected concerted activities.\u201d App\u2019x at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On July 27, 2015, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) tried the case in Brooklyn, New York. The ALJ heard testimony from Acosta and from Ward on behalf of LIAAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">On August 26, 2015, the ALJ issued his decision. The ALJ first held that the Confidentiality Statement was \u201cfacially invalid\u201d because \u201can employer unlawfully intrudes into its employees\u2019 Section 7 rights when it prohibits employees, without justification, from discussing among themselves their wages and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d App\u2019x at 175. The ALJ then found that Acosta engaged in concerted activity with respect to wages at LIAAC by discussing wages and COLA increases with other employees, and by bringing these concerns to Noel, Keogh, and Nico-letti even though Acosta refused to identify those with whom he had been speaking. The ALJ also found that, even if Acosta were not engaged in concerted activity, his comments were protected because the Confidentiality Statement was facially invalid. The ALJ further held that LIAAC had not met its burden in proving that Acosta would have been discharged due to his poor work performance, and thus concluded that LIAAC\u2019s discharge of Acosta violated Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. The ALJ therefore required LIAAC to reinstate and compensate Acosta, to remove paragraphs three and four from the Confidentiality Statement, and to post an attached Notice to Employees in its facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Thereafter, both parties filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision. On June 14, 2016, after considering the parties\u2019 exceptions, the NLRB issued a decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s rulings, findings, and conclusions as modified. The NLRB agreed with the ALJ that LIAAC violated Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA by \u201cpromulgating and maintaining a confidentiality statement that employees would reasonably construe to prohibit them from discussing wages or other terms and conditions of employment with employees or nonemployees and the media.\u201d App\u2019x at 199. The NLRB also agreed with the ALJ that LIAAC violated Section 8(a)(1) by threatening to discharge and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>then discharging Acosta for refusing to agree to the unlawful confidentiality statement. The NLRB did not base its decision on a finding that Acosta engaged in concerted activity. The NLRB also adopted remedial provisions similar to those adopted by the ALJ and required LIAAC to post a Notice to Employees on its premises regarding LIAAC\u2019s employees\u2019 rights under the NLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The NLRB\u2019s application to enforce and LIAAC\u2019s cross-p\u00e9tition to review the NLRB\u2019s decision were timely filed on July 1, 2016 and August 10, 2016, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AHn\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">\u201cWe uphold the NLRB\u2019s findings of fact if supported by substantial evidence and the NLRB\u2019s legal determinations if not arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Cibao Meat Prods., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>547 F.3d 336, 339 (2d Cir. 2008). \u201c[Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>NLRB v. G&amp;T Terminal Packaging Co., Inc., </em>246 F.3d 103, 114 (2d Cir. 2001). \u201cThe substantial evidence standard requires us to review the record in its entirety, including the body of evidence opposed to the [NLRB\u2019s] view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). \u201cWe may not[, however,] displace the [NLRB\u2019s] choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though we would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before us de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). \u201cInstead, a reversal based upon a factual question will only be warranted if, after looking at the record as a whole, we are left with the impression that no rational trier of fact could reach the conclusion drawn by the\u201d NLRB.. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">\u201cOur review [of the NLRB\u2019s legal conclusions] is [also] deferential: This [C]ourt reviews the [NLRB\u2019s] legal conclusions to ensure they have a reasonable basis in law. In so doing, we afford the [NLRB] a degree of legal leeway.\u201d <em>Cibao Meat Prods., </em>547 F.3d at 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">II. Acosta\u2019s Termination in Violation of Section 8(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">LIAAC appeals the NLRB\u2019s decision with respect to Acosta\u2019s termination primarily because Acosta did not engage in \u201cconcerted activity\u201d under Section 7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157, and therefore his termination was not in violation of Section 8(a)(1), and, secondarily, because Acosta was terminated because of his poor work performance and not his refusal to sign the Confidentiality Statement. The NLRB, however, affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision because it determined that Acosta had been terminated based on his refusal to sign the Confidentiality Statement and because it held that terminating Acosta for his refusal to sign an unlawful confidentiality agreement violated Section 8(a)(1) independent of any need for concerted activity. Thus, we must first determine whether substantial evidence supports the factual finding that Acosta was terminated for his refusal to sign, and then we must determine whether a concerted activity is legally necessary to find a violation of Section 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">We hold that substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s finding that Acosta was terminated because of his refusal to sign the Confidentiality Statement. Acosta\u2019s testimony that Nicoletti told him to \u201csign [the Confidentiality Statement] or get fired\u201d during the meeting on March 24, 2015 is uncontroverted. App\u2019x at 32. In addition, both Acosta and LIAAC\u2019s own witness testified that Nicoletti told Acosta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>that he \u201cjust terminated his own employment\u201d based on his writing \u201cunder duress\u201d on the Confidentiality Statement when he signed it on March 24, 2015. App\u2019x at 32, 88. No evidence has been presented that refutes'this statement of events.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Further, LIAAC\u2019s counter-story that Acosta was fired for his poor performance is not supported by the evidence. Although there is evidence in the record that Acosta had difficulty with time management in 2014, that he was considered for termination in November 2014, and that there was an issue with Acosta refusing to do a presentation at work in early 2015, the more recent evidence in the record indicates that Acosta was improving. LIAAC presented no evidence contradicting Acosta\u2019s testimony that Noel told him four days before he was fired that he had made \u201ca big improvement since November.\u201d App\u2019x at 30. LIAAC also did not respond to Acosta\u2019s testimony that, on the day of his firing, he met with Noel in order to discuss future events that Acosta would be participating in at LIAAC, thus suggesting that Noel did not believe Acosta would be fired later that day based on his performance. Indeed, Acosta testified that at that meeting, which was immediately before he was terminated, Noel again told him that he had improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Accordingly, we hold that substantial evidence supports the NLRB\u2019s finding that Acosta was terminated because of his refusal to sign the Confidentiality Statement. Thus, we must next determine whether the NLRB was correct as a legal matter that LIAAC violated Section 8(a)(1) when it terminated Acosta for his refusal to sign an unlawful confidentiality agreement without requiring proof of concerted activity-</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u201cThe [NLRB] has long adhered to and applied the principle that discipline imposed pursuant to an unlawfully over-broad rule is unlawful.\u201d <em>The Cont'l Grp., Inc., </em>357 N.L.R.B. 409, 410 (2011). This is called the <em>Double Eagle </em>rule after <em>Double Eagle Hotel &amp; Casino, </em>341 N.L.R.B. 112 (2004). <em>See The Conti Grp., Inc., </em>357 N.L.R.B. at 410. One of the central concerns animating the <em>Double Eagle </em>rule is that \u201cthe mere maintenance of an over-broad rule tends to inhibit employees who are considering engaging in legally protected activities by convincing them to refrain from doing so rather than risk discipline.\u201d Id<em>. </em>at 411. Thus, \u201c[a]n employer is not free to evade liability through the device of utilizing a rule prohibiting activity protected by Section 7 of the [NLRA] and by then basing its discipline\u2019 on the fact that the employee has violated the rule, thereby being insubordinate.\u201d <em>Kolkka Tables &amp; Finnish-Am. Saunas, </em>335 N.L.R.B. 844, 849 (2001). In other words, \u201can employer may not discharge an employee for refusing to comply with an unlawful order prohibiting protected activity.\u201d <em>Quantum Elec., Inc., </em>341 N.L.R.B. 1270, 1280-81 (2004). The rule that has emerged, therefore, is \u201cthat an employer may not take coercive action against an employee .,. for refusing to comply with a policy that .itself deters protected activity\u201d in violation of Section 8(a)(1). <em>NLRB v. Air Contact Transp. Inc., </em>403 F.3d 206, 214 (4th Cir. 2005). This rule holds true for employee refusals to sign unlawful documents as a condition of employment, including, for example, unlawful arbitration agreements. <em>See Everglades College, Inc., </em>363 N.L.R.B. No. 73, at *1, *3 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">We hold that the NLRB was correct in deciding that an employer violates Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1), when an employer terminates an employee for refusing to agree to an unlawful confidentiality agreement. An employer may not require even one individual employee to agree to abide by unlawful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>restrictions as a condition of employment. That the employees have not yet organized in order to protest the unlawful nature of the restriction at issue does not make it any less unlawful. The contrary rule urged by LIAAC, that an employee can be required to comply with an unlawful policy and the employee is only protected from the unlawful policy if he or she actively organizes with other employees against it, is illogical and untenable. An unchallenged unlawful document can cause the chilling effect that Section 8(a)(1) seeks to prevent just as much as one that has been challenged by concerted action. <em>See NLRB v. Vanguard Tours, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 62, 67 (2d Cir. 1992). We see no reason to judge the effect of an unlawful requirement on an employee\u2019s termination based solely on whether the employee acted in concert or alone. Instead, we judge the effect of the requirement on an employee\u2019s termination based on the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">Here, the Confidentiality Statement was unlawful and Acosta was terminated by LIAAC for refusing to sign the unlawful Confidentiality 'Statement. This was a violation of Section 8(a)(1). Accordingly, finding neither legal nor factual error, we affirm the decision of the NLRB that Acosta was terminated by LIAAC in violation of Section 8(a)(1) for refusing to sign the unlawful Confidentiality Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">For the reasons set forth above and in the accompanying summary order, we affirm the judgment of the NLRB.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
