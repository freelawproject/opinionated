The Supreme Court vacated and remanded our earlier opinion, <em>Bishop v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., </em>823 F.3d 35 (2d Cir. 2016), in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1989, 195 L.Ed.2d 348 (2016). <em>See Bishop v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1067, 197 L.Ed.2d 169 (2017). Because <em>Escobar </em>set out a materiality standard for FCA claims that has not been applied in the present case, we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion and <em>Escobar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">The present case began in 2011, when Robert Kraus and Paul Bishop (together, \u201cthe relators\u201d) brought a <em>qui tarn </em>action under the FCA on behalf of the United States against Wells Fargo &amp; Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (together, \u201cWells Fargo\u201d). The relators claimed that Wells Fargo, along with Wachovia Bank and World Savings Bank, which later merged into Wells Fargo, falsely certified their compliance with banking laws in order to borrow money at favorable rates from the Federal Reserve System. The government declined to intervene, and the district court (Cogan, <em>J.) </em>dismissed the relators\u2019 complaint in its entirety. <em>See United States ex rel. Kraus v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 117 </em>F.Supp.3d 215 (E.D.N.Y. 2015). We affirmed. <em>Bishop, </em>823 F.3d at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">When evaluating the relators\u2019 claims, our decision and that of the district court relied on <em>Mikes v. Straus, </em>274 F.3d 687 (2d Cir. 2001), for two points in particular. First, we relied on Mikes\u2019s holding that \u201cimplied false certification is appropriately applied only when the underlying statute or regulation upon which the plaintiff relies <em>expressly </em>states the provider must comply in order to be paid.\u201d <em>Mikes, </em>274 F.3d at 700. We refer to this as Mikes\u2019s express-designation requirement. Second, we relied on Mikes\u2019s holding that \u201c[a]n expressly false claim is ... a claim that falsely certifies compliance with a <em>particular </em>statute, regulation or contractual term, where compliance is a prerequisite to payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 698 (emphasis added). We refer to this as <em>Mikes\u2019 </em>s particularity requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">These two <em>Mikes </em>requirements\u2014the express-designation requirement for implied false certification claims and the particularity requirement for express false certification claims\u2014did not survive <em>Escobar. </em>First, the <em>Escobar </em>Court directly abrogated Mikes\u2019s express-designation requirement, holding that \u201c[a] statement that misleadingly omits critical facts is a misrepresentation irrespective of whether the other party has expressly signaled the importance of the qualifying information.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 2001; <em>see id. </em>at 1999 (citing <em>Mikes </em>as limiting the implied false certification theory through an express-designation requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">Second, although <em>Escobar </em>was an implied false certification case, it also abrogated <em>Mikes\u2019s </em>particularity requirement for express false certification claims. <em>See Doscher v. Sea Port Grp. Sec., LLC, </em>832 F.3d 372, 378 (2d Cir. 2016) (explaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>that a panel of this Court may overrule a precedent when \u201can intervening Supreme Court decision casts doubt on the prior ruling\u201d). The <em>Escobar </em>Court indicated that limitations on liability under the FCA must be grounded in the text of the FCA, including the \u201cwell-settled meaning[s] of common-law terms [the FCA] uses\u201d but does not expressly define. <em>Escobar, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1999. We detect no textual support in the FCA for <em>Mikes\u2019s </em>particularity requirement. <em>See </em>31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3729-33. In addition, the common law does not limit fraud claims in a way that would support <em>Mikes\u2019s </em>particularity requirement. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 525 cmt. b, p. 56 (1977) (defining \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d to include \u201cnot only words spoken or written but also any other conduct that amounts to an assertion not in accordance with the truth,\u201d without any particularity requirement).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <em>Escobar </em>Court also explained that the FCA addresses the concerns animating <em>Mikes\u2019s </em>particularity requirement in other ways: \u201cInstead of adopting a circumscribed view of what it means for a claim to be false or fraudulent, concerns about fair notice and open-ended liability can be effectively addressed through strict enforcement of the [FCA] \u2019s materiality and scienter requirements.\u201d 136 S.Ct. at 2002 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). In light of these statements from the Supreme Court, <em>Mikes\u2019s </em>particularity requirement cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In place of <em>Mikes\u2019s </em>requirements, the <em>Escobar </em>Court set out a \u201cfamiliar and rigorous\u201d materiality standard. <em>Id. </em>at 2004 n.6. \u201c[A] misrepresentation about compliance with a statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement must be material to the Government\u2019s payment decision in order to be actionable under the [FCA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2002, In general, \u201cmateriality looks to the effect on the likely or actual behavior of the recipient of the alleged misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically in the FCA context,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-8\">proof of materiality can include, but is not necessarily limited to, evidence that the defendant knows that the Government consistently refuses to pay claims in the mine run of cases based on noncompliance with the particular statutory, regulatory, or contractual requirement. Conversely, if the Government pays a particular claim in full despite its actual knowledge that certain requirements were violated, that is very strong evidence that those requirements are not material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 2003-04. The <em>Escobar </em>Court admonished that \u201cMateriality ... cannot be found where noncompliance is minor or insubstantial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">The materiality standard set out in <em>Es-cobar </em>has not been applied in the present case. We remand for the district court to determine, in the first instance, whether the relators have adequately alleged the materiality of the defendants\u2019 alleged misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b131-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court\u2019s dismissal of the rela-tors\u2019 complaint and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\">. <em>Mikes's </em>particularity requirement also cannot be derived from <em>Escobar's </em>materiality standard. As the <em>Escobar </em>Court explained, \u201cmateriality cannot rest on \u2018a single fact or occurrence as always determinative.\u2019 \u201d 136 S.Ct. at 2001 (quoting <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, </em>563 U.S. 27, 39, 131 S.Ct. 1309, 179 L.Ed.2d 398 (2011)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
