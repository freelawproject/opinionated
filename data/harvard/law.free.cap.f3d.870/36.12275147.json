She filed this lawsuit not against the cadet, but against two superior officers, Lieutenant General Franklin Lee Hagenbeck and Brigadier General William E. Rapp, in their personal capacities. Lieutenant General Hagenbeck was Superintendent of West Point from approximately July 2006 to July 2010, and in that role he chaired the Sexual Assault Review Board, which is the \u201cprimary means of oversight\u201d of the sexual assault prevention and response program at West Point. Joint App\u2019x 12. Brigadier General Rapp was Commandant of Cadets at West Point from 2009 to 2011 and was in charge of the administration and training of cadets. Doe alleges, in substance, that Lieutenant General Ha-genbeck and Brigadier General Rapp \u201cperpetrat[ed] a sexually aggressive culture\u201d at West Point that \u201cdiscriminated against female cadets,\u201d \u201cput female cadets at risk of violent harm,\u201d and resulted, <em>inter alia, </em>in her sexual assault. <em>Id. </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">In 2013, Doe filed suit against the United States, Lieutenant General Hagenbeck, and Brigadier General Rapp. She pleaded four causes of action, but the district court dismissed all but one: a claim against Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp brought pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), on the basis of their alleged violation of equal protection rights protected by the Fifth Amendment. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the district court erred in permitting this <em>Bivens </em>claim to proceed. We therefore REVERSE the order of the district court as to this claim and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">I, Factual Allegations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">Doe, who graduated from high school in 2008, received an offer of admission to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>West Point during her senior year, which she accepted. As a West Point cadet, Doe was a member of the Army. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3075(b)(2). The expectation upon enrollment was that, following her military training and education at West Point\u2014 which, together with room and board, Doe received without charge\u2014she would serve at least five years of active duty. The West Point curriculum, as Doe alleges in her Amended Complaint, \u201cis designed to train \u2018officer-leaders of character to serve the Army and the Nation.\u2019\u201d Joint App\u2019x 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Upon arrival at West Point, Doe, who was one of about 200 women among the approximately 1,300 cadets in her class, alleges that she encountered what she describes as a \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cmisogynistic culture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14, 15. Cadets, for example, sang sexually explicit and offensive chants while marching on campus, \u201cin view and earshot of faculty and administrators.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16. Doe contends that she \u201cobserved her cadet classmates making misogynistic and sexually aggressive comments on a regular basis,\u201d while \u201c[t]he West Point administration frequently ignored and sometimes condoned these comments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15. Doe does not allege that Lieutenant General Hagenbeck or Brigadier General Rapp engaged in any such conduct, but she does contend that they \u201ccreated\u201d the culture there, which \u201cmarginalized\u201d Doe and other female cadets and \u201ccaused them to be subjected to routine harassment, [to]' suffer emotional distress and other harms, and [to] be pressured to conform to male norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Doe also maintains that West Point\u2019s training on sexual assault and harassment was inadequate \u201cand did little to combat the overwhelmingly misogynistic culture of the school.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In the early morning of May 9, 2010, during her second year at West Point, Doe alleges that she was raped by a fellow cadet with whom she had gone walking after hours. In particular, Doe asserts that after taking a prescribed sedative as she was preparing for bed, she agreed at about 1:00 a.m. to leave her dormitory with this cadet (identified by Doe in her Amended Complaint only as \u201cMr. Smith\u201d (\u201cSmith\u201d)) in violation of West Point rules. Doe alleges that she accepted only a few sips of alcohol from Smith but that, as a result of the combined effects of the sedative and the alcohol, she \u201cbegan to lose awareness of her surroundings and consciousness of what she was doing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. Doe contends that Smith \u201cwas aware that [she] had lost consciousness and took advantage,\u201d attacking her and having \u201cforcible, non-consensual intercourse with her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>She also maintains that she does not remember the details of the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">Doe sought care from West Point\u2019s cadet health clinic the next day, which provided her with emergency contraception and, on a subsequent visit on or about May 11, tested her for sexually-transmitted diseases. Although the treating nurse allegedly informed Doe that she had signs of vaginal tearing, and the medical record indicates Doe reported that she \u201cwas sexually assaulted by a friend,\u201d Doe states that the clinic \u201cdid not perform any forensic collection or preservation of evidence of the sexual assault.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. During a regular appointment with her psychiatrist that day (a psychiatrist Doe began consulting, she alleges, because of the significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>stress she suffered due to West Point\u2019s oppressive atmosphere), Doe reported \u201cnonconsensual sexual relations with a friend,\u201d and was referred to West Point\u2019s Sexual Assault Response Counselor, Major Maria Burger, <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Doe met only once with Major Burger. During that meeting, the major explained to Doe that she could file either an \u201cunrestricted\u201d or a \u201crestricted\u201d report about the incident. <em>Id.- </em>An unrestricted report would have included both Doe\u2019s and her alleged assailant\u2019s names and would have been given to commanders for potential disciplinary action. A restricted report would preserve their anonymity, but would not result in a referral. Doe filed a restricted report. She alleges in her Amended Complaint that she feared reputational harm or even retaliation from other cadets if she\u2019 filed an unrestricted report. She also worried that she would be punished for having been out after hours and for consuming alcohol with her alleged assailant, and that an unrestricted report would damage her career prospects because \u201c[i]t was common knowledge among the cadets that successful women in the military did not report incidents of sexual assault.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Doe contends that in the aftermath of the sexual assault, her anxiety grew intolerable, Doe informed West Point that she would resign, and on August 13, 2010, she was honorably discharged. Doe thereafter enrolled in a civilian college from which she earned a degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">II. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">On April 26, 2013, Doe filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Heller-stein, J.)<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On September 4, 2013, she filed an Amended Complaint. Therein, Doe pleaded four independent causes of action: (1) a <em>Bivens </em>claim based on an alleged Fifth Amendment due process violation against Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp; (2) a <em>Bivens </em>claim premised on an alleged Fifth Amendment equal protection .violation against Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp; (3) a claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under 28 U.S.C, \u00a7 1346(a)(2) (the \u201cLittle Tucker Act\u201d) against the United States; and (4) a Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671-2680, claim against the United States alleging negligent supervision, negligent training, negligence, negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>gent infliction of emotional distress, and abuse of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">On September 20, 2013, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Amended Complaint, which Doe' opposed. On April 13, 2015, the district court issued an opinion and order granting in part and denying in part defendants\u2019 motion: The district court granted defendants\u2019 motion as to the two claims against the United States: the Little Tucker Act claim and the FTCA claim. The district court also dismissed Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim asserting a violation of her due process rights; These claims are not at issue in this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">The district court denied the motion to dismiss as to the <em>Bivens </em>claim in which Doe asserted that Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp violated her equal protection rights. The district court acknowledged that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is not available \u201cwhen \u2018special factors counselling hesitation\u2019 are present,\u201d <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 298, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983) (quoting <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 396, 91 S.Ct. 1999). It recognized that absent Congressional authorization for a money damages claim, \u201c[t]he need to insulate the military\u2019s disciplinary structure from judicial inquiry\u201d constitutes a special factor. <em>Doe v. Hagenbeck, </em>98 F.Supp.3d 672, 684 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Further, the court acknowledged the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction, in <em>United States v. Stanley, </em>that in the military context, _ the special factors requiring abstention \u201cextend [even] beyond the situation in which an officer-subordinate relationship exists, and require abstention in the inferring of <em>Bivens </em>actions as extensive as the exception to the FTCA\u201d established in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 683-84, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987). In the district court\u2019s view, however, \u201cthe primary reason for exercising judicial restraint with cases concerning the' military is \u2018the need to' preserve the military disciplinary structure and prevent judicial involvement in sensitive military matters.\u2019 \u201d <em>Doe, </em>98 F.Supp.3d at 688 (quoting <em>Wake v. United States, </em>89 F.3d 53, 57 (2d Cir. 1996)). The district' court concluded that Doe\u2019s claim, at least at the motion to dismiss stage, did not implicate such concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Following the district- court\u2019s opinion, Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp filed a notice of interlocutory appeal and moved for a stay pending the appeal. In response, Doe argued that any appeal should be pursued in the Federal Circuit instead of in the Second Circuit. The district court granted the stay until August' 7, 2015, \u201cand such further period as the U.S. Court of Appeals shall determine.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 9. The district court also \u201cnote[d] Plaintiffs position that any appeal should be pursued in the Federal Circuit[] instead of the Second Circuit\u201d and \u201cle[ft] that determination for the appellate courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A panel of this Court thereafter granted defendants\u2019 motion to stay the proceedings before the district court and denied Doe\u2019s motion to transfer venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b65-11\">Doe\u2019s \u00e9qual protection claim is based on the proposition that Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp, her superior officers at the time, \u201cknowingly and intentionally created , and enforced a policy and practice\u201d at West Point that \u201cdiscriminated against female cadets,\u201d \u201ctolerated attacks against [them] and discouraged reporting,\u201d and promoted a'\u201csexually aggressive culture\u201d there that caused Doe to suffer, <em>inter alia, </em>a sexual assault. Joint App\u2019x 29. The district court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>claim, concluding it should be permitted to proceed \u201cunless it is evident from the complaint, or shown by an answer and subsequent proofs, that military discipline or its command structure is compromised.\u201d <em>Doe, </em>98 F.Supp.3d at 689. We review the district court\u2019s determination <em>de novo. Warney v. Monroe Cty., </em>587 F.3d 113, 120 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to dismiss, we assume that the allegations in Doe\u2019s Amended Complaint are. true and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in her favor. <em>Starr Int\u2019l Co. v. Fed. Reserve Bank, </em>742 F.3d 37, 40 (2d Cir. 2014). Assuming their truth, Doe\u2019s allegations of harassment and abuse are no credit to West Point, an institution founded, as Doe alleges, \u201cto train \u2018officer-leaders of character to serve the Army and the Nation.\u2019 \u201d Joint App\u2019x 13. But this neither does nor should end the judicial inquiry into whether Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Doe seeks to hold her superior officers personally liable for money damages in connection with their decisions regarding the training, supervision, discipline, education, and command of service personnel at West Point, an officer training school and military base. But Congress, \u201cthe constitutionally authorized source of authority over the military system of justice, has not provided a damages remedy\u201d for the constitutional claim that Doe asserts. <em>Chappell, </em>462 U.S. at 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362. The Supreme Court, citing the \u201cinescapable demands of military discipline ... [that] cannot be taught on battlefields,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 300, 103 S.Ct. 2362, has held, unanimously, that absent Congressional authorization, \u201cit would be inappropriate [for courts] to provide enlisted military personnel a <em>Bivens-type </em>remedy against their superior officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362; <em>see also id</em>. at 305, 103 S.Ct. 2362 (holding that \u201cenlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations\u201d). We conclude that <em>Chappell </em>and its progeny are dispositive of Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim and, accordingly, that the district court erred in determining that Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">We start with <em>Bivens </em>itself. In <em>Bivens, </em>the Supreme Court permitted the plaintiff, who alleged that he had been subjected to an unlawful, warrant-less search of his home and to an unlawful arrest, to proceed with a Fourth Amendment damages claim against allegedly errant federal law enforcement agents, despite the fact that Congress had not provided for such a remedy. 403 U.S. at 389, 395-97, 91 S.Ct. 1999. Although the <em>Bivens </em>Court permitted this damages claim to proceed, it signaled, as the Court has repeatedly cautioned since, that \u201csuch a remedy will not be available when \u2018special factors counselling hesitation\u2019 are present.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Chappell, </em>462 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>at 298, 103 S.Ct. 2362 (quoting <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 396, 91 S.Ct. 1999). The Court has since made clear that it is \u201creluctant to extend <em>Bivens </em>liability \u2018to any new context or new category of defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>656 U.S. 662, 675, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting <em>Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, </em>534 U.S. 61, 68, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001)). In the forty-six years since <em>Bivens </em>was decided, the Supreme Court has extended the precedent\u2019s reach only twice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and it has otherwise consistently declined to broaden <em>Bivens </em>to permit new claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Ziglar v. Abbasi, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 137 S.Ct. 1843, 1857, 198 L.Ed.2d 290 (2017) (observing that \u201cthe Court has made clear that expanding the <em>Bivens </em>remedy is now a \u2018disfavored\u2019 judicial activity,\u201d and collecting cases in which the Supreme Court has refused to do so (quoting <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 675, 129 S.Ct. 1937)). Indeed, noting that \u201cit is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles for a court to determine that it has the authority,\u201d in effect, \u201cto create and enforce a cause of action for [money] damages against federal officials,\u201d the Court only recently observed that \u201cit is possible that the analysis in the Court\u2019s three <em>Bivens </em>cases might have been different if they were decided today.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1856.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s separation-of-powers concern with implied causes of action under the Constitution, present in all cases in which plaintiffs have sought to extend <em>Bivens\u2019s </em>reach, is particularly acute in the military context. In <em>Chappell, </em>the Supreme Court held that special factors counselled against permitting the plaintiffs\u2014enlisted Navy sailors who alleged that superior officers had discriminated against them on the basis of race\u2014to maintain <em>Bivens </em>money damage claims. 462 U.S. at 297, 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362. Referencing the \u201ccenturies of experience\u201d reflected in the military\u2019s \u201chierarchical structure of discipline and obedience to command,\u201d a structure \u201cwholly different from civilian patterns,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 300, 103 S.Ct. 2362, the Court concluded that civilian courts, not responsible for the lives of soldiers and \u201cill-equipped to determine the impact upon discipline\u201d of their intrusions, <em>id. </em>at 305, 3.03 S.Ct. 2362 (quoting Earl Warren, <em>The Bill of Rights and the Military, </em>37 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 181, 187 (1962)), must \u201chesitate long\u201d before entertaining suits which ask courts to \u201ctamper with the established relationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 300, 103 S.Ct. 2362. Congress, the Court unanimously said, has \u201cplenary control over rights, duties, and responsibilities in the framework of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>[military [establishment, including regulations, procedures and remedies related to military discipline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 103 S.Ct. 2362. In the absence of Congressional action, the-Court, concluded, \u201cenlisted military personnel may not maintain a suit to recover damages from, a superior officer for alleged constitutional violations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 103 S.Ct. 2362.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\">The Supreme Court was, if anything, even more emphatic in <em>Stanley. </em>The Court ruled there that the plaintiff\u2014a former soldier alleging that the Army had secretly given him, doses of LSD to study the drug\u2019s effects\u2014could not maintain a <em>Bivens </em>action, even though at least some of the defendants in the case were not, Stanley\u2019s superior military officers (thus not directly implicating <em>Chappell\u2019s </em>chain-of-command concerns) and \u201cmay well have been civilian personnel.\u201d 483 U.S. at 679, 107 S.Ct. 3054; <em>see. id. </em>at 671, 680-84, 107 S.Ct. 3054. Citing by way of analogy to its decision in <em>Feres, </em>which established that \u201cthe Government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service,\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153, the <em>Stanley </em>Court explained that there is no \u201creason why [its] judgment in the <em>Bivens </em>context should be any less protective of military concerns than it has been with respect to FTCA suits, where [it] adopted [the] \u2018incident to service\u2019 rule,\u201d 483 U.S. at 681, 107 S.Ct. 3054. The Court thus concluded\u2014in sweeping language\u2014that in the military context, even where <em>no </em>\u201cofficer-subordinate relationship exists,\u201d the reach of the special factors counselling \u201cabstention in the inferring of <em>Bivens </em>actions\u201d is \u201cas extensive as th\u00e9 exception to the FTC\u00c1 established by <em>Feres.\u201d Id. </em>at 683-84, 107 S.Ct. 3054. Accordingly, pursuant to the incident-to-service rule, \u201cno <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available for injuries that \u2018arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684, 107 S.Ct. 3054 (quoting <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">This Supreme Court precedent frames our inquiry and leads ineluctably to the conclusion that Doe cannot maintain her <em>Bivens </em>claim. Doe was a member of the military at the time the events giving rise to her claim occurred, and the claim concerns superior officers.

'</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">Here, in considering whether Doe\u2019s injuries occurred \u201cincident to service,\u201d we examine the specific factual allegations that underlie her equal protection claim,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Klay v. Panetta, </em>758 F.3d 369, 375 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (noting that the incident-to-service rule bars <em>Bivens </em>claims when litigating \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s theory of the ease\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>would, in effect, \u201crequire military leaders to defend their professional management choices\u201d). The allegations in Doe\u2019s Amended Complaint do not merely invite, but require a most wide-ranging inquiry into the commands of Lieutenant General Ha-genbeck and Brigadier General Rapp. Specifically, as they relate to these defendants\u2019 conduct, Doe\u2019s allegations center on the implementation and supervision of allegedly inadequate and harmful training and education programs relating to sexual assault and harassment; on the alleged failure to provide properly both for the report and investigation of sexual assault claims, and for the support of cadets who are assaulted; on the alleged lack of sufficient numbers of female faculty and administrators at West Point and on the failure to recruit female cadets; on the allegedly inadequate punishment meted out not only to perpetrators of sexual violence but also to those who engage in misogynistic chants, slurs and comments; and, most broadly, on the assertedly culpable tolerance of a hostile culture toward women at West Point. Adjudicating such a money damages claim would require a civilian court to engage in searching fact-finding about Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp\u2019s \u201cbasic choices about the discipline, supervision, and control\u201d of the cadets that they were responsible for training as future officers. <em>Shearer, </em>473 U.S. at 58, 105 S.Ct. 3039. In such circumstances, we conclude that <em>Chappell </em>and <em>Stanley </em>squarely foreclose Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">This conclusion, we note, is consistent with the recent decisions of at least two other circuits. The D.C. Circuit rejected as \u201cpatently deficient\u201d a <em>Bivens </em>claim pressed by current and former sailors and Marines who alleged they were the victims of sexual assault or harassment resulting from a military culture attributable to their superiors: \u201cIf adjudicating the case would require military leaders to defend their professional management choices\u2014 \u2018to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions\u2019\u2014then the claim is barred by the \u2018incident to service\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Klay, </em>758 F.3d at 370, 375 (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Shearer, </em>473 U.S. at 58, 105 S.Ct. 3039). The Fourth Circuit, addressing a similar claim, was equally clear: <em>\u201cBivens </em>suits are never permitted for constitutional violations arising from military service, no matter how severe the injury or how egregious the rights infringement.\u201d <em>Cioca v. Rumsfeld, </em>720 F.3d 505, 512 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting Erwin Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction 621-22 (5th ed. 2007)). This result, the Fourth Circuit said, implies no tolerance for the misconduct alleged in a plaintiffs pleading, but rather reflects \u201cthe judicial deference to Congress and the Executive Branch in matters of military oversight required by the Constitution and our fidelity to the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent refusal to create new implied causes of action in this context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 518; <em>see also id. </em>at 514 (noting that \u201cthe <em>Chappell, Stanley, Feres </em>and <em>Shearer </em>precedents mandate that courts not permit a <em>Bivens </em>action that challenges military decisionmaking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Doe argues, relying principally on <em>United States v. Virginia (VMI), </em>518 U.S. 515, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996), that the failure to afford her a <em>Bivens </em>claim against Lieutenant General Hagen-beck and Brigadier General Rapp \u201ccontradict[s] <em>VMI,\u201d </em>Doe\u2019s Br. at 15, specifically the Supreme Court\u2019s merits determination therein that the State of Virginia could not preclude women from attending the Virginia Military Institute, a public college that styles itself as providing a military edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>cation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>VMI, </em>518 U.S. at 519, 116 S.Ct. 2264. But this argument misses the point. Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp do not seek dismissal based on the scope of equal protection guarantees\u2014a subject to which <em>VMI </em>could be pertinent. Instead, they invoke binding Supreme Court precedent standing for the proposition that whatever the scope of the particular constitutional <em>rights </em>at issue, the <em>remedy </em>of money damages is unavailable to members of the armed services for violations of those rights where Congress has not acted and the incident-to-service rule is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><em>Chappell </em>itself involved an equal protection claim by African American enlisted personnel who alleged that their superior officers \u201cfailed to assign them desirable duties, threatened them, gave them low performance evaluations, and imposed penalties of unusual severity,\u201d all on account of their race. 462 U.S. at 297, 103 S.Ct. 2362; <em>see Wallace v. Chappell, </em>661 F.2d 729, 730 (9th Cir. 1981). Despite the gravity of these allegations, and with no disparagement of the right at stake, the Court, noting that Congress \u201chas established a comprehensive internal system of justice to regulate military life\u201d and \u201chas not provided a damages remedy for claims by military personnel that constitutional rights have been violated by superior officers,\u201d determined that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy was unavailable. <em>Id. </em>at 302-04, 103 S.Ct. 2362. As the Court unanimously recognized, \u201c[jjudges are not given the task of running the Army. The responsibility for setting up channels through which ... grievances can be considered and fairly settled rests upon the Congress and upon the President of the United States and his subordinates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 103 S.Ct. 2362 (second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Orloff v. Willoughby, </em>345 U.S. 83, 93-94, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842 (1953)). <em>VMI </em>is simply not germane to the remedial inquiry mandated by <em>Chappell, Stanley, </em>and other <em>Bivens </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Doe next contends, and the dissent agrees, that pursuant to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Taber v. Maine, </em>67 F.3d 1029 (2d Cir. 1995), her injuries did not arise incident to military service. This is also incorrect. <em>Taber </em>involved an FTCA claim brought by an off-duty Navy Seabee who was injured in an automobile accident by another off-duty Navy serviceman. <em>Id. </em>at 1032. This Court concluded in <em>Taber </em>that the question whether <em>Feres </em>barred the plaintiffs FTCA claim turned, <em>in the circumstances of that case, </em>on whether a person in Taber\u2019s position would be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits on the theory that when injured he was engaged in activities that \u201cfell within the scope of [his] military employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050. Whatever TabeVs significance to this Circuit\u2019s FTCA case law, the <em>Taber </em>panel had no occasion to address either <em>Chappell </em>or <em>Stanley, </em>or the scope of \u201cabstention in the inferring of <em>Bivens </em>actions\u201d more generally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. at 683, 107 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>3054. Moreover, even in the FTGA context, <em>Taber </em>itself noted, citing Supreme Court precedent, that the ineident-to-service rule (regardless of workers\u2019 compensation considerations) is properly invoked when adjudicating the claim of a service member would require \u201c\u2018commanding officers, to stand prepared to convince a civilian court of the wisdom of a wide range of military and disciplinary decisions.\u2019 \u201d 67 F.3d at 1049 (quoting <em>Shearer, </em>473 U.S. at 58, 105 S.Ct. 3039). This is precisely the problem with Doe\u2019s claim here.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">Doe attempts to avoid this conclusion by arguing that her damages claim \u201cdoes not interfere with military discipline or management ... because she only questions <em>school </em>management\u201d\u2014the decisions of Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp \u201cmade in their roles as school administrators\u2014not as military officials.\u201d. Doe\u2019s Br. at 36. The dissent, too, takes this tack.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Observing, dismissively, that West. Point serves a military purpose \u201cto <em>some extent,\u201d </em>Dissenting Op. at 59 (emphasis added), the dissent claims..that the \u201cincident to service\u201d rule does not apply because at the time that Doe was allegedly' assaulted, she was \u201cout for an evening walk on a college campus,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 59, and because, more brdadly, Doe while at West Point was not a soldier on the battlefield, but a student attending college. <em>Id. </em>at 58-59. \u201cWest Point functions principally as a school,\u201d the dissent urges, and \u201cDoe was primarily a student.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">With respect, this analysis is both contrary to the case law and unsupported by the factual allegations in Doe\u2019s Amended Complaint.' As Doe has acknowledged, the United States Military Academy at West Point has a single, unitary mission: to \u201ctrain \u2018officer-leaders of character to serve the Army and the Nation.\u2019\u201d Joint App\u2019x 13. Its cadets swear an oath to <em>\u201cat all times </em>obey the legal orders of ... superior officers, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice,\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4346(d) (emphasis added), and are subject to military discipline pursuant to the Code, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 802(a)(2). Cadets are divided into companies, each commanded by an Army officer, \u201cfor the purpose of military instruction,\u201d <em>id, </em>\u00a7 4349(a), and are \u2018.\u2018trained in the duties of members of the Army,\u201d <em>id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00a7 4349(e), and even paid as members of the Army, 37 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(c). Doe\u2019s contention that this Court might disaggre-gate those aspects of cadets\u2019 lives that concern \u201ceducation\u201d from those involving them training to be future officers\u2014a contention entirely unsupported by allegations in the Amended Complaint\u2014is thus fanciful, at best, because academic and military pursuits are inextricably intertwined at the United States Military Academy, which exists for \u201cthe instruction and preparation for military service\u201d of Army members.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>10 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">As <em>Chappell </em>recognized, \u201c[t]he inescapable demands of military discipline and obedience to orders cannot be taught on battlefields,\u201d and \u201cconduct in combat inevitably reflects the training that precedes combat.\u201d 462 U.S. at 300, 103 S.Ct. 2362. Doe was not \u201ca soldier on a battlefield\u201d at the time of the events challenged here, as the dissent points out. Dissenting Op. at 59. This observation, however, is beside the point. As a member of the Army, Doe was training at West Point to lead battlefield soldiers. Adjudicating the claim she brings against her superior officers, moreover, which charges them with \u201ccreat[ing] \u00e1 dangerous and sexually hostile environment,\u201d Joint App\u2019x 28, and challenges matters ranging from the alleged \u201cunder-representation of women in the school administration\u201d and among the cadet classes, <em>id. </em>at 14, to the alleged tolerance of \u201csexually aggressive language and conduct by faculty, officials and male cadets,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 28, would require a civilian court to examine a host of military decisions regarding aspects of West Point\u2019s culture, as well as the supervision of West\" Point cadets, their training and education, and their discipline by superior officers. Doe\u2019s claim thus \u201cstrikes at the core\u201d of the concerns implicated by the incident-to-service rule: that civilian courts are ill-equipped \u201cto second-guess military decisions\u201d regarding \u201cbasic choices about th\u00e9 discipline, supervision, and control\u201d of service members, <em>Shearer, </em>473 U.S. at 57-58, 105 S.Ct. 3039, that doing so could impair \u201cmilitary discipline and effectiveness\u201d in unintended and unforeseen ways, <em>id. </em>at 59, 105 S.Ct. 3039, and that the \u201cexplicit constitutional authorization for <em>Congress </em>\u2018[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,\u2019\u201d counsels hesitation as to the wisdom of money damages litigation, where Congress has not authorized it, <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. at 681-82, 107 S.Ct. 3054 (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 14).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">In sum, West Point is part of the Department of the Army. Its cadets are service members. Lieutenant General Hagen-beck was the commanding officer \u2022 of a military base during his time at West Point, and Brigadier General Rapp Commanded the cadets. The future officers who study and train at West Point, like the enlisted men and women they are trained to command, may not invoke <em>Bivens </em>to recover damages for injuries that \u201carise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d <em>Stanley, </em>483 U.S. at 684, 107 S.Ct. 3054, Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim against her superior officers, implicating Army training, supervision, discipline, education, and command, triggers the incident-to-service rule and cannot proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We note, as did the D.C. Circuit, that Congress \u201chas been \u2018no idle bystander to th[e] debate\u2019 about sexual assault in the military.\u201d <em>Klay, </em>758 F.3d at 376 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Lebron v. Rumsfeld, </em>670 F.3d 540, 551 (4th Cir. 2012)). In reversing the district court\u2019s determination as to the viability of Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim, we do not discount the seriousness of her allegations, nor their potential significance to West Point\u2019s administration. As the Supreme Court has made clear, however, it is for Congress to determine whether affording a money damages remedy is appropriate for a claim of the sort that Doe asserts. We therefore join the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit in concluding that no <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available here. We accordingly need not reach the question whether Lieutenant General Hagenbeck and Brigadier General Rapp are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the order of the district court, and REMAND to the district court with instructions to dismiss Doe\u2019s equal protection claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">. The factual background presented here is derived from the allegations in Doe\u2019s Amended Complaint, which we accept as true and view in the light most favorable to her in reviewing the district court\u2019s decision on the motion to dismiss. <em>See Starr Int\u2019l Co. v. Fed.

At a hearing, the district court granted the motion in part, and denied it in part. It granted Doe permission to proceed under a pseudonym, and it also ruled that she could continue to redact from public filings the name of \"Mr. Smith,\u201d the man she alleged had assaulted her, The district court decided that the names of the individual defendants and the facts and circumstances of the alleged assault, however, should be disclosed. No challenge has, been presented on appeal to this manner of proceeding and we are without the benefit of briefing on the question, We assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining to proceed in this manner and do not address the matter further. <em>But see, e.g., Doe v. Public Citizen, </em>749 F.3d 246, 275 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding .that the district court's sealing order \"violated the public's right of access under the First Amendment and that the [district] court abused its discretion in allowing Company Doe to proceed under a pseudonym\u201d); <em>Sealed Plaintiff v.

We have suggested that in some circumstances\u2014for instance, where an issue exists for FTCA purposes as to whether a given automobile accident occurred \u201cwithin a distinctly military sphere of activity,\u201d <em>see Wake, </em>89 F.3d at 58\u2014the incident-to-service inquiry may require the analysis of potentially relevant factors, such as the relationship of the activity at issue to membership in the service or the location of the conduct giving rise to the tort claim. <em>Id, </em>No such close analysis is necessary here, however, given the clear relationship between Doe's <em>Bivens </em>claim and management and discipline at West Point. In any event, we note that the balance of the relevant factors we identified in <em>Wake </em>are clearly present here. Doe was a member of the Army; her tuition-free presence at West Point (and access to the facilities therein) was a benefit conferred as a result of that membership; and her constitutional claim arises from her treatment at West Point, where she resided- and was training to become an officer. <em>See id. </em>at 57 (identifying \"status as a member of the military,\u201d \"the location of the conduct giving rise to the underlying tort claim,\u201d and \"whether the service member was taking advantage of a privilege or enjoying a benefit conferred as a result of military service\u201d as among relevant factors).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b71-5\">.

As a matter of this Circuit\u2019s FTCA precedent, moreover, it is noteworthy that only some nine months after the amended decision in <em>Taber, </em>this Court in <em>Wake </em>suggested that to the extent the appellant there argued that <em>Taber </em>had created a new \u201cscope of employment\u201d test for determining the applicability of the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, <em>Taber </em>could not be read to alter the reach of <em>Feres, </em>which was then and remains binding precedent. 89 F.3d at 61. This Circuit has not relied on <em>Taber's </em>holding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>in the intervening twenty-plus years, and at least one other circuit has declined to employ its approach. <em>See Skees v.

Suffice it to say that the dissent cites no case law supporting the proposition that the availability of a <em>Bivens </em>damages suit turns on, this contingency, and unsurprisingly, since such an approach would be inconsistent with courts' traditional reluctance \"to intrude -upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs' unless 'Congress specifically has provided otherwise.' \" <em>Ziglar, </em>137 S.Ct. at 1861 (quoting <em>Dep\u2019t of Navy v.

The harassment resulted from practices and policies that the individual defendants permitted to proliferate and, indeed, implemented or encouraged, depriving Doe of an equal education because of her gender. The amended complaint alleges that the individual defendants created, promoted, and tolerated a misogynistic culture, including by, for example, setting separate curriculum requirements for women and men (self-defense for first-year female cadets and boxing for first-year male cadets), requiring sexually transmitted disease testing for female but not male cadets, warning female cadets that it was their burden to spurn sexual advances from male cadets while openly speaking to male cadets about sexual exploits and encouraging them to take advantage of any opportunity to have sex, imposing inadequate punishment for offenders, and permitting sexually explicit, violent, and degrading group chants during team building exercises, with verses such as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-10\">I wish that all the ladies/were bricks in a pile/and I was a mason/ I\u2019d lay them all in style....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-11\">I wish that all the ladies/were holes in the road/and I was a dump truck/I\u2019d fill \u2019em with my load....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-12\">I wish that all the ladies/were statues of Venus/and I was a sculptor/I\u2019d break \u2019em with my penis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-13\">App\u2019x 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-14\">If West Point were a private college receiving federal funding or another public educational institution and allegations such as these were proven, there clearly would be a violation of Doe\u2019s rights and she could seek recourse for her injuries. The Government argues, however, that the individual defendants are immune from suit because they are military officers. And while it acknowledges that \u201c[sjexual assault in the military and at service academies cannot be tolerated,\u201d it argues that Doe is a service member and that \u201cservice members may not sue their superiors for injuries that arise incident to military service,\u201d Appellants\u2019 Br. at 2, relying on the concept of intramilitary immunity as set forth in <em>Feres v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950), and its progeny. The majority accepts the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>I do not agree that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine applies, for in my view Doe\u2019s injuries did not arise \u201cincident to military service.\u201d When she was subjected to a pattern of discrimination, and when she was raped, she was not in military combat or acting as a soldier or performing military service. Rather, she was simply a student, and her injuries were incident only to her status as a student. When she was raped, she was taking a walk on a college campus with another student, someone she thought was a friend. The actions and decisions she now challenges had nothing to do with military discipline and command; instead, she seeks recourse for injuries caused by purported failures on the part of school administrators acting in an academic capacity overseeing a learning environment for students.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">While West Point is indeed a military facility, it is quintessentially an educational institution. As its website proclaims, it is \u201cone of the nation\u2019s top-ranked colleges,\u201d and it provides its \u201cstudents with a topnotch education.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In my view, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine does not bar Doe\u2019s equal protection claims. For these and other reasons discussed below, I would affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying the individual defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the equal protection claim. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">As alleged in the amended complaint, the facts are summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">Doe is a former cadet who resigned from West Point in 2010 after completing two years. She grew up in a military family and graduated near the top of her class in high school. At West Point she \u201cthrived academically, participated in extracurricular activities, and ranked high in her class.\u201d App\u2019x 14. Because she left West Point before the start of her third year, she never assumed active status and had no obligation to enlist as a soldier. <em>See </em>32 C.F.R. \u00a7 217.6(f)(6)(ii)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Her obligations to the military did not vest, and she was not contractually required to repay the cost of her education.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">West Point has an enrollment of approximately 4,600 cadets and a faculty of some 600 individuals, of whom three-quarters are military personnel and one-quarter are civilian employees. Cadets live on-campus in dormitories all four years and eat in dining halls. The curriculum \u201cis designed to train \u2018officer-leaders of character to serve the Army and the Nation,\u2019 \u201d App\u2019x 3, and thirty-six majors are offered, including Politics, Art, Philosophy and Literature, Engineering, History, Physics and Sociology.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> West Point is accredited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the accreditation unit for the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cadets may participate in numerous extracurricular activities, including athletics, honor societies, academic competitions,- and musical groups. West Point fields athletic teams in twenty-four NCAA Division I sports and twenty-one club sports. Upon graduation, West Point, cadets earn a Bachelor of Science degree and become commissioned as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army. :</p>\n<p id=\"Aiu\">Approximately 200 of the 1,300 cadets in Doe\u2019s entering class were women. Doe was often the only woman in a squad of approximately ten cadets. During her time at West Point, she was subjected to pervasive sexual harassment and a culture of sexual violence. Her classmates regularly made misogynistic and sexually aggressive comments, which were frequently ignored and sometimes condoned by West Point administrators, During team-building exercises, cadets would march and sing \u201csexual, misogynistic chants,\u201d such as the one quoted above, in view and earshot of faculty and administrators. App\u2019x 16. Male cadets often used derogatory terms to describe women and frequently made contemptuous comments about the physical appearance of women. West Point officials ignored or endorsed these comments, and openly joked with male cadets about sexual exploits, Male faculty members routinely expressed sympathy with male cadets over the'lack of opportunities to have sex, and suggested that they seize any chance they could to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">There were other disparities in the treatment of male and female cadets. West Point officials required mandatory annual sexually transmitted disease (\u201cSTD\u201d) testing for female cadets, but not male cadets, explaining that STDs were more harmful to women than to men and therefore it was the responsibility of women to prevent the spread of these diseases. In the Physical Education program in the first year at West-Point, male cadets were required to take boxing while female cadets were required to take self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">While West Point provided training for the prevention of sexual assault and harassment, the training was inadequate. West Point officials provided only limited training on the concepts of respect and consent, while sending the message to female cadets that it was \u201ca woman\u2019s responsibility\u201d to prevent sexual assault and that \u201cit was their job to say \u2018no,\u2019when faced with inevit\u00e1ble advances from their male colleagues.\u201d App\u2019x 18. West Point officials failed to punish cadets who perpetrated sexual assaults and created an environment in which male cadets understood that they could sexually assault female colleagues with \u201cnear impunity,\u201d while female cadets' understood \u201cthat they risked their own reputations and military careers\u201d by reporting sexual assaults against them. App\u2019x 18; The vast majority of faculty members and administrators were male.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">A 2010 Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d) survey found that fifty-one percent of female cadets and nine percent of male cadets reported that they had experienced sexual harassment at West Point.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>survey found that more than nine percent of the female cadets at West Point experienced unwanted sexual. contact in 2010, and some eighty-six percent of these women did not report the incident.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of the female cadets who did not report unwanted sexual contact, seventy-one percent feared \u201cpeople gossiping about them\u201d and seventy percent \u201cfelt uncomfortable\u201d making a report.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In 2011, DoD found that West Point was only \u201cpartially incompliance\u201d with sexual harassment and assault policies, and that West Point\u2019s prevention training was \u201cdeficient,\u201d did not meet the minimum standard of annual training for cadets, lacked an institutionalized comprehensive sexual assault prevention and response curriculum, and failed to comply with DoD directives intended to reduce rape and sexual assault.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Defendants-appellants Lieutenant General Franklin Lee Hagenbeck, the Superintendent of West Point from July 2006 to July 2010, and Brigadier General William E. Rapp, Commander of Cadets at West Point from- 2009 to 2011, were responsible for administering the sexual assault prevention and response program and the training of cadets on campus during the relevant time period. According to the amended complaint, however,' instead of implementing programs and policies to educate and protect students, defendants created, promulgated, implemented, and administered the policies, practices, and customs at issue. The 2009-2010 DoD Annual Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at Military Service Academies found that trends of unwanted sexual contact experienced by female cadets increased during the time Hagenbeck and Rapp were, respectively, Superintendent and Commander of Cadets.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">On May 8, 2010, around 1 a.m., a male cadet stopped by Doe\u2019s dormitory room and invited her for a walk. It was after curfew, and Doe had earlier taken a sedative prescribed to help her sleep because she had been suffering from anxiety and stress. Nonethel\u00e9ss, she agreed to go with him. They eventually walked into an administrative building and the male cadet began drinking alcohol, offering Doe a few sips. She took them, and then \u00edost consciousness as the alcohol mixed with her medication. The male cadet then took advantage, attacking Doe and having \u201cforcible, non-consensual intercourse with her,\u201d on the concrete floor of a boiler room. App\u2019x 22. She woke up in her own bed a few hours later, with dirt on her clothes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>and hair, bruises on her lower back, and blood between her legs. Three days later, when she went for a vaginal examination at West Point\u2019s health clinic, there were signs of vaginal tearing. She eventually left West Point, enrolling at a four-year college from which she earned a degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Doe brought this action below against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \u201cFTCA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 <em>et seq., </em>and the Little Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(2), as well as against Hagenbeck and Rapp in their individual capacities under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), for due'process and equal protection violations. The district court dismissed the claims against the United States as well as the due process claim, and permitted Doe to pursue only her equal protection claim against the individual defendants. The district court held that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine did not bar the equal protection claim and that, the individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Only the district court\u2019s denial of defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the equal protection claim is before us on this interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">A. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">Since 1971, the Supreme Court \u201chas repeatedly recognized that neither federal nor state government acts compatibly with the equal protection principle when a law or official policy denies to women, simply because they are women, full citizenship stature\u2014equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, participate in and contribute to society based on their individual talents and capacities.\u201d <em>United States v. Virginia, </em>518 U.S. 515, 532, 116 S.Ct. 2264, 135 L.Ed.2d 735 (1996) (\u201cVMI\u201d) (citing, <em>inter alia, Reed v. Reed, </em>404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971)). In <em>VMI, </em>the Court held that Virginia\u2019s policy of excluding women from enrolling in its historically single-sex military college \u2022 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 518 U.S. at 534, 116 S.Ct. 2264. Similarly, in <em>Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, </em>458 U.S. 718, 733, 102 S.Ct. 3331, 73 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1982), the Court held that a state university\u2019s policy of admitting only women to its nursing programs violated the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">These principles apply not just to gender discrimination in admissions to educational institutions but to the continued treatment of students after they have been admitted. <em>See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. Comm., </em>555 U.S. 246, 258, 129 S.Ct. 788, 172 L.Ed.2d 582 (2009) (holding plaintiffs could pursue claims against school system and superintendent for \u201cunconstitutional gender discrimination in schools\u201d under \u00a7 1983, where defendants purportedly failed to address sexually harassing conduct by another student). Courts have thus recognized equal protection claims where' gender discrimination created a hostile educational environment. <em>See, e.g., Hayut v. State Univ. of New York, </em>352 F.3d 733, 743-46 (2d Cir. 2003) (allowing \u00a7 1983 equal protection claim by student against professor for hostile educational environment created by \u201cderogatory and sexually-charged comments\u201d). Moreover, the Supreme Court has recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>nized a <em>Bivens </em>claim for gender discrimination, holding that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment confers \u201ca federal constitutional right to be free from gender discrimination.\u201d <em>Davis v. Passman, </em>442 U.S. 228, 235, 99 S.Ct. 2264, 60 L.Ed.2d 846 (1979) (holding that former congressional staff member could sue U.S. Congressman for damages under Fifth Amendment for discriminating against her on basis of sex).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Equal protection and other constitutional principles have been applied to the military and military institutions. In <em>Frontiero v. Richardson, </em>the Court held that a statutory scheme for housing allowances and spousal medical and dental benefits that applied different standards for male and female active service members was \u201cconstitutionally invalid.\u201d 411 U.S. 677, 688, 93 S.Ct. 1764, 36 L.Ed.2d 583 (1973). <em>See also Fitzgerald, </em>555 U.S. at 257, 129 S.Ct. 788 (observing that students at \u201cmilitary service schools and traditionally single-sex public colleges,\u201d which are exempt from Title IX of Educational Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a), could bring \u00a7 1983 claims for violation of equal protection clause); <em>VMI, </em>518 U.S. at 535-36, 547-54, 116 S.Ct. 2264; <em>Schlesinger v. Ballard, </em>419 U.S. 498, 95 S.Ct. 572, 42 L.Ed.2d 610 (1975) (rejecting, but reaching merits, of claim challenging different discharge policies for male and female officers, based on then-existing exclusion of women from combat roles). In <em>Crawford v. Cushman, </em>we observed that \u201ca succession of cases in this circuit and others had reiterated the proposition that the military is subject to the Bill of Rights and its constitutional implications,\u201d 531 F.2d 1114, 1120 (2d Cir. 1976); <em>see also Dibble v. Fenimore, </em>339 F.3d 120, 128 (2d Cir. 2003) (\u201cWe decline to adopt a categorical rule on the justicia-bility of intramilitary suits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The military has itself adopted regulations to address the issue of gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Army regulations unambiguously prohibit sexual harassment, and commanders and supervisors are obliged to ensure that sexual harassment is not tolerated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All military academies (including West Point) must comply with regulations promulgated by DoD as part of its Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">Hence, Doe was entitled, under the Fifth Amendment and the Army\u2019s own regulations, to an environment free from gender discrimination and sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">B. The <em>Feres </em>Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">In 1950, the Supreme Court held in <em>Feres v. United States </em>that \u201cthe Government is not liable under the [FTCA] for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.\u201d 340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct, 163. <em>Feres </em>involved three cases, brought by or on behalf of servicemen against the United States for personal injuries, sustained \u201cwhile on active duty and not on furlough,\u201d purportedly caused by the \u201cnegligence of others in the armed forces.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 137-38, 71 S.Ct. 153. In two of the cases, death resulted. <em>Id. </em>at 137, 71 S.Ct. 153. The Court held that Congress did not intend to subject the Government to tort claims \u201cby a member of the armed services.\u201d <em>Chappell v. Wallace, </em>462 U.S. 296, 299, 103 S.Ct. 2362, 76 L.Ed.2d 586 (1983) (interpreting <em>Feres).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The Court later extended the concept of intramilitary immunity to <em>Bivens </em>claims. A <em>Bivens </em>remedy is not available when \u201cspecial factors counseling hesitation\u201d are present. <em>Bivens, </em>403 U.S. at 396, 91 S.Ct. 1999; <em>see Ziglar v. Abbasi, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 1843, 1857, 198 L.Ed.2d 290 (2017) (\u201cThe Court\u2019s precedents now make clear that \u215e <em>Bivens </em>remedy will not be available if there are \u2018special factors counseling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)). In <em>Chappell, </em>the Court recognized that \u201cthe unique disciplinary structure of the military establishment and Congress\u2019 activity in the field constitute \u2018special factors\u2019 which dictate that it would be inappropriate to provide enlisted military personnel a <em>Bivens-type </em>remedy against their superior officers.\u201d <em>Chappell, </em>462 U.S. at 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362; see <em>also United States v. Stanley, </em>483 U.S. 669, 683-84, 107 S.Ct. 3054, 97 L.Ed.2d 550 (1987) (recognizing that rationales for intramilitary immunity as explained in <em>Feres </em>are \u201cspecial factors\u201d counseling against <em>Bivens </em>relief, and \u201cholding that no <em>Bivens </em>remedy is available for injuries that \u2018arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 146, 71 S.Ct. 153).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">At the same time, however, \u201cour citizens in uniform may not be stripped, of basic civil rights simply because they 'have doffed their civilian clothes.\u201d Earl Warren, <em>The Bill of Rights and the Military, </em>37 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 181, 188 (1962) (quoted in <em>Chappell, </em>462 U.S. at 304, 103 S.Ct. 2362). As the Court noted in <em>Chappell-. </em>\u201cThis Court has never held, nor do we now hold, that military, personnel are barred from all redress in civilian courts for constitutional wrongs suffered in the course of military service,\u201d 462 U.S. at 304-05, 103 S.Ct. 2362. Indeed, members of the military have been permitted, after <em>Feres, </em>to bring constitutional challenges against the Government with respect to matters relating to the military. <em>See Frontiero, </em>411 U.S. at 688, 93 S.Ct. 1764; <em>accord Regan v.

Johnson, </em>481 U.S. 681, 688, 107 S.Ct. 2063, 95 L.Ed.2d 648 (1987). First, there is a \u201cunique relationship between the Government and military personnel,\u201d <em>Chappell, </em>462 U.S. at 299, 103 S.Ct. 2362, that is \u201c \u2018distinctively federal in character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>481 U.S. at 689, 107 S.Ct. 2063 (quoting <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 143, 71 S.Ct. 153). The military function is performed \u201cin diverse parts of the country and the world,\u201d and when a service member is injured \u201cincident to service\u2014that is, because of his military relationship with the Government\u201d\u2014a uniform federal remedy should be available, and \u201cthe fortuity of the situs of the alleged negligence\u201d should not dictate whether the Government is liable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Second, Congress has established alternative, statutory means of compensation for military-personnel injured-incident to service. As the Court observed in <em>Johnson, </em>\u201cthe existence of these generous statutory disability and death benefits is an independent reason why the <em>Feres </em>doctrine bars suit for service-related injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is not likely, the Court has concluded, that Congress would have created \u201c \u2018systems of simple, certain, and uniform compensation for injuries or death of those in the armed services\u2019\u201d while intending at the same time to permit lawsuits for service-related injuries under the FTCA. <em>Chappell, </em>462 U.S. at 299, 103 S.Ct. 2362 (quoting <em>Feres, </em>340 U.S. at 144, 71 S.Ct. 153).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A11\">Third, suits based upon service-related activity \u201c\u2018would involve the judiciary in sensitive military affairs at the expense of military discipline and effectiveness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>481 U.S. at 691, 107 S.Ct. 2063 (quoting <em>Shearer, </em>473 U.S. at 57, 105 S.Ct. 3039). Courts should not intrude in military matters, the Court has explained, because \u201ca suit based upon service-related activity necessarily implicates the- military judgments and decisions that are inextricably intertwined with the conduct of the military mission.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>481 U.S. at 691, 107 S.Ct. 2063; <em>see United States v. Shearer, </em>473 U.S. 52, 59, 105 S.Ct. 3039, 87 L.Ed.2d 38 (1985) <em>(\u201cFeres </em>seems best explained by the peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to his superiors, the effect of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme results that might obtain if suits ... were allowed for negligent orders given or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">In <em>Taber v. Maine, </em>after reviewing the Supreme Court case law,'we summarized the various considerations and held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">an appropriate test for applying the <em>Feres </em>doctrine .must respect: (1) the Supreme Court\u2019s stated concern for keeping courts away from, delicate questions involving military discipline; (2) Feres\u2019s clear -intention to replace the contingencies of local tort law with a uniform federal scheme; and (3) Feres\u2019s original desire that this uniforihity is to be achieved through exclusive recourse to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>the federal system of military death and disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">67 F.3d 1029, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">In <em>Taber, </em>the plaintiff Taber was a Navy \u201cSeabee\u201d\u2014a construction worker\u2014who was injured in Guam when his car was struck by a car driven by another Navy serviceman, Maine. <em>Id. </em>Both were on active duty but on liberty, and the accident occurred on a public road. <em>Id. </em>Taber had spent the day with his companion and they were driving back to her home for the weekend when the accident occurred. <em>Id. </em>He sued the United States and Maine for his injuries, which he alleged were caused by Maine\u2019s negligent driving. <em>Id. </em>The Government defended in part by relying on the <em>Feres </em>doctrine, and the district court agreed, dismissing the claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1033.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed, holding that \u201cthe link between Taber\u2019s activity when he was injured and his military status is too frail to support a <em>Feres </em>bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1050. The Court explained that \u201c[t]here is nothing characteristically military about an employee who, after working-hours are done, goes off to spend a romantic weekend with a companion.... The accident that followed, on the open road and on the way to [the companionj\u2019s house[,] had \u2018nothing to do with\u2019 Taber\u2019s military career and was \u2018not caused by service except in the sense that all human events depend upon what has already transpired.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1051 (quoting <em>Brooks v. United States, </em>337 U.S. 49, 52, 69, 69 S.Ct. 918, 93 L.Ed. 1200 (1949)).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\"><em>Taber </em>teaches us that military status does not automatically trigger <em>Feres </em>immunity. Rather, we apply the incident to service test by asking whether, at the time the plaintiff was injured, she was \u201cengaged in activities that fell within the scope of [her] military employment.\u201d 67 F.3d at 1050. In <em>Wake v. United States, </em>we reiterated that we must look at \u201cthe totality of the germane facts,\u201d and noted that \u201c[i]n examining whether a service member\u2019s injuries were incurred \u2018incident to service,\u2019 the courts consider various factors, with no single factor being dispositive.\u201d 89 F.3d at 57-58. In addition to \u201c[t]he individual\u2019s status as a member of the military at the time of the incident,\u201d those factors include: \u201cthe relationship of the activity to the individual\u2019s membership in the service\u201d; \u201cthe location of the conduct giving rise to the underlying tort claim\u201d; \u201cwhether the activity is limited to military personnel and whether the service member was taking advantage of a privilege or enjoying a benefit conferred as a result of military service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">C. Application of the <em>Feres </em>Doctrine to this Case</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">In my view, the <em>Feres </em>doctrine does not bar Doe\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim that she was denied her constitutional right to equal access to education, for her injuries did not arise \u201cincident to service.\u201d First, as .to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>activities immediately preceding Doe\u2019s rape, her ultimate injury, she was engaged in purely recreational activity: she was out for an evening walk on a college campus, after curfew, with another student who was a friend. Second, as to her broader activities at West Point, she was a student attending college: she was taking classes, participating in extracurricular activities, and learning to grow up and to be a self-sufficient and healthy individual. She was not a soldier on a battlefield or military base. She was not traveling in a military car or boat or plane or pursuant to military orders. She was not being treated by military doctors. She was not on duty or in active service or on active status, and she was not yet obliged to enter into military service. There was \u201cnothing characteristically military\u201d about what she was doing, and her injuries did not arise out of military employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">To be sure, West Point serves, to some extent, a military purpose, and its cadets are indeed being trained to be soldiers and officers. As the Government and the majority note, West Point cadets are considered members of the military. Appellants\u2019 Br. at 14; Maj. Op. at 44-45 (citing 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 3075(a)-(b)(2) (including \u201ccadets of the United States Military Academy\u201d in the \u201cRegular Army,\u201d \u201ca component of the Army\u201d)). But Doe\u2019s status as a member of the military is not, by itself, dispositive. <em>See Wake, </em>89 F.3d at 58-61 (declining to attribute dispositive weight to plaintiffs status as a cadet but looking at all germane circumstances); <em>Taber, </em>67 F.3d at 1053 (holding that <em>Feres </em>was not a bar where \u201c[ojther than the naked fact that Taber was in the Navy at the time of his injury, there is no government/plaintiff relationship of any significance in this case\u201d). Rather, West Point functions principally as a school and Doe was primarily a student; the concerns underlying the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Feres </em>and the \u201cspecial factors counseling hesitation\u201d in the in-tramilitary immunity cases simply are not implicated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">First, Doe\u2019s claims do not implicate \u201cdelicate questions involving military discipline.\u201d <em>Taber, </em>67 F.3d at 1049. Her claims do not call into question \u201cthe military judgments and decisions that are inextricably intertwined with the conduct of the military mission.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>481 U.S. at 691, 107 S.Ct. 2063. The actions and decisions of the individual defendants being challenged here do not implicate, except perhaps in the most abstract sense, military discipline or military judgment or military preparation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Instead, Doe\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>claims challenge academic decisions and policies, and the individual defendants were acting as educators and school administrators, tasked with providing their students with a positive learning environment, one free from sexual discrimination and harassment. <em>See VMI, </em>518 U.S. at 532, 116 S.Ct. 2264 (recognizing right to equal protection in education, including at a military educational institution); <em>Hagopian v. Knowlton, </em>470 F.2d 201, 210 (2d Cir. 1972) (comparing West Point\u2019s responsibility for instilling discipline in cadets \u201cto the responsibilities of public school teachers to educate their students\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Second, the \u201cfederal system of military death and disability benefits\u201d established by Congress for injuries sustained by military personnel incident to service, <em>Taber, </em>67 F.3d at 1049, apparently is not available to Doe. Indeed, now that her claims against the United States have been dismissed, it appears that her <em>Bivens </em>claim is her only means of seeking relief for her injuries. The Government has not suggested that Doe is eligible for any benefits akin to workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries arising out of activities within the scope of her military duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Third, the district court\u2019s decision to permit Doe to proceed with her federal constitutional claim does not implicate the Court\u2019s concern that a \u201cuniform federal scheme\u201d not be displaced by \u201cthe contingencies of local tort law.\u201d <em>Taber, </em>67 F.3d at 1049. Federal constitutional rights are at stake, and \u201cthe fortuity of the situs of the alleged [wrongdoing]\u201d will not dictate whether the individual defendants will be liable. <em>Johnson, </em>481 U.S. at 688, 107 S.Ct. 2063. Rather, Doe\u2019s equal protection claim is a federal claim, based on federal constitutional law: the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Moreover, there are federal regulations that also apply here, and Doe alleges that defendants failed to abide by them. The concern identified in <em>Feres </em>and its progeny that courts not interfere with military discipline and structure carries.little weight when the military is violating its own rules and regulations. <em>See Crawford, </em>531 F.2d at 1120 (noting that \u201c[a] line of cases in our court holds that actions by the armed services that are violative of their own regulations are within the reach of the courts\u201d) (collecting cases); <em>Hammond v. Lenfest, </em>398 F.2d 705, 715 (2d Cir. 1968) (permitting review of petition for writ of habeas corpus where naval reservist claimed he was denied discharge by Navy in violation of its own regulations). Judicial review of Doe\u2019s allegations that the individual defendants failed to follow mandatory military directives and regulations would not unduly interfere with \u201cthe proper and efficient operation of our military forces.\u201d <em>Smith v. Resor, </em>406 F.2d 141, 146 (2d Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The Government cites three cases that have applied the <em>Feres </em>doctrine to dismiss claims brought by service academy cadets. <em>See </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 14 (citing <em>Miller v. United States, </em>42 F.3d 297, 301 (5th Cir. 1995); <em>Collins v. United States, </em>642 F.2d 217, 218 (7th Cir. 1981); <em>Archer v. United States, </em>217 F.2d 548, 552 (9th Cir. 1954)). These out-of-circuit cases, of course, are not controlling, and they are in any event distinguishable. In <em>Miller, </em>a freshman midshipman at the Naval Academy was hit in the head by the boom of a sailboat while training to learn, <em>inter alia, </em>seamanship and the handling of a small vessel. 42 F.3d at 299. In <em>Collins, </em>an Air Force cadet alleged that he was injured by medical malpractice on the part of Air Force medical personnel. 642 F.2d at 218. In <em>Archer, </em>a West Point cadet was aboard a United States Army plane returning to West <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Point from a leave. He was being transported as \u201ca soldier in military service in line of duty\u201d and was killed when the plane crashed. His parents brought a wrongful death action against the United States, alleging negligence in the operation of the plane. 217 F.2d at 549, 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">These factual scenarios are significantly different from the circumstances before us now. Injuries resulting from training aboard a Navy boat or flying on an Army plane or being treated by military doctors clearly are injuries incident to service. None of the cases involved a claim for the violation of constitutional rights, <em>see Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 814, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982) (damages suits \u201cmay offer the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees\u201d), and none involved a claim for the deprivation of the opportunity for an equal education, or a claim of an injury sustained while socializing with a classmate. Moreover, in all three cases, the armed forces provided disability or death benefits or other compensation. <em>Miller, </em>42 F.3d at 299-300, 306, 307; <em>Collins, </em>642 F.2d at 221; <em>Archer, </em>217 F.2d at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Finally, the majority and the Government rely on two recent decisions of other Circuits rejecting <em>Bivens </em>claims brought by current and former service members alleging they had been raped and sexually assaulted by other service members. The plaintiffs in these cases contended that the actions and omissions of current and former Secretaries of Defense had created a military culture of tolerance for sexual assault and misconduct. <em>See Klay v. Panetta, </em>758 F.3d 369, 371-72 (D.C. Cir. 2014); <em>Cioca v. Rumsfeld, </em>720 F.3d 505, 513-14 (4th Cir. 2013). The cases, however, are distinguishable, for they involved active duty service members who brought broad challenges to policies of high-ranking government officials, raising questions as to military discipline and command for those in active duty. The cases did not involve students or an educational institution or the deprivation of meaningful access to an education because of discriminatory academic policies or school administrators tasked with running an educational institution. The <em>Feres </em>concerns\u2014particularly the question of interfering with military command and discipline\u2014play out very differently in this scenario.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As Justice Brennan wrote in Stanley:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-9\">In <em>Chappell, </em>the Court did not create an inflexible rule, requiring a blind application of <em>Feres </em>in soldiers\u2019 cases raising constitutional claims. Given the significant interests protected by <em>Bivens </em>actions, the Court must consider a constitutional claim in light of the concerns underlying <em>Feres. </em>If those concerns are not implicated by a soldier\u2019s constitutional claim, <em>Feres </em>should not thoughtlessly be imposed to prevent redress of an intentional constitutional violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">483 U.S. at 705, 107 S.Ct. 3054 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part, with Marshall, J., joining, and Stevens, J., joining in relevant part).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">The <em>Feres </em>doctrine has been criticized wide and far, and many have called for the Supreme Court to reconsider it.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>do not, of course, have the authority to overrule <em>Feres, </em>we should not be extending the doctrine. <em>See Lombard v. United States, </em>690 F.2d 215, 233 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cWhile lower courts are bound by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Feres, </em>they are hardly obliged to extend the limitation.... \u201d). By holding that Doe\u2019s injuries sustained as a cadet incident to being a student are barred as injuries incident to military service, the majority does precisely that.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">I would affirm the district court\u2019s determination that the <em>Feres </em>doctrine does not bar Doe\u2019s equal protection claim.

The student was an enlisted inactive member of the Navy Reserves who was assigned to \u201ctemporary duty\u201d to travel to a military clinic for a physical examination required to qualify as a flight navigator. <em>Id. </em>at 56. On the way back, while traveling in a military vehicle driven by a Marine Corps sergeant, she was injured. <em>Id. </em>at 55-56. We concluded, not surprisingly, that the student's injuries were sustained incident to service. <em>See id. </em>at 58-61. While Wake was indeed a student, she was on a \"temporary duty\u201d assignment and was traveling in a military vehicle driven by an active service member. Moreover, she received military benefits for her injury\u2014she \u201cwas assigned a 100% disability rating from the [Veterans Administration] on January 5, 1993, resulting in monthly VA service-connected compensation benefits of approximately $2,000 per month.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\">. The Government argues that Doe's claims \"call[] into question the management of the military,\u201d \"specifically their decisions concerning the discipline, supervision, and control of West Point cadets.\u201d Appellants' Br. at 10. I suppose that may be so to a degree, but our observation in <em>Taber </em>applies here: \"Arguably, there is some government/tortfeasor relationship that might entail minimal disciplinary concerns even in this case, but these are both qualitatively and quantitatively different from those that concerned us in [other cases implicating <em>Feres], </em>let alone those that troubled the Supreme Court in <em>Shearer.\" </em>67 F.3d at 1053. Moreover, as amici point out, many graduates of military academies use their degrees to pursue other professional, non-military endeavors immediately after meeting minimum service requirements. <em>See </em>Amicus Br. of Former Military Officers at 10 (citing Government Accountability Office study reporting that 32% and 38% of academy graduate officers in, respectively, 2001 and 2005 left in their fifth year, the first year officers were eligible to leave the military). While a four-year college degree is required to be commissioned as an Army officer, admission to West Point is not; in fact, in Fiscal Year 2011, only 14.6% of Army officers were commissioned by attending West Point. <em>See </em>Ami-cus Br. of Former Military Officers at 11 (citing Table B-31: Active Component Commissioned Officer Corps, FY 11, http:// prhome.defense.gov/Portals/52/Documents/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>POPREP/poprep201 l/appendixb/b_31 .html (last visited Aug. 29, 2017)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b85-7\">. <em>Klay </em>and <em>Cioca </em>are also distinguishable because they do not employ the fact-specific, totality-of-circumstances approach our Circuit applied in <em>Taber </em>and <em>Wake. </em>Instead, they rely primarily on one consideration: military discipline and decisionmaking. <em>See Klay, </em>758 F.3d at 374-75; <em>Cioca, </em>720 F.3d at 512-15.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b85-13\">. <em>See, e.g., Lanus v.
