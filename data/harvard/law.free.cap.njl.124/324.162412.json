Service of the summons and complaint was made upon both defendants. Seraf\u00edn answered denying his endorsement, but Gusciora defaulted. Issue was joined; and the cause came on for trial on February 1st, 1932, at the Passaic Circuit, before Circuit Judge Mackay and a jury on the usual notice of trial to the answering defendant. Neither defendant appeared. Plaintiffs adduced evidence in support of the allegations of the complaint; and it is now made to appear that, at the direction of the trial judge, the jury returned \u201ca general verdict against the defendants and in favor of the plaintiffs for $1,539.85.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">There was no return to this court of \u201cthe transcript with the verdict and other proceedings had thereon,\u201d as directed by section 209 of the Practice act of 1903 <em>(Comp. Stat. </em>1910, <em>p. </em>4117, now <em>R. S. </em>1937, 2:27-188), and therefore no judgment upon the verdict; and, Judge Mackay having died in the meantime \u201cbefore signing the <em>postea\u2019\u2019 </em>plaintiffs now produce \u201cthe circuit record with the <em>postea </em>annexed,\u201d certified and sealed by the clerk of the Passaic Circuit Court as provided in the cited provision of the statute, and ask for judgment thereon against both defendants. See rule 11? of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Seasonable notice of the application was given to each defendant. Seraf\u00edn has not entered his appearance. Conced<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>ing that he \u201ccould have no objection to the entry of final judgment provided satisfactory compliance with the Supreme Court rule, in effect at the time, was had,\u201d Gusciora, invoking rule 68 of the schedule of rules annexed to the Practice act of 1913 <em>(Pamph. L., pp. </em>377, 396), now rule 90 of this court, maintains that it was incumbent upon plaintiffs, \u201cprior to the assessment of damages * * * to give this defendant fifte\u00e9n days\u2019 notice of their intention so to do;\u201d that no such notice was given to him; and that this was a fatal departure from procedural requirements which deprives the court of \u25a0 jurisdiction to enter judgment against him on the <em>postea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The point is not well made. The last-cited rule of this court, providing for the assessment of damages by a jury drawn from the general panel on fifteen days\u2019 notice to the defendant where there has been a judgment by default, in lieu of a writ of inquiry, is not applicable to an action upon a promissory note.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Section 136 of the Practice act of 1903 <em>{Comp. Stat. </em>1910, <em>p. </em>4096, now <em>R. S. </em>1937, 3:37-195) provides that, \u201cIf interlocutory judgment in an action on contract is entered by default, where the damages or sum recoverable are a mere matter of calculation or can readily be ascertained, the plaintiff may have his damages assessed by the court, or if the court is not actually in session, by a judge or the clerk, unless a rule shall be entered for a writ of inquiry or an order be made for assessment of damages in open court.\u201d See <em>Peacock </em>v. Haney, 37 <em>N. </em>J. <em>L. </em>179; <em>Simmons </em>ads. Kelly, 39 <em>Id. </em>438. And rule 89 of this court directs that, \u201cIn all cases of assessment of damages to be made by the court, or any justice thereof or by the clerk,\u201d in an action upon a promissory note, a copy of the instrument \u201cshall be included in the assessment,\u201d and the original \u201cproduced before the court or officer making such assessment,\u201d or proof of its loss or destruction made by affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Yet judgment cannot be entered against the defendant Gusciora. Examination of the record in the clerk\u2019s office reveals that there has been no interlocutory judgment by default against him, and so plaintiffs\u2019 only recourse now is to rule him to plead. <em>R. S. </em>1937, 3:37-118, derived from section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>100 of the Practice act of 1903 <em>(Comp. Stat. </em>1910, <em>pp. </em>4053, 4083). See <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Merchants\u2019 National Bank, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>481; <em>Broad and Market National Bank </em>v. <em>Wiesen, </em>99 <em>Id. </em>331.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Since the defendant Seraf\u00edn interposes no objection, plaintiffs may enter judgment against him on the <em>postea. </em>And they may have a rule to plead directed to the defendant Gusciora. There is no suggestion of laches in the legal sense.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
