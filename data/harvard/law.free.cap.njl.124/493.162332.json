There was a rule to plead. The plea was not interposed until three days after the expiration of the time limited. On that very day, the clerk, on relator\u2019s motion, entered a rule for judgment final adjudging that relator was \u201crightfully entitled to the office\u201d in question, and to immediate possession and enjoyment thereof, and directing the ouster of respondent. On December 16th ensuing, the instant rule to show cause was allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The motion to vacate the judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the court; and in the circumstances we should deem it our duty to award such relief wore it not that the proofs reveal the judgment is well-based on the merits. Apart from the inherent power of the court to open a default judgment, if its enforcement would defeat the ends of justice as regards the individual litigants, the public interest demands that controversies respecting title to public office be adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>cated on the merits to the end that an intruder be ejected. <em>Vide Anderson </em>v. <em>Meyers, </em>77 <em>N. J. L. </em>186.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On July 11th, 1919, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Bayonne (a commission-governed municipality), presumably in the purported exercise of the authority conferred by article XV, section 1, of chapter 152 of the laws of 1917, as amended by chapter 252 of the laws of 1918 <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1917, <em>pp. </em>319, 358; <em>Pamph. L. </em>1918, <em>p. </em>958; now <em>B. 8. </em>1937, 40:52-1 <em>et seq.), </em>adopted an ordinance entitled \u201cAn Ordinance to\" Eegulate and Control the Maintenance and Operation of \u00c1uto-Buses and Jitneys.\u201d There is no contention that this local legislative action was <em>ultra vires; </em>the grant of power so to legislate is not denied. The ordinance lays down an elaborate scheme for the regulation and control of such vehicles. An operating license is prescribed, conditioned, <em>inter alia, </em>upon the provision of a liability insurance policy for a designated sum. The vehicular operator is required to be of good character and in sound health, and possessed of the skill and ability requisite for safety in the operation of the vehicle upon the highways. It is provided that the licensed vehicle shall be \u201cmechanically perfect and without faulty construction.\u201d Operating rules are set out at length. And there is a levy upon gross receipts as \u201ca monthly franchise tax for revenue for use of the city.\u201d Originally, the Director of Eevenue and Einance was directed to appoint a \u201csupervisor to manage and control all auto-buses and jitneys and drivers of auto-buses and jitneys;\u201d and such supervisor was clothed with \u201ceach and every power\u201d therein \u201cgranted to the Director of Eevenue and Finance to control, regulate and manage all auto-buses and jitneys,\u201d and with authority to \u201cappoint as many inspectors of auto-buses and jitneys and of drivers of auto-buses and jitneys with the approval and consent\u201d of the director \u201cas he shall deem necessary and advisable.\u201d The supervisor and inspectors were invested with \u201cfull police power.\u201d There was no term prescribed for either the supervisor or the inspectors.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The parties seem to be in agreement that thereby an office in the legal sense came into being. The information so treats it, and respondent acquiesces in that view. It is likewise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>termed in the stipulation of facts introduced on this motion \u201cin the event\u201d that the court \u201cwill hear arguments on the merits * * And it would seem that it is properly classable as an \u201coffice\u201d in legal intendment. Conceding the State\u2019s grant of such authority', the place thus created is of kin to the municipal superintendent of buildings and health inspector considered in <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Board of </em>Health, 82 <em>N. J. L. </em>200.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Subsequently, the appointive authority in respect of the office of supervisor was transferred to the Director of Public Safety. The validity of this action is not challenged. It is stipulated that on May oth, 1925, the municipal governing body \u201cadopted a resolution transferring the power, authority and duties of the Department of Revenue and Finance relating to the jitney department and auto-bus supervision to the Department of Public Safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">On February 1st, 1935, the then Director of Public Safety appointed relator to the office of \u201cSupervisor of Auto Buses for a term ending the 31st day of December, 1935, at a salary of $2,300 <em>per annum.\u201d </em>The appointee assumed the office, and continued in possession thereof without further appointment until June 12th, 1939, when he was notified by the Director of Public Safety that his \u201cservices as Supervisor, Auto Bus Department,\u201d were \u201cno longer required and said services\u201d were thereby \u201cterminated, as of June 15th, 1939.\u201d Immediately thereafter, the director appointed respondent to the office for a term ending on the last day of the year at a like annual salary of $2,300. It is frankly avowed that political considerations and not misbehavior dictated this course.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">Relator is an honorably discharged veteran of the World War, and claims the protection of <em>R. 8. </em>1937, 38 :16-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">Concededly, the legislative action embodied in the ordinance under review, if not <em>ultra vires </em>the municipality, was within the domain of the Board of Commissioners. Under section 4 of the Commission Government Act <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1911, <em>p. </em>462), as amended by chapter 275 of the laws of 1915 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>494), the governing body was invested with \u201call administrative, judicial and legislative powers and duties\u201d theretofore \u201chad and possessed and exercised by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>mayor and city council and all other executive or legislative bodies\u201d of the municipality, and with \u201ccomplete control over\u201d its \u201caffairs.\u201d There was a direction for the \u201cdistribution\u201d of \u201cthe executive, administrative, judicial and legislative powers, authority and duties\u201d in municipalities of the class embracing the city of Bayonne \u201cinto and among five departments,\u201d each headed by' one of the commissioners. The duty was also laid upon the governing body to \u201cdetermine the powers and duties to be performed by each department,\u201d and to \u201cassign such powers and duties to the appropriate departments\u201d and \u201cprescribe the powers and duties of all officers and employes * * *.\u201d It was empowered to \u201cassign particular officers and employes to one or more departments,\u201d and to \u201crequire any officer or employe to perform duties in two or more departments,\u201d conditioned in a manner not here pertinent, and to \u201cmake such other rules and regulations as\u201d might \u201cbe necessary or proper for the efficient and economical conduct of the business of the citj\\\u201d It was also directed, \u201cat the first meeting, or as soon as may be after organization,\u201d to \u201ccreate such subordinate boards and appoint such officers as it\u201d might \u201cdeem necessary for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs\u201d of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Our court of last resort has ruled that this power of appointment of such officers as may be deemed necessary \u201cfor the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs of the city\u201d connotes also the authority to \u201cabolish all pre-existing administrative offices, whether created by the legislature or the municipality, the performance of the duties of which has been assigned by the commission to a governmental department of which such office constitutes no part, and which has no place in the municipal machinery provided for the proper and efficient conduct of municipal affairs under the new scheme of government.\u201d <em>Schmeidler </em>v. <em>Atlantic City, </em>102 <em>N. J. L. </em>121.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">By parity of reasoning, the authority to regulate and control the maintenance and operation of auto-buses, and to create such offices as may be deemed necessary for the achievement of that objective, comprehends the prescription of tenure beyond modification by the commissioner in whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>power of appointment is vested. If the board possessed the power to create the office \u2014 and, as noted, this is granted \u2014 so also had it the authority to prescribe the term \u2014 a mere incident of the creative power. Here, the ordinance does not delimit the term, nor does it endow the commissioner in charge with such function as appurtenant to the power of appointment. Therefore, at the time of relator\u2019s appointment, the \u201cterm of office\u201d was not \u201cfixed by law.\u201d His term was not co-extensive with that of the governing body: the tenure was rather of the class <em>durante bene pl\u00e1cito. </em>And so the term was indefinite, and the relator is consequently within the protection of section 38:16-1 of the Revision, <em>supra. Maxwell </em>v. <em>Wildwood, </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>181; <em>affirmed, </em>113 <em>Id. </em>404. His removal in contravention of its provisions was therefore nugatory. The policy of the statute is not to be set at naught through an appointment for a fixed term by the departmental head. There being no fixation of a definite term by the creative authority, the tenure is during good behavior as prescribed in the last cited section of the Revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">And there is no force to the contention that relator, having \u201caccepted appointment from February 1st, 1935, to December 31st, 1935,\u201d thereby \u201ccontracted with\u201d the municipality \u201cfor his term, and is therefore bound\u201d accordingly, and at the time of his removal was in the category of a \u201chold-over\u201d officer not entitled to the benefit of section 38:16-1, supra\u2014 citing <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Orange, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>620; <em>DeMol </em>v. <em>Clifton, </em>6 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>669; <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>10 <em>Id. </em>832.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The principle enunciated in <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Orange, supra, </em>is not applicable here. An office does not rest in contract: its acceptance does not give rise to a contractual relation. <em>Hoboken </em>v. <em>Gear, </em>27 <em>N. J. L. </em>265; <em>Fredericks </em>v. <em>Board of Health, supra; Board of Education, Cedar Grove, </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>67. In <em>Ufert </em>v. <em>Vogt, </em>65 <em>Id. </em>377; <em>affirmed, Id. </em>621, our court of last resort declared that, where \u201cthe term of the office * * * is to be held at the pleasure of the common council,\u201d under the municipal charter, \u201cthe matter is not one of contract, but one of law,\u201d and it was therefore beyond the power of the council to fix a definite term. And in the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Gum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>mere thus distinguished the Hardy ease, <em>supra: </em>\u201cAn examination of the opinion in the case cited will disclose that its scope has been misapprehended by counsel. The conclusion there was that the appointment of Hardy to the position of keeper of the reservoir at Orange for the period of a year, and his acceptance of that appointment, constituted a contract between him and the municipality. As holder of that position Hardy was not the incumbent of a public office, but a mere employe of the city; the services to be performed by him were not in anywise public or official, but purely of a private nature, and, for this reason, it was considered that his appointment and acceptance constituted a contract, the court following the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in the case of <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>7 <em>Gray </em>33, so far as it applied to the appointment of municipal agents whose duties were not public or official in their character. But this doctrine has no application in the case of a person holding a public office as distinguished from a position in which the services to be performed are simply of a private nature. The appointment to a public office for a definite term, and the acceptance of such office, bears no analogy to a contract made between the government and an individual. In the latter the terms agreed upon define the rights and obligations of both parties, and neither may depart from them without the assent of the other. In the former both the rights and privileges as well as the duties of the appointee are prescribed by the government and not by agreement of the parties, and the government (in the absence of constitutional restriction) may at any time, and without the appointee\u2019s consent, abridge those rights and privileges or increase those duties, or change their character; or it may put an end to them before the expiration of the term, by abolishing the office.\u201d See, also, <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Hudson, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>117, where the post of deputy warden of a county almshouse was held to be a position not subject to contractual fixation of the term so as to render inapplicable a war veterans\u2019 tenure act such as the one invoked here. It is to be observed that this ease was in the Supreme Court and was decided before the Hardy case, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Nor does relator have the status of a \u201chold-over\u201d officer rather than one having tenure during good behavior within the intendment of section 38:16-1 of the Revision, <em>supra. </em>The continuance of relator in the office from December 1st, 1935, until June 12th, 1939, without further appointment for a definite term or otherwise, is indicative of the departmental director\u2019s recognition of his lack of capacity as regards the prescription of a definite term. We deem that course of conduct to be the equivalent of an appointment for an indefinite term under the ordinance. Compare <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Hudson, supra. </em>The case of <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>152 \u2014 not cited by either party \u2014 is not to the contrary. There, it was held that an appointment designed to be and in terms temporary merely, covering the transition period upon the adoption of the commission government plan, could not be distorted into the equivalent of an appointment for the three-year term fixed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">It remains to consider whether the judgment is void, in that \u201cit adjudged the relator to be entitled to the office, which is unlawful,\u201d since at common law only the title of the respondent could be inquired into, unless the latter put the relator\u2019s title in issue\u2014citing <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>57 <em>N. J. L. </em>203; <em>Manahan </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>64 <em>Id. </em>465; <em>Magner </em>v. <em>Yore, </em>75 <em>Id. </em>198.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The principle is without applicancy here. Relator\u2019s title has been put in issue on this motion to vacate the judgment. As stated, the parties have joined in a prayer that the court hear and determine the question of the title to the office, and for that purpose the facts have been stipulated. Therein relator\u2019s title is directly challenged. It was agreed that \u201cthere is no issue or dispute of facts between the parties, and that the respondent, by his attorney, questions solely the legality of relator\u2019s right to hold the office of auto bus supervisor after the expiration of the specific term of his original appointment.\u201d In <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Burk, supra, </em>this court declared that \u201cOne complaining of the illegality of the election to office of another in his stead must first show that he himself has legal title to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The rule to show cause is accordingly discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
