We are constrained to resolve them against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">As to negligence, the inquiry is whether there is any evidence which, if accepted and given its fullest probative force, reasonably tends to sustain the pleaded cause of action. Is it such that fair and reasonable men would be justified in concluding that the <em>onus probandi </em>had been sustained? <em>Sivak </em>v. <em>New Brunswick, </em>122 <em>N. J. L. </em>197. There was such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Defendant represented the range to be of proper construction and function for safe domestic use; and there was tangible evidence tending to establish the contrary. Apart from the indisputable failure of function, there was expert evidence of improper construction, in that there was inadequate air circulation, and \u201cmore gas\u201d was \u201cfed in than could be lighted,\u201d whereby, \u201cwhen the flame was turned to one-sixteenth inch flame there wasn\u2019t sufficient air entering into it to keep the burner lighted when you closed the door fast,\u201d and thus there was danger of explosion of the accumulated gas when the door was opened. This is what happened here.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Moreover, upon complaints by the plaintiffs, made on three separate occasions, defendant undertook to remedy this defect, and, upon the conclusion of its efforts in that direction, advised plaintiffs that necessary adjustments had been made and the instrument was no longer dangerous to use. It is elementary that the negligent performance of work gratuitously undertaken is actionable if damage ensues as the proximate result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Pointing to the testimony of the expert witness that \u201cpoor circulation\u201d in the room in which the range was installed might be a contributing factor, the contention is made that the <em>onus </em>was on plaintiffs to \u201cexclude inferences of negligence which could be drawn from causes or omissions not attributable to appellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">But, in reasoning from circumstances, the test in the ultimate analysis is whether the evidence on the whole brings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>the proposition affirmed within the realm of probability. It is not requisite that the circumstances also exclude beyond doubt the inference that the damage in a case such as this ensued from a cause not imputable to defendant. Certainty is not the standard. It is sufficient if the circumstantial evidence be such as to afford a fair and reasonable presumption of the facts inferred. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>487; <em>Kuczynski </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>118 <em>Id. </em>321: <em>Vollkommer </em>v. <em>Menge, </em>118 <em>Id. </em>360. In civil cases, \u201ca mere preponderance of probability, due regard being had to the burden of proof, is a sufficient basis of decision.\u201d <em>Best on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 95. See, also, section 23. It is the jury\u2019s duty \u201cto decide in favor of the party on whose side the weight of the evidence preponderates, and according to the reasonable probability of truth.\u201d 1 <em>Lewis\u2019 Greenleaf on Evidence, </em>\u00a7 13a. Professor Greenleaf divides circumstantial evidence into two classes, viz.: \u201c* * * certain, or that from which the conclusion in question necessarily follows; and uncertain, or that from which the conclusion does not necessarily follow, but is <em>probable </em>only (italics the author\u2019s), and is obtained by a process of reasoning\u201d \u2014 a conclusion which does not necessarily follow from the facts proved, \u201cbut is obtained from these and other circumstances, by probable deduction.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>\u00a7 13a. The evidence preponderates if it establishes \u201cthe reasonable probability of the fact.\u201d 20 <em>Amer. Jur. </em>1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Furthermore, it was incumbent upon defendant to take into account the vital factor of the room\u2019s air circulation when it assured plaintiffs, after the installation and adjustment of the mechanism, and the readjustment following complaints of improper functioning, that the instrument was capable of safe usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">And it is a corollary of the foregoing considerations that it is <em>immaterial that </em>defendant was the distributor <em>and not </em>the manufacturer of the range.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The point that the evidence was conclusive of contributory negligence is frivolous. Whether Mrs. Jaeger\u2019s conduct exhibited reasonable care for her own safety was, in its most favorable aspect to defendant, a question for the triers of the facts. If we assume awareness of the danger, still the proofs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>disclose that this plaintiff\u2019s continued use of the instrument rested upon assurances by defendant that there, had been a rearrangement of the mechanism to insure normal use free from danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The next insistence is that the trial judge erred in overruling defendant\u2019s objection to the following question propounded to the plaintiff, Theodore Jaeger: \u201cDid you afterward find out what was the cause of that?\u201d The question referred to the extinguishment of the range \u201c\u00f1ame,\u201d regulated \u201cto one-fourth or one-half inch,\u201d when the door was \u201cclosed or opened;\u201d and the witness answered \u201cpoor circulation of oxjrgen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">It is argued that the question called for hearsay evidence. This was not the ground of the objection interposed at the trial; there it was said to be \u201cimmaterial.\u201d Moreover, the evidence thus educed was in nowise prejudicial, for it seems to have been conceded that the extinguishment of the flame was due to inadequate air circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">And it was not reversible error to exclude the six photographs offered in evidence by defendant. Two of these photographs presented views of the range in question, while the others were represented as covering parts of a range of like make and style. They were taken more than two years after the mishap; and they were offered, not \u201cto show 'the condition of the range on that date or on any date,\u201d but \u201cmerely * * * to show what kind of range it was and the set-up of the range and the general mechanism \u2014 how the range works.\u201d The trial judge considered that there were other and more satisfactory methods of \u201cproving the physical aspects\u201d of such instruments; and, in the special circumstances, the ruling is not fairly classable as an abuse of discretion. The offer in question invoked sound judicial discretion. <em>Braelow </em>v. Klein, 100 <em>N. J. L. </em>156.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Lastly, it is said that, as regards the husband\u2019s action for consequential damages, there was error in the overruling of defendant\u2019s objection to the following question put to him: \u201cDid you pay the expenses of her [the wife\u2019s] trip down there?\u201d On the advice of her physician that \u201ca change of environment would improve her nervous state,\u201d Mrs. Jaeger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>had gone to Oklahoma to recuperate; and the ground of the objection was that the payment of such expenses was \u201cimmaterial,\u201d since the physician \u201ctestified that it did not matter where she went.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Assuming that this expense was not chargeable to defendant as a necessary and reasonable disbursement, the witness\u2019 merely affirmative answer was not in itself prejudicial; and, while he was later permitted, over objection, to state the amount paid for railroad fare, there was no exception to that ruling. Moreover, we think it reasonably clear that the jury discarded this item in the appraisement of the husband\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Judgments affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
