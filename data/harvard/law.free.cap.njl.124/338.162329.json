The action was for an alleged trespass wherein the defendants are said to have maliciously entered upon plaintiffs\u2019 premises, destroyed a concrete wall with appurtenant drain pipes, despoiled the grass and earth, &amp;c. Plaintiffs specify as the determinations of the District Court with which they are dissatisfied in point of law that the court struck so much of the state of demand and of plaintiffs\u2019 testimony as dealt with the destruction of the wall and the cost of replacing same. The appeal comes up on a state of case, settled by the trial judge, which recites that when plaintiffs rested the \u201cdefendants moved to strike out all the testimony in relation to the alleged destruction of the wall for the reason that the testimony in the plaintiff\u2019s case comprised an admission that the wall was constructed by the predecessor in title of the defendants and constituted an encroachment or nuisance on the property of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the defendant and that the testimony of Joseph Spitzer was not proper in proving the construction costs by predecessor in title. The court granted the motion.\u201d We find no record of the striking of any part of the state of demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">The state of case discloses no testimony by Joseph Spitzer, nor does it show the production of him as a witness or otherwise. The witnesses for the plaintiffs, as certified to us, were Mr. and Mrs. Templin and Ered J. Thomson, Jr., a surveyor. The testimony given by one or more of these witnesses discloses that the wall in question was of concrete and was situated on the line between the premises of the plaintiffs and the premises of the defendants and that \u201cto the side of such wall there were located certain drain pipes taking the water from the roof of plaintiffs\u2019 house,\u201d that this wall to the extent of twenty-one feet from the street line was torn down by the defendants, that plaintiffs repaired the pipe line with one day\u2019s labor and at a cost of $6 for materials and that defendants did further damage by riding over the plaintiffs\u2019 lawn. We find nothing in the plaintiffs\u2019 ease which states that the wall was constructed by defendants\u2019 predecessor in title or that it constituted a nuisance on the property of the defendant. The struck testimony, in our opinion, was relevant to the issue and should have gone to the jury as part of the case. The court action was objected to by the plaintiffs and exception was duly noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The judgment will be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
