He died in 1934, and consequently there was no statutory presumption that the transfer, a settlement on his children of some forty per cent, of his estate, was \u201cin contemplation of death.\u201d However, the commissioner, after taking evidence, came to the conclusion that as a matter of fact the settlement was made in contemplation of death; and on appeal to the Prerogative Court, that court, in 127 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>323, by Yice-Ordinary Buchanan, affirmed the finding of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">Our examination of the case and briefs leads us to the same conclusion, and substantially for the reasons set out in the opinion of the learned vice-ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>It is suggested in the brief of respondent that the findings of fact by the vice-ordinary are impregnable in this court if there be any legal evidence to justify them; and this on the theory, as we read the brief, that the Prerogative Court is \u201cnot a special statutory tribunal\u201d in an inheritance tax case. But the Court of Errors and Appeals in the case of <em>In re Roebling, </em>91 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>72, expressly held that the Prerogative Court in these cases is a special statutory tribunal, and that for that very reason its decisions are reviewable only by <em>certiorari. </em>An instance of such review on the facts is <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>122 <em>Id. </em>489, on <em>certiorari, </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>564, and on appeal from this court in 122 <em>Id. </em>283. See, also, <em>In re Fischesser, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>815, cited by the vice-ordinary in his opinion; and section 11 of the <em>Certiorari </em>act of 1903, <em>Comp. Stat. </em>1910, <em>p. </em>405, now <em>R. S. </em>2:81-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">The decree of the Prerogative Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
