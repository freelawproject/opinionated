The only question involved is whether, under our <em>statute </em>\u2014 B. <em>S. 2 </em>:26-153 \u2014 a judgment creditor in a discovery proceeding is privileged to require a witness, under process to appear and testify, to bring a specified document or agreement germane to the issue, which shows that certain moneys are due the judgment debtors from given persons. The statute in question reads as follows: 2:26-153 \u2014 \u201cIn proceedings for discovery in aid of execution, witnesses may be required to appear and testify concerning the matters involved by either party, by process of <em>subpoena ad </em>testificandum, issued out of the court wherein the judgment is recovered or docketed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The witness was served with this court\u2019s process to appear before a Supreme Court commissioner \u201cto testify and give evidence\u201d and at the same time bring with him the agreement in question wherein, as it is alleged, certain credits of the debtor are assigned to the witness and his law partner, to whom the judgment debtors are indebted.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">The moving party confines its argument to the proposition that the power to compel a witness to bring records <em>(i. e., duces </em>tecum) is not contained in the statute quoted above; that the words <em>\u201cad testificandum\u201d </em>are a limitation on the scope of the subpoena and are not comprehensive enough to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>require the production of records. In opposition it is admitted that while no case has been found in which the precise question as to the scope of the statute has been determined by this court, nevertheless the construction placed upon other statutes of like import\u2014(section 58, Evidence act, <em>Comp. Stat., p. </em>2237; <em>R. </em>S.2:100-35) in a general way are favorable to the contention that the power to compel a witness in a proceeding of this character to bring records to the hearing is implicit in the statute. <em>Cf. Davis </em>v. <em>Lehigh Valley Railroad, </em>97 <em>N. J. L. </em>412. The argument of the former rests on strict construction; that of the latter that the statute, being remedial in essence <em>(Coleman </em>v. <em>Roff, </em>45 <em>N. J. L. </em>7) compels the exercise of this power as entirely eompatable with the spirit of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">A subpoena or, more fully, a <em>subpoena ad testificandum </em>is defined as a process to cause a witness to appear and. give testimony, &amp;c. 27 <em>Amer. &amp; Eng. Gyc. </em>197; 2 <em>Bouvier (Rawles 3d ed.) </em>3164. Professor Wigmore, in his work on evidence (volume 4, section 2199) writes, \u201cThe form of document traditionally used for this purpose (to summon witnesses) is the writ of subpoena which commands the witness to appear * * *. Where the witness is desired to bring documents a specific clause to that effect is additionally required to be inserted.\u201d And, in the following section (2200), \u201cThe form of the subpoena, when the production of documents is desired, is varied by the insertion of a special clause adapted to the purpose and requiring the witness to bring with <em>him </em>\u2014 duces <em>tecum </em>\u2014 the desired document.\u201d Of course, the learned author is speaking of the writ of subpoena generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Our statute law concerning evidence and witnesses \u2014 2:97 subtitle 11 \u2014 in speaking of such process, regards it rather in the generic sense without distinction or qualification whether the process be to testify or to bring records, and this court in the Davis case, <em>supra, </em>held that under section 58 of the Evidence act (now <em>R. S. </em>2:100-35)' a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>might be ordered, relying on a decision of Mr. Justice <em>Garrison' </em>\u2014 In <em>re Donald and Healy. </em>The opinion of Mr. Justice Garrison, unfortunately, was not reported and is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>available. The law reports only contain the judgment of our court of last resort (87 <em>N. J. L. </em>691) where it appears that an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Garrison was discussed. The language of the statute, considered by Mr. Justice Bergen in the Davis case, supra, is that the court \u201cmay make an order awarding process of subpcena * * * for such witness * * * to appear and testify.\u201d This, in effect and meaning, is identical with the language of the statute under review requiring witnesses to appear and testify \u201cby process of <em>subpcena ad testificandum.\" </em>Mr. Justice Bergen, in the Davis case, held that the word \u201csubpcena,\u201d as used in the statute then under consideration, was \u201cany subpoena necessary to accomplish the intention of the statute.\u201d This reasoning seems to me to be just as apt in the present situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">This proceeding is \u201cfor discovery in aid of execution\u201d and the record or agreement called for concerns \u201cthe matters involved,\u201d viz., alleged credits of the judgment debtors. If the subpoena be restricted to oral testimony the purpose of the statute, to aid execution, is seriously circumscribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">A <em>subpcena ad testificandum </em>does not lose any of its identity or its quality and become something else because there is added thereto a clause of requisition to the witness to bring in certain records in his possession pertinent to \u201cthe matters involved\u201d without which the power of process to compel his testimony might well be valueless. Text-writers seem to take the position that the term <em>subpoena ad testificandum </em>is a technical and descriptive name for the ordinary subpcena. 60 <em>C. J. </em>689; 70 <em>C. J. </em>43, \u00a7 <em>22G; </em>and that a power to compel testimony by subpcena as a general rule connotes authority to include therein a <em>duces tecum </em>requirement. 70 <em>C. J. </em>48, \u00a7 34. And it seems to me to be a sensible view. After all, the words \u201csub poena\u201d looking to the meaning, certainly have no relation whatever to process. Custom and tradition have, however, made the words synonymous with process of a certain kind. It is an erroneous view to my mind to hold that <em>subpcena duces tecum </em>is something different and apart from <em>subpcena ad testificandum, </em>and that the latter term does not include the former. My judgment is that under our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>statute iu proceedings for discovery in aid of execution <em>(B. 8. </em>2:26-153) witnesses brought in to testify concerning the matters involved may be required to produce pertinent records which are in their custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The rule will be discharged, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
