The question before the Passaic Pleas was whether defendant had been legally served with the summons and complaint in this cause. The Pleas held to the contrary, and this holding is before us on plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">Por the defendant it is first objected that the order setting aside the service is not a final judgment, and hence that appeal does not lie. But we consider that it had all the elements of finality, inasmuch as the case shows that the person on whom the service was made was a traveling salesman residing in Brooklyn, with no place of business in this state, and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>sequently not within the language of the first paragraph of <em>R. S. </em>2:36-44. The mixed question of law and fact which was before the Pleas for decision was whether this-, salesman was a \u201cservant of the corporation within this state and acting in the discharge of his duties.\u201d If not, that is the end of the case, as it is not intimated that there is any other representative in this state on whom process may be served. The order is therefore a finality, and appeal lies. <em>Bickel </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania Steel Co., </em>123 <em>Md. </em>226; 91 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>136. We have held to the same effect in cases of attachment. <em>Hanford </em>v. <em>Duchastel, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>205; <em>Jaudel </em>v. <em>Schoelzke, </em>95 <em>Id. </em>171; <em>Burleigh </em>v. <em>Sartain, </em>114 <em>Id. </em>151, 153. See, also, <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Miner, </em>88 <em>Id. </em>361.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">It remains, therefore, to decide whether the judge of the Common Pleas erred in setting aside the service; and we think that he did err. His decision followed as a precedent the case of <em>Jaeger </em>v. <em>Breslow Brothers, </em>9 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>1069. But an important and determinative feature of that case was that the salesman was authorized only to take orders, and the acceptance or rejection of those orders vested with the home office in New York; whereas in the case at bar the testimony of the salesman was that he had authority to accept orders and \u201cfinish the deal * * * in the store in New Jersey.\u201d The case is not within the ruling in <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>117 <em>N. J. L. </em>305; affirmed in 118 <em>Id. </em>379, but rather within that in <em>Giovannini </em>v. <em>Hartford, &amp;c., Co., </em>130 <em>Id. </em>580.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The rule or order setting aside the service of process is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
