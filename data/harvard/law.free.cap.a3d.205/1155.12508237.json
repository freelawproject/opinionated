The court sentenced G.E.P. to an aggregate term of thirty years in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Jane, who was thirty-six years old at the time of the trial, testified extensively about the abuse she allegedly suffered. Jane testified that G.E.P. began committing sexual assaults on her soon after he moved in with her mother, when she was six or seven years old. She testified that the sexual encounters, which began with touching, occurred on a regular basis, becoming progressively more intense, until she and G.E.P. were engaging in oral sex and intercourse when she was about ten or eleven years old. G.E.P. last engaged in this sexual activity with her when she was fifteen or sixteen years old, a year or two after he had moved out of her mother's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Jane's testimony provided the basis for introducing various items seized from a bag taken from G.E.P.'s office. She stated that, around the time they started having sex, he used Velcro\n   straps to \"bind [her] breasts.\" In addition, she testified that he bought and had her wear bras that he cut out. Jane previously testified at a Rule\n   404(b) evidentiary hearing that the binding lasted until around the time that the two stopped having intercourse, when she told G.E.P. that she was not \"doing this anymore.\" At trial, Jane noted the items were always stored in a bag similar to the one found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Jane identified the Velcro straps and ropes seized by the State as \"not the same but ... very similar\" to the sort of straps she had been made to use. She also noted that the seized clothespins, rubber bands, rope, and intact bra were all similar to the sort of items that G.E.P. had used with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Jane also testified that her relationship with G.E.P. was complicated by the fact that she had true feelings of affection for him. She testified that she considered him to be a father figure and \"would want to see him to get support or guidance ....\" She testified that she still cared for him and continued to visit him on occasion after they stopped having intercourse. The visits continued until approximately 2007, well after she went to college. During these visits, G.E.P. fondled Jane's breast and kissed her neck or breast. Jane testified that \"there was no below the belt action ....\" Jane attended G.E.P.'s wedding in 1996, and sent him a Christmas card with a photograph of her daughter on at least one occasion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Jane testified that she did not report G.E.P.'s abuse as a child because G.E.P. gave her the impression when she was very young that \"everybody does it.\" G.E.P. also told her their relationship was \"special,\" that \"he was in love with [her,] and that [they were] soul mate[s]\" who would \"make a life together ....\" At other times, they discussed the disastrous impact that this information would have on her family and G.E.P. if the information became public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Jane testified that she reported the abuse in 2009 out of concern for G.E.P.'s adopted daughter who \"looked just like [her]\" and was nine years old, around the same age as Jane when G.E.P. began to\n   abuse her. When Jane reported the abuse, the police recorded a phone call between her and G.E.P. The audio recording of this phone call was played during Jane's testimony, and the jurors were provided transcripts to follow along. While G.E.P. made a few cryptic, salacious comments, he did not admit to any specific sexual activity, despite Jane's efforts to obtain an incriminating statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Cross-examination of Jane focused on her delayed reporting of the abuse and inconsistencies between her prior statements and her trial testimony. During the pretrial N.J.R.E. 404(b) evidentiary hearing, defense counsel observed in particular that she did not originally mention most of the items she later stated had been used by G.E.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Dr. D'Urso testified not only about why children may delay reporting, but also that children frequently \"may retract or recant the allegation.\" He also testified \"a child isn't going to necessarily say the same thing to every person who interviews them in the course of this investigation.\" Jane initially told the police about \"straps,\" allegedly used by G.E.P. Almost six years later, after sexual paraphernalia found by the police in G.E.P.'s office was shown to her, for the first time Jane alleged those items had also been used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   G.E.P. testified and denied he ever had sexual intercourse with Jane. G.E.P. acknowledged that he and Jane \"wound up necking\" on one occasion around 1996 when Jane was more than sixteen years old, during \"a really low point\" in his life. He further stated that he was \"not happy ... or proud of\" the incident and \"felt like it was too weird and odd, and not appropriate.\" G.E.P. stated that after this incident\n   he \"just sort of pulled away\" to focus on his girlfriend, who is now his wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   G.E.P. argues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT DEPRIVED DEFENDANT OF A FAIR TRIAL BY ADMITTING EXPERT TESTIMONY ON CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE ACCOMMODATION SYNDROME AND FAILING TO LIMIT ITS USE TO THE PERIOD WHEN THE ALLEGED VICTIM WAS A CHILD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    POINT II\n   </em>\n   : THE ERRONEOUS ADMISSION OF EVIDENCE THAT DEFENDANT HAD SUBSEQUENT LEGAL INTIMATE CONTACT WITH THE ALLEGED VICTIM TO EXPLAIN HER DELAY IN BRINGING THESE ALLEGATIONS VIOLATED DEFENDANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRESENT A COMPLETE DEFENSE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    POINT III\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DECLINING TO GRANT A MISTRIAL BASED ON [JANE'S] INTERJECTION OF BARRED FRESH COMPLAINT TESTIMONY THAT IMPERMISSIBLY BOLSTERED HER CREDIBILITY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    POINT IV\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING EVIDENCE OF ITEMS SIMILAR TO THOSE ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN USED ON JANE TO CORROBORATE [JANE'S] ACCOUNT.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   As we have explained, applying the holding in\n   <em>\n    J.L.G.\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that the admission of the CSAAS testimony presented the real possibility of an unjust result that requires reversal.

When the police arrived, C.P. \"went outside to talk to them\" and they left without speaking to Nancy. She testified the sexual encounters occurred on a regular and frequent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   During their first sexual encounter, C.P. told Nancy that if she screamed or told anyone about what happened that she would not be able to see C.P. anymore. Nancy thought that if she was unable to see C.P., she would no longer see her mother and brothers. Nancy also did not immediately report C.P.'s abuse because C.P. told her that the sexual contact between them was \"what little girls do for their fathers.\" C.P. told Nancy that he was going to marry her. Nancy further testified that she knew \"something wasn't right, but [she] was scared and [she] didn't know what to do or what to say.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Nancy first disclosed the abuse to her boyfriend when she was in eighth grade. She told him that she and C.P. had oral sex and asked him \"not to tell any[one] because [she] didn't want to not have contact with [her] brothers anymore.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Around April 2012, when she was in ninth grade, Nancy moved into her great aunt and uncle's home in Florida. After a custody hearing in July, Nancy told them about her history of sexual abuse. The\n   following morning, they called the police and an officer came to their house and took a statement from Nancy. Nancy later gave a statement to police officers in New Jersey. Cross-examination of Nancy focused on her delayed disclosure of the abuse and inconsistencies between her prior statements and trial testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Dr. Lippmann testified: \"We should not be automatically dismissive of a child whose disclosure is not necessarily completely\n   consistent in its details ....\" She also said when a child does disclose the abuse, \"it is more likely than not to be after some considerable delay.\" She continued: \"And when they tell after such a delay, there are times that there are aspects of the disclosure that one might think are inconsistent. A child may tell about part of what happened on one occasion and then ... perhaps at another time, talk about something else happening.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Dr. Lippmann testified that a child might disclose abuse \"after a long period of time\" when there is \"a change in their family situation or something,\" and they \"then feel comfortable to disclose ... or feel a need to disclose at that point in time, when they may not have before.\" C.P. did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   C.P. argues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO PROPERLY LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE CSAAS TESTIMONY.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    POINT II\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO ISSUE A CORRECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN RESPONSE TO THE STATE'S WITNESS VIOLATING BOUNDARIES OF CSAAS TESTIMONY.

The fact that the first jury was unable to reach a verdict and the second jury convicted only after hearing the improper CSAAS expert testimony, supports reversal. We affirm without further\n   discussion the trial court's evidentiary decisions to preclude \"Sexual Abuse in Divorce/Custody Syndrome\" (S.A.I.D.) evidence and excited utterance testimony of defense witnesses. We also affirm the trial court's admission of J.P.'s testimony. The trial court's evidentiary decisions did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Because we remand for a new trial, we need not address C.P.'s sentencing argument or his argument that the trial court's \"cumulative errors\" denied him a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    C.K.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant C.K. was convicted of nine crimes: three counts of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(a)(1) ; four counts of second-degree sexual assault, N.J.S.A. 2C:14-2(b) ; and two counts of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, N.J.S.A. 2C:24-4(a) by digitally penetrating, and engaging in sexual contact and intercourse with his biological daughter, Julie, before her thirteenth birthday. The court sentenced C.K. to an aggregate term of thirty years in prison, with eighty-five percent parole ineligibility, pursuant to NERA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Julie, who was seventeen years old at the time of trial, testified that C.K. first digitally penetrated her when she was six years old. Julie testified that she stopped having sexual contact with C.K. when she was about eight years old. The abuse resumed, however, when Julie was nine years old. C.K. digitally penetrated Julie, touched her breasts, and had intercourse with her. These incidents occurred until Julie was eleven years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   When Julie was fifteen years old, she and C.K. argued in front of her mother. Twice Julie told C.K. that she did not respect him because he \"raped\" her. Julie did not explain to her mother what she meant by that statement. Julie \"felt like [she] couldn't\" tell her mother what happened. About two weeks later, Julie told her best friend that C.K. \"raped\" her. Her friend told her mother, who contacted the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Cross-examination of Julie focused on inconsistencies between her prior statements and trial testimony. Defense counsel questioned\n   her about what she remembered, and to whom and when she disclosed the abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The State conceded at the outset of trial that its case depended on Julie's testimony rather than physical evidence. The State introduced expert testimony from Dr. Marita Lind, a pediatrician who examined Julie when she was approximately fifteen years old. Dr. Lind testified Julie showed signs of \"special learning needs.\" Dr. Lind also testified to Julie's medical history, which included anxiety and the need for a school aide. Dr. Lind observed no signs of scarring, healed trauma, or sexually transmitted diseases. Dr. Lind testified that because the sexual abuse Julie recounted ended several years ago, she would not expect any injuries to be present at the time she examined her. Dr. Lind did not observe evidence of separation of Julie's hymen, and noted that this was contrary to what she would generally expect to see in a child who was penetrated at the age of six. However, she noted that \"[i]f the penis penetration is -- what little girls often term as inside, which is between their labia ... then I wouldn't necessarily expect to see any trauma.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Dr. Lippman testified as she had in C.P.'s trial. She also explained that a child's cognitive ability \"may affect how a child will make a disclosure.\" She testified that \"[c]ognitive abilities will affect memory, affect verbalization, will affect conceptual ability, and in addition there are other kinds of factors\" such as \"various emotional issues that may intervene and may influence how and when ... [a child] disclose[s]\" the abuse. The court failed to give the jury the then-current cautionary charge regarding CSAAS testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   C.K. did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   C.K. argues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n   : THE TRIAL COURT VIOLATED THE DEFENDANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS TO COUNSEL OF HIS CHOICE AND TO REPRESENT HIMSELF BY FAILING TO ENGAGE IN THE REQUISITE INQUIRIES WHEN DEFENDANT INDICATED AN INABILITY TO WORK WITH ASSIGNED COUNSEL.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   A.
