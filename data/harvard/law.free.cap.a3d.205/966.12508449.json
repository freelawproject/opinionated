These exceptions are commonly known as privileges. This case asks us to balance the search for truth against one of the strongest privileges-confidential marital communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We weigh the introduction of evidence that tends to implicate child abuse against the protection of the confidential marital communications privilege. In so doing, we resolve the two questions presented: (1) whether this Court should adopt a principle of narrow construction with respect to\n   the marital communications privilege, and (2) whether the trial court properly exercised its discretion by allowing the State to introduce text messages that Kevin Sewell sent to his wife's cell phone. As to the first question, we agree with the State that courts should narrowly construe privileges, including the marital communications privilege. As to the second, we affirm the trial court's decision to admit the text messages, although we diverge from its rationale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Overview and Procedural Posture\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Three-year-old Luke Hill lived with his mother, Victoria Harmon, and her fianc\u00e9, Nick Miller, in Keller, Virginia. Luke was a happy, healthy little boy who enjoyed running around, playing outside, and driving his toy Jeep. In late April, Luke went to his pediatrician for a wellness check, and the doctor told his mother that he was \"perfectly fine.\" Approximately one week later, Luke's mother and Nick left Luke in the care of Amanda and Kevin Sewell (\"Amanda\" and \"Kevin,\" respectively),\n   his aunt and uncle, so that they could enjoy a night out. They arrived at Amanda and Kevin's house in Pocomoke City, Maryland around 3:00 p.m. and visited for a short time, during which Luke and his cousin were running, playing, and wrestling. When Victoria and Nick departed for Salisbury, Kevin was holding Luke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Kevin played with the boys until around 5:00 p.m. They all ate eggs and bacon for dinner, and afterward, Amanda gave Luke a bath. She testified that during Luke's bath, she noticed, for the first time, that he had \"[a] lot\" of bruises, including bruising behind his ears, down his neck, on his chest, arms, and legs. He also had black eyes and a knot on his head. Amanda testified that she called Victoria and told her about the bruises behind his ears and that Luke was not feeling well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Amanda woke up around 5:00 a.m. on Sunday morning, May 3, to get ready for her shift at a nearby restaurant. Luke and his cousin woke shortly thereafter, and Amanda made them breakfast. She departed for work around 6:45 a.m., leaving the children in Kevin's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Beginning around 9:00 a.m., Amanda and Kevin sent a series of text messages to each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [AMANDA 9:07:22 a.m.]: Everything ok?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [KEVIN 9:14:15]: Ye boo\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [KEVIN 9:14:28]: He doesn't listen worth shit but were fine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [KEVIN 9:14:49]: I think tori told me he [breaks] out from grass\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [KEVIN 9:15:02]: I wonder if thats why his neck n chest are broke out\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [AMANDA 9:15:48]: His ear is bruised\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [KEVIN 9:16:34]: Yeah, it sure [is]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [KEVIN 9:16:47]: [Maybe] him and [Son] were rough housing\n   [AMANDA 9:33:14]: He's very [skittish]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [KEVIN 9:40:58]: Yeah, he is I've noticed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [KEVIN 9:41:00]: Why, tho\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [KEVIN 9:47:55]: He threw up on our sheets\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   [KEVIN 9:48:24]: [Daughter] was sleeping n he started [screaming] so I [made] him lay down\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [KEVIN 9:48:32]: Then he threw up on our bed\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [AMANDA 9:53:43]: Nice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [AMANDA 9:54:23]: Strip the bed and put [what] u can in the washer please\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [KEVIN 10:02:27]: Ok\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [AMANDA 10:12:49]: Thank u how are u\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [KEVIN 10:13:07]: Good boo boo\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [AMANDA 10:32:39]: U going with me to take him[ home]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [AMANDA 10:41:48]: ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [AMANDA 11:20:32]: ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [KEVIN 11:44:12]: I thought u were taking him tomorrow\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [KEVIN 12:05:59 p.m.]: [What] time u getting off?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [AMANDA 12:32:19]: Today\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [AMANDA 12:32:27]: 1:30\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [KEVIN 12:35:39]: Ok\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   [KEVIN 12:35:53]: Thats fine because he's acting like a fucking asshole\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [KEVIN 12:36:20]: He ignores u like hes retarded hes thrown up twice n all he does is whine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [KEVIN 12:36:28]: This is the [last] time\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [KEVIN 12:37:21]: The other thing I have been entertained by is him running around saying butt fuck.

She further stated that without waking Luke, she put a diaper on him, changed his shorts, and Kevin put him in her car. While Amanda was driving Luke home, she and Kevin exchanged the following text messages:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [KEVIN 3:16:16]: Hey I love you be careful\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   [KEVIN 3:16:45]: Dont tell them o bit him back lol Blame [Son]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [KEVIN 3:17:01]: I didn't even bite him hard but apparently he bruises easy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   [AMANDA 3:18:33]: I told her he had bruises so I'll just say they were all ready there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   [AMANDA 3:18:42]: I love u too\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   [KEVIN (unspecified time) ]: Im glad we have a day off together\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [KEVIN 3:19:42]: Well he bit the shit out of me\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [KEVIN 3:19:51]: How else will he learn not to bitw\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   [KEVIN 3:19:53]: Bite\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   [AMANDA 3:20:22]: Right\n   [AMANDA 3:20:33]: I only get on u cause I know u can do better\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   [KEVIN 3:20:46]: [I'd] be more con[c]erned about all the bruises\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   When Amanda arrived at her sister's home, Victoria found Luke in a booster seat in the backseat hunched over. He was unresponsive, had a large bump on his head, had a bite mark on his arm, and was making a phlegmy sound while barely breathing. It was later discovered that Luke also had several other bruises. Nick took Luke out of the car, and Victoria\n   called 911. Nick then went to get a neighbor who was an EMT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Initially, Luke was transported by ambulance to Shore Memorial Hospital in Nassawadox, Virginia but, given the grave nature of his condition, he was promptly transported by helicopter to King's Daughters Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. Luke was taken into surgery immediately upon arrival. He never regained consciousness. Luke died on Tuesday, May 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Kevin Sewell was charged with (1) first-degree murder, (2) first-degree child abuse, (3) second-degree murder, and (4) neglect of a minor. Amanda Sewell was also charged in the death of Luke, but was granted immunity by the State and compelled to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Before trial, a hearing was held on defense counsel's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to exclude the text messages between Kevin and his wife while Luke was in his care. The basis for the motion was the marital communications privilege. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   During the trial, the State moved into evidence screenshots of the text messages containing timestamps. Over defense counsel's continuing objection, the screenshots of the text messages were received in evidence as a State's exhibit. The text messages were also read into the record in a colloquy between Amanda and the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   At trial, Dr. Suzanne Starling, the medical director of the child abuse program at the Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters, testified that she examined Luke when he arrived at the hospital. She observed that \"he was covered in bruises from head to toe.\" She noted that Luke had multiple injuries, which included a large bruise on his stomach; bruises on both hips; bruises on his legs, arms, and underneath his armpit; several injuries across his chest; and \"a very large bruise from his forehead up into his hair.\" On the left side of his face, he had a small cut underneath his eye, bruising on the front of his cheek, bruising across his jawbone, bruising inside his ear, bruising underneath his chin, and several bruises around his neck. Starling testified that Luke had similar injuries to the right side of his face. These injuries included \"bruises all around his hairline, bruises all in front of his ear, and his right ear [was] really significantly bruised inside, and even swollen around the outside, and the bruises extend[ed] all the way down from his jawbone onto his neck.\" In addition, Luke \"had a very large bite mark on his right shoulder,\" a bite mark on his left shoulder, and a bite mark on his left forearm. The doctor also testified that \"the skin from the base of [Luke's] penis to the tip of his penis [had] been removed.\" Starling opined, with a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that \"the bruises were inflicted,\" meaning \"they didn't occur by accident.\" She determined that \"a blow to the abdomen caused [Luke] to have abdomen trauma,\" and that he sustained abusive head trauma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Starling concluded that the fatal injury did not occur until after breakfast on Sunday, May 3. She explained that Luke \"would not be expected to eat normally\" due to the severity of his head injury and abdominal trauma, and the \"fact that he was able to sit up and eat breakfast demonstrates that he had not received his fatal injury at that time.\" Starling testified that Luke was \"clearly significantly injured at the time that he lost consciousness later in the morning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   After Luke's death, Dr. Wendy Gunther performed an autopsy. At trial, Gunther testified that Luke sustained a minimum of 40 to 50 injuries, and that his brain was still in the\n   process of swelling when she performed the autopsy. Based on her observations, Gunther concluded, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Luke died from \"shaken/slam syndrome\n   with many other injuries contributing.\" She explained that when \"a child is shaken, or shaken and slammed, their brain is injured,\" and when the brain sustains an injury, it swells. Gunther concluded that someone punched or hit Luke on the top of his head causing \"direct blunt trauma to his head.\" She also observed that many of the injuries were \"control injuries,\" which occur \"anyplace where a person's hands would naturally fall when grabbing a child to control it,\" such as the arms, legs, stomach, and hip. Like Starling, Gunther testified that Luke's injuries were recently inflicted, as they did not \"look like they[ were] starting to heal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Kevin Sewell was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree child abuse, and neglect of a minor child. Sewell timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In a reported decision,\n   <em>\n    Sewell v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493447\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/670/12493447/#p114\">\n    236 Md.

Concluding that the State failed to do so, it held that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the text messages, and it remanded the case for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493446,12493447\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/670/\">\n    180 A.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 9-101(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"CJP\"). There are two distinct marital privileges: the first, protecting confidential marital communications, and the second, privileging adverse spousal testimony. Here, the confidential marital communications privilege is at issue. In Maryland, this privilege is codified at CJP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00a7 9-105, \"Confidential communications occurring during marriage.\" This section provides that \"[o]ne spouse is not competent to disclose any confidential communication between the spouses occurring during their marriage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493446,12493447\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/670/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The privilege is available in both civil and criminal trials and may be invoked by either spouse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joseph F.

Regarding the confidential marital communications privilege, the State asserts that, to the extent that it has been construed in the past, this Court has been too \"liberal\" and untethered the privilege from its original purpose-to preserve and promote marital and family harmony. All testimonial privileges, the State contends, should be disfavored and narrowly construed. Sewell, on the other hand, sees no conflict to resolve. Instead, Sewell characterizes all past case law as broadly interpreting the marital communications privilege and recognizing few, if any, exceptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Typically, \"privilege statutes are interpreted narrowly.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

Accordingly, Wong-Wing \"ran the risk\" that others could have overheard or retrieved the message and had no reasonable expectation of\n   confidentiality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"32322\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/156/597/#p610\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"32322\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/156/597/#p610\">\n    at 610\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"32322\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/156/597/#p610\">\n    847 A.2d 1206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the State demonstrated that the circumstances surrounding Wong-Wing's communication destroyed his expectation of confidentiality-knowing that multiple individuals had access to the answering machine, he chose to leave his message there anyway. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that evidence about Sherry's living arrangements rebutted the presumption of confidentiality. For Wong-Wing to trust that these messages would be confidential simply was not reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The State would have us extend this rationale to encompass text messages generally, including the ones at issue here. It focuses on the\n   <em>\n    Wong-Wing\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning that \"[e]ven if there were any ambiguity, 'the disfavor with which the law looks on testimonial privileges dictates that we resolve an ambiguity against the privilege, rather than in its favor.' \" Praising the\n   <em>\n    Wong-Wing\n   </em>\n   rationale, the State asserts: \"The merit of the approach taken in\n   <em>\n    Wong-Wing\n   </em>\n   is that it imposes a reasonable and pragmatic limitation on an otherwise boundless presumption of entitlement to a policy-based privilege that itself was never intended to be boundless.\" It further advances that \"[i]f a spouse chooses to communicate in a manner that assumes a practical risk that someone other than the intended recipient could retrieve the message, there is no logical basis for 'presuming' that the person intended for the communication to be confidential[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   We are not in lock-step with the State's view of text messages. We agree, rather, with Sewell that the circumstances in\n   <em>\n    Wong-Wing\n   </em>\n   differ from those in this case. We see a substantial difference between traditional answering machines (prevalent before cell phones) and the text messaging capabilities of modern cell phones. Because cell phones are so small, they are highly portable, and can be easily carried in a pocket or purse. Conceivable scenarios exist wherein a party could reasonably believe a text message to be confidential, just as scenarios exist wherein this assumption would not be reasonable. Thus, it would be unwise to presume that text\n   messages\n   themselves can never be confidential. Again, it was the State's responsibility to make a demonstration one way or the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) Confidentiality of Matters the Spouse is Mandated to Report\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In the alternative, the State focuses on the nature of the crime-arguing that \"every federal circuit court to have ever considered the issue has interpreted an exception to the corresponding federal privilege in cases of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , child abuse,\" and citing cases from multiple federal jurisdictions. It emphasizes that \"child abuse occurs most often in the home at the hands of a parent or parent-substitute. Testimony regarding confidential marital communications may constitute critical evidence in such cases.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Breton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825936\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1/#p11\">\n    740 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (1st Cir. 2014). It continues, \"Several states, and the District of Columbia, recognize a similar exception by court rule or statute.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Maryland, the State asserts, has also legislatively recognized an exception concerning child abuse, citing Maryland Code (1987, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 5-705(a)(1) of the Family Law Article (\"FL\"). This requires that \"notwithstanding any other provision of law, including a law on privileged communications\" any person in Maryland \"who has reason to believe that a child has been subjected to abuse or neglect\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   notify the local [Department of Social Services] or the appropriate law enforcement agency.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3825936\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/740/1/#p11\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The State sees the Family Law Article as \"reflect[ing] a legislative determination that preserving marital harmony, though a legitimate value in its own right, is not predominant over society's interest in identifying and prosecuting the abuse of children in\n   Maryland.\" It submits that Sewell had no reasonable expectation of confidentiality when he communicated something his wife had a statutory duty to disclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Sewell, although not specifically addressing FL \u00a7 5-705 in his brief, generally responds that the marital communications privilege applies, even when made in furtherance of a crime, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Mazzone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993607\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/379/\">\n    336 Md. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993607\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/379/\">\n    648 A.2d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). During oral arguments, Sewell seemed to suggest that, were the General Assembly intending that marital communications regarding child abuse or neglect be exempted from the marital privilege, it would have done so in the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, not the Family Law Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   There are few matters our State takes more seriously than child abuse. Thus, we examine carefully the impact of FL \u00a7 5-705 on the marital communications privilege, especially in light of the General Assembly's explicitly broad statement of application-\"notwithstanding any other provision of law.\" Mandatory reporting for suspected child abuse has existed for some time, but it was previously only a requirement for health practitioners, police officers, educators, and human service workers.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1993607\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/336/379/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 5-704(a).

It is also readily distinguished from the present case. Retrieving a ring from a third party is not a circumstance requiring disclosure because the task could have been carried out without revealing the husband's communication. Further, unlike the child abuse reporting statute, no law requires disclosure of all known or suspected illegal activity to law enforcement. Because it is reasonable to expect that a spouse will not betray the other spouse's marital trust, the communication remains encased in its confidential patina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   But the tipping point is reached when the privilege is asserted with respect to information the other spouse is under a legal duty to disclose to law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Amanda\n   Sewell, like all Marylanders, owed a legal duty to make a report if she had any \"reason to believe\" that a child was the victim of abuse or neglect, \"\n   <strong>\n    notwithstanding any other provision of law\n   </strong>\n   .\" FL \u00a7 5-705(a)(1) (emphasis added).

To the degree that the present statutes are in conflict-and we need not decide whether there is an \"irreconcilable conflict\" here- FL \u00a7 5-705 would control the Court's reading in this instance. The confidential marital communications privilege has existed,\n   in some fashion, since 1864.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1864 Md. Laws ch. 109 at 137. The mandated reporting requirement, as discussed earlier, was not enacted until 1987. Thus, were these statutes in conflict, we would presume that the General Assembly knew the language of CJP \u00a7 9-105 and passed the reporting statute with the intention that it control.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Excluding statements regarding child abuse from the realm of \"confidential\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   marital communications is also sensible policy aligned with the privilege's purpose.

Therefore, offenses against a \"spouse, child, or cohabitant ... most strongly implicate the policy that justifies the creation\" of an exception to the marital communication privilege. 6C-13 Edward J.

On Sunday at 9:07 a.m., after Amanda had been at work for a couple of hours, she texted Kevin to see if \"everything [was] ok.\" A series of messages followed, during which Kevin complained that Luke \"doesn't listen worth shit,\" was \"acting like a f---ing asshole,\" had vomited, and that it had been a \"day from hell.\" After work, Amanda changed Luke's diaper after the skin from the base of Luke's penis to the tip of his penis had been removed, and discovered that Luke had large bitemarks on his body. It is palpable that, by the time Amanda placed Luke in her car to take him back to his parents-and very likely before that-she possessed the requisite \"reason to believe\" that Luke had been the victim of child abuse at the hands of her husband, and knew that her husband had bitten the child causing the marks. Amanda's awareness of the severity of the abuse is evident in the couple's effort to conceal the source of Luke's injuries from Luke's parents. Indeed, the text messages indicate that Amanda had to \"get on\" Kevin before about similar behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The injuries were so severe that, upon seeing her child, Luke's mother immediately realized he was in grave danger-he was unresponsive, covered in bruises, and \"making a phlegmy sound\" while barely breathing. Under these circumstances, no reasonable person could miss the abuse. Thus, Amanda was mandated to report this information, and by law,\n   none of her husband's text messages relating to the time during which Luke was in his care were confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Information or circumstances giving rise to a reportable incident of child abuse need not be found in each individual communication to be admissible.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Utah v. Widdison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244317\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/4/100/\">\n    4 P.3d 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 n.9 (Utah Ct. App. 2000) (recounting the testimony from a wife concerning statements by her former husband that gave rise to suspected child abuse and were admitted over an objection invoking the confidential marital communications privilege). Reporting can be cumulative. For example, some suspicions of abuse are built up over time-e.g., from ongoing conversations and experience with a child or their suspected abuser-while others are gained instantaneously-e.g., seeing a child with injuries clearly suggesting abuse. Regardless, once a mandated reporter possesses the necessary \"reason to believe\" that a child has been the victim of abuse,\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   information \"that would help to determine\" the individual suspected of the abuse and the circumstances surrounding that suspicion\n   <strong>\n    shall\n   </strong>\n   be revealed, \"notwithstanding any other provision of law, including a law on privileged communications,\" FL \u00a7\u00a7 5-704(c), 5-705(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, Amanda was obligated by law to report the suspected abuse, including each text message quoted in this opinion. They were not protected by the confidential marital communications privilege because it was not reasonable for Kevin to believe that his text message communications were confidential when they pertained to child abuse and must be disclosed. It matters not whether Kevin thought they were confidential at the time he sent them. A court performs an objective analysis, and based on such, clearly the privilege does not attach to communications relating to child abuse. The entire collection of text messages relate to Kevin's actions that day as caretaker for the children, and therefore, they were admissible against him for all charges relating to and stemming from child abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   We hold that courts should continue to narrowly construe all privileges. Even so, the confidential marital communications privilege contains a rebuttable presumption of confidentiality once other elements are established. Further, text messages, like other marital communications, are presumed to be confidential, unless the party advocating for their admission can establish that they were not. Finally, we hold that it is unreasonable for a spouse to assume that communication made to the other spouse, which the latter has a legal duty to report to law enforcement, is confidential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The text messages in this case were properly admitted against Respondent.

The marital communications privilege is codified in Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"Cts. &amp; Jud.

Proc. \u00a7 9-106 and\n   <strong>\n    explicitly contemplates\n   </strong>\n   that the privilege will not apply in cases of child abuse. The statute reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   (a) The spouse of a person on trial for a crime may not be compelled to testify as an adverse witness\n   <strong>\n    unless the charge involves:\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The abuse of a child under 18[.]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   (emphasis added). Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 9-106 clearly provides an exception to the privilege, and is evidence that the General Assembly could have written an exception into Cts. &amp; Jud.

Instead, the Majority contends that a\n   <strong>\n    separate\n   </strong>\n   Article of the Maryland Code, the Family Law Article, should guide our interpretation of Cts. &amp; Jud.

Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 9-105 and 9-106 provides evidence that the marital communications privilege is construed more broadly than its counterpart. An analysis of our case law also reveals that the marital communications privilege has been interpreted more broadly relative to our interpretation of other evidentiary privileges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    CASE PRECEDENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ashford v.
