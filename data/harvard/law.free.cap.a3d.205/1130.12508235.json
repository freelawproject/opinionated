He argues the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, that he was denied a fair trial based on certain evidence rulings and that this offense should not have been graded as a third-degree crime under N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(c). We find the statute is constitutional, there were no trial errors that were \"clearly capable of producing an unjust result,\"\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   2:10-2, and there was substantial evidence to support grading this conviction as a third-degree offense under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The evidence adduced at trial revealed that J.R.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and defendant met via an internet dating site in October 2010 and began dating a month later. J.R. ran an internet marketing agency called XYZ,\n   which she founded. Defendant, a schoolteacher, was then unemployed. He began to assist her with work as an independent contractor. Their romantic relationship ended following a heated argument in early February 2011. She testified she broke up with defendant because he had become more demanding of her time, would call her repeatedly if she did not answer her phone, and because her daughter was \"very uncomfortable\" with his presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   J.R. testified that defendant sobbed and begged her to reconcile with him, and then in the same conversation yelled at her and threatened to \"ruin\" her life, her business career, and her reputation. He said he would hurt her \"in any way possible.\" Although their professional relationship continued for about a month after the breakup, because of pending work, it too ended badly with J.R. sending defendant cease-and-desist letters to discontinue his contacts with her clients, and accusing him of undermining those relationships. Defendant then sued J.R. for uncompensated work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   J.R. testified that defendant began to join groups she belonged to and attend events when she would be present. She had a scheduled speaking engagement in March 2011 before the Camden County Chamber of Commerce, and defendant joined that group. She testified she was \"very alarmed.\" In April 2011, defendant joined the South Jersey Business Networking Group. In November 2011, J.R. posted on the Camden County Chamber's LinkedIn webpage promoting an event she was organizing. Defendant commented on J.R.'s post, stating that he intended to attend. In January 2012, defendant attended a joint networking event for the Philadelphia and Camden Chambers of Commerce; J.R. was a member of the board. In April 2012, J.R. saw defendant at an event for a group she had founded called the \"Ladies Networking Group.\" Then, in June 2012, a friend warned J.R. not to attend a rotary luncheon because defendant was there. J.R. testified she was \"upset and shaking\" when she learned he was there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.R. learned in April 2011 that defendant had begun following her on Twitter. J.R. immediately \"blocked\" defendant,\n   thereby preventing him from following or contacting her on that platform.\n   In November 2012, J.R. learned about a website titled \"Band Aid Justice,\" where videos were posted that appeared to disparage her. These also were on streaming video websites, YouTube and Vimeo, under an account with the same name. The court admitted into evidence two videos from this series. These videos were titled for purposes of the trial: \"Cross-Motion Claiming Physical Violence\" (\"Physical Violence\"), and \"Who Asked for Your Opinion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.R. testified that defendant \"tagged\" her in the \"Physical Violence\" video, though he did not refer to her by name in that video. She said a \"tag\" is a feature by which YouTube allows a user, who is posting a video, to place a \"tag\" on the video, which could include a person's name. The purpose of a tag \"is to be able to have [the video] discovered when a person searches for that term.\" Then, if a user has set up a \"Google alert\" for a name or term, Google will notify the user every time that name or term is tagged in a video or mentioned online. J.R. explained to defendant while they were dating that she received Google alerts when her name or business was mentioned online. Thus, she alleged that defendant knew that she would receive a Google alert each time he tagged her on one of his videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the \"Physical Violence\" video, defendant criticized the justice system and explained that he was the subject of false accusations that could trigger an \"emotional response.\" This video featured a clip from the film\n   <em>\n    Inglourious Basterds\n   </em>\n   , which J.R. testified scared her, because it depicted a man grabbing a blonde woman by the throat and strangling her to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The \"Who Asked for Your Opinion\" video featured a recording of the song, \"One Way or Another\" by Blondie with the lyrics: \"[o]ne way or another, I'm gonna find ya', I'm gonna get ya', get ya', get ya', get ya'.\" J.R. testified that the videos \"terrified\" her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant posted other videos to a website called MonkeyCom modeled after her business's website, but on MonkeyCom her face was photoshopped over the caricature of a monkey. Defendant posted these videos to YouTube under an account with the same name. During the period of the indictment, January 2, 2013 to\n   May 15, 2013, defendant posted 176 videos to the MonkeyCom site and YouTube account. Ten of the MonkeyCom videos were shown to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   J.R. discovered MonkeyCom after she received a Google alert. In five of the ten \"MonkeyCom\" videos, defendant refers to himself by name, either verbally or in screen text, as a \"stalker,\" \"harasser,\" and an \"internet troll.\" Four feature the J.R. photoshopped caricature alongside text identifying her by name as a \"criminal at large.\" Three claim or imply that J.R. is suffering from a mental illness. J.R. testified that she was scared upon watching the video series because she feared he was trying to \"drive [her] business to the ground.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   J.R. testified that another video titled for purposes of trial, \"RU Burger Farms Breakfast Patties\" (\"RU Burger Farms\"), made her scared for her safety. That video shows J.R.'s dog \"Ruger,\" a Belgian Malinois. J.R. testified she obtained Ruger for protection from defendant. This video shows what purports to be a box of sausage patties made from \"Belgian Malinois meat products,\" with a picture of a dog resembling Ruger photoshopped onto the box. Defendant then is shown sitting at a table dining on the sausage patties and commenting on how delicious they are, noting, among other descriptions, their \"gooey taste\" and \"nice bloody center.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In another video, \"Coming Soon MonkeyCom [XYZ] [J.R.],\" after Ruger's image fades, it is replaced with meat processing footage. Following that are video clips of monkeys in business suits in an office that defendant calls the XYZ \"corporate office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In \"MonkeyCom News [J.R.] of [XYZ] Reports Her Dog as Being Eaten\" (\"MonkeyCom News\"), defendant identified J.R. by name and then narrated a story that was filled with sexually explicit double entendres involving a rooster and cat. J.R. testified that she felt disgusted by this video and found it to be pornographic and sick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the spring of 2013, when the MonkeyCom account was active, J.R. received more than 100 Google alerts notifying her that she\n   had been mentioned or \"tagged\" in one of defendant's videos. J.R. testified she eventually disbanded XYZ because of the \"MonkeyCom\" series and had to seek professional help to deal with the emotional impact of the videos. J.R. stopped public speaking and attending networking events from fear she would encounter defendant or say something he would parody in a video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A detective for the Division of Criminal Justice testified that defendant's internet browser included websites called getrevenge.com, getrevengeonyourex.com, and bestrevengewebsites.html that defendant had bookmarked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   J.R. obtained a temporary restraining order (TRO) against defendant in March 2011, but then agreed to the entry of civil restraints. On August 2, 2012, both parties consented to entry of an Indefinite Temporary Restraining Order (ITRO). This prohibited defendant from contacting J.R. through any means, including electronic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant testified that he, not J.R., ended the dating relationship; he wanted to spend more time with her but she was busy with work and family pressures. She also wanted to run for a local political office and it \"scared\" him because that was \"another thing that came into the relationship.\" He testified that at one point, she did not return his calls but had time to post to Facebook, which made defendant \"very, very angry,\" and he ended the relationship as a result following a \"heated discussion.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   He acknowledged receiving a cease-and-desist letter from an attorney. He filed a civil suit against J.R. Then his unemployment was terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant testified it was just a coincidence that in 2011 and 2012, he and J.R. attended the same events. He joined the same groups to which she had belonged, because he was unemployed and needed to network because building websites and design work was his only marketable skill. At some point, however, he was asked not to attend an event and was threatened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant testified that he tagged videos not to send them to J.R. but to make his viewers aware that J.R. was the subject of his videos. The MonkeyCom series of videos were parodies where he commented on and mocked things J.R. had said about him; he explained they were not \"about\" her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant believed that J.R. was stalking and harassing him. He used the Blondie song in a Band Aid Justice Video because he identified with Blondie, who he said was being stalked at the time she released the song.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant testified the \"RU Burger Farms\" videos were a response to J.R.'s video of Ruger-that she posted to YouTube-commanding her dog to \"get him,\" and \"eat him.\" Defendant assumed this was about him even though he was not mentioned by name. His videos were intended to be jokes, not threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged entries from his diary that were written between October and November 2011, saying he was \"sad and angry\" from the breakup, was \"chasing [J.R.]\" in his \"mind,\" and was \"constantly trying to find a way to get revenge.\" In January 2012, he wrote, \"I need [J.R.] so I feel more valuable than I see myself to be. I have no one to impress. I want to have the one I love be impressed by who I am.\" In the same entry, defendant wrote, \"Dear [J.R.] ... I didn't think you had me in your plans, but I'm making sure that you remember me. I'm making sure you know I'm alive and real and that I have feelings. What you've done by moving me aside I'll never forget.\" In an entry from April 2012, defendant wrote that his actions in signing up for chamber events were not the \"best decision, but [he] was angry.\" Defendant said these entries had nothing to do with J.R. but were examples of cathartic writing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In August 2013, defendant was indicted on one count of third-degree stalking, N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(c), for conduct during the period from January 2, 2013 to May 15, 2013, in violation of the ITRO. The court bifurcated the trial with defendant's consent. The jury\n   would first hear evidence about the stalking offense without any reference to the ITRO, and then, if the jury convicted defendant of stalking, the same jury would hear evidence about the ITRO to determine whether the stalking offense warranted grading it as a third-degree crime. Defendant was self-represented during the trial with stand-by counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant was convicted of stalking following a multiple-day jury trial. The same jury then heard the second issue, determining that defendant's stalking violated the ITRO. That finding raised the stalking offense to a third-degree crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(c). Defendant was sentenced to a four-year term of probation conditioned on 364 days of incarceration. A permanent restraining order for the stalking conviction was issued under N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, defendant contends the anti-stalking statute is unconstitutional because N.J.S.A. 2C:12-10(a)(1) imposes an improper restriction on the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. He argues the trial court's decision to admit evidence of conduct that occurred pre-indictment as both intrinsic evidence and under N.J.R.E. 404(b), in combination with a deficient limiting instruction, constituted plain error. He further contends he was denied a fair trial when the trial court excluded a video that he wanted the jury to see as part of his defense, and by allowing improper lay opinion testimony. Even if the conviction for stalking were proven, which defendant denies, he argues his conviction for third-degree stalking must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We start with defendant's constitutional challenge to the anti-stalking statute. The trial court denied defendant's pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment based on his claim the anti-stalking statute violated his First Amendment right to free speech and was unconstitutionally vague. During the trial, when defendant reasserted\n   the constitutional arguments, the trial court ruled that the anti-stalking statute was not a content-based restriction on free speech. On appeal, defendant contends the statute criminalizes speech made in a public forum to willing listeners in violation of the State and Federal Constitutions. Even if the videos were \"distasteful,\" he argues they are protected speech. He contends the anti-stalking\n   statute penalizes him for the content of his speech in the videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In 2009, the anti-stalking statute was amended to provide as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   a. As used in this act:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) \"Course of conduct\" means repeatedly maintaining a visual or physical proximity to a person; directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, following, monitoring, observing, surveilling, threatening,\n   <em>\n    or communicating to or about, a person\n   </em>\n   , or interfering with a person's property; repeatedly committing harassment against a person; or repeatedly conveying, or causing to be conveyed, verbal or written threats or threats conveyed by any other means of communication or threats implied by conduct or a combination thereof directed at or toward a person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) \"Repeatedly\" means on two or more occasions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (3) \"Emotional distress\" means significant mental suffering or distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (4) \"Cause a reasonable person to fear\" means to cause fear which a reasonable victim, similarly situated, would have under the circumstances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   b. A person is guilty of stalking, a crime of the fourth degree, if he purposefully or knowingly engages in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to fear for his safety or the safety of a third person or suffer other emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   c.

He also argues the trial court's \"hybrid\" jury instruction that addressed the use of pre-indictment evidence was deficient because it did not tell the jury it could not use pre-indictment evidence to prove the course of conduct element under the stalking statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The pre-indictment evidence included: defendant's emotional outburst after his\n   relationship with J.R. ended and his threat to \"ruin\" her; defendant's civil lawsuit against J.R.; his attempt to\n   follow her on Twitter; his attendance at networking events that J.R. attended; his joining of clubs with which he knew she was affiliated; and two Band Aid Justice videos from prior to January 2, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This evidence was admitted without objection by defendant. In fact, defendant invited the introduction of this evidence to explain his conduct and also opposed the State's effort, in the initial portion of the trial, to exclude evidence of the prior restraining order and his litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The trial court ruled that the pre-indictment evidence was admissible both as intrinsic evidence that directly proved the crime and under N.J.R.E. 404(b) as evidence of motive or intent.

We find no error by the trial judge in admitting this as relevant evidence that was probative and not unduly prejudicial. Although it may have been error to treat this evidence as both intrinsic and under Rule 404(b), we do not find that error rose to the level of plain error.

She stated her \"concern was that he was stalking [her] through [her] LinkedIn and attempting to connect with people that [she] was connected to.\" J.R. testified the videos concerned her because \"[i]t's like everything that I'm doing is subject to ridicule and question and ongoing harassment, and ... to me it's stalking.\" She testified her business was suffering and she \"was personally afraid.\" She sought professional help \"to talk to somebody .... It was an ongoing barrage of harassment, intimidation and stalking.\" Another witness, A.C., also testified that J.R. stopped attending events because she indicated that in some fashion she was being \"stalked\" or \"harassed\" by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We do not agree that admission of this testimony constituted plain error. A.C.'s testimony described the effect the defendant's conduct had on J.R. and was not admitted for the truth of whether defendant stalked or harassed J.R. Thus, this was not offered as opinion testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   When J.R. testified, she did use terms such as harassment and stalking; however,\n   that testimony when read in context was not so much an opinion by J.R. but a description of her subjective state of mind placed in layman's terms. Moreover, the anti-stalking statute required an evaluation of the facts against an objective measure and not against J.R.'s subjective perception. In defendant's videos played to the jury, he also described himself as \"a stalker, harasser and a troll.\" Thus, this record did not warrant reversal because the comments were not clearly capable of producing an unjust result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Defendant contends his conviction for third-degree stalking should be vacated because \"the jury was not instructed that it could not consider any of the evidence of conduct prior to the issuance of the [ITRO] in reaching its verdict.\" We do not agree there was error warranting the requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Procedurally, once the jury returned a guilty verdict on the stalking charge, the court commenced part two of the bifurcated\n   trial, notifying the jury it had to address whether defendant committed stalking in violation of the August 2, 2012 court order. The ITRO was marked as evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In charging the jury, the trial court advised that it could \"consider the evidence that you've already heard in the initial case.\" It also read the verdict sheet to the jury prior to its deliberations, which framed the issue for the jury to decide whether defendant did \"on diverse dates between the 2nd of January 2013 through the 15th day of May 2013 ... commit the crime of stalking in violation of an existing [c]ourt [o]rder prohibiting the behavior.\" The jury had the verdict sheet during its deliberations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We have already addressed the use of the pre-indictment intrinsic evidence. The question posed to the jury at this stage was whether defendant committed the crime of stalking from January 2 to May 15, 2013, after the August 2, 2012 order was entered. The court narrowly framed this issue for the jury and it had the verdict sheet during its deliberations for added guidance.
