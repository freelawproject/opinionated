Outland was found guilty of second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2 and 2C:15-1, and second-degree robbery, N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After merging the convictions, the trial judge sentenced defendant to a\n   sixteen-year extended term as a persistent offender subject to the No Early Release Act. N.J.S.A. 2C:43-7.2 ; N.J.S.A. 2C:44-3(a). Defendant appeals and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We glean the facts from the trial record. Defendant worked next door to a check cashing establishment and often took coffee in the morning to Claudia Cardenas, the check cashing employee. She worked in the rear where the safety deposit box was located, protected by a system of two security doors. Exterior video footage taken on the date of the robbery, April 30, 2014, depicts defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   walking towards and joining two hooded figures while holding a white object, similar in appearance to a paper cup. The group moves together towards the check cashing store and disappears inside. Moments later, the two hooded figures run out. Shortly thereafter, police cars arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cardenas testified that on the morning of the robbery, defendant called in to her, and, as was her custom, she unlocked the outer security door to get the coffee. As she did so, a man forced the second security door open and punched her. She saw another man; both of their faces were covered by hoodies. Cardenas was punched in the face again and pushed down onto the floor. Approximately $ 35,000 was taken from the safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When she next raised her head, Cardenas saw defendant near the door. She asked him to call the police, and he told her to calm down because the men were dangerous. A customer entered the store, and Cardenas again asked defendant to call 9-1-1, which he did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the State rested, defendant moved the 9-1-1 recording into evidence and played the tape to the jury. Over the State's objection, the judge found the tape admissible as a present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(1), and the excited utterance exception, N.J.R.E. 803(c)(2). The judge also\n   ruled that if defendant played the tape to the jury, in rebuttal the State could play redacted portions of defendant's two recorded statements to police, and proffer his prior convictions.\n   Defense counsel played the 9-1-1 tape. In rebuttal, the State moved into evidence defendant's sanitized criminal history of four prior indictable offenses and service of state prison time, and the two redacted statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the statements, defendant denied culpability, but discussed in detail how easy it would be to plan a robbery at the check cashing store because the employees were so \"lax\" about security, and their patterns of behavior so well established. He added, \"if it was me and I knew that she opened the door like that, I could plan. I know how to plan around shit[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendant raises the following points for our consideration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    POINT I\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   AFTER THE STATE'S WITNESS TESTIFIED THAT SHE DID NOT SEE DEFENDANT CALL [9-1-1] ON THIRD-PARTY PERPETRATORS, [DEFENDANT] CHOSE NOT TO TESTIFY, BUT COUNTERED ONLY WITH PROOF THAT HE\n   <em>\n    HAD\n   </em>\n   CALLED [9-1-1].

Thus, N.J.R.E. 806 permits the admission of evidence impeaching the credibility of the hearsay declarant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant contends that the 9-1-1 call was not hearsay, on the basis that it was moved into evidence solely to disprove Cardenas's testimony that defendant had not called 9-1-1. From that premise, defendant argues that defendant's prior criminal history should have been excluded as the rules do not permit impeachment of a declarant's non-hearsay statements. The premise, however, is not supported by the record. Cardenas did not\n   deny that defendant called police-she only said that she asked him to do so and did not see him place the call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The judge observed the call could be construed as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   a bona fide excited utterance, present sense impression, or a premeditated attempt by ... defendant to distan[ce] himself from his co-conspirators/princip[als]. If ... defendant was not a conspirator/accomplice the call certainly qualifies under 803(c)(1) and (c)(2). The call was made within two minutes of the robbery.... [D]efendant requested police assistance at the check cashing store explaining that a robbery had just occurred, an event which both sides agree ... defendant had perceived. Likewise defendant's call related to a startling event, that is the robbery. Defendant's voice indicated that he was still under the stress or excitement caused by the robbery. [ ] Cardenas's distraught crying and moaning in the background of the [9-1-1] call is certainly evidence that the robbery was still fresh in the minds of both she and ... defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We agree. Trial counsel sought to have the tape admitted so the jury could hear defendant's tone and manner as evidence of his innocence. Defendant wanted the jury to hear him, not to establish that a robbery occurred, but rather to demonstrate that he made a genuine 9-1-1 call as would any bystander or victim-and the trial judge agreed, after hearing it, that on the tape defendant sounded \"excited and unreflective.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant played the recording to disprove any involvement in the conspiracy to commit the robbery. He wanted to proffer his distressed-sounding voice, recorded outside the courtroom, \"to prove the truth of the matter asserted\"-his innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.R.E. 801(c). \"[T]he matter asserted\" was not the event, but his lack of prior knowledge about it. Playing the tape for the jury to hear was, in effect, equivalent to making an assertion of innocence from the witness box.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   After ruling that the call was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, the judge went on to state that although defendant, obviously, could not be subjected to cross-examination, the State would be \"afforded the opportunity to offer evidence regarding the credibility of the call using relevant portions of any prior voluntary statement made by ... defendant pursuant to [N.J.R.E.] 803(b)(1) and [N.J.R.E.] 806, and by his prior convictions under [N.J.R.E.] 806.\" By doing so, the court acknowledged the State's theory that\n   the 9-1-1 call was, far from innocently made, designed to exonerate defendant from involvement in the robbery. In other words, that \"defendant's excitement was\n   contrived and he certainly had both the opportunity and motive to plan the call to [9-1-1] in a fabricated effort to portray himself as a victim and not a participant[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The judge observed that the tension between these conflicting interpretations of the evidence made its admission \"unique.\" He had to \"resolve the conflict between [the] duty to make the factual findings regarding the admissibility of the [9-1-1] call as comporting with two particular rules of evidence, and the ultimate issue that must be addressed by the jury.\" Having concluded that the 9-1-1 call was admissible under the relevant exceptions to the hearsay rule, the judge said he would \"not invade the province of the jury\" by deciding whether the 9-1-1 tape was proof of the conspiracy to rob.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The judge also reminded trial counsel to review the decision with his client, to ensure defendant understood the patent risks of the jury hearing his criminal history and recorded statements. In addition, the judge indicated he would charge the jury regarding defendant's credibility along with the manner in which it should weigh and consider \"the [9-1-1] call[ ] [as] a statement of defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sum, the judge framed the issue as follows. On the one hand, defendant sought admission of the 9-1-1 tape as either an excited utterance or present sense impression exception to the hearsay rule to corroborate that his presence at the moment of the robbery was mere happenstance. In that light, the call was a hearsay statement in which defendant claimed his innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the other hand, the State contended that the tape should not be admitted because the call was merely a step in the conspiracy, and necessary for defendant to advance the commission of the crime. Since defendant's purpose in admitting the tape was testimonial, his conviction history could be revealed to the jury, along\n   with the redacted statements, which the State considered inculpatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The judge based his decision on N.J.R.E. 806, which states: \"the credibility of [a hearsay] declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   evidence which would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant had testified as a witness.\" (emphasis added). The comment following the rule states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The Rule makes it clear that the credibility of a declarant is subject to attack when his statement is admitted by virtue of an exception to the hearsay exclusionary rule....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   The Rule permits impeachment or support of a declarant's credibility as if the declarant had been a witness.\n   <em>\n    This would permit, for example, a statement introduced under an exception to the hearsay rule to be impeached by evidence that the declarant had been convicted of a crime[\n   </em>\n   .] ( N.J.S.[A.] 2A:81-12 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Biunno, Weissbard &amp; Zegas,\n   <em>\n    Current N.J.

The defendant did not testify at trial; however, he admitted the 9-1-1 tape into evidence to prove that the murder was not premeditated.\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   The court ruled that the prior convictions were appropriately admitted because \"[a]dvising the jurors of the declarant's prior felony convictions aids them in assessing the trustworthiness of the declarant's statement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 814.

That possibility exists, however, in every trial in which a previously convicted defendant testifies, and his or her prior convictions are disclosed to the jury. Those juries are given the same model jury charge the trial judge gave here.
