(child).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the respondent claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the petitioner, the Commissioner of Children and Families, proved by clear and convincing evidence that (1) the Department of Children and Families made reasonable efforts to reunify her, (2) she was unable or unwilling to achieve the requisite degree of personal rehabilitation, and (3) it was in the child's best interest to terminate her parental rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record discloses that the child first entered the petitioner's care on April 6, 2016. The child was reunified with the respondent, on July 28, 2016, under an order of protective supervision and again was removed from the respondent's care on November 28, 2016. The child has been in the care and custody of the petitioner since November 28, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 2, 2017, the petitioner filed a petition to terminate the respondent's parental rights, alleging, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), that the child previously was adjudicated neglected and that the respondent had failed to rehabilitate such that she could assume a responsible position in the child's life in a reasonable time. The petitioner further alleged that termination of the respondent's parental rights was in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To prevail in a nonconsensual termination of parental rights case, the\n   petitioner must prove by clear and convincing evidence that one of the statutory grounds for termination exists. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3). If the trial court determines that failure to rehabilitate has been proven by the appropriate standard, then it must determine whether termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child. General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (2). Our standard of review on appeal is twofold.\n   <em>\n    In re Shane M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=318%20Conn.%20569\">\n    318 Conn. 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 587-88,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=122%20A.3d%201247\">\n    122 A.3d 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). First, the court's ultimate conclusion of whether a parent has failed to rehabilitate is \"[reviewed under an evidentiary sufficiency standard], that is, whether the trial court could have reasonably\n   concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify its [ultimate conclusion]....

Claiming that her parents can provide her with neither, on May 2, 2017, the Commissioner of Children and Families (commissioner) filed the pending petition to terminate their parental rights (TPR) under General Statutes \u00a7 17a-112. As statutory\n   grounds for termination, the petition alleges, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), that the child was previously found neglected and that both parents have failed to rehabilitate such that they can assume a responsible position in the child's life in a reasonable time. The petition also alleges, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (E), that the child is less than seven years of age and neglected, and that the father has both failed to rehabilitate and has lost parental rights as a consequence of another TPR petition for a different child. The petition\n   further claims that termination is in the child's best interest. Both parents appeared on the initial hearing date for the petition and, after being appointed counsel and advised of their rights, denied the allegations of the petition. Trial was then scheduled for two days in January, 2018. For the reasons discussed below, the petition is granted and the commissioner is appointed statutory parent for the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Trial began on January 8, 2018, and evidence continued for two more days. When the father, Antonio M., failed to appear on the first day of trial, a default was entered against him pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 35a-8 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner's motion to amend the petition to include additional factual allegations was thereafter granted without objection.

In a telephone conversation she had on November 19, 2016, with the respondent father, she admitted that she has been an addict for more than 20 years. See recording 461, on petitioner's exhibit 29. In April, 2016, and again in November, 2017, she told treatment providers that she was using $40 to $100 worth of cocaine on a daily basis.

Between 2005 and 2016, there were numerous such incidents between Ms. G. and Aaliya's father, Ms. G.'s mother (the children's maternal grandmother), and\n   Avia's father, Mr. M., the respondent father in the present proceeding. Many of these incidents occurred when Ms. G. was intoxicated or under the influence of drugs. The evidence also showed that in 2014 and 2015 there were numerous incidents of domestic violence between these two respondents, and at least two of those incidents occurred in front of Aaliya, who was nine years old at the time of the 2014 incident and ten years old during the 2015 incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the 2014 domestic violence incident, DCF social workers \"tried to ensure the safety and well-being of Aaliya.\" Transcript of testimony of Amber Orvis on January 8, 2018, p. 128. Ms. G. would not cooperate with the department, however, or let the DCF social worker into her home. A vivid example of her unwillingness to cooperate is provided by an incident, recounted credibly at trial by DCF social worker Orvis, when that social worker went to the mother's home in an effort to ensure that Aalyia was safe, and after she had made several attempts to gain entry, Ms. G. leaned out of her window and said \"Nice try. Try again.\" Id., 129.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In July, 2015, Mr. M. was convicted on six counts of violating a protective order that had been entered by the criminal court with Ms. G. as the intended protected person. He received suspended sentences of three years on each of those counts and three years of probation. In December, 2015, Mr. M. was arrested again, this time for assault in the third degree after assaulting Ms. G. in her home and trying to choke her, and in May, 2016, he was convicted of that charge and two counts of violation of probation, for which he received a total effective sentence of 18 months of incarceration. The call log from the Connecticut Department of Correction (DOC) entered into evidence shows that Mr. M. and Ms. G. were in constant telephone contact during that period of incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The mother's older child, Aaliya, was also the subject of a neglect petition brought in August, 2007, after DCF received the report of domestic violence two months earlier between Ms. G. and the maternal grandmother that had resulted in minor injuries to Aaliya, as described in footnote 13 of this opinion. That case resulted in an adjudication of neglect and a period of protective supervision. Ms. G.'s unaddressed mental health and substance abuse issues and the repeating cycle of domestic violence resulted in another neglect petition being filed on Aaliya's behalf in August, 2015, on the ground that the child was living under conditions injurious to her well-being. The summary of facts alleged that Ms. G. had \"not taken the proper steps to protect Aaliya from exposure to domestic violence.\" An addendum to the petition further alleged that the mother had \"neglected Aaliya by exposing her to the verbal and physical abuse\" between the parties and \"puts the child at further risk as she demonstrates no insight into the risk [that] relationship ... poses to\n   Aaliya.\" Neither parent appeared at the initial hearing on September 17, 2015, and after finding that the mother had been properly served, the child's father had been notified of the petition by publication and neither parent was in the military services of the United States, the court,\n   <em>\n    Cohn, J.\n   </em>\n   , entered defaults against both parents, adjudicated the child to be neglected, and ordered a period of six months of protective supervision with the mother.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although DCF again offered her services, Ms. G. still had no interest in cooperating, and she refused to sign any releases of information (which would have been necessary so that DCF could refer her to a service provider, for otherwise statutory confidentiality laws would have prevented the department from discussing her with any third party\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   On March 31, 2016, two weeks after the expiration of protective supervision in the 2015 neglect proceeding, the department received a report from The Hospital of\n   Central Connecticut that Ms. G. had tested positive for cocaine and marijuana at the time of Avia's birth. Although the baby's urine tested negative for drugs, the meconium was later determined to be positive for cocaine. A DCF investigator spoke to hospital workers, one of whom told the investigator that the mother had acted erratically when told about the positive drug test and had \"presented manic at times in the hospital.\" Petitioner's exhibit 22, DCF Investigation Protocol, p.\n   6. When the investigator initially met with Ms. G., the mother denied having used cocaine while pregnant, but \"appeared sluggish, delayed in her responses ... [and] combative at times .... She did not appear to be remorseful or apologetic. She did not appear to understand the concerns concerning the drug exposure and impact to her newborn infant.\" Id., 7. A few hours later, however, the mother \"admitted to continuous marijuana, cocaine and alcohol use throughout her pregnancy with Avia [and that] ... she is addicted to drugs and needs help.\" Id. (her admission to continuous drug use during the pregnancy signifies that she had been using drugs throughout the period of protective supervision on the 2015 neglect case, and her lack of cooperation had prevented the department from learning about that substance abuse). The department offered to refer her to an inpatient substance abuse program at which her newborn child might also be placed with her, and although originally appearing receptive to that suggestion, within a few days the mother \"was refusing to enter into substance abuse treatment.\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   At the hospital, the mother agreed to a DCF safety plan that the maternal grandmother would take care of Aaliya and Avia and not permit Ms. G. to have unsupervised contact with the baby. On April 4, 2016, Avia was released from the hospital, but two days later the maternal grandmother asked DCF to take the child, and Ms. G., who had also been released from the hospital, admitted that \"she got really drunk last night and smoked marijuana.\" Id., 8. She also told the social worker: \"If I had money, I would have bought cocaine and did that too.\" She told the social worker that \"she does not care anymore and that she wants DCF to take her kids.\" Id. The department invoked a 96 hour hold on Avia and removed her from the maternal grandmother's care, sought and obtained orders of temporary custody\n   (OTCs) for both children,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   and filed neglect petitions on behalf of both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   On April 15, 2016, Avia's parents both appeared at the preliminary hearing on the OTC, were appointed counsel and advised of their rights, entered denials to the allegations of neglect, but agreed for the OTC to be sustained. On April 28, 2016, Ms. G. entered an inpatient substance abuse treatment program at the New Life Center. Having continued to use drugs until then, she tested positive for cocaine and marijuana upon intake. According to the testimony of Samantha Larkin, a residential counselor at NLC, and certain written exhibits prepared by NLC about the mother's treatment there, Ms. G. initially appeared to do well there. She worked on her mental health issues (her counselor there testified that she had diagnoses of bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ), her substance abuse history, and her \"history of abusive relationships,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   particularly with Avia's father, Mr. M. On July\n   28, 2016, the mother entered a plea of nolo contendere to the neglect petition, and the child was placed with her at NLC under an order of protective supervision for nine months (without\n   prejudice to Mr. M., who was allowed to stand silent as a noncustodial parent a month later).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   On November 7, 2016, Ms. G. returned to the facility from a pass in an intoxicated state, and she admitted to having driven Avia in her vehicle while in that condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   NLC notified the department, which removed the child from her mother's care on a 96 hour hold, sought and obtained another OTC for the child, and filed a motion to modify the disposition (from protective supervision to commitment). After initially contesting that motion and the OTC, on November 28, 2016, both parents subsequently agreed to the motion for modification, the OTC was withdrawn, and Avia was committed to the commissioner. She has been placed in nonrelative foster care since then, in the same household where she had lived during the three months between the original OTC and her placement with Ms. G. under protective supervision at NLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Ms. G. stayed at the NLC for only another week after Avia's removal and left the facility on November 14, 2016, against the advice of her counselor there. That counselor, Samantha Larkin, testified that \"I definitely wanted her to stay,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the NLC Discharge Form reports that \"[c]lient presented irrational and impulsive\n   at time [of] discharge. Expectations for future function are poor due to [client's] inability to remain in treatment and collaborate on discharge and aftercare in order to facilitate a smooth transition back into the community.\" Petitioner's exhibit 5, CHR Discharge Form dated November 15, 2016, p. 1. The DCF social worker recommended to Ms. G. that she enter another inpatient mother-daughter treatment program at Amethyst House, but she refused. NLC referred her to the intensive outpatient program at Wheeler Clinic, and DCF then adopted that recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   While the mother was attending the inpatient mother-child treatment program at the New Life Center between April and November of 2016, DCF had referred her to The Connection for case management and subsidized housing through the Supportive Housing Program. After leaving NLC, Ms. G. found a three bedroom apartment that The Connection agreed would satisfy the subsidy requirements, and Ms. G. moved into that apartment later in November. The Supportive Housing program provided her with \"basic furniture\" for the\n   apartment, paid off an outstanding electric bill of $1600, and paid the gas company $100 to activate gas service. (The Connection program also helped her in other ways, such as assisting with immigration issues and providing transportation to an inpatient program.) Ms. G. has lived at that apartment ever since, although at the end of evidence she was behind in her rent, out of compliance with Supportive Housing requirements, and did not yet have employment or legal income to pay for her rent and other expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Over the course of the next few months after leaving the NLC facility, Ms. G. entered and was discharged unsuccessfully from a number of substance abuse treatment programs. She began attending LifeLine, Wheeler Clinic's Adult Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP), but by mid-January, 2017, however, she had relapsed on cocaine and stopped going to treatment there, and Wheeler Clinic then discharged her for noncompliance. She told The Connection case manager that she had stopped going to Wheeler Clinic because \"LifeLine [IOP] was not helping her.\" Petitioner's exhibit 18, DCF Monthly Client Contact Reports from The Connection, report dated February 3, 2017. She told a DCF social worker on January 23, 2017, that she \"wanted to go inpatient\"; petitioner's exhibit 23, Running Narrative Document, p. 15 of 138; but two days later she said that she no longer wanted to go inpatient \"and felt she could maintain her sobriety doing Intensive Outpatient Treatment.\" Id. Next, she went to the Intensive Outpatient Program at the Farrell Treatment Center, but by the end of February, 2017, she had also been discharged from that program unsuccessfully, with Farrell recommending that she engage in a higher level of care in an inpatient program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Instead, Ms. G. went to another Intensive Outpatient Program, this one at Community Mental Health Affiliates, beginning on March 9, 2017. From the court's perspective, however, that treatment did not begin on an\n   auspicious note, as she lied to program staff at her initial intake when she claimed that \"she had been sober 8 years until she recently (Dec. 2016) relapsed\n   on intermittent cocaine and marijuana use when her abusive husband was released from jail.\" Petitioner's exhibit 31, CMHA Intake Assessment, dated March 9, 2017, p. 1. She participated in that IOP program for two months, but missed seventeen of her scheduled thirty-one appointments. After she continued to relapse, CMHA discharged her in May, 2017, as unsuccessful for noncompliance with its treatment and poor attendance and recommended a higher level of treatment for her in an inpatient program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Over the next few months, the mother procrastinated about entering the inpatient treatment that had been recommended after her unsuccessful discharges from the IOP programs at Farrell Treatment Center and CMHA. For example, she told her The Connection case manager that she \"planned to go into rehab on May 22,\" at the New Life Center in Putnam. Respondent mother's exhibit B, The Connection Client Chronological Notes, unspecified date, p. 27. But her next formal treatment was another IOP program, when she returned to Farrell Treatment Center in August, 2017. Her attendance there was sporadic, and after she admitted more relapses and had some positive drug screens, FTC discharged her in September, 2017, with another recommendation that she enter inpatient treatment. She was on a waiting list for an inpatient treatment program at Rushford when, after another relapse in November, 2017, and operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, she entered CMR's 30 day inpatient Milestone substance abuse treatment facility, from which she was successfully discharged after approximately thirty days of treatment. At of the end of evidence, she had returned for outpatient treatment at FTC. Throughout the course of these proceedings, DCF social workers have asked\n   her to submit to hair tests to assess her drug usage. The specific steps directed her to \"submit to random drug testing; the time and method of testing will be up to DCF to decide.\" Ms. G. has refused to comply with that request, except for one occasion, when she agreed to provide a hair sample but then never actually did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   A recurring theme of the mother's statements about her substance abuse has been that her drug and alcohol relapses are the result of two triggering motivations-to relieve distress at violence from Mr. M. or to cope with her emotions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The specific\n   steps ordered when\n   Avia was committed to the commissioner on November 28, 2016, directed Ms. G. to engage in individual counseling, with goals that included for her to \"[l]earn triggers for substance abuse and alternative coping mechanism[s],\" \"understand impact of domestic violence and substance abuse on children,\" \"[a]ddress mental health needs in individual counseling in order to maintain emotional stability [and] continue in care for mental health needs.\" Petitioner's exhibit 14, specific steps for mother, Addendum. The specific steps also ordered her to \"[a]ttend and create an appropriate domestic violence program,\" and one of the goals of her individual counseling was to \"[c]reate and maintain [a] safe, stable, and nurturing home environment free from domestic violence and substance abuse.\" Id., p. 1 and Addendum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Consistent with the specific steps, DCF referred the mother for mental health treatment at Wheeler Clinic after her discharge from the New Life Center program in November, 2016, but Ms. G. instead chose to select\n   her own mental health clinician,\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and since January of 2017, she has been attending weekly therapy with Ronald Klemba, a licensed marriage and family therapist at Healing House of CT in New Britain. Social worker Fazzolari testified that he \"specializes in domestic violence.\" Transcript of testimony, January 9, 2018, p. 111. In a letter dated October 4, 2017, Klemba wrote that her treatment with him was intended \"to address symptoms impairing her ability to function on certain levels\" and that she \"has proven to be a reliable, engaged client.\" Respondent mother's exhibit F. His treatment records for June, 2017 through January of 2018, however, show that any progress she may have made has been slow and, even when construed most favorably for her, that she has just begun taking steps toward consistent sobriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is significant, however,\n   that even though Klemba's most recent treatment record introduced into\n   evidence commented that Ms. G. presented herself on January 11, 2018, as \"committed to sobriety,\" therapist Klemba's own conclusion about her \"progress\" was that she was \"unchanged.\" See Psychotherapy Treatment Records for January 11, 2018, contained in respondent mother's exhibit F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   After the 2014 report of domestic violence in front of Aaliya, DCF referred Ms. G. to the Prudence Crandall Center, a New Britain domestic violence shelter and service provider. Records from that agency introduced into evidence by the mother\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   show that Prudence Crandall staff twice called her home in 2014 but were unable to reach her.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The current DCF social worker, Alison Sroka, was also then assigned to the mother's case and she testified that, \"to my knowledge,\" Ms. G. did not seek any services from Prudence Crandall at that time. Transcript of testimony, January 17, 2018, pp. 48-49. The evidence shows that, in fact, the mother had approximately ten contacts with Prudence Crandall between 2014 and 2017 in which she received counseling and support. But, at least until recently,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   she continued her relationship with Mr. M. and incidents\n   of\n   domestic violence continued to occur during most of that time. The department social worker also provided an opportunity for Ms. G. to meet for a consultation with a domestic violence specialist at DCF, who suggested various referrals to her. One of those was a domestic violence program at The Hospital of Central Connecticut, but the mother declined that service, telling her social worker that she did not feel comfortable addressing these issues in a group setting. She instead agreed to a referral offered by DCF to Harold Fischer and Associates, a private therapist offering individualized domestic violence services. Unfortunately, she did not follow up on that referral or begin services there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The Father, Antonio M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In 2009, the father's parental rights were terminated to his then 12 year old son, Antonio S., after Mr. M. submitted his written consent in a TPR proceeding brought in 2006 by the Commissioner of Children and Families to terminate the parental rights of the child's natural mother and father. He is the father of eight other children, including Avia, all of whom have had involvement with DCF because of parental neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Mr. M. married the respondent mother in January, 2014. As has been previously discussed and is shown by the police reports and his criminal conviction and protective order history introduced into evidence, their relationship has been marred by numerous incidents of domestic violence on his part toward Ms. G. He was incarcerated and serving the sentences imposed in December, 2015, when the commissioner brought the\n   neglect petition on Avia's behalf in April, 2016, and there has been at least one more incident of domestic violence between the parents since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   After Mr. M.'s release from incarceration in December, 2016, he spent three months at a halfway house in New Britain, where he received anger management and mental health services. The department also provided him weekly visits with Avia while he was there. In March, 2017, DCF social worker Orvis was developing a discharge plan for him, when he abruptly left the halfway house, and his whereabouts were then unknown to DCF until he appeared at the initial hearing on the TPR petition on June 2, 2017. He missed three of the five scheduled visits with his daughter between then and the end of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   After that court hearing, DCF requested that Mr. M. submit to a substance abuse evaluation and urine screen, and he attended Wheeler Clinic for that purpose in August, 2017. The toxicology report was negative and there were no recommendations for treatment or services. DCF also referred him to Radiance Innovative Services for domestic violence services but, after attending a few sessions, he stopped doing so. Although the subject of a standing criminal protective order that he not assault, threaten, abuse, or harass Ms. G., he went to her home on June 29, 2017, and struck the door to her premises \"so hard that the trim on the inside broke away and some wood split near the bottom hinge.\" Petitioner's exhibit 9A, New Britain Police Department Incident Report dated June 29, 2017, p. 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   He was arrested on\n   charges of criminal mischief, breach of the peace and violation of a protective order, which remained pending at the close of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   ADJUDICATORY PHASE OF TPR PROCEEDING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In the adjudicatory phase of a proceeding under \u00a7 17a-112 (j), the court must determine whether the commissioner has proven by clear and convincing evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   both a statutory ground for termination of\n   parental rights and that the department complied with its reasonable efforts obligations.

The father was incarcerated and serving an eighteen month sentence when the commissioner brought the underlying neglect petition, and the department caused him to be served in-hand with that petition. On April 15, 2016, he appeared at the preliminary hearing on the order of temporary custody (OTC) entered ex parte\n   seven days earlier. The father was advised of his rights that day and appointed counsel, and along with the mother agreed for the OTC to be sustained. He was also specifically advised that day to keep his address current with the department, his attorney, and\n   the clerk's office, but after his release from incarceration in March, 2017, he did not initially do so. While he was in parts unknown, DCF attempted to locate him by asking his mother, other relatives, and former associates if they knew his location, and also did a Lexis search for him, but was unable to ascertain his whereabouts. After DCF submitted an affidavit to that effect, the court authorized notice to him of the TPR petition by publication. When he appeared at the initial hearing on the TPR petition held on June 1, 2017, he provided a New Britain address. Trial on the petition was scheduled that day, in father's presence, for January 8 and 9 of 2018, at which time he did not appear. After his appearance at the TPR plea, the department had ongoing contact with him and provided visitation with the child. Under these circumstances, and the others proven at trial, it is found by clear and convincing evidence that the department made reasonable efforts to locate both the mother and the father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Reasonable Efforts to Reunify\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Mother, Agnieszka G.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The evidence shows that the issues leading to the initial and subsequent removals of Avia from Ms. G.'s custody were her ongoing substance abuse and mental health problems; in addition, her continuing involvement with violent and abusive intimate partners has been a barrier to reunification. This court has noted several times that \"[e]fforts to reunify a parent with a child should begin with identifying any barriers to the parent being willing or able to meet the child's needs and to provide the child with stable and competent care appropriate for the child's age and needs, identifying culturally competent services or programs that are\n   appropriate for addressing those barriers and helping the parent assume a responsible position in the child's life, informing the parent of the steps they need to take to get their child back, and then referring a parent to those services and programs while at the same time providing the parent ongoing visitation with the child to help maintain their relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Samantha A.\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Juvenile Matters, Docket No. H14-CP14-011171-A,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203080874\">\n    2017 WL 3080874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 20, 2016). The department here met all those obligations: it identified the barriers to reunification and appropriate services to address those barriers, informed Ms. G. of the need to engage in these services in order for Avia to be returned to her care, referred the mother to the various services and programs as recounted above, and offered her ongoing visitation. The evidence proved clearly and convincingly that the department made reasonable efforts to reunify Avia with Ms. G. by referring her on multiple occasions to services and treatment providers to help her address these problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   In her trial brief, Ms. G. argues that the department's failure to offer her another \"mother-daughter\" program prevents a finding of reasonable efforts to reunify, but the court disagrees. Since the department and Ms. G.'s service providers have all repeatedly asked her to reenter inpatient treatment, her only complaint can be that the department did not offer her another inpatient treatment program that offered the prospect of the child residing with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The premise of the mother's argument on this point, however, is not correct. The department did offer her another opportunity to participate in a mother-daughter treatment program. First, it must be noted that Ms. G. left the New Life Center's mother-daughter program on November 14, 2016, after her child was removed, but New Life Center was then still willing to provide her with ongoing treatment. Second, two weeks later, the department did offer her another\n   opportunity to attend a mother-daughter program, this time at Amethyst House. See petitioner's exhibit 1, p. 9. Ms. G. refused. That was the second time the department had offered and the mother had refused a referral there. After that, she attended and was discharged from several different inpatient treatment programs for noncompliance, with a recommendation after two of these discharges for inpatient treatment that she refused. For example, in June, 2017, she acknowledged to the DCF social worker that Farrell Treatment Center had recommended inpatient treatment but said she was going to instead attend the program to obtain her CNA certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Our courts have repeatedly emphasized, however, that \"reasonable efforts\" does not mean \"doing everything possible,\" only \"doing everything reasonable.\" The courts have said that \"reasonableness\" is an objective standard, but have also repeatedly emphasized that \"whether reasonable efforts have been proven depends on the careful consideration of the circumstances of each individual case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Eden F.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1063830\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/48/290/#p311\">\n    48 Conn.

To the extent that Ms. G.'s argument is that the department should have offered a fourth referral to a mother-daughter program, after she had left one before its conclusion and twice rejected referral to another such program and after her repeated relapses in 2017 during numerous courses of treatment, it would not have been \"reasonable\" to remove Avia from the safe and secure foster placement where she has done so well while the mother participated in additional treatment whose prospects, based on the mother's long history of relapses after treatment, would appear dismal. It would only have been \"reasonable\" to place the child back with the mother in an\n   inpatient mother-daughter setting if there were reasonable prospects for success, both during and after that treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The commissioner argues in her trial brief that the respondent mother has been unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts. The evidence contained exhibits regarding the mother's treatment at the New Life Center, CMHA, Farrell Treatment Center, and CHR's Milestone Program. These four programs encompass the bulk of Ms. G.'s substance abuse treatment during the period covered by this case. The court also heard testimony from individual treatment providers from three of these four programs: Samantha Larkin from the New Life Center, Daniel Millstein from Farrell Treatment Center and Lori Bergeron from Milestone. The evidence also contains evidence from three other service providers who engaged with Ms. G. during this period: The Connection, Prudence Crandall Center, and the Healing House of CT. Together, this evidence, along with the testimony of DCF employees and the contents of DCF-created exhibits, portrays Ms. G. in two different lights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   On the one hand, the testimony and exhibits demonstrate that, at times, Ms. G. appears sincere in her desire to overcome her addiction and end her abusive relationship\n   with Mr. M. and also sometimes seems to be making progress toward those goals. The evidence is also permeated, however, by examples of her lack of sincerity and candor in her treatment efforts. When the TPR petition was filed on May 2, 2017, it may well have been said that the mother, as of that time, had been unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts. As of that date, she had left the New Life Center in November, 2016, against its recommendation after relapsing, refused DCF's offer that same month for another\n   inpatient program, stopped attending the intensive outpatient program at Wheeler Clinic that had been recommended by NLC and DCF after her discharge from NLC, been discharged from the Farrell Treatment Center intensive outpatient program for noncompliance and with a recommendation, which she rejected, for inpatient treatment, and was one day away from being discharged from the CMHA intensive outpatient program after relapsing during that treatment and missing many treatment sessions, again with a recommendation for more intensive inpatient treatment. At that time in her life, she was not yet willing or able to overcome the grip of addiction on her life, as shown by her statements to her therapist that \"sobriety was too painful to feel\" (on February 7, 2017) and that she \"cannot see life without getting high\" (on March 7, 2017). Petitioner's exhibit F. Although she had identified the stress of a violent and \"toxic\" relationship with her husband as one trigger for her substance abuse,\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   she had voluntarily maintained her relationship with him while he was incarcerated for violating protective orders for her benefit. And, as of that time, she was not yet willing to be honest with her treatment providers; for example, at her intake at CMHA on March 9, 2017, she falsely reported that \"she had been sober 8 years until she recently (Dec. 2016) relapsed on intermittent cocaine and marijuana use ....\" Petitioner's exhibit 31, p. 1 of 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The petitioner chose, at the time of trial, however, to amend the petition to add allegations, thereby amending\n   the adjudicatory date, and the mother's willingness and ability to benefit from reunification efforts must thus be assessed as of that later juncture. By early January, 2018, the evidence does not portray such an unqualified pattern. The records of the mother's therapist, for example, show recent signs of a desire and willingness on Ms. G.'s part to change, although not without some contrary indication of calculation on her part. Ms. G. appeared to be more honest with her treatment providers. And she had filed for divorce from her husband. On the other hand, her intoxication that led to her arrest in November, 2017, shows that sobriety remains an elusive goal. Her actions displayed on the DVD recording of her arrest and conduct later at the local jail show not only that she was inebriated but also suggest an element of cunning and calculation on her part. Her report to the police in August, 2017, that the father had entered her home was probably false and suggests that she was trying to convince others that she was no longer emotionally attached to him, thereby calling into question\n   the sincerity of her actions. The evidence as of the amended adjudicatory date is thus decidedly mixed, but, containing some indications of a desire on Ms. G.'s part to change, does not prove clearly and convincingly that, as of that date, she was still unwilling or unable to benefit from reunification efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   b\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Father, Antonio M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The evidence proved clearly and convincingly that DCF made reasonable efforts to reunify Avia with her father as of the date when the petitions were filed and also at the time of trial. It offered him visitation with her to allow them to develop a bond. His proclivity for violence and aggression in his relationships with intimate partners has been a barrier to his reunification, not just with Avia, but with other children of his as\n   well and upon his release from incarceration, DCF referred him for domestic violence treatment services to address this problem. Earlier cases that he had with the department involving other children also led DCF to believe that he also had substance abuse and mental health issues, and the department appropriately referred him for an Advanced Behavioral Health (ABH) evaluation of treatment needs in these areas upon his release from incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Statutory Grounds for Termination\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   As statutory grounds for terminating parental rights, the TPR petition alleges: Failure to rehabilitate against both parents, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i), and neglect of a child under the age of seven and failure to rehabilitate by a parent whose parental rights to another child have been terminated in a proceeding brought by DCF, against the respondent father, pursuant to \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (E).\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   To prevail on the petition as to either parent, the commissioner must prove at least one of the statutory\n   grounds for terminating that person's parental rights by clear and convincing evidence.

The required specific steps were ordered on an ex parte basis upon the granting of the OTC on April 8, 2016, and those ex parte orders were served four days later on the parents by a marshal, who made in-hand service on the father and abode service on the mother. At the preliminary hearing on the OTC on April 15, 2016, this judge entered preliminary specific steps in the presence of both parents; that same day both parents signed the specific steps that had been ordered and affirmatively waived any formal reading of the steps by the court. When the order of protective supervision was entered on July 28, 2016, final specific steps were ordered in the mother's presence for both parents. A month later, on August\n   31, 2016, the father was allowed to stand silent to the neglect adjudication, and the Memorandum of Hearing for the court proceeding that day shows that he waived a formal reading of the steps. When the second OTC was entered on November 10, 2016, the required orders of specific steps were served four days later on the parents by a marshal, and when the child was committed to DCF on November 28, 2016, final specific steps were again ordered and the parents waived a formal reading of the steps. The mother was physically present in court that day and signed the steps. The incarcerated father had participated in the proceeding by video, and he signed his copy of the steps on December 1, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Neglect of a Child under the Age of Seven\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Subparagraph (E) of \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) requires proof, not of a prior neglect adjudication, but that a child under the age of seven years is neglected or uncared for as of the petition's adjudicatory date. Avia is certainly under the age of seven, but on the adjudicatory date she had been in DCF care for more than a year, and there could thus be no evidence here of actual neglect on or near the adjudicatory date. The department's proof of neglect to satisfy subparagraph (E) must therefore rely instead on the doctrine of predictive neglect.

Although that case referred to the fair preponderance of the evidence standard applicable to neglect proceedings, since the present case is a TPR proceeding, such proof would have to meet the more exacting standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The evidence proved here clearly and convincingly that at the time the TPR petition was filed and on the amended adjudicatory date Avia would be neglected in the care of either parent. The evidence discussed above shows that Avia would be neglected if left in the mother's care. The father has neither developed nor attempted to maintain a parent-child relationship with her, even forgetting or cancelling visits that DCF offered. Mr. M. was present in court on June 1, 2017, when the court scheduled trial on the TPR petition for January 8 and 9 of 2018, and his failure to attend the trial shows his lack of interest in or concern for the child. His arrest for another domestic violence incident in June, 2017, shows that he has yet to benefit from\n   any treatment or services while incarcerated, at the halfway house or in the community that would help him learn how to control his anger and aggression in his relationships with intimate partners. Without such knowledge or the ability to provide a safe home, he would not be able to meet Avia's need for a safe and secure environment. As shown by the incident between Mr. M. and Ms. G. in which Aaliya attempted to intervene (and which is described more thoroughly elsewhere, in footnote 14 and in part II B 4 of this opinion), children themselves can be placed at physical risk during domestic violence between adults, and such a setting thus not only damages their sense of safety and provides a negative behavioral role model, but also jeopardizes their actual safety. The neglect of his many other children would only be repeated if Avia were placed with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   3\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Prior Termination of Parental Rights\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Section 17a-112 (j) (3) (E) also requires proof that a parent had previously lost parental rights pursuant to a petition filed by the Commissioner of Children and Families, and the evidence here proved clearly and convincingly that on January 20, 2009, Mr. M.'s parental rights to another child were terminated in a TPR proceeding brought by the commissioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   4\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The Parents' \"Rehabilitative Status\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Both of these subparagraphs of \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) have one statutory element in common, each requiring proof that a parent has failed to achieve the degree of personal rehabilitation that would encourage the belief that within a reasonable time, considering the age and\n   needs of the child, the parent could assume a responsible position in the life of the child. \"Personal rehabilitation\n   as used in [ \u00a7 17a-112 ] refers to the restoration of a parent to his or her former constructive and useful role as a parent.... [The statute] requires the trial court to analyze the [parent's] rehabilitative status as it relates to the needs of the particular child, and further, that such rehabilitation must be foreseeable within a reasonable time.... [The statute] requires the court to find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the level of rehabilitation [he] has achieved, if any, falls short of that which would reasonably encourage a belief that at some future date [he] can assume a responsible position in [his] child's life.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Eden F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237159\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/674/\">\n    250 Conn. 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=741%20A.2d%20873\">\n    741 A.2d 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999). \"[I]n assessing rehabilitation, the critical issue is ... whether the parent ... has gained the ability to care for the particular needs of the child at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Danuael D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1201485\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/51/829/#p840\">\n    51 Conn.

As this court has observed elsewhere, the crux of the adjudicatory ground of failure to rehabilitate is whether a parent has sufficiently addressed the problems and deficiencies in parenting that led to state intervention so that the parent can, considering the age and needs of the child, assume a responsible position in the child's life, or will be able to do so within a reasonable time in the future.\n   <em>\n    In re Zachary W.\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Juvenile Matters, Docket No. HP12-CP06-011133-A,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202478587\">\n    2011 WL 2478587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (May 18, 2011). \"What is a reasonable time is a factual determination that must be made on a case-by-case basis\";\n   <em>\n    In re Michael L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"443913\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/56/688/#p694\">\n    56 Conn.

The failure to rehabilitate ground for termination of parental rights, under either \u00a7 17a-112 (j) (3) (B) (i) or (E), thus requires the court to assess the rehabilitative status of a parent in relationship to the\n   age and needs of a particular child, i.e., their readiness to meet those needs as of the adjudicatory date or in a reasonable time thereafter. Here, the court has also considered the parents' rehabilitative status as of the end of trial. That evidence includes the information recited below in the dispositional portion of this decision about the parents' compliance before the adjudicatory date with the specific steps.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   When the TPR petition was filed on May 2, 2017, Avia was barely 13 months old. On the amended adjudicatory date of January 8, 2018, she was only 21 months old. Her first and most obvious need, both when the petition was filed and on the amended adjudicatory date, was for a sober, responsible adult caretaker who will keep her safe and provide stable, competent care for her; but the two parents' histories show their inabilities at any of the relevant times to meet this need. Keeping a child safe is a paramount need for a child of Avia's age. Toddlers of her age at the end of trial are mobile and can be active, but they lack common sense and any judgment and are at constant risk of doing something dangerous to themselves-climbing onto an object from which she can fall, leaving the safety of her home and opening a door to the outside and venturing into the street, or exposing herself to other dangers are just some of the hazardous activities that any child her age may undertake if left unsupervised. Dangerous situations can occur quickly for a toddler and Avia is completely depending on having a vigilant, alert and competent caretaker to keep her safe. A parent under the influence of drugs or alcohol cannot be counted on to be alert, ready and able to\n   recognize and respond to dangerous situations, and keep such a child safe. The person that the court viewed, when the video was played at trial of Ms. G.'s behavior at the time of her arrest last November for operating under the influence,\n   would not be competent or capable in that condition of keeping a child of Avia's age safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Ms. G. has been unable, both during Avia's life and, if her own account to her husband is to be believed, for many years before, to demonstrate that she can maintain sobriety or serve as a competent parent. The mother has repeatedly relapsed on drugs or alcohol despite participating in numerous drug treatment programs since the child's original removal from her custody. The evidence also demonstrates her inability to use good judgment, to accept responsibility for her conduct, and to remain sober over time. Although Ms. G. appeared alert and sober at trial and, according to her substance abuse counselor at the 30-day inpatient program that the mother completed just before trial began, had done well there, her history of continuing relapses after substance abuse treatment offers little hope or confidence today that she will not again relapse. The evidence, according to her counselors and the treatment records from the New Life Center and Milestone, shows that Ms. G. apparently was able to maintain sobriety while within the confines of those two inpatient treatment programs-although when given a day pass from the New Life Center after six months there, she relapsed. The evidence also shows utter lack of success in maintaining sobriety in the community after inpatient treatment, even if she were attending three times per week intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment. After her discharge from Milestone, she had attended only one treatment session at the Farrell Treatment Center as of the time of trial and had already missed one session, and a 50 percent attendance record would hardly suggest successful treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In addition, she refused to comply with the court order for her to submit to a hair test before an in-court review in January, 2017, and has repeatedly refused to comply with numerous requests by DCF to submit to\n   hair tests, as was ordered in the specific steps. (See petitioner's exhibit 14.) In October, 2017, she did agree to participate in a hair test, but then did not do so. The logical inference from these repeated refusals is that Ms. G. was continuing to use illegal substances or abuse alcohol, an inference confirmed by her intoxication at the time of her November, 2017 arrest and vividly corroborated by her admission, upon intake to the CHR inpatient program on November 29, 2017, that she had used cocaine on twenty days in the last month. Such refusals to submit to hair tests prevent DCF from verifying any claims of sobriety and must be considered in light of the mother's statement to the father a year earlier that \"she was going to put on a show for now,\" thereby suggesting an intent to try to deceive DCF about her ongoing substance abuse and demonstrating a legitimate need to verify any such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Treatment counselor Daniel Millstein testified that the mother would need to demonstrate sobriety in the community for a period of at least six months \"before you could say she's really affected a solid recovery\"; transcript of testimony, January 9, 2018, p. 43; but Ms. G.'s history of repeated relapses after longer periods of sobriety show that Millstein's estimate is woefully short for her. Ms. G. claimed to have been sober for four years, between 2010 and 2014, for example, but by the year 2015 and into early 2016 she was continuously using marijuana and cocaine\n   up to the time of Avia's birth, and after that until she entered the NLC facility. She has continued to test positive for illegal substances throughout Avia's life, and short periods of sobriety during this period have not proven indicative that Ms. G. would continue to refrain from substance abuse. Her repeated refusals to submit to hair follicle substance abuse testing show a desire on her part to conceal the extent of her substance abuse. A few weeks of sobriety and abstinence at the time of trial do not show her to\n   be ready then or in the reasonable future to assume responsibility for Avia's safety and well-being.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   In addition, domestic violence has continued between the parents, and neither one has shown himself or herself ready to end such a cycle of violence. Despite the fact that the father served 18 months in jail for violence against the mother, Ms. G. steadfastly maintained her relationship with him until, perhaps, recently. Although Ms. G. recently filed for divorce from Mr. M., she has done nothing to show that she is ready to end her pattern of involvement with violent intimate partners. Inventing a false story about him assaulting her and slashing the tires on his motor vehicle when she found him at another woman's house, as the evidence showed that Ms. G. has done, both suggest that she continues to be emotionally invested in her relationship with Mr. M. The fathers of both of her children have been violent to her, and the end to the violent relationship with the father of her first child did not motivate or prompt Ms. G. to avoid a relationship or parenthood with another violent intimate partner. Mr. M. continues to commit acts of domestic violence and has shown no willingness to address the issues of intimate partner violence that have characterized his relationships with Ms. G. and the mothers of his other children and endangered the safety of Ms. G.'s older daughter at least once.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The violence of the incident that occurred in the presence of Avia's older sister in February, 2015, when Mr. M. stood over Ms. G., choking her (and is described more thoroughly in footnote 14 of this opinion), shows the risk to children when violence occurs between their parents: when Aaliya tried to intervene in that incident, Mr. M. continued to engage in violence and the child could have been hurt as a result. After years of exposure to domestic violence between her mother and other adults, 13 year old Aaliya is now reported by the TPR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   social study to \"become verbally aggressive\" and to use profanities during arguments with her foster mother; and when she gets upset or angry at school \"she becomes enraged (yells, screams, gets right in the faces of other students).\" Petitioner's exhibit 1, pp. 6-7. It is to be hoped that Avia will not have the same exposure to domestic violence, as she needs the opportunity to live instead with caretakers and role models who will both keep her safe and also help her learn how to resolve disagreements without resort to threats or violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Thus, both parents need to learn how to engage in intimate relationships without resorting to violence or involving themselves with intimate partners who will be abusive, and neither of these respondents has yet shown that willingness or ability. DCF has referred the mother to several different services and treatment providers willing to support her in ending her relationship with Mr. M. and to help her learn how to avoid abusive relationships in the future, but she has completed none of them. When she told the department social worker that she did not feel comfortable in the group setting offered by one of those providers, DCF referred her for individualized services that she did not complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   While Mr. M. was at the Bishop House halfway facility for three months after his release from incarceration, he did receive domestic violence services, and after he was back in contact with DCF, the department referred him to Radiance Innovative Services for a domestic violence assessment. He went to the intake assessment, after which Radiance recommended that he attend group treatment. Mr. M. attended one group and then stopped doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Beyond physical safety, Avia also needs love, affection and nurture, stability, and permanency. Her mother's interactions with her, as reported by the DCF social worker who has supervised their visitations,\n   show that Ms. G. can be warm, loving and responsive to her daughter. (The father has visited the child too little, so his ability to meet this need is unknown.) Despite these favorable observations about the mother's interactions with Avia, however, Ms. G.'s personal history is the source of serious reservations about her readiness to provide the child with safety, stability, permanency or to assume responsibility for this young child, in view of Avia's age and needs, when the petition was filed, on the adjudicatory date, at the end of trial or in the reasonable future. After the child had been returned to her at NLC, Ms. G. operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated and her daughter was a passenger. That incident occurred in November, 2016. After an additional year of substance abuse and mental health services, the mother again operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated or under the influence of illegal substances in November, 2017. Fortunately, the child was not in the vehicle on that latter occasion, since Avia had been removed from her mother's care and custody after the November, 2016 incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The record contains many examples of Ms. G. stating that she wanted to end her addiction to drugs and alcohol and that she entered numerous substance abuse treatment programs hoping to overcome her addiction. Similarly, the evidence contains examples of her stating that she recognized and wanted to eliminate the safety threat posed by her relationship with Mr. M. The evidence also, however, shows that she chose her own path toward such objectives and generally did not heed the advice or recommendations from DCF or her treatment providers. Choosing her own therapist rather than accepting DCF's referral to Wheeler Clinic has not been shown to have any negative consequences, and the evidence shows no reason to believe that her therapist is less skilled than clinicians she might have seen at Wheeler Clinic. Until recently, however, she had\n   rejected recommendations from her substance abuse counselors to reenter inpatient treatment and insisted that she \"could maintain her sobriety doing Intensive Outpatient Treatment.\" Petitioner's exhibit 23, Running Narrative for January 25, 2017. Moreover, she has never been willing to engage in consistent treatment or services to help her end her relationship with Mr. M. and avoid future domestic violence. Despite the many times in which Ms. G. has asserted a desire to end drug addiction and domestic violence, she continued, at least until recently, to abuse drugs and/or alcohol and maintained her relationship with Mr. M. Because of this long history of substance abuse and domestic violence, statements she now makes about a desire to overcome her addiction or end her marriage cannot be credited until they have been corroborated by a substantial period demonstrating her success in achieving those goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The evidence therefore proves clearly and convincingly that, at the time the TPR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   petition was filed, on the amended adjudicatory date, and at the close of trial, neither parent had sufficiently rehabilitated themselves that they were ready, on any of those occasions or in the reasonable time thereafter, to assume a responsible position in Avia's life, in view of Avia's age and her needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In light of the mother's many relapses after treatment, any present sobriety or abstinence from drugs is too new and short-lived to offer confidence that they will continue. While several of the mother's treatment providers who testified said that relapses are a normal component of recovery from drug abuse, the court does not regard such testimony as meaning that relapses are signs of recovery. Instead, the court views such testimony as signifying that recovery from substance abuse is arduous, may not follow a steady path toward recovery, and may include setbacks. The mother's many relapses, after so many treatment opportunities, and\n   the November, 2017 relapse in particular, show that Ms. G. will need to demonstrate a substantial period of sobriety, without relapses, before one can be confident that she is, at last, in lasting recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Even after the father was incarcerated, the parents maintained their relationship, and the domestic violence between them continued through at least June of 2017, and, in light of their inability to form and maintain healthy intimate partnerships, neither of them has shown any ability to teach their child about healthy relationships and respect for others or to model such relationships to Avia. One cannot be confident that either of them yet has the ability even to provide the child with a safe environment, and the recent past suggests that the risk is too great that the mother might again drive while under the influence or the parents might again engage in violence. The mother's last-minute filing for divorce does not signify that she has learned any of the skills necessary to provide Avia with a safe, secure, and stable home, and, at best, suggests that these two parents might no longer engage in violence with each other that could endanger a child in their care, but neither one has shown that an end to this relationship would mean an end to their mutual and long patterns of involvement in violent intimate relationships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In sum, the petitioner proved both grounds for termination of the father's parental rights clearly and convincingly, and the sole ground alleged as to mother by that same standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   DISPOSITIONAL PHASE OF TPR PROCEEDING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Having concluded that clear and convincing evidence proved the statutory grounds pleaded for termination of the respondents' parental rights to this young child,\n   the court must next proceed to the dispositional phase, in which \"there must be a showing by clear and convincing evidence whether termination is in the best interests of the child.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Brian T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778865\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/134/1/#p11\">\n    134 Conn.

She also missed numerous appointments to visit with her children, did not keep at least one appointment to which she had agreed for a hair test, and did not keep all of her appointments with Harold Fischer and Associates, the domestic violence service provider to which the department referred her.\n   <em>\n    Father\n   </em>\n   : Mr. M. missed appointments to visit with Avia and at Radiance Innovative Services, the domestic violence provider to which the department referred him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <em>\n    Cooperate with DCF home visits, announced or unannounced, and visits by the child(ren)'s court-appointed attorney and/or guardian ad litem.\n   </em>\n   Ms. G. has not cooperated, as she has refused requests for home visits by DCF social workers.

Although Ms. G. has participated in substance abuse, mental health, and domestic violence counseling, the evidence shows no progress toward meeting the goals identified for that treatment, except that she does appear to be able to maintain a close and nurturing relationship with Avia during visits. Similarly, Mr. M. has shown no progress in learning how to avoid domestic violence despite his limited participation in domestic violence treatment services to which DCF referred him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   <em>\n    Cooperate with recommended service providers\n   </em>\n   :\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Mother\n   </em>\n   : The testimony and exhibits presented at trial\n   suggest that, when undergoing treatment, Ms. G. may sometimes present the appearance of making sincere and earnest effort to cooperate with her substance abuse and mental health service providers. For example, the exhibits from treatment providers sometimes (but not always) contain what appear to be candid admissions from her about her substance abuse history and her explanations for her repeated relapses. As noted in the text above, however, she is not always honest with her treatment providers, and some of those records indicate a tendency on her part to blame others for her problems rather than accepting personal responsibility for the choices she has made. Regardless of the apparent candor of her statements to her treatment providers and her sometimes ostensible cooperation with them, however, her cooperation has never extended to complying with the ultimate goals of treatment that she stop abusing drugs and alcohol and stop involving herself in violent relationships. Her decisions near the time of trial to reenter an inpatient treatment program and to file for divorce may signal a willingness now to cooperate more fully with the recommendations of treatment providers, but not enough time had elapsed at trial's end to determine whether any such willingness continues. She has also shown only limited cooperation with the service provider through The Connection that sponsors and provides her with Supportive Housing, and she has received three warnings for noncompliance with that program.\n   <em>\n    Father\n   </em>\n   : Mr. M. did not comply and stopped attending the domestic violence program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   <em>\n    Submit to substance abuse evaluation and follow treatment recommendations; submit to random drug testing; do not use illegal drugs or abuse alcohol or medicine\n   </em>\n   . Until recently, Ms. G. had not followed treatment recommendations for a higher level of drug treatment. She still has not complied with the department's repeated requests for hair samples for drug testing, and\n   she has continued, at least until recently, to use illegal drugs and to abuse alcohol. Mr. M. did comply with DCF's referral for a substance abuse and mental health evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Sign releases allowing DCF to communicate with the parents' service providers and your child's attorney to review your child's records\n   </em>\n   . Ms. G. has signed many but not all of the releases requested by the DCF social worker. There was no evidence that father failed to comply with this step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <em>\n    Cooperate with court-ordered evaluations\n   </em>\n   . No evaluations were ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <em>\n    Get and/or maintain adequate housing and legal income\n   </em>\n   . Ms. G. has partly complied. She has lived in adequate subsidized housing funded through The Connection, but has been at risk of losing the subsidy by not fully complying with the program's requirements. She has had no source of legal income, and has not yet completed the vocational training program for a CNA certificate that would probably provide a means by which she could support herself. There was no evidence about father's compliance with this step, other than his report of being employed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <em>\n    Identify changes in household composition\n   </em>\n   . There was no evidence that either parent failed to comply with this step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <em>\n    Take care of children's various needs and make all necessary child care arrangements\n   </em>\n   : While Avia was placed with her at the NLC program, Ms. G. satisfactorily took care of her various needs until she risked the child's life and safety by driving in an intoxicated condition while Avia was in the motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <em>\n    No involvement in the criminal justice system.

She looks to them for comfort and is also bonded with her foster siblings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   The evidence shows that Ms. G. and Avia have an affectionate relationship and that Avia has developed a bond with her.

He refused any visits with her while he was incarcerated. After he was placed at the halfway house, he agreed to visitation and saw her four times before his release from Bishop House in March, 2017. He then had only two more visits with her, in October and\n   December, 2017.

The father has shown a distinct lack of interest in Avia or in addressing the problems of criminality and domestic violence that pose a threat to her safety. The mother has a long history of substance abuse that has jeopardized the safety and well-being of her children on more than one occasion and a similarly long history of exposing both of her children to the inherent dangers of adult intimate partner violence. She has used drugs or abused alcohol while under protective supervision, while pregnant, and while engaged in treatment. Since Avia was born, Ms.\n   G. has sought substance abuse treatment on at least six different occasions-residency at the New Life Center between April and November, 2016, intensive outpatient treatment at Wheeler Clinic, Community Mental Health Affiliates and, for two different periods, Farrell Treatment Center between January and November, 2017, at the Milestone inpatient treatment program from late November, 2011, to late December, 2017, and lastly, outpatient treatment once again at the Farrell Treatment Center. None of the previous substance abuse treatment before her recent stay at the Milestone facility had enabled her to overcome her addiction.

See Trial Brief for Respondent Mother, pp. 18-19. It is true that Connecticut cases often describe the clear and convincing standard in the following way: \"The burden of persuasion, therefore, in those cases requiring a showing of clear and convincing proof is sustained if evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist.\"\n    <em>\n     Dacey\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Connecticut Bar Assn.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"509717\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/170/520/#p537\">\n     170 Conn. 520\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 537,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=368%20A.2d%20125\">\n     368 A.2d 125\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1976) ; see also\n    <em>\n     Lopinto\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Haines\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"534586\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/185/527/#p534\">\n     185 Conn. 527\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 534,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=441%20A.2d%20151\">\n     441 A.2d 151\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1981) (same). Her brief is also correct that the clear and convincing standard of proof is constitutionally required under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment in TPR cases.

Finally, her brief is correct that the United States Supreme Court has approvingly quoted a New Jersey case describing that standard as evidence which \"produces in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as to the truth of the allegations sought to be established, evidence so clear, direct and weighty and convincing as to enable [the fact finder] to come to a clear conviction, without hesitancy, of the truth of the precise facts in issue.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Cruzan\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Director, Missouri Dept. of Health\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215746\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/261/\">\n     497 U.S. 261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 285 n.11,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215746\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/261/\">\n     110 S.Ct. 2841\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6215746\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/261/\">\n     111 L.Ed.2d 224\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1990), citing\n    <em>\n     In re Jobes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"292304\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/108/394/#p407\">\n     108 N.J. 394\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 407-408,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=529%20A.2d%20434\">\n     529 A.2d 434\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1987).
