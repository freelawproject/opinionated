Weathers, appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a trial by a three judge court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a(a), criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c(a)(1), and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35(a). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the trial court's rejection of his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect was not reasonably supported by the evidence and (2) the court erred as a matter of law in deciding\n   an issue without the aid of expert testimony. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The court reasonably could have found the following facts from the evidence presented at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the morning of March 26, 2015, the victim, Jose Araujo, and several\n   other individuals employed by Burns Construction were installing an underground gas main on Pond Street in Bridgeport. Fernando Oquendo, a patrolman with the Bridgeport Police Department, was working overtime duty at the construction site and had blocked off Pond Street near Chopsey Hill Road.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around the time in question, Officer Oquendo had gone to retrieve coffee for the construction crew, who were in the process of backfilling a trench that had been dug along the side of the road. Matthew Girdzis, one of the crew members, was seated in a dump truck positioned near the trench. The victim was standing on the driver's side of the truck speaking with Girdzis about where they should dump the fill material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   While the victim and Girdzis were talking, the defendant walked into the work zone and approached the victim. Girdzis had never seen the defendant there before; he was not an employee of Burns Construction. The defendant greeted the victim with a seemingly amicable \"fist bump\" and asked the victim whether the construction company was hiring. The victim, in turn, relayed the question to Girdzis. Speaking to the defendant directly, Girdzis suggested that he go to the construction company's office downtown to fill out an application and \"see what happens.\" By all accounts, there was nothing unusual or remarkable about the defendant's demeanor during his initial interaction with the victim and Girdzis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was nothing to suggest\n   that any sort of argument or altercation ensued or that the defendant harbored any animosity toward the victim or Girdzis. The defendant did not appear to be acting strangely; he appeared to be rational and to understand what was being said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following this encounter, the defendant walked away, seemingly leaving the work zone, but, in fact, he merely walked around to the other side of the truck and stood near the passenger side door. Meanwhile, Girdzis and the victim had begun walking toward the trench. After a few seconds, the defendant looked up and down the street and, seeing the street empty, proceeded to walk back around the truck and reapproach the victim. In a matter of seconds, the defendant, without saying a word, removed a revolver from his pocket and shot the victim several times. The victim ultimately died from gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Immediately after the shooting, the defendant began running up the street, zigzagging\n   across it several times. Several of the victim's coworkers chased the defendant on foot. The defendant, seeing that he was being pursued, stopped momentarily at a parked pickup truck and opened its door but then quickly shut it again and resumed running up the street. The coworkers continued chasing the defendant until he ran in between two houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Members of the Bridgeport Police Department soon arrived on the scene and began canvassing the area. The defendant eventually was located by Officer Darryl Wilson, who found the defendant hiding in some tall bushes in a backyard. Wilson ordered the defendant to show his hands, at which point the defendant began to run. Wilson ordered the defendant to stop and again demanded that he show his hands. The defendant complied. Upon observing the revolver in the defendant's hand, Wilson ordered the defendant several times to\n   drop the weapon and warned the defendant that he was prepared to shoot if the defendant did not comply. After repeating this order, the defendant dropped his weapon. Additional police units arrived a few seconds later, and the defendant was arrested. As he was being arrested, the defendant mumbled something to the effect of, \"it's all messed up\" or \"I messed up.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following his arrest, the defendant was led out from behind the house and into the street, at which point Lieutenant Christopher LaMaine heard the defendant state spontaneously that he had been involved in a \"labor dispute.\" When approached by LaMaine, the defendant again claimed that there had been a \"labor dispute.\" After advising the defendant of his constitutional rights, which the defendant waived, LaMaine questioned him. The defendant seemed to have difficulty focusing, putting his thoughts together, and answering LaMaine's questions fully, and, at times, he rambled on incoherently, causing LaMaine to suspect that the defendant either had a mental illness or was under the influence of phencyclidine (PCP). Upon further questioning, the defendant stated that the victim was a foreman and was not \"letting anyone out here work\" and that he had shot the victim to settle this dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant subsequently was transported to the police station, where he was interviewed by Detective Paul Ortiz and another detective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Ortiz observed, there were numerous instances throughout the interview where the defendant either entirely failed to respond to questions or gave less than responsive answers, and some of his statements seemed disorganized. Given his interactions with the defendant, Ortiz thought it was appropriate to have him evaluated at a\n   hospital for possible mental health or drug problems. Nevertheless, the defendant appeared to understand the detectives' questions. He admitted to shooting the victim and expressed remorse for it. He stated that he had been looking for a job and felt that the victim had \"brushed [him] off.\" Following the interview, the defendant was transported to Bridgeport Hospital for evaluation and, the next day, was remanded to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant subsequently was charged with, inter alia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   murder, criminal possession of a firearm, and carrying a pistol without a permit. The defendant elected to be tried by a three judge court\n   and raised the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13(a), otherwise known as the insanity defense. \"This defense has both a cognitive and a volitional prong.... Under the cognitive prong [of the insanity defense], a person is considered legally insane if, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacks substantial capacity ... to appreciate the ... [wrongfulness] of his conduct.... Under the volitional prong, a person also would be considered legally insane if he lacks substantial capacity ... to [control] his conduct to the requirements of law.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185034\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/120/437/\">\n    120 Conn.

The matter subsequently was tried to the court over the course of two days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its oral decision, the court rejected the defendant's insanity defense and found him guilty of the charged offenses. With respect to the insanity defense, the court\n   found that there was credible evidence that the defendant did suffer from a mental disease or defect, specifically, psychosis of an unspecific nature. Nevertheless, the court determined that the defendant had failed to establish that, as a result of his psychosis, he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With regard to the volitional prong in particular-the only prong at issue in this appeal-the court found that \"the defendant's mental disease did not diminish his ability to conform his behavior. The defendant's actions in shooting [the victim] were not borne out of his psychosis. Simply put, he was acting out of frustration and anger. The defendant was faced with a multitude of stressful and emotional hurdles in his life not of a psychiatric nature which motivated his actions that day.... The evidence suggests that he made overtures for a job, and when he was directed to make an application elsewhere, he felt rebuffed and in his own words, felt that he had been brushed off.\" The court further found that the defendant had obeyed police commands and that \"there was nothing remarkable, untoward or aberrant about the defendant's conduct\" during the police interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the basis of these findings, the court determined that \"the credible evidence [did] not support a finding that as a result of his mental disease, the defendant lacked the substantial capacity to control his conduct within the requirements of the law.\" The court rendered judgment accordingly and sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of imprisonment of forty-five years. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, the defendant first claims that the court's rejection of his affirmative defense of mental disease or defect was not reasonably supported by the evidence. He argues that the court improperly rejected his expert witnesses' conclusions that he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct within the law. He further argues that the court made certain clearly erroneous findings of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As an initial matter, we set forth our standard of review. \"The evaluation of ... evidence on the issue of legal insanity is [within] the province of the finder of fact .... We have repeatedly stated that our review of the conclusions of the trier of fact ... is limited.... This court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court's [judgment] and will affirm the conclusion of the trier\n   of fact if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom.... The probative force of direct and circumstantial evidence is the same.... The credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony and to that of lay witnesses on the issue of sanity is determined by the trier of fact....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"The affirmative defense of mental disease or defect is codified in ... \u00a7 53a-13(a) and provides that [i]n any prosecution for an offense, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant, at the time he committed the proscribed act or acts, lacked substantial capacity, as a result of mental disease or defect, either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to control his conduct within the requirements of the law. Whereas an\n   <em>\n    affirmative defense\n   </em>\n   requires the defendant to establish his claim by a preponderance of the evidence, a properly raised\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   places the burden on the state to disprove the defendant's claim beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487910\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/149/1007/#p161\">\n    169 Conn.

In support of his affirmative defense, the defendant presented the testimony of two expert witnesses, David Lovejoy and Paul Amble, both of whom produced written evaluations that were admitted into evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lovejoy, a board certified neuropsychologist hired by the defense, examined the defendant on three separate occasions in July, September, and November, 2015. Lovejoy also reviewed a variety of records, conducted interviews with the defendant's wife and two of his friends, and watched the video recording of the police interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to Lovejoy, the defendant and his wife reported that in the two years leading up to the offense, the defendant had been experiencing multiple ongoing\n   stressors. Lovejoy's evaluation revealed that the defendant had lost his job as a truck driver in 2013 and that he had remained unemployed thereafter, despite continuing efforts to secure employment. Following the loss of his job, the defendant began drinking heavily, which resulted in criminal charges for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs. In January, 2015, the defendant, aware that there was a warrant out for his arrest in connection with these charges, turned himself in to authorities. The defendant remained in prison until his wife was able to secure a bail bond in March, 2015-shortly before the offense in question took place. According to the defendant's representations to Lovejoy, after his release from prison, he began to worry about his family's finances and, over time, started to \"feel crazy\" and experience thoughts of suicide. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to Lovejoy, \"[i]nformation collected during the clinical interviews with [the defendant] and the collateral interviews with his wife and friends indicated that [the defendant] began to decompensate psychiatrically, beginning on [March 22 or 23, 2015]. Strange behaviors, disrupted sleep, ruminative pacing, tangential and confused thinking, and moments of appearing 'spaced out' were observed by those who were with him.\" The defendant's wife also indicated to Lovejoy that she had observed the defendant begin to espouse paranoid thoughts related to a belief that she wanted to hurt or kill him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Regarding the defendant's conduct and state of mind later that week, Lovejoy's interviews with the defendant revealed that \"[b]y the evening [before and/or morning of the offense, the defendant] appeared to be under the influence of strong beliefs that were not based in reality (delusions).\" More specifically, the defendant reported to Lovejoy that he had begun to believe that he was\n   receiving messages via flashing lights emanating out of his computer screen. In Lovejoy's view, \"[t]hese beliefs had become a prominent part of [the defendant's] clinical presentation, at that time.\" The defendant also reported to Lovejoy that he had begun to hear voices that made critical comments about him. He described these voices as sounding like \"me talking to myself from the inside.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant further represented to Lovejoy that, by the night before the offense, he had resolved to kill himself because he \"was tired of trying to get [his] thoughts together and ... wanted the voices to go away,\" but he decided against doing it at that time because he did not want his wife and daughter to have to find his body in the house. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Lovejoy's interviews with the defendant further revealed that, by the morning of the offense, \"auditory hallucinations, delusions and suicidal thinking were present and appeared to be overarching influences on [the defendant's] thinking and behavior.\" More specifically, the defendant reported to Lovejoy that, on the morning of the offense, he had believed that the flashing lights from his computer screen were sending him a message indicating, \"[g]et your gun. You are worthless and others are evil.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant reported that the message also had indicated that he would receive additional messages from lights outside of his home. The defendant reported that, by this point, he had decided to kill himself at a local cemetery. He further reported, however, that he came upon a construction site displaying a range of colored lights that were flashing at him and that these lights and the voices inside of him told him to stop. According to the defendant, a person at the construction site fixed his eyes on him and then looked to another man with \"an evil intent,\" at which time the lights conveyed to\n   the defendant that this person was dangerous and that he should shoot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition to interviewing the defendant and collateral sources, Lovejoy also reviewed the defendant's medical records from after the offense. Regarding the defendant's Bridgeport Hospital records, which were admitted into evidence at trial, Lovejoy noted that mental health experts there had diagnosed him with \"psychosis not otherwise specified\" and that his Global Assessment of Functioning score indicated \"the presence of very severe psychiatric symptoms and associated functional impairments.\" Lovejoy further noted that the hospital records described a number of symptoms consistent with a thought disorder, including tangential thinking, thought blocking, confused and disorganized thinking, the inaccurate interpretation of reality, suspicious and paranoid thinking, difficulty following conversations and responding to questions, a poverty of speech, and impaired impulse control. The defendant also was observed to be internally preoccupied and staring suspiciously. Regarding the defendant's medical records from the Department of Correction (department), Lovejoy testified that they were largely, but not entirely, consistent with the hospital records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lovejoy testified\n   that, early on in the defendant's treatment at the department, a psychiatrist, Allison Downer, had suspected that the defendant may have been exaggerating or fabricating his mental health symptoms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lovejoy surmised, however, that Downer\n   likely had not reviewed the defendant's hospital records nor conducted any collateral interviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, as part of his evaluation, Lovejoy also conducted psychological and neuropsychological testing on the defendant. Lovejoy testified that this testing gave no indication that the defendant had been exaggerating his cognitive complaints or had been attempting to fabricate or exaggerate his psychiatric symptoms. According to Lovejoy, the testing revealed the presence of likely delusions, auditory hallucinations, and a tendency to experience confused thinking, which was consistent with the defendant's self-report of his psychological and psychiatric symptoms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing information, Lovejoy testified that his overall opinion was that, at the time of the offense, the defendant had been suffering from a psychotic disturbance that significantly influenced his thinking and behavior, although he was not able to arrive at any specific diagnosis for the defendant. Although he did not opine in his written evaluation as to whether this psychotic disturbance had impacted the defendant's ability to conform his conduct to the law, upon questioning by defense counsel, Lovejoy testified that the defendant's \"psychotic disorder did impact him in that way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Amble, a board certified forensic psychiatrist hired by the state, also testified for the defense. Amble evaluated the defendant for three and one-half hours in April,\n   2016. Amble reviewed the same reports, records, and video recording reviewed by Lovejoy and interviewed the same collateral sources. He also reviewed Lovejoy's written evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Amble testified that the information he obtained during his interviews with the collateral sources was consistent with that reported by Lovejoy. The defendant's account of his symptoms and the circumstances surrounding the offense, as reported in Amble's written evaluation, were also generally consistent with that provided to Lovejoy, but it also included some additional information. Regarding his auditory hallucinations, the defendant reported to Amble that he had first begun to hear voices while still incarcerated on the operating a motor vehicle while under the influence charges. He also reported that these voices had indicated to him on multiple occasions that he should kill himself, and\n   on the morning of the offense he heard his own voice confirming the plan. The defendant further reported that, in addition to the auditory hallucinations, he also had experienced visual hallucinations in the form of his deceased father. Most notably, upon questioning by Amble as to what exactly had prompted him to shoot the victim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the defendant reported that, at the time of the offense, he had perceived himself to be possessed by a demon and that, afterward, he had continued to be possessed until \"people in jail prayed over [him] and release[d] the demon.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On the basis of his review of the records, Amble concluded that the department's diagnosis of psychosis\n   not otherwise specified was reasonable, although he was likewise unable to make his own diagnosis. As to the defendant's insanity defense, Amble testified that his overall opinion was that, at the time of the offense, the defendant \"had some impairments in his ability to conform his conduct to the law.\" As Amble explained in more detail in his written evaluation, however, there were several pieces of countervailing information that militated against the veracity of the defendant's claim of insanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, Amble noted that the defendant had failed to share with anyone, including Lovejoy, that he was having severe visual hallucinations and auditory hallucinations while incarcerated prior to the offense. Second, the defendant had never before claimed to have been possessed by a demon until after repeated questioning by Amble. Amble opined that these two pieces of information, taken together, strongly suggested the possibility that the defendant was embellishing his psychiatric symptoms and was providing a malingered explanation for why he shot the victim. Third, the mental health evaluations by Downer at the department drew clear conclusions that the defendant was fabricating symptoms of a mental illness. Fourth, the defendant's account of his symptoms was not typical for individuals with a psychotic illness. Specifically, Amble stated that it was atypical for an individual to experience auditory hallucinations in one's own voice and to experience visual hallucinations as distinctive as those described by the defendant. Finally, Amble raised doubts about the claimed impulsivity of the shooting. He found it curious that, although the defendant purportedly had experienced auditory hallucinations telling him to kill himself on numerous occasions and had intended to do so on the day of the offense, the single hallucination at the construction site was enough to cause him to change his plans and kill somebody else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ultimately, Amble concluded that, despite these countervailing considerations, \"the sum of the evidence, including reports of the defendant's spouse and friends, the illogical nature of the act, the lack of primary gain, and mental health assessments immediately after the crime concluding that he was suffering from a psychiatric illness, provide[s] a sufficient basis to conclude that the defendant lacked substantial capacity to control his conduct at the time of his crime.\" In response to questioning by the court, Amble clarified that his conclusion was \"[t]o some extent based on [the defendant's own] report\" but also noted that the collateral information was \"very\n   important.\" He also attributed moderate weight to what he described as the seemingly illogical, senseless nature of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In rebuttal to the defendant's insanity defense, the state relied on its cross-examination of the defendant's two experts and the evidence adduced in its case-in-chief. A significant portion of the state's cross-examinations was focused on the possibility that the defendant's mental state had been caused by the use of PCP or \"bath salts.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13(b) (\"[i]t shall not be a defense under this section if such mental\n   disease or defect was proximately caused by the voluntary ingestion, inhalation or injection of intoxicating liquor or any drug or substance, or any combination thereof\"). Nevertheless, the state also challenged the experts' conclusions regarding the defendant's ability to control his conduct. On cross-examination, Lovejoy conceded that not all people who suffer from psychotic symptoms lose the ability to control their conduct within the requirements of the law and that the majority of people who suffer from some sort of psychosis do not come into contact with the law. Regarding his familiarity with the meaning of the statutory insanity defense, Lovejoy acknowledged that it was \"difficult for [him] to separate conceptually in [his] head\" the cognitive and volitional prongs because \"[f]or [him] the notion of understanding the wrongfulness of your action and the notion of being in control of your actions when you are separated from reality are somewhat intertwined ....\" Lovejoy agreed that this was \"sort of a philosophical difference from the way the law is written.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Amble likewise conceded on cross-examination that a psychosis does not necessarily impair a person's ability to control his or her conduct within the requirements of the law and that the majority of people experiencing their first episode of psychosis do not commit violent acts. Amble further conceded that the fact that a crime is poorly thought out does not necessarily indicate that it is a product of psychosis. Similarly, Amble agreed that the fact that someone may have reacted violently to\n   an apparently minor slight does not necessarily\n   indicate that he was operating under the influence of a psychosis. Moreover, in response to questioning by the court, Amble agreed that people who act illogically and commit illogical acts are not necessarily unable to conform their behavior to the requirements of the law.

The court also found that the defendant had been acting under the influence of \"a multitude of stressful and emotional hurdles in his life\n   <em>\n    not of a psychiatric nature\n   </em>\n   ,\" and, thus, it affirmatively found that \"the defendant's mental disease did not diminish his ability to conform his behavior.\" (Emphasis added.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   This conclusion directly conflicts\n   with Lovejoy and Amble's opinions. Therefore, the court, as the finder of fact, was entitled to adopt this nonpsychiatric explanation for the defendant's conduct and, accordingly, to reject the expert opinions. Moreover, given the experts' reliance on the defendant's own account of his symptoms and the events surrounding the shooting, it was reasonable for the court to conclude that the experts' opinions were undermined by the court's finding that the defendant intentionally had either embellished or fabricated psychiatric symptoms over time.

If an expert's opinion of the defendant's mental state at the time of the offense is based in part on information obtained from the defendant himself during the expert's interview with him, the fact finder may reasonably discredit this opinion if it finds the defendant's account to the expert to be inconsistent with other evidence adduced at trial.

As Lovejoy himself acknowledged, he found it difficult to distinguish between the cognitive and volitional prongs of the test. This difficulty appears to be borne out in his written evaluation, in which he opined that the defendant's psychosis had impaired the defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct but made absolutely no mention of the defendant's capacity to\n   <em>\n    control\n   </em>\n   his conduct. It was not until Lovejoy explicitly was asked at trial to opine on the volitional aspect of the affirmative defense that he offered an opinion. Given the conclusory nature of this opinion, his failure to offer such opinion in his written evaluation, and his apparent misapprehension of the distinction between the two prongs of the affirmative defense, the court reasonably could have found Lovejoy's opinion to be unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With respect to Amble, the court reasonably could have found that he had failed to account adequately for the defendant's statements to police immediately after the shooting. As indicated in his written evaluation, Amble found the defendant's reason for shooting the victim to be \"a mystery\" and relied on the apparent \"randomness\" and \"illogical\" nature of the shooting to conclude that the defendant lacked substantial capacity to control his conduct at the time of the offense. As Amble clarified at trial, he gave \"moderate\" weight to\n   the seemingly senseless, illogical nature of the act. As previously noted, however, the defendant himself told police immediately after the shooting that the victim had not been \"letting anyone out [there] work\" and that he had shot the victim to settle a perceived \"labor dispute.\" When confronted with this contradictory evidence at trial, Amble's only response was that the defendant's statements to police \"didn't seem to make sense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In light of the weight that Amble placed on the seemingly enigmatic nature of the shooting, the court reasonably could have found Amble's conclusion to be attenuated. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Patterson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"759953\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/229/328/#p338\">\n    229 Conn. at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=641%20A.2d%20123\">\n    641 A.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (trial court's finding that experts had failed adequately to account for defendant's apparently premeditated attack on victim, his efforts thereafter to avoid detection and apprehension, and his calculated attempts to manipulate hospital staff supported court's conclusion that defendant had failed to meet burden of establishing insanity defense).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Because the court's rejection of Lovejoy's and Amble's expert opinions is reasonably supported by the court's findings of fact and the evidence adduced at trial, the defendant's first argument fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The defendant also argues that some of the court's express subordinate findings of fact are clearly erroneous. Specifically, the defendant assigns as clearly erroneous the court's findings that (1) the defendant shot\n   the victim out of \"frustration and anger\"; (2) \"there was nothing unremarkable, untoward or aberrant about the defendant's\n   conduct [in the police interview]\"; and (3) the defendant either fabricated or embellished his symptoms over time. Because there is evidence in the record to support the court's factual findings and we are not left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made, we conclude that these findings are not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The defendant first contends that the court's finding that he shot the victim out of frustration and anger \"is not supported by the testimony of any witness.\" In support of this argument, the defendant points out that, not only did none of the victim's coworkers testify that the defendant had appeared angry, their testimony suggested the opposite-that there was \"nothing unusual\" about the defendant's demeanor during his initial interaction with the victim and Girdzis and there did not appear to be any argument or altercation between the defendant and any of the victim's coworkers. The defendant also notes that it was Girdzis and not the victim who had directed the defendant to fill out an application at the construction company's office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the defendant's state of mind in the period leading up to the offense, the defendant's wife reported to Lovejoy that, after losing his job in 2013, the defendant began on a downward emotional spiral characterized by significant depression and feelings of hopelessness about his future. She further reported that the defendant had become increasingly desperate for work in 2014 and that, upon his release from prison in March, 2015, he quickly became overwhelmed by financial pressures. The defendant's wife provided Amble with a similar account of the defendant's financial and emotional circumstances. Moreover, the defendant himself reported to Lovejoy that he had begun to worry about his family's finances and his failures in life upon leaving prison and that he had felt as though he had failed his family and was responsible for the stress\n   in their lives. Similarly, Lovejoy testified that the defendant had reported experiencing significant financial distress related to his lack of employment, the potential foreclosure of his home, and his bail bond obligation. Given this evidence, it was reasonable for the court to find that the defendant had been facing a \"multitude of stressful and emotional hurdles in his life not of a psychiatric nature ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   After the offense, the defendant stated in his interview with Detective Ortiz that he had been out of work for more than a year and that, after approaching the victim and his coworkers looking for a job, \"they sent [him] to the office.\" When asked by Ortiz whether the victim had said anything that upset him, the defendant responded, \"he did, he brushed me off.\" Similarly, Detective LaMaine testified that, immediately after being apprehended, the defendant had stated that the victim was not \"letting anyone out here work\" and that he had shot the victim to settle a \"labor dispute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the defendant's preexisting\n   anxiety and depression regarding his prolonged unemployment, his perception of the victim's response as a slight, his characterization of their interaction as a dispute, and his\n   admission that he shot the victim to settle this dispute, the court could have properly found that it was this perceived slight-as opposed to a psychotic delusion or hallucination-that prompted the defendant to shoot the victim. Consequently, it was reasonable for the court to find that \"[t]he defendant's actions in shooting [the victim] were not borne out of his psychosis\" and that he was simply \"acting out of frustration and anger.\" The fact that there was no\n   <em>\n    direct\n   </em>\n   evidence that the defendant had been\n   <em>\n    visibly\n   </em>\n   angry does not render this finding clearly erroneous.

The defendant thus appears to argue that, because the court rejected the opinions of Lovejoy and Amble, and the state did not offer any rebuttal expert testimony, the court had no proper basis on which to conclude that \"the defendant's mental disease did not diminish his ability to control his behavior.\" This claim clearly lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   It is well established that, although \"expert testimony is of great assistance, the ultimate issue of sanity, including intent, is decided by the trier of fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"499212\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/203/212/#p242\">\n    203 Conn. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20A.2d%201306\">\n    523 A.2d 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987).

He was avoidant of eye contact and while seated, [seemed] to be, 'coming in and out,' of different states of orientation and confusion. The mood is euthymic and with odd, bizarre affect. Denies auditory or visual hallucinations, denies suicidal or homicidal ideation.\" According to Amble, on April 6, 2015, Downer further noted: \"In light of collateral information, past custody records and presentation over his time in the infirmary, it can be stated with confidence [that the defendant] does not suffer with a mental illness and is not in acute risk of hurting himself or others. With the exception of the initial encounter, [the defendant] has been clear, logical and coherent, manifesting no symptoms of mood or psychotic disturbance. Informed him he would be discharged and he will continue to be seen by mental health for supportive intervention with psychotropic intervention to be employed if deemed necessary.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Specifically, Amble asked the defendant, \"[d]id you feel your body was overtaken by an evil spirit who took control of you and shot the man?\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The defendant responded affirmatively. When asked to explain, the defendant initially stated that \"something from the devil\" had taken control of his body and fired the gun. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Upon further probing, the defendant clarified that he perceived himself to be possessed by a demon.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Evidence pertaining to the possible use of PCP or bath salts is as follows. The defendant reported to Lovejoy that he had \"experimented with substances such as cocaine, hallucinogens and PCP\" but that \"he did not like the way that he felt after taking the substances and did not continue [using them].\" According to Amble, one of the defendant's friends whom he interviewed-identified only by the nickname \"Dread\"-claimed that the defendant's wife had mentioned to Dread that she had smelled PCP on the defendant's breath two weeks before the incident. At this point in the telephonic interview, the call was disconnected, and Amble's subsequent attempts to contact Dread were unsuccessful. As Amble noted, the defendant's wife denied any awareness of the defendant having used PCP. In summarizing the defendant's medical records, Amble also noted that there was a notation in the department's records indicating that a urine toxicology screen performed at Bridgeport Hospital had tested positive for PCP, which, as Amble recognized, directly contradicted the Bridgeport Hospital records. In an attempt to resolve this discrepancy, Amble contacted the individual at the department who had made the notation. According to Amble, she could not recall why she had made that notation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    At trial, Amble conceded that the defendant's behavior around the time of the shooting could also be consistent with PCP use or with the use of \"bath salts,\" also known as \"synthetic marijuana.\" According to Amble, synthetic marijuana \"has a much more potent ... psychogenic effect on individuals [than marijuana],\" and it is commonly used by people who know that they are going to be subjected to drug testing because there is not a readily available, reliable test for it. Ultimately, however, the trial court found that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the defendant's mental state had been the product of PCP use.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Regarding the \"labor dispute\" explanation he had given to LaMaine, the defendant told Amble, \"[i]t was like I was a mechanic and this was a labor dispute.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) When asked what was specifically in his mind at the time of the offense, he responded, \"I don't know where [this explanation] came from and why.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In discussing its rejection of the experts' opinions, the court observed that \"their testimony and ... reports show at least as much divergence as they do uniformity in the basis for their opinions.\" The defendant argues that \"this observation does not justify rejecting both experts' conclusions.\" We conclude that this claim is inadequately briefed. \"We are not required to review issues that have been improperly presented to this court through an inadequate brief.... Analysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Fowler\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12491858\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/175/76/#p345\">\n     178 Conn.

More specifically, the defendant contends that this conclusion is not logically supported by the court's subsidiary findings of fact-namely, that he greeted and exchanged pleasantries with the construction workers, made overtures for a job, and behaved appropriately during the police interview-because these findings are not necessarily inconsistent with a conclusion that the defendant was legally insane. In other words, the defendant's position appears to be that, in order to reasonably infer that he was legally sane from circumstantial evidence of his state of mind, such evidence must be so strong as to exclude every other possible inference. This argument plainly lacks merit, as it contravenes the well-established principle that \"[p]roof of a material fact by inference from circumstantial evidence need not be so conclusive as to exclude every other hypothesis.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Berthiaume\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489404\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/681/#p444\">\n     171 Conn.

The only mention of \"AA\" in the record is in Lovejoy's written evaluation. The defendant reported to Lovejoy that, on the night before the shooting, he had been placing pages from a phone book into neighbors' mailboxes in the belief that the pages represented messages. According to Lovejoy, the defendant believed that one of these messages related to \"AA Automotive.\" As the defendant appears to suggest, this evidence reasonably might be construed to support the defendant's contention that he was delusional at the time of the shooting. The trial court, however, evidently did not find this evidence to be so strong as to preclude its finding that the defendant's actions were motivated by nonpsychiatric factors. Accordingly, to the extent the defendant is arguing that this evidence renders the court's finding clearly erroneous, we disagree.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The defendant appears to argue that we may review this finding de novo because \"[t]here was no live witness whose credibility could only be assessed by the fact finder,\" and that, therefore, this court is in as good a position as the trial court to assess the defendant's demeanor during the interview.
