At approximately 9:35 p.m. on August 10, 2014, Police Officers Kyle Lipeika, Stephen Cowf, and Michael Pugliese (officers) were patrolling Washington Village, a housing complex in Norwalk. The officers were members of the Street Crimes Task Force within the Special Services Division (task force) of the Norwalk Police Department (department).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   They had entered Washington Village from Day Street and walked through\n   an alley that led to a courtyard between buildings 104 and 304. Lipeika was shining a flashlight in order for people in the courtyard to see the officers approaching. Lipeika and Cowf were wearing uniforms with yellow letters identifying them as police. When the officers entered\n   the courtyard, they saw benches, a picnic table, a cement retaining wall,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   bushes, a playground, and six individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant, Kason Sumpter, and Altolane Jackson were seated at the picnic table near a corner formed by the cement walls of a planter. The defendant was seated with his back to the cement wall containing the bushes. See footnote 4 of this opinion. Brian Elmore first walked away from the officers, but turned back and sat at the picnic table.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   To establish rapport with the individuals sitting at the table, the officers engaged them in conversation. As was their practice, the officers scanned the area for firearms and narcotics that the individuals may have tried to conceal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Cowf and Pugliese conversed with the individuals at the picnic table, Lipeika stepped onto the wall behind the defendant and immediately saw in plain view a gun lying in the corner by the bushes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to Lipeika, the gun looked like it had been placed there just before he discovered it because the gun was resting on top of leaves, was not covered with\n   dirt or debris, except a twig, and appeared to be free of rust and dust. Jackson and Kason Sumpter were seated closest to the gun, two or three feet away from it. The defendant was seated four to five feet away from the gun. None of the officers who testified had seen the defendant touch the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Lipeika discovered the gun, he drew his weapon and ordered the six individuals in the courtyard to show their hands. Pugliese and Cowf detained the individuals and moved them away from the gun. Lipeika radioed for more officers and guarded the gun until the scene was secured. The additional officers photographed the scene and the gun. Then Lipeika put on a new pair of rubber gloves and seized the loaded gun in accordance\n   with department procedures. He removed the ammunition from the gun, a revolver with a two inch barrel, and took the ammunition and the gun to the police station.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Days later, at Lipeika's request, the defendant, Kason Sumpter, Jackson, and Elmore went to the police station; each of them voluntarily provided a sample of his DNA. None of them claimed that the gun was his. The defendant also provided a written statement in which he stated that he \"walked through Washington Village to Water Street, stopped to talk when officers came through and found a handgun in the bushes in the area [where] I was talking.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jackson, too, provided a written statement and testified at trial that he was in the Washington Village courtyard when the defendant walked through and stopped to talk. He also stated that ten minutes later someone said \"police,\" and everyone looked up. Jackson did not see the defendant with a gun, and he did not see the defendant walk toward the bushes where the gun was found. Jackson confirmed that the gun did not belong to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 28, 2014, Arthur Weisgerber, a lieutenant in the department, tested the gun for latent fingerprints but did not find any suitable for identification. Thereafter, he used swabs to collect DNA from the gun and the ammunition that Lipeika had removed from the gun. He placed the swabs in an envelope. In addition, Weisgerber fired the gun and determined that it was operable. The swabs and the DNA samples provided by the defendant, Kason Sumpter, Jackson, and Elmore, were delivered to the state forensics laboratory (laboratory), where Melanie Russell, a forensic science examiner, conducted DNA analyses of the materials. Russell provided expert testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The laboratory has procedures to protect DNA samples and evidence from contamination. It also prescribes how laboratory analysis of DNA is to be conducted. The DNA that Weisgerber swabbed from the gun and ammunition is touch DNA because it was deposited on the gun or ammunition when someone touched them directly, through a secondary transfer or through aerosolization, that is, coughing or sneezing. Touch DNA comes from skin cells left behind when a person touches an object. The quantity and quality of touch DNA varies according to the character of the object's surface, i.e., rough or smooth, and the length of time the DNA has been on the object. DNA degrades with time due to environmental factors, such as heat and moisture. Degradation makes it difficult to amplify the DNA and, in some cases, even to detect DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The quantity of DNA on the swabs was small, and the DNA was partially degraded. Nonetheless, Russell was able to extract a DNA solution of 7.16 picograms per microliter from the swabs. Although she was able to amplify a sample of about seventy picograms of DNA, 1000 picograms is the ideal amount for DNA analysis. A low yield sample will provide a DNA profile but usually not a full profile. Russell was able to generate a\n   partial profile and obtained results at seven out of fifteen loci tested. The profile Russell obtained from the gun and ammunition consisted of a mixture of DNA, signifying the presence of more than one person's DNA. She was able to compare the DNA from the swabs with the samples provided by the defendant, Kason Sumpter, Elmore and Jackson in a scientifically accurate way and to obtain scientifically viable and accurate results. Her analysis eliminated Kason Sumpter, Elmore, and Jackson as possible contributors to the DNA profile she developed from the swabs. The defendant, however, could not be eliminated as a contributor. The expected frequency of individuals\n   who could not be eliminated as a contributor to the DNA profile is approximately one in 1.5 million in the African-American population, one in 3.5 million in the Caucasian population, and one in 930,000 in the Hispanic population.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant is African-American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A warrant was issued for the defendant's arrest on September 25, 2014. He was charged in separate informations with criminal possession of a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and criminal trespass in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-109 (a) (1). The informations were consolidated for trial. Subsequently, the state filed an amended long form information charging the defendant with criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of \u00a7 53a-217c and criminal trespass in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-109 (a) (1). At the conclusion of the state's case-in-chief, the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. The court denied the motion for a judgment\n   of acquittal. The jury found the defendant guilty of both charges. The court sentenced the defendant to consecutive terms of ten years imprisonment, two years being a mandatory minimum, on the conviction of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, and three months imprisonment on the conviction of criminal trespass in the third degree, for a total effective sentence of ten years and three months to serve. Thereafter, the defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver because there was insufficient evidence of his knowledge of the gun and no evidence to prove his dominion or control over it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant was charged, in part, with violation of \u00a7 53a-217c, which provides in relevant part: \"(a) A person is guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver when such person possesses a pistol or revolver ... and (1) has been convicted of a felony ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (2) defines \"possess\" as \"to have physical possession or otherwise to exercise dominion or control over tangible property ....\" Because the gun was not found on the defendant's person, the state prosecuted the subject charge under the theory of constructive possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"There are two types of possession, actual possession and constructive possession....

The defendant argues on appeal that although the gun was found near him and his DNA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   was found on it, his proximity to it and the presence of his DNA on the gun and ammunition are not sufficient evidence to prove that he had knowledge of the gun, knew of its presence or exercised dominion or control over it. In particular, the defendant argues that the presence of his DNA on the gun merely means that at some unknown time and under unknown circumstances his DNA was transferred to the gun, but that is insufficient to support a finding that he knew of the gun's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The state acknowledges that because the defendant was not in exclusive control of the courtyard, the jury could not infer properly from that circumstance that the defendant knew of the gun's presence without incriminating statements or other circumstances to buttress the inference. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086240\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/296/62/#p78\">\n    296 Conn. 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 78,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=993%20A.2d%20970\">\n    993 A.2d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The state, however, contends that there were four circumstances that established a nexus between the defendant and the gun and permitted the jury reasonably to infer that the defendant knew of the gun's presence, that he was in a position to exercise dominion or control over it, and that he intended to do so. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517934\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/201/505/#p516\">\n    201 Conn. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20A.2d%201252\">\n    523 A.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the state notes that the gun was found in plain view and appeared to have been placed near the bushes recently. The jury, therefore, reasonably could have inferred that the person who put the gun near the bushes did not abandon it and leave the courtyard but, instead, was one of the six individuals in the courtyard when the officers arrived. In response, the defendant argues that the gun was not in plain view because Lipeika needed a flashlight\n   to see it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's argument\n   lacks merit. The police were patrolling the courtyard pursuant to the department's agreement with the housing authority. The officers needed artificial light both to be seen as they approached the courtyard and to see what was in the courtyard. The gun was lying on a wall in a public space, and it was dark. The gun was in the open and uncovered, and, therefore, it was in plain view. It clearly would have been visible in daylight. Under the circumstances, there is no difference between Lipeika's using a flashlight and turning on a light in a dark room. Furthermore, the state's argument is not that the location of the gun is evidence that the defendant saw it there. Instead, the state's argument is that the location of the uncovered gun near the bushes close to the defendant supports the inference that the defendant had placed the gun there. Thus, the lighting conditions at the time were immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the state points out that Lipeika was shining his flashlight when the officers walked through the alley into the courtyard. In his statement to the police, Jackson stated that someone saw the light and called out \"police,\" causing individuals in the courtyard to look up. According to Lipeika, when individuals who have a gun in their possession become aware of a police presence, they try to \"discard ... or stash\" the gun so that they will not be detected with it. The state, therefore, argues that it was reasonable for the jury to infer that the defendant quickly put the gun on the wall near the bushes to avoid being found with it. The jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the defendant, whom it knew to be a convicted felon, was motivated to \"stash\" the gun because he is not entitled to possess a gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Third, the state cites Lipeika's testimony that, when individuals with a gun seek to \"discard ... or stash\" it, they put the gun in a place close enough to be \"accessible\" to them. In this instance, the gun was four to five feet from the defendant, who was sitting at a picnic table next to the wall and bushes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Fourth, the defendant was the only person at the picnic table who could not be eliminated as a contributor to the DNA profile found on the gun and ammunition. The chance that a random individual, someone other than the defendant, could have contributed to the DNA was one in 1.5 million in the African-American population. On the basis of these four circumstances, the state argues that the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant knew of the gun's presence and could have exercised dominion or control over it, and intended to do so. Although none of the factors alone is direct evidence of the defendant's knowledge of the gun's presence or his intent to possess it, the cumulative force of the circumstantial evidence was sufficient for the jury reasonably to infer that the defendant knew of the gun and was in constructive possession of it. \"Where a group of facts [is] relied upon for proof of an element of the crime it is [the] cumulative impact [of those\n   facts] that is to be weighed in deciding whether the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been met and each individual fact need not be proved in accordance with that standard.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McDonough\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"504668\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/205/352/#p355\">\n    205 Conn. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=533%20A.2d%20857\">\n    533 A.2d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13956,13348,13188,13383,13543,13800,13222,14165,13401,14171,13981,14174,13247\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/906/\">\n    485 U.S. 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20S.%20Ct.%201079\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20238\">\n    99 L.Ed.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Evidence of the defendant's DNA on the gun and ammunition, plus his proximity to the gun, leads to a reasonable inference that the defendant once had the gun on his person and intended to do so again when the police left the courtyard.\n   The defendant argues, citing\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"516009\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/186/179/\">\n    186 Conn. 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=440%20A.2d%20280\">\n    440 A.2d 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982), that the state cannot rely on the DNA evidence alone to prove that he knew of the gun's presence on the wall near the bushes.

Here, the defendant not only was at the scene at the time the gun was found, but he also was in close proximity to it. Others were in close proximity to the gun too, but the defendant was the only one of them who was a contributor to the DNA obtained from the surface of the gun or the ammunition, or both. Moreover, the defendant had at least two reasons to \"stash\" the gun. The defendant stipulated to the fact that he was a convicted felon. We discern that the jury reasonably could have inferred\n   that because the defendant was trespassing\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, more importantly, because he was a convicted felon, he had \"stashed\" the gun to avoid being found with the gun on his person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The defendant also argues that the DNA evidence is insufficient due to \"the questionable reliability of a sample containing only 70 picograms of DNA, when the ideal amount is 1000 picograms of DNA.\" The defendant did not object to the admission of the DNA evidence at trial, but cites Russell's testimony regarding problems that are inherent in testing small samples of DNA. Despite the small sampling, however,\n   Russell testified that she was able to analyze the DNA from the gun, and that she obtained scientifically viable and accurate results that revealed a high likelihood that the defendant was a contributor to the sample. Her findings were reviewed by a forensic science examiner in the laboratory and no problems were identified. Defense counsel vigorously cross-examined Russell. Although the burden was on the state to prove its case, the defendant presented no evidence to contradict Russell's testimony regarding the accuracy of her analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant's claim is not that Russell's testimony regarding the results of her DNA analysis was improperly admitted. The evidence, therefore, properly was before the jury to be considered along with the other evidence. The size of the sample went to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. \"It is axiomatic that it is the jury's role as the sole trier of the facts to weigh the conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses.... It is the right and duty of the jury to determine whether to accept or to reject the testimony of a witness ... and what weight, if any, to lend to the testimony of a witness and the evidence presented at trial.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Osbourne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779650\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/138/518/#p533\">\n    138 Conn.

Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines the noun 'control' as the 'power or authority to guide or manage.' The essence of exercising control is not the manifestation of an act of control but instead\n   <em>\n    it is the act of being in a position of control coupled with the requisite mental intent\n   </em>\n   .

In the present case, the state presented evidence of the defendant's proximity to the gun, which provided a DNA profile from which the defendant could not be excluded. There is circumstantial evidence that the gun recently had been placed on the wall near the bushes. The defendant, a convicted felon, had a reason not to want to be found with the gun on his person, and, therefore, the jury reasonably could have inferred that he had \"stashed\" it and remained in close proximity to it, so that he could exercise dominion or control over it, if he so intended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence by which the jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant was in possession of the gun when he entered the courtyard, that he put it near the bushes when the police arrived so that it would not be found on his person, and that he intended to retrieve the gun when the police left. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to support the defendant's conviction of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, and the court, therefore, properly denied the defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The defendant also claims that he was deprived of a fair trial because, during her final argument, the prosecutor (1) misstated the law of constructive possession and (2) mischaracterized the DNA evidence.

As a consequence, the defendant argues that the prosecutor invited the jury to disregard\n   the dominion or control element of possession. Although the prosecutor's argument did contain an incomplete and, therefore, incorrect statement of the law of constructive possession, we conclude that the error did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To provide a context for the defendant's claims, we have reviewed the entire record, which discloses the following procedural history that is relevant to the defendant's claim that the prosecutor misstated the law. Before the presentation of evidence, the court instructed the jury that \"you should understand that the arguments of the attorneys, including the closing arguments and any arguments made during the trial to the court in connection with questions of law, are not evidence.... Closing arguments are intended to assist you, the jury, in understanding the evidence and the contentions of the parties in this case.... [A]t the conclusion of the final arguments of the parties,\n   <em>\n    I will instruct you as to the principles of law which you are to apply in your deliberations when you retire to consider your verdicts.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Again, in its final charge to the jury, after thanking the jury for its service, the court gave the\n   customary charge stating that \"it is exclusively the function of the court to state the rules of law that govern the case. It is your obligation to accept the law as I state it. You must follow all of my instructions and not single out some and ignore others. They are all equally important.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The record also discloses that the court held two on-the-record charge conferences. The court gave counsel a copy of a draft of its charge and time to review it. The court and counsel subsequently went through the draft page by page, and counsel made several suggestions,\n   none of which concerned constructive possession. As a result of the charge conference, the court revised portions of its draft charge, presented counsel with its revised charge and provided an opportunity for counsel to review the revisions. At a second on-the-record charge conference, the court and counsel went through the revised charge page by page. Defense counsel orally agreed with the court's revised charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"A review of the statements made by the prosecutor, in the context of the entire closing argument, is necessary to address the defendant's challenges.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%2051\">\n    305 Conn. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20629\">\n    43 A.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record contains the arguments of the prosecutor and defense counsel, and the court's instructions, which we have reviewed and hereafter summarize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In the first portion of her argument, the prosecutor first thanked the jury for its service and then stated that the court will \"\n   <em>\n    remind you as to the elements of the crimes that make up the charges\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) The prosecutor then addressed the elements of the crime of criminal trespass in the third degree and the evidence related to that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Thereafter, she stated, in part: \"For you to find the defendant guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt. The first element is that the defendant possessed a pistol or revolver.\n   <em>\n    The judge will define possession as having control over an object.\n   </em>\n   That is, knowing where it is and being able to access it. Again, possession in this case means knowing where it is and being able to access it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The prosecutor continued: \"You've heard that the gun recovered from the scene was found only four to five feet away from [the defendant]. It was lying on top of the leaves, in good condition, as if it had been placed there very recently. No dirt or leaves or other debris were covering it. It was easily in [the defendant's] reach. He was about four to five feet away from it when the police arrived. The state submits that it would have been a matter of seconds for him to stand up, or lean over, and drop the gun, or even pick it up again from where it was lying.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Later in the first portion of her argument, the prosecutor stated: \"Here's the thing,\n   <em>\n    you'll hear the judge instruct you on the law of possession\n   </em>\n   . And through that you will learn that if [the defendant] walked up to the gun and saw it there and was aware that it was there, he's still in violation of the law. Because as long as he's aware it's there and aware it's a gun, and could grab it off the ground, that's possession. If he walked up to it and said 'oh, no, a gun,' and ran away, i.e., if he\n   immediately removes himself from the situation, that's different. Or if he saw it and immediately dialed 911 or alerted the authorities, that's different, too. But if he sees the gun and remains at the picnic table anyway, four to five feet away from it, not locked up or anything like that, in an area where he could easily get to it, that's constructive possession. It's that simple.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor argued: \"So for you to find him not guilty, you would have to believe that despite his close proximity to the gun, despite the fact that he's trespassing in the exact location the gun is found, and despite the fact that his DNA, and not the DNA of any other person around the picnic table is on it, he didn't even know it was there. Ask yourselves, based on common sense, is it reasonable and logical to believe that?\" The prosecutor also argued that the\n   jury reasonably could infer that the gun belonged to the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In his closing argument, which immediately followed, defense counsel addressed the evidence, particularly what he considered to be the weakness in the state's case. He contended that the DNA evidence was not enough to incriminate the defendant because the profile was small, the DNA sample was touch DNA, and the sample had been degraded. The theory of defense was that the DNA evidence was problematic and insufficient to prove that the defendant was guilty of felony possession of the gun. Defense counsel argued, in part, that the state had \"to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the [the defendant] knew, or had knowledge of, that he was in possession of [the gun], that he knew where it was and that he had access to it.\" See footnote 17 of this opinion. He continued that the jury could not \"infer or assume that [the defendant] knew that a weapon was there, unless there are other incriminating statements or circumstances tending to support such an inference. We argue that no such statements or circumstances exist.... You need context, you need corroboration, and you don't have it. You don't have eye witnesses. You don't have fingerprints. You don't have enough.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In the rebuttal portion of her argument, the prosecutor first stated: \"I just want to touch on a few things that the defense touched on. I want to start with something.\n   <em>\n    The judge will instruct you\n   </em>\n   ... and I just want to make sure it's clear, that you will come to a separate verdict on each charge.\n   <em>\n    So, the state has to prove every element of each individual charge.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) She extensively addressed the DNA evidence, which the defendant contended was problematic and insufficient to prove that the gun was his. She argued that the presence of the defendant's DNA on the gun or ammunition and his proximity to the gun was enough to prove his knowledge of it. The prosecutor concluded:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"For you to accept the defense's theory, you have to accept the idea that [the defendant] is the unluckiest man alive. That this set of coincidences has come out of nowhere and each and every one of them has coincidentally occurred on the same evening. The convergence of him trespassing, at a time when unluckily a gun was nearby, within four to five feet of him, only his DNA, and no one else's at the scene, gets on to it, at a time when he happens to be trespassing and happens to be prohibited from possession of such a gun.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Immediately upon conclusion of the prosecutor's rebuttal argument, the court began its charge to the jury, stating: \"\n   <em>\n    It is now my duty to instruct you as to the law that you are to apply to the facts in this case\n   </em>\n   .... The charges [are] to be considered as a whole, and individual instructions are not [to] be considered [in] artificial isolation from the overall charge.... It is\n   exclusively the function of the court to state the rules of law that govern the case.\n   <em>\n    It is your obligation to accept the law as I state it\n   </em>\n   . You must follow all of my instructions and not single out some and ignore others. They are all equally important.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The court gave general instructions applicable in any trial and then addressed the law related to the crimes with which the defendant was charged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court's\n   instruction included definitions of knowledge and\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   . The court stated, in part: \"A person\n   <em>\n    acts knowingly\n   </em>\n   with respect to conduct or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware that his conduct is of such nature or that such circumstance exists.\" (Emphasis added.) It also stated that \"[\n   <em>\n    i\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ntent\n   </em>\n   relates to the condition of the mind of the person who commits the act, his or her purpose in doing it. Here, the state is required to prove that the defendant intentionally, and not inadvertently or accidentally, engaged in his actions. In other words, the state must prove that the defendant's actions were intentional, voluntary and knowing, rather than unintentional, involuntary and unknowing.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court continued: \"A person is guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver when such person possesses a pistol or revolver and has been convicted of a felony. For you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt.... The first element is that the defendant possessed a pistol or revolver.... Possession means either having the object on one's person or otherwise having control over the object. That is, knowing where it is and being able to access it. Possession also requires that the defendant knew he was in possession of the firearm. That is, that he was aware that he was in possession of it and was aware of its nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"The state must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant knew that he was in possession of the pistol or revolver. Possession does not mean that one must have the illegal object upon one's person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Rather, a person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has the power and\n   <em>\n    the intention\n   </em>\n   , at a given time, to exercise control over a thing is deemed to be in constructive possession of that item. As long as the object is or was in a place where the defendant could, if he wishes, go and get it, it is in his possession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.) Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel took an exception to the charge. See footnote 17 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the prosecutor's argument concerning possession \"completely disregards the dominion [or] control element of possession and was a direct invitation to the jury to disregard an element of constructive possession that the state was required to prove.\" He argues that the prosecutor improperly equated mere access with possession and that her argument does not conform to the definition of possession found in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517934\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/201/505/#p516\">\n    201 Conn. at 516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20A.2d%201252\">\n    523 A.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to wit, \"[t]o possess, according to \u00a7 53a-3 (2), is to have actual physical possession or otherwise to exercise dominion or control ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The state acknowledges that the prosecutor did not state explicitly that the defendant must have, not only the power, but also the intention to exercise dominion or control over the gun. It contends, however, that the defendant has not cited any authority that the prosecutor needs to discuss all aspects of the relevant law in summation. The state argues that it is the court's duty \"to give jury instructions that are accurate in law, adapted to the issues and adequate to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict ....\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bellamy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p429\">\n    323 Conn. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 429,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p429\">\n    147 A.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Although we agree that the court is responsible for instructing the jury on the law, that fact does not give the prosecutor license to misstate the law to the jury. During closing argument, the prosecutor three times incorrectly told the jury that it could convict the defendant if he knew where the gun was located and had access to it. According to the prosecutor, \"[i]t's that simple.\" Of course, it is not that simple. The prosecutor's statement left out the necessary element of intent. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hill\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"517934\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/201/505/#p516\">\n    201 Conn. at 512-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=523%20A.2d%201252\">\n    523 A.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the prosecutor's statement of the law was not just incomplete, it was inaccurate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Nevertheless, the jury was informed numerous times, including by the prosecutor, that it was the court's responsibility to instruct the jury as to the law. In particular, at the beginning of trial and when it commenced its charge, the court informed the jury that it was its duty to instruct the jury on the law and that the jury was bound to follow the law as given by the court.

The state represented that the court's\n   instruction was \"nearly\n   identical to the model jury instructions for possession and criminal possession\" of a gun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant recognizes that the court's charge conformed to the model jury instructions on the elements of possession, but he argues, citing\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489690\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/323/\">\n    325 Conn. 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821-22 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489690\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/323/\">\n    160 A.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017),\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the model jury instructions are not indicative of their correctness, and, citing\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bellamy\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p429\">\n    323 Conn. at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p429\">\n    147 A.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring),\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the model instructions have been the source of constitutional error. Despite this argument, the defendant has not demonstrated how the model jury instruction used in the present case is a source of constitutional error, as the model charge for constructive possession, which is explicitly referenced in the model charge for criminal possession of a pistol or revolver, requires that the state prove knowledge of the gun's presence and an intent\n   to possess it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, defense counsel had the opportunity to review the court's charge prior to an initial on-the-record charge conference, participated in that charge conference, and offered suggestions. None of the suggestions offered related to the charge on constructive possession. The court made several changes to its charge pursuant to the suggestions of counsel, distributed its revised charge to counsel and held a second on-the-record charge conference. At the conclusion of the second charge conference, defense counsel agreed to the revised charge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, the court specifically instructed the jury that \"a person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has the power and the intention, at a given time, to exercise control over a thing is deemed to be in constructive possession of that item.\" \"The jury [is] presumed to follow the court's directions in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fields\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"913341\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/265/184/#p207\">\n    265 Conn. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=827%20A.2d%20690\">\n    827 A.2d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003). \"[P]rosecutorial [impropriety] claims [are] not intended to provide an avenue for the tactical sandbagging of our trial courts, but rather, to address\n   <em>\n    gross\n   </em>\n   prosecutorial improprieties ....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8458155\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/563/#p576\">\n    269 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=849%20A.2d%20626\">\n    849 A.2d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

Although the prosecutor's inaccurate reference to the law of constructive possession had the potential to confuse the jury, applying the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors, we conclude that any perceived impropriety did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial. But we take this opportunity to remind prosecutors that during the course of argument, they must take care to accurately discuss the elements of the crimes charged. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12507876\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/204/1183/#p339\">\n    188 Conn.

In examining the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   factors, we find that the prosecutor's argument, although not invited by defense counsel, was not central to the theory of defense that focused on the DNA evidence. Furthermore, the state's case was convincing in that the defendant could not be excluded as a contributor to the DNA mixture obtained from the gun or ammunition. Most importantly, the court's correct charge on constructive possession coupled with the repeated admonitions that the jury must follow the law as given to it by the court, adequately cured the prosecutor's error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the prosecutor's statement regarding the law of constructive possession fell well short of misleading the jury with respect to constructive possession and did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The defendant also claims that the prosecutor's mischaracterization of the DNA evidence deprived him of a fair trial. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The defendant claims that the state mischaracterized the DNA evidence and improperly suggested that there was no evidence to support the defense's theory that although his DNA may have been on the gun or ammunition, it came to be there in some incidental or accidental fashion. The defendant contends that Russell testified as to the various ways in which DNA can be transferred, and that she could not conclude how the defendant's DNA came to be on the gun and that, therefore, the following portion of the prosecutor's final argument was improper: \"You've heard no evidence that [the defendant], for instance, sneezed on the gun. And you can't assume that happened because it's not in evidence.... Secondary transfer would require someone to touch [the defendant], or an object, with his DNA on it, and then to touch the gun. But there's no evidence that ever occurred. No evidence for you to consider\n   with regard to that.... So, there is no evidence before you that Officer Lipeika, or anyone else for that matter, touched some object that [the defendant] touched and then touched the gun soon thereafter. You haven't heard any evidence to that effect.... Again, I would reiterate, you haven't heard any evidence of a transfer DNA. You haven't heard evidence of someone spitting on the gun. And if [the defendant] had spit on the gun, he would have spat around ... Jackson from four to five feet away. Does that seem likely? The same thing with a sneeze. He would have sneezed around ... Jackson from four to five feet away. That's not likely.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defense counsel did not object to the prosecutor's argument. As stated previously, a defendant's failure to object is not fatal to his claim, but this court has stated that we continue \"to adhere to the well established maxim that defense counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor's argument when it was made suggests that defense counsel did not believe that it was [improper] in light of the record of the case at the time.... This\n   is particularly true if, as in the present case, a defendant claims prosecutorial impropriety stemming from a prosecutor's discussion of DNA evidence. Such discussions require precise and nuanced distinctions in nomenclature that easily may be misconveyed or misunderstood, especially in light of the zealous advocacy that is part and parcel of a closing argument. If a prosecutor's arguments do not portray accurately the DNA evidence as it was presented to the jury or stray too far from reasonable inferences that may be drawn from such evidence, a contemporaneous objection by defense counsel would permit any misstatements, whether inadvertent or intentional, to be remedied immediately.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brett B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505704\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/200/706/#p572\">\n    186 Conn.

On cross-examination, defense counsel explored the problematic issues with the DNA profile that were critical to the defendant's theory of the case, i.e., that his DNA was deposited on the gun by secondary transfer or aerosolization. The defendant argues that the prosecutor's final argument that there was no evidence of a secondary transfer or aerosolization for the jury to consider mischaracterized Russell's testimony. We disagree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Russell testified as to a number of ways in which the defendant's DNA could have been transferred to the gun and that she did not know how his DNA was deposited on it. Russell's testimony described possibilities or hypotheticals, but such testimony is not evidence of how, in fact, the defendant's DNA came to be on the gun or the ammunition. Russell, however, testified that the most common way for touch DNA to occur is through direct contact. The prosecutor's argument simply was that there was\n   <em>\n    no evidence\n   </em>\n   to support the defendant's theory that the defendant's DNA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   was deposited on the gun by a secondary transfer or aerosolization. The court instructed the jury that its verdicts had to be based on evidence that it heard. \"While the jury may not speculate to reach a conclusion of guilt, [it] may draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven to reach a verdict.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stovall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416180\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/142/562/#p567\">\n    142 Conn.

It was not required to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state proved that the defendant's DNA was contained in the DNA profile\n   developed from the swab of the gun and ammunition. That fact was in evidence. The state also presented circumstantial evidence permitting the jury to find the defendant guilty of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. Pursuant to Russell's testimony, the jury reasonably could have found that it was more likely that the defendant's DNA on the gun and ammunition came from his direct contact with them than from either secondary transfer or aerosolization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that, although the prosecutor misstated the law of constructive possession, the defendant has failed to carry his burden to demonstrate that he was denied due process.

The defendant was under no obligation to provide any evidence as to how the DNA came to be on the gun, but he certainly could have done so if such evidence was available to him.
