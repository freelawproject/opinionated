The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court violated his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment to the United States constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Specifically, the defendant argues that the court violated his confrontation rights by improperly admitting into evidence a witness' prior videotaped statement to the police in accordance with\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. 743\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 753,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6502338,6503652,6502713,6503432,6503325,6503216,6503540,6502614,6502425,6502525,6503134\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/994/\">\n    479 U.S. 994\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=107%20S.%20Ct.%20597\">\n    107 S.Ct. 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20598\">\n    93 L.Ed.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986), because the witness was functionally unavailable for cross-examination due to his refusal to provide verbal responses to any questions asked by the prosecutor or defense counsel when called to testify before the jury. The defendant further argues that the improper admission of the witness' prior statement did not constitute harmless error because its content significantly undermined his justification defense. We agree with the defendant and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of conviction and remand the matter for a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. Late in the evening on February 27, 2007, the defendant and Lenworth Williams entered Building 5 of the Greene Homes housing complex in Bridgeport, at which time they encountered the victim, Juan Marcano, and several of his friends. The victim and his friends became embroiled in a confrontation with the defendant and Williams. The defendant, who was part of a group that controlled the sale of drugs in Building 5, was angry with the victim because he had been selling fake crack cocaine in Building 5, damaging the defendant's reputation and drug business. As the confrontation escalated, the victim went to his car and retrieved a handgun. At some point, Williams was able to get\n   away by ascending a nearby staircase, returning soon thereafter with Garrett Bostick, also known as \"Slim,\" who lived on the fifth floor of Building 5, and John Trevil, also known as \"Pealz\" or \"Pills.\" When the defendant and his group tried to exit the lobby back into the stairwell and up the stairs, the victim grabbed Slim and pulled him back down the stairs, at which time the victim was kicking and pistol-whipping Slim. The victim, who was six feet, eight inches tall and weighed approximately 400 pounds, was considerably larger than Slim. Neither the defendant nor his friends called for help or otherwise attempted to break up the fight by nondeadly means. Rather, the defendant pulled out a pistol and fired two gunshots into the victim's back, which immediately incapacitated him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The victim's friends chased the defendant and his group up the stairs. Slim and Pills went into Slim's apartment. The defendant tossed his gun into the apartment before he and Williams continued down the hallway, exiting the building via a different stairway. Williams eventually drove the defendant back to his mother's house at 135 Higgins Avenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The victim was able to call 911 for medical assistance and, after the police responded, he was transported to Bridgeport Hospital. The next morning, the police arrested Slim, Pills, and a third man, Ricardo Richmond, at Building 5 on wholly unrelated drug charges. At that time, the police searched Slim's apartment and recovered a gun that later was determined to be the gun used in the shooting of the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The police showed photographs of Slim, Pills and Richmond to the victim, who remained hospitalized. The victim was able to identify Slim as the person with whom he was fighting at the time he was shot. The victim could not, however, identify the shooter from the photographs and maintained that the only other\n   persons in the area at the time of the incident were himself, Slim, and Slim's friends. The victim eventually died of complications from his gunshot wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Despite some leads, the police were unable to develop sufficient evidence to obtain an arrest warrant, and the matter eventually was classified as a cold case. On July 4, 2013, however, Williams, who the police had arrested and were booking on unrelated charges, informed the police that he had information about the 2007 shooting. He thereafter gave a videotaped statement to the police in which he identified the defendant as the person who shot the victim. In his statement, Williams also explained that Building 5 was part of the drug dealing territory controlled by the defendant and Slim. According to Williams, the defendant confronted and shot the victim because the victim had been selling fake drugs in Building 5, which adversely affected the defendant's\n   drug business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Williams' statement identifying the defendant as the shooter also corroborated other evidence that the police had collected implicating the defendant in the victim's murder. Specifically, the police had obtained a letter that the defendant had sent to a friend in prison. In the letter, the defendant admitted to having committed a \"redrum,\" which was street slang for murder, and he also indicated that Slim had been caught with the gun he used a few hours later. Additionally, a jailhouse informant, Anestos Moffat, who was incarcerated for a time with the defendant and Pills, told the police that\n   the defendant had confessed to him about shooting a \"Spanish kid\" who was \"getting the best of Slim ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 4, 2013, the defendant was arrested and charged with the victim's murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He pleaded not guilty and elected a jury trial. The defendant testified at trial on his own behalf and admitted to shooting the victim. The theory of the defense was that the defendant had shot the victim, not over a dispute about gang turf and drugs, but in defense of his friend, Slim, who was being repeatedly pistol-whipped by the victim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state's theory was that the confrontation with the victim centered on a dispute over the victim selling \"burn bags,\" i.e., fake drugs, in the defendant's territory and that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant's actions were not justified as a defense of others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury found the defendant guilty of murder. On May 2, 2016, the court sentenced him to fifty-five years of incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant claims on appeal that the trial court improperly violated his constitutional right to confrontation by admitting into evidence Williams' videotaped statement to the police. In particular, the defendant argues that because Williams refused to answer even a single question when he was called to testify before the jury, he was functionally unavailable for purposes of cross-examination and, therefore,\n   his statement was inadmissible under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559597\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/743/#p753\">\n    200 Conn. at 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2086\">\n    513 A.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and its admission violated his confrontation rights under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. at 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant further argues that the state could not demonstrate that the improper admission of the statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The state responds that the court properly admitted Williams' statement as a prior inconsistent statement in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   , and that Williams' refusal to give verbal responses to the questions asked at trial did not implicate the defendant's confrontation clause rights because the jury was able to observe and evaluate Williams' nonverbal reactions to the questions posed to him by the prosecutor and by defense counsel. We agree with the defendant that, despite Williams' physical presence on the witness stand, the defendant was not afforded a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine Williams about his prior statement due to Williams' outright refusal to answer questions, and, therefore, the admission of Williams' statement violated the defendant's right to confrontation. We also agree that the state has failed to demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On the afternoon of February 3, 2016, during the state's case-in-chief and outside the presence of the jury, the state informed the court,\n   <em>\n    Kahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , that it intended to call Williams as its next witness. The prosecutor informed the court that Williams likely\n   would be a \"difficult witness\" and that the court may want to permit the state first to question him outside the presence of the jury \"just to see where he stands ....\" The court asked the prosecutor if Williams had a \"fifth amendment issue ....\" The prosecutor indicated that because the case was nine years old, everything but the murder fell outside the statute of limitations and, thus, he did not believe that Williams intended to invoke the fifth amendment. Nevertheless, the prosecutor informed the court that the witness was represented by Attorney Don Cretella, who was present and could address that issue further. Cretella told the court that he had spoken with Williams in the courthouse lockup and that he did not anticipate him invoking his fifth amendment right not to incriminate himself. Cretella, however, informed the court that Williams had indicated that he was going to refuse to answer any questions, despite Cretella's advisement of the possible consequences of pursuing that course of action. After taking a brief recess to speak with all counsel in chambers, the court came back on the record and indicated that it intended to permit the state to question Williams outside the presence of the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Williams was sworn in, the court addressed him. The court first indicated its understanding that Williams did not intend to invoke his fifth amendment right not to testify. Williams answered that this was correct. The court then explained to Williams that, as a subpoenaed witness, he would be questioned under oath by the state following which defense counsel would have an opportunity to cross-examine him. Williams indicated that he understood the process. When the court asked if he intended to go forward with that process, Williams said: \"I'm not complying with nothing you're asking me, ma'am.\" The court responded: \"Well, I don't know what you mean by not complying, but the state is going to ask you some questions ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The prosecutor began by asking Williams his name, which did not elicit a\n   verbal response. The following colloquy ensued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The Court: Mr. Williams, are you going to answer the questions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"[Williams]: No. There's no question. I don't know nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"The Court: Well, that's different. If you don't know anything, that's different.

But it's your position not to answer any questions posed by either side?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[Williams]: No. As I told you before, I'm not answering no questions. I don't know nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: You can say that to each one of my questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"The Court: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: You can say that. If you don't know anything, you don't know anything to any of my questions. Did you meet with Detective [Heitor] Teixeira?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"[Williams]: (No verbal response.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Did you meet with the Bridgeport Police Department detectives on July 4th, 2013?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   \"[Williams]: (No verbal response.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Do you remember meeting with them?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[Cretella]: Your Honor, the offer of proof I think we can safely assume this is how each question will be answered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"The Court: So, Mr. Williams, I'm going to begin contempt proceedings. You can talk to your lawyer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   After making findings that the defendant had appeared pursuant to a valid subpoena, he did not have a valid fifth amendment claim, and he was refusing to answer any questions \"not just with I don't know anything but not even answering,\" the court gave the parties an opportunity to address the court regarding contempt. Both Williams and Cretella declined to make any statement. The prosecutor also made no statement with respect to the contempt proceedings but argued that because Williams had indicated to the court under oath during the state's proffer that he did not know anything about the shooting, which was in direct contradiction to his videotaped statement to the police, the state should be permitted to play the videotaped statement to the jury as a prior inconsistent statement. Defense counsel argued that Williams was not \"available\" to testify and, therefore, his prior statement was not admissible under\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The court found Williams in criminal contempt and imposed a sentence of six months of incarceration for his failure to answer questions. The court ordered Williams to return to court the next day, however, and, indicated that, if Williams decided to answer questions at that time, the court would consider vacating the contempt\n   conviction. The court reserved making a decision on whether Williams' videotaped prior statement would be admitted into evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The next day, in the presence of the jury, the state again called Williams to testify. The prosecutor asked Williams if he remembered being in court the day before and telling the judge that he knew \"nothing about nothing ....\" Williams provided no verbal response. The prosecutor then asked Williams if he remembered being interviewed by the police on July 4, 2013, and signing a statement identifying the person who shot the victim in the present case. Williams refused to respond and initially would not look at the copy of his written statement when it was handed to him by the prosecutor to verify his signature on the document. At the state's request, the court admonished Williams that he was in court under a subpoena and had a legal obligation to answer the questions posed to him. The state briefly resumed questioning Williams, who continued to give no verbal responses to the prosecutor's questions. The court then excused the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Once the jury left, the prosecutor renewed his request that the court allow the jury to hear Williams' videotaped statement. The prosecutor argued that the statement was admissible under\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   as a prior inconsistent statement on the basis of Williams' testimony to the court the day before that he knew nothing. Defense counsel responded that the availability of a witness is a prerequisite to the admission of any\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   statement and that Williams' refusal to answer any of the questions posed to him rendered him unavailable. Defense counsel clarified that he was not challenging whether the videotaped statement was inconsistent with the position Williams had staked out the day before, but that the admission of the prior statement\n   without any opportunity for meaningful cross-examination would seriously impede the defendant's right to confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court made an oral ruling admitting Williams' statement to the police, concluding that the statement met the\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   criteria. Specifically, the court found that the statement was reliably recorded by audio/videotape, the statement was duly authenticated, and Williams had personal knowledge of the events recounted in the statement. With respect to the defense's objection that the witness was functionally unavailable and never subject to cross-examination\n   with respect to his statement, the court first read into the record Williams' testimony proffered the day before, concluding: \"Clearly, his statements yesterday under oath are inconsistent with the interview he provided to the police back on July 4th, 2013, as well as what he signed on that date.

He raised his eyebrows at certain critical times, like when he was cross-examined\n   about not knowing the date of the shooting when the police asked him the date. He first didn't look at state's exhibits 9 and 14, then he looked at it, then he looked and looked away. He had gestures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"When questioned about whether he could see the first step let alone the landing, he looked down. When asked how long he was selling drugs in Building 5, he looked up at the ceiling.

When asked about whether he was a womanizer, he didn't audibly do it but he sort of chuckled in his nonverbal expression. When questioned whether he wanted the jury to believe that he didn't know where this girl lived that he was seeing, he sat straight up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"Again, he continued to make facial expressions, closing his eyes. He sighed when he was asked questions about Caroline [a woman at Greene Homes with whom, he told the police, he had been having sex] and that being the reason he went to Building 5, and saying that she was nice and straight. When asked about whether he indicated that [the victim] was the villain who went out of his way to raise trouble, he nodded and raised his eyebrows. Asked questions about whether he observed the victim go to the car to grab a gun and then start a conversation with Slim, he raised his eyebrows, sighed, and looked at defense counsel. And there were many instances where he did that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"When he was questioned about not knowing [the defendant's] name as Nirone Hutchinson, he frowned. When asked about his plea agreement and plea deal to\n   get cooperation for his testimony, he nodded and raised his eyebrows, and then when asked about whether he told the police he was smoking and what he was smoking, which was toward the end of the cross, he sighed again.

In some circumstances, an otherwise available witness might render themselves unavailable by his or\n   her actions on the witness stand. Although no appellate court in this state has squarely addressed whether a witness is \"available for cross-examination\" if he or she refuses outright to answer any questions after being sworn in to testify, courts in other jurisdictions that have considered this issue have concluded that such a witness is functionally unavailable and, therefore, the admission of a prior statement of that witness would violate the confrontation clause's guarantee of an opportunity to cross-examine. Although not binding on this court, we find these cases persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state has not cited, nor has our own research revealed, any post-\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   court decision expressly holding that a witness who takes the stand but then refuses to answer any questions despite having no valid right to refuse to answer the questions is available for cross-examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Barksdale\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241746\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/265/9/\">\n    265 Ga. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241746\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/265/9/\">\n    453 S.E.2d 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), the Georgia Supreme Court was presented with a situation quite similar to the one now before us. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Barksdale\n   </em>\n   was charged with murder and armed robbery. The state\n   called as a witness one of the defendant's accomplices, who already had pleaded guilty to armed robbery in exchange for the state's dropping the murder charge against him. The witness, who remained incarcerated, refused to testify at trial, believing that, by doing so, he would put his life in danger. After consulting with counsel, the trial court ruled that the witness did not have any valid fifth amendment privilege to assert, and the court ordered him to testify. The witness nevertheless continued to refuse to answer any questions. The prosecutor asked the court to hold him in contempt, but the trial court declined to do so immediately. The state also moved to admit a videotaped statement that the witness previously had provided to the police. The court postponed ruling on the request to permit counsel time to research the issue. The next day, the state recalled the witness. The prosecutor asked the witness if he still refused to answer questions in light of a possible criminal contempt conviction. He continued to refuse to testify and was excused. The state renewed its motion to admit the prior videotaped statement, arguing that it was admissible for substantive purposes as a prior inconsistent statement under Georgia's version of the\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant objected, arguing, inter alia, that the admission of the videotaped statement would violate his confrontation rights. The trial court nevertheless ruled that the videotaped statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent\n   statement. The state recalled the witness to the stand and played the videotaped statement to the jury. At the conclusion of the videotape, the court permitted the defense to attempt to cross-examine the witness. Defense counsel asked the witness if he intended to continue to refuse to answer questions. The witness answered in the affirmative, and defense counsel indicated that he had nothing further to ask.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In his appeal of the conviction, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Barksdale\n   </em>\n   claimed that the admission of the videotaped prior statement violated his right to confrontation because the witness was not subject to cross-examination regarding the prior statement. The Georgia Supreme Court unanimously agreed and reversed his conviction. In so doing, it distinguished for confrontation purposes the case before it, in which the witness refused to answer questions outright, from cases in which a witness had testified but asserted a lack of memory regarding a prior statement or the events at issue. In the latter line of cases, the court explained, the defendant had \"the opportunity to cross-examine a forgetful witness about such matters as his bias, his lack of care and [attentiveness] ... and even ... the very fact that he has a bad memory.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241746\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/265/9/\">\n    Id., at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241746\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/265/9/\">\n    453 S.E.2d 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Owens\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601912\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/554/#p561\">\n    484 U.S. at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"601912\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/484/554/#p561\">\n    108 S.Ct. 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Williams was called to the stand and put under oath before the jury, he outright refused to give any verbal responses to questions asked of him. Although both the prosecutor and the defense counsel were permitted to ask Williams a series of questions, merely posing questions is not the equivalent of cross-examination; the defendant is also entitled to answers, whatever they may be. If a witness does not provide even a single answer while on the witness stand, the defendant is completely deprived of any opportunity he might have to probe and expose infirmities in the witness' prior statement or even the reasons behind the witness' recalcitrance or lack of memory. Williams' outright refusal to respond to any questions rendered him unavailable for cross-examination, and because the defendant never had any other opportunity to cross-examine Williams about his statement to the police prior to trial, admission of that statement violated\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Our conclusion that Williams was unavailable for purposes of cross-examination is consistent with the Federal Rules of Evidence regarding criteria that render a\n   witness unavailable under the federal rules for purposes of admitting hearsay statements.

In each of those cases, the witness willingly provided some responses to the questions asked when called to testify. Although the witnesses in the cases cited by the trial court claimed or feigned memory loss regarding the information provided in the statement or of making the statement at all, they nevertheless responded verbally to questioning, providing some relevant information from which the jury, in combination with the witness' demeanor, could evaluate whether to believe the facts of the statement or the witness' trial testimony. In the present case, Williams did not respond in any way to any of the questions asked. He did not assert whether he had or had not made the statement at issue, whether he remembered the contents of the statement or the events contained therein. He simply failed to provide any testimony. Contrary to the position that the state now takes on appeal, at trial, the prosecutor seemed to understand that it was essential that Williams provide verbal responses to questions. When Williams stated, outside the presence of the jury, that he was not \"answering no questions,\" the prosecutor told him that he could say that in response to each question he was asked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The utter lack of a verbal response to any questions renders the present case wholly unlike the cases that the trial court relied on in admitting Williams' prior statement. The trial court, in rendering its ruling, indicated that the availability required under both\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Whelan\n   </em>\n   was satisfied simply from the witness' physical presence and the jury's ability to assess his\n   demeanor and body language \"\n   <em>\n    in responding to questions\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Williams, however, never responded to a single question asked of him before the jury, remaining silent throughout. In its analysis of whether Williams' refusal to answer questions rendered him functionally unavailable to testify, the trial court also\n   appeared to conflate that question with whether a prior statement could be considered inconsistent if a witness failed to respond to questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   It certainly is within the province of the jury in its role as fact finder to assess the credibility of a witness' answers to questions by assessing the witness' demeanor on the stand, which would include how a witness looks and acts while testifying. In the present case, the trial court stated on the record its own observations of Williams while he was on the stand, including, inter alia, that Williams had looked up at the ceiling, looked down, raised his eyebrows, closed his eyes, and \"sort of chuckled in his nonverbal expression.\" The court did not make any finding, however, that Williams intended any of his gestures or body language to convey a specific nonverbal response to a question that would amount to a yes or no. We agree with the defendant that the meaning of the court's observations of Williams,\n   <em>\n    which were completely unconnected to verbal responses to questions\n   </em>\n   , is ambiguous and far too speculative to be considered as the equivalent of testimony. In other words, body language and demeanor are only instructive in assessing the credibility of testimony actually given, and are not a substitute for verbal responses or nonverbal responses intended to convey a substantive response to a question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Our reasoning is consistent with observations made by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in upholding a District Court's ruling that it did not implicate confrontation rights for a witness to testify while wearing dark sunglasses. The Second Circuit noted: \"Even if we accept the idea,\n   <em>\n    grounded perhaps more on tradition than on empirical data\n   </em>\n   , that demeanor is a useful basis for assessing credibility, the jurors had an entirely unimpaired opportunity to assess the delivery of [the witness'] testimony, notice any evident nervousness, and observe her body language.\n   <em>\n    Most important\n   </em>\n   , they had a full opportunity to combine these fully observable aspects of demeanor\n   <em>\n    with their consideration of the substance of her testimony\n   </em>\n   , assessing her opportunity to observe, the consistency of her account, any hostile motive, and all the other traditional bases for evaluating testimony.\" (Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Artuz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391177\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/55/#p61\">\n    281 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 61-62 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Greiner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9209120,9209792,9209924,9209060,9209316,9209448,9209385,9209194,9209579,9209514,9209741,9209264,9209658,9209855\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/836/\">\n    537 U.S. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20S.%20Ct.%20152\">\n    123 S.Ct. 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=154%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2056\">\n    154 L.Ed.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In sum, because of Williams' refusal to provide any verbal responses to questions he was asked by both the prosecutor and defense counsel, and absent anything more than speculation as to the nonverbal mannerisms observed by the trial court, we conclude that the defendant was deprived of an opportunity to cross-examine Williams regarding his prior videotaped statement to the police.

Significantly, aspects of the defendant's account were corroborated by other evidence. The state's medical examiner testified that the victim was six feet, eight inches tall and weighed about 400 pounds. Detective Michael Fiumidinisi, who initially investigated the shooting, testified that Slim was six feet, two inches tall, from which the jury could infer that he was smaller than the victim. More importantly, Fiumidinisi testified,\n   without objection, about statements that the victim made to him at the hospital, many of which\n   corroborated the defendant's narrative of the events just prior to the shooting. For example, the victim stated to the detective that he had followed Slim when Slim tried to leave the lobby, that he was trying to intimidate Slim, and that he pulled him down the stairs and was engaged in a fistfight with Slim when he was shot from behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Williams' videotaped statement to the police was the only other evidence presented from an eyewitness of the shooting. The significance of his statement cannot be downplayed given that prior to that statement, there was insufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the defendant's arrest. Williams told the police that the defendant was part of the group that controlled drug sales in Building 5. Williams indicated that the defendant knew that the victim was selling fake drugs, which adversely affected the defendant's drug business. It can be reasonably inferred from Williams' statement that this knowledge motivated the defendant to confront and ultimately shoot the victim. If the jury believed Williams, this would have cast serious doubt on the veracity of the defendant's version of events, namely, that he and Williams were initially attacked by the victim and his friends, and that he had shot the victim only to prevent him from seriously injuring Slim, who had come to their aid. Without Williams' alternate version of events, which put the defendant's encounter with the victim into a different context, the only evidence before the jury would have been the account given by the defendant, which, as we have set forth, was corroborated by other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The state argues that the defendant's testimony was \"inconsistent and patently incredible.\" Moreover, the state contends that the defendant's claimed justification for using deadly force was \"internally inconsistent, contrary to common sense and arguably legally insufficient, even viewed in a light most favorable to him.\" According\n   to the state, even if the jury credited the defendant's version of events, the jury was \"unlikely to have found that the scenario he posited, whereby neither he nor any of his friends made any effort to assist Slim in stopping the victim by using nonlethal force, justified his actions.\" In short, the state takes the position that the defendant's defense of others claim was so \"fraught with problems that the jury could not have overlooked\" that any improper admission of Williams' statement was rendered harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Although we acknowledge that, as the state suggests, there were potential problems with the defendant's theory of defense and there is no\n   <em>\n    guarantee\n   </em>\n   that the jury would have found the defendant not guilty on that basis in the absence of the erroneous admission of Williams' statement, the state's arguments are insufficient to satisfy its demanding burden of demonstrating harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt. First, however technically weak the defendant's claim of defense of others might have been, it was sufficiently supported by both law and fact that the court agreed to give the jury an instruction on the defense of others. The state does not argue that the defendant was not entitled to the instruction. Second, and more importantly, the introduction of Williams' statement provided the jury with evidence of a clear and alternative motive on the part of the defendant to shoot the victim that, if credited, effectively obliterated any need for the jury to consider the defendant's justification defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Contrary to the position taken by the state, we conclude that it was reasonably likely that Williams' statement played a significant role in the jury's decision to\n   disregard the defendant's justification defense, and, therefore, the improper admission of Williams' statement and its effect on the jury cannot be viewed as harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The sixth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him ....\" U.S. Const., amend.

The court, in a scholarly and historical discussion of the issue, first noted that, pre-\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    , although a witness who asserted an inability to recall any significant information was deemed available for cross-examination under existing United State Supreme Court precedent, some courts nevertheless held that a witness who refused to answer any questions on the stand was not available for cross-examination for confrontation purposes. Id., at 466-67. The court in\n    <em>\n     Fowler\n    </em>\n    concluded that it was unnecessary to decide the confrontation issue post-\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    because it concluded that the defendant had forfeited any right to confrontation by making no effort to compel the witness' testimony. The court explained: \"A refusal to answer, even after a court order, arguably falls on the loss of memory side of the line. Unlike a privilege that, as in\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    , prevents the witness from taking the stand, the refusing witness, like the amnesiac, is before the jury. The basis for the refusal and the [witness'] demeanor can be taken into account in evaluating the prior statement just as the loss of memory can be evaluated by the trier of fact. On the other hand, a simple refusal to answer may be viewed as barring the defendant's access to meaningful cross-examination. We believe we need not resolve this issue because here [the defendant] did not seek an order compelling a response. ... [W]e think a request for an order directing the witness to respond is necessary to preserve a [c]onfrontation [c]lause objection to prior statements by the witness.\" Id., at 467.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    See\n    <em>\n     Gibbons\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1183698,1183828\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/248/858/\">\n     248 Ga. 858\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 862-64,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=286%20S.E.2d%20717\">\n     286 S.E.2d 717\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1982).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    We note that because\n    <em>\n     Barksdale\n    </em>\n    was decided prior to the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Crawford\n    </em>\n    , the court, in analyzing whether the defendant's right to confrontation was violated, applied the former trustworthiness standard set forth in\n    <em>\n     Ohio\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Roberts\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/#p66\">\n     448 U.S. 56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787607\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/56/#p66\">\n     100 S.Ct. 2531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
