De Almeida-Kennedy. On appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) denied in part his motion for modification, (2) granted in part the plaintiff's motion for clarification, in which she requested, inter alia, that the court address her prior motion for attorney's fees, and (3) granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and expenses pending appeal. We reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the defendant's second claim but affirm the judgment in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The marriage between the parties was dissolved on August 2, 2010. The judgment of dissolution\n   incorporated the parties' separation agreement, which provided, inter alia, that the defendant would pay the plaintiff $ 1000 per week in unallocated alimony and child support. On December 9, 2014, that judgment was modified by agreement of the parties to provide, inter alia, that the defendant would pay the plaintiff $ 900 per week in unallocated alimony and child support.\n   On December 28, 2015, the defendant filed the present motion for modification in which he requested, inter alia, that his unallocated alimony and child support obligation be modified.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 12, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion for attorney's fees, asking the court to order the defendant to pay her attorney's fees incurred defending the defendant's motion for modification. The court received evidence on both motions in a trial held over the course of several days beginning on July 24, 2017, and concluding on August 2, 2017. By order dated September 29, 2017, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion for modification. Relevant to this appeal, the court denied the defendant's request to modify his unallocated alimony and child support obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant filed the present appeal on October 27, 2017. On October 30, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion for clarification as to the trial court's September 29, 2017 ruling, requesting, inter alia, that the trial court\n   issue a ruling on her May 12, 2017 motion for attorney's fees. At the same time, the plaintiff also filed a motion for attorney's fees and expenses pending appeal. On November 16, 2017, the trial court held a hearing, which the defendant did not attend, on the plaintiff's motion for clarification and motion for attorney's fees and expenses pending appeal. On that same date, the court (1) granted in part the plaintiff's motion for clarification, ordering the defendant \"to pay the sum of $ 11,250 to plaintiff's counsel as a sanction for bringing a baseless motion,\" and (2) granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees and expenses pending appeal, ordering the defendant to pay \"an advance of $ 10,000 as a retainer to be applied with regard to the appeal from the court's order.\" Subsequently, the defendant filed two new appeals from the court's November 16, 2017 orders, which, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 61-9, we have treated as amendments to the defendant's original appeal. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant first claims that the court improperly denied in part his motion for modification by rejecting his request to modify his unallocated alimony and child support obligation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We begin by noting that \"[t]he well settled standard of review in domestic relations cases is that this court will not disturb trial court orders unless the trial court has abused its legal discretion or its findings have no reasonable basis in the facts.... As has often been explained, the foundation for this standard is that the trial court is in a clearly advantageous position to assess the personal factors significant to a domestic relations case.... In determining whether a trial court has abused its broad discretion in domestic relations matters, we allow every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action.... Notwithstanding\n   the great deference accorded the trial court in dissolution proceedings, a trial court's ruling ... may be reversed if, in the exercise of its discretion, the trial court applies the wrong standard of law.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gabriel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488806\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/1230/#p336\">\n    324 Conn. 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 336,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12488806\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/152/1230/#p336\">\n    152 A.3d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion by (1) ordering the unallocated alimony and child support amount of $ 900 to continue without making findings under the child support guidelines, (2) concluding that the defendant admitted there was no change in circumstances, and (3) concluding that there was insufficient evidence of a change of circumstances to justify modification. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant claims that the court abused its discretion by ordering that his current obligation to pay unallocated alimony and child support be continued without making findings under the child support guidelines. He claims that his request to modify his unallocated alimony and child support obligation automatically triggers the court's duty to make specific findings pursuant to the child support guidelines, even if he made no such request. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"[Section] 46b-86 governs the modification of [an unallocated alimony and] child support order after the date of a dissolution judgment....

See footnote 1 of this opinion. The court read the defendant's request as seeking a modification of his unallocated alimony and child support obligation on the basis of a change in legal or physical custody and, in closing argument, the defendant specifically stated that he was \"requesting financial modifications due to a substantial change in circumstance.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the defendant never raised before the trial court his claim that his unallocated alimony and child support obligation substantially deviated from the child support guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It\n   is well established that an appellate\n   court is under no obligation to consider a claim that is not distinctly raised at the trial level....

The requirement that [a] claim be raised distinctly means that it must be so stated as to bring to the attention of the court\n   <em>\n    the precise\n   </em>\n   matter on which its decision is being asked.... The reason for the rule is obvious: to permit a party to raise a claim on appeal that has not been raised at trial-after it is too late for the trial court ... to address the claim-would encourage trial by ambuscade, which is unfair to both the trial court and the opposing party.... It therefore follows that [a] party cannot present a case to the trial court on one theory and then seek appellate relief on a different one ....\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Corrarino\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Corrarino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186373\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/121/22/#p29\">\n    121 Conn.

The court, however, considered the defendant's request to modify his unallocated alimony and child support obligation on the basis of a substantial change in circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In the context of a trial court's consideration of a motion to modify, the guidelines become relevant only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   a change in circumstances has been shown, if that is the ground urged in support of modification ... or in determining whether the existing child support order substantially deviates from the guidelines, if that is the ground urged in support of modification.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Mullin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mullin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716292\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/28/632/#p635\">\n    28 Conn.

Accordingly, because the defendant did not raise as a basis for the court's review his claim that his unallocated alimony and child\n   support obligation substantially deviated from the child support guidelines, the court properly did not make findings under the child support guidelines when it determined that there was not sufficient evidence of a substantial change in circumstances to justify modification. Accordingly, the defendant's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his request to modify his unallocated alimony and child support obligation because its conclusion that he \"had admitted there was no change in circumstance\" was clearly erroneous.

A factual finding is clearly erroneous when it is\n   not supported by any evidence in the record or when there is evidence to support it, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made....

In his brief, the defendant mischaracterizes the court's statement by omitting the court's specific reference to the defendant's motion. On the basis of our review of the trial transcript, including, specifically, the defendant's statements during closing argument; see footnote 5 of this opinion; we conclude that the court's finding as to the state of the record before it was not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, the defendant's claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court abused its discretion in concluding that there was not sufficient evidence of a change in circumstances to justify modification.

Second, if the court finds a substantial change in circumstances, it may properly consider the motion and ... make an order for modification.... A party moving for a modification of a child support order must clearly and definitely establish the occurrence of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party that makes the continuation of the prior order unfair and improper.... The power of the trial court to modify the existing order does not, however, include the power to retry issues already decided ... or to allow the parties to use a motion to modify as an appeal.... Rather, [t]he court has the authority to issue a modification only if it conforms the order to the distinct and definite changes in the circumstances of the parties.... The inquiry, then, is limited to a comparison between the current conditions and the last court order....

See footnote 1 of this opinion. The court reasonably read the defendant's request to alter his unallocated alimony and child support obligation as seeking a modification on the basis of a change in legal or physical custody; see footnote 4 of this opinion; a change which did not occur. The defendant argues that he also \"articulated a request ... to modify based on a change in financial circumstance right through closing argument,\" which the plaintiff does not dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In support of his claim that the court improperly determined that he did not present sufficient evidence of a substantial change in circumstances based on a\n   change in \"financial circumstances,\" the defendant raises three arguments. First, the defendant contends that \"[t]he court erred in not taking [his increasing debt] into account in determining what evidence was sufficient in its mind to cross the threshold necessary to consider modifying the financial orders in this case.\" The defendant argues that \"[t]he second basis for crossing the evidentiary threshold is [the] plaintiff's veracity as evidenced by her admittedly fabricated financial affidavits.\" Third, the defendant broadly states that the financial affidavits he had filed with the court support his contention that \"his financial circumstances have changed and not just in terms of net income.\" He argues that \"[t]he court had to at least consider this in reaching a conclusion, but it did not, and that was an abuse of discretion and plain error.\" We find the defendant's arguments unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court found that the defendant did not meet his burden of showing sufficient evidence of a substantial change in circumstances. The record supports the court's conclusion. The defendant, who moved for the modification, had the burden of clearly and definitely establishing the occurrence of a substantial change in circumstances, here, the \"financial circumstances\" of either party. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's request to modify his unallocated alimony and child support obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The defendant next claims that the court improperly granted in part the plaintiff's motion for clarification because it abused its discretion in granting the plaintiff attorney's fees without making a specific finding of bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"We begin by setting forth the standard of review and legal principles relevant to this claim.

As a second basis for granting the plaintiff attorney's fees, the court stated at the hearing on the plaintiff's motion for clarification and motion for attorney's fees pending appeal: \"Under Article 17 of the decree it provides that in the event either party has breached any agreement, the offending party shall pay to the other the attorney's fees and court costs incurred in the enforcement of this provision.

Rather, the plaintiff at all times sought attorney's fees pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-62.
