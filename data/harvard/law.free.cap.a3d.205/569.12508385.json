The trial court acquiesced to this agreement, despite recognizing that it \"is probably against the public interest ....\" This appeal requires us to decide, under the circumstances of this case, whether the defendant, Kevan Simmons, is entitled to a new trial because of this concededly unlawful promise. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that this error was so egregious in nature that it undermines public confidence in the due administration of justice and that, pursuant to our supervisory powers, the defendant should be granted a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of two counts of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5), criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (1), and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). On appeal, the defendant claims, in his initial brief, that the prosecutor committed improprieties during closing argument that deprived him of his right to a fair trial, including, among other things, suggesting to the jury that it could consider as substantive evidence a prior statement of Harris that was admitted at trial only for impeachment purposes, in which he identified the defendant as his assailant. We later\n   granted the defendant permission to file a supplemental brief addressing an additional claim of prosecutorial impropriety, namely, whether the defendant's right to due process was violated by the state's failure to disclose to him, prior to trial, certain exculpatory evidence relevant to the veracity of the detective who took a statement from the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/#p87\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After oral argument before this court, and on the basis of our review of the record, we ordered the parties, sua sponte, to file additional supplemental briefs addressing an unpreserved claim of error not raised by the parties, namely, \"(1) whether the state's agreement not to prosecute George Harris for any future acts of perjury committed while testifying for the state at the defendant's trial constituted plain error because it violates the public policy of this state against immunizing perjured testimony; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Giraud\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"357916\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/258/631/#p634\">\n    258 Conn. 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634-35,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=783%20A.2d%201019\">\n    783 A.2d 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001) ; and (2) if so, whether such error was structural error or subject to harmless error analysis.\" Each party filed a supplemental brief. In its brief, the state conceded that its grant of immunity to Harris was improper. We later asked the parties to submit additional supplemental briefs addressing whether this court should exercise its supervisory authority to reverse the conviction. Because we exercise our supervisory powers to order a new trial for the defendant on the basis of the improper grant of immunity to Harris, we do not reach the merits of the remaining claims raised by the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. A shooting occurred on Bedford Street in Hartford on March 28, 2013, involving the defendant; Harris, his friend; and Joaquin Cedeno. Specifically, at approximately 9:22 p.m. that day, the defendant and Harris were walking through the Bedford mall, a term commonly used to describe a cluster of apartment buildings on either side of Bedford Street, when they encountered Cedeno standing on the front stoop of an apartment building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cedeno and the defendant began arguing. The argument quickly escalated into a physical fight. Harris tried to break up the fight but was unsuccessful. During the fight, the defendant pulled out a gun and pointed it at Cedeno. Cedeno attempted to push the gun away from himself, but the defendant fired several gunshots, hitting both Cedeno and Harris. Cedeno, Harris, and the defendant then all ran from the scene in different directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Officer Robert Fogg of the Hartford Police Department, who was working nearby, received a dispatch that gunshots had been fired at 137 Bedford Street. Fogg drove to the location. When he arrived, he found Harris, who had been shot in the leg, lying in an alleyway just south of 137 Bedford Street. Harris did not name his shooter and only told Fogg to relay a message to his mother that he loved her. Harris was taken to a hospital by ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At 9:36 p.m., Officer Bartosz Kubiak was dispatched to 378 Garden Street, a location close to the scene of\n   the shooting, after someone reported a serious assault with a firearm. When Kubiak arrived, Cedeno was sitting on the front steps of 378 Garden Street. Cedeno's pants, T-shirt, and sweatshirt were stained with blood, and it appeared to Kubiak that Cedeno had been shot several times on the right side of his body. Cedeno did not indicate to Kubiak who had shot him. Cedeno was also transported to a hospital. Kubiak searched the surrounding area for evidence relating to the shooting but did not find a weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately ten minutes after the shooting, the defendant returned to the scene of the shooting on Bedford Street. He approached Fogg, and the two began talking. Fogg knew that the defendant and Harris were friends, so Fogg relayed to the defendant the message Harris had asked Fogg to give to Harris' mother. Fogg also asked the defendant if he had seen anything with respect to the shooting, and the defendant replied that he had not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 30, 2013, two days after the shooting, Detective Christopher Reeder spoke to Harris at the hospital. Harris told Reeder that, on the night of the shooting, he was walking through Bedford mall with a person nicknamed \"Ghost\" when he heard gunshots and realized he had been shot. He described the shooter as a black male wearing black clothing. Reeder told Harris that the police had video that captured the incident. Harris then rolled over in his hospital bed, sighed, and said, \"You ain't even here; do what you gotta do.\" Harris also told Reeder that he might have\n   seen \"Boobie,\" the nickname of Cedeno, at the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That same day, Reeder also questioned Cedeno about the shooting. Cedeno described his shooter as a black male of average build, about five feet, eight inches tall, and between twenty and twenty-five years old. Cedeno also told Reeder that, on the night of the shooting, he\n   had been hanging out in Bedford mall when he was approached by the shooter. Cedeno recalled that the two got into an argument, during which the shooter took out a gun and fired it at Cedeno. Cedeno told Reeder that, after the gunfire broke out, he ran through an alleyway between 133 and 135 Bedford Street, and made it to Garden Street before he realized that he had been shot and collapsed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 19, 2013, Harris was arrested on drug charges. After reading Harris his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, Reeder began to question Harris about the shooting incident on Bedford Street. Harris relayed to Reeder a version of events similar to that which he had given when he was questioned about the shooting in the hospital. Reeder then showed Harris a video comprised of footage recovered from security cameras attached to various apartments on Bedford Street (video) that depicted the shooting. Harris once again pointed out \"Ghost\" in the video, but did not offer any additional details about the shooting or identify himself on the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While incarcerated on the drug charges, Harris made a phone call to his mother, during which he implicated the defendant as his shooter. That call was recorded by the correctional facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 2, 2013, the defendant was arrested on charges unrelated to the shooting of Harris and Cedeno. That day, Reeder, Detective Renee LaMark-Muir, and Detective Reginald Early interviewed the defendant. Reeder showed the defendant the video of the shooting. Afterward, Early presented the defendant with a statement that he represented to the defendant had been given to the police by Harris. Early, however, had fabricated the entire statement in order to encourage the\n   defendant to confess that he was the shooter on the belief that Harris had already inculpated him. In the fabricated statement, Harris purportedly told the police that Cedeno had attempted to rob him and the defendant at gunpoint, and that the defendant had shot Cedeno in self-defense. The fabricated statement further provided that the defendant also had shot Harris by accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After Early read the fabricated statement to the defendant, he became upset and began crying. Early then began questioning the defendant about the shooting, and the defendant gave a written statement in which he admitted that he had shot Cedeno and Harris. Specifically, the defendant stated that Cedeno had attempted to rob the defendant and Harris, and that the defendant was forced to shoot Cedeno in self-defense but hit Harris, too. The defendant also stated that he had found\n   the gun with which he shot Cedeno and Harris earlier that day near a dumpster and, after the shooting, ran and hid the gun before the police arrived. He stated that he returned to Bedford Street after shooting Cedeno and Harris to make sure that Harris was okay. Finally, the defendant admitted that he was the person depicted in the surveillance video speaking to Officer Fogg after the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 1, 2014, the state filed the operative substitute information, in which it charged the defendant with two counts of assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5), and one count each of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (1) and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35 (a). On October 8, 2014, the jury trial began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the first day of trial, the state called Harris as a witness during its case-in-chief. Harris' attorney was present and advised Harris to invoke his fifth and fourteenth amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Harris did so and refused to answer any questions by the state. A colloquy then ensued between the court, the state, and defense counsel regarding a potential grant of immunity for Harris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At that time, the state agreed not to prosecute Harris for any crimes stemming from his involvement in the March 28, 2013 shooting. His attorney rejected the state's offer of immunity as insufficient because if Harris were to testify he could expose himself to federal criminal liability with respect to the Bedford Street shooting incident and might implicate himself in an unrelated shooting in 2011 for which he had just recently been served a warrant. The state represented to the court that it would inquire as to whether it could obtain federal immunity for Harris with respect to his\n   testimony at the defendant's trial. The court then continued Harris' appearance until the next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On October 9, 2014, the state again called Harris as a witness. Before Harris testified, the court inquired as to whether the state and Harris had come to an agreement regarding the grant of immunity. Harris' counsel represented to the court that he believed an agreement had been reached. The following exchange then ensued between defense counsel, the court, and the prosecutor:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"[Harris' Counsel]: And so [the grant of immunity] includes transactional immunity to the events related to the-on the day of the shooting, directly and indirectly. It involves use immunity, so none of his words could be used directly against him in this or any other proceeding in state or federal court or anywhere else. It also includes derivative use so that his words can't be used to investigate and then come up with other evidence that can be used against him in any proceeding. There are\n   other issues that we have talked about that I think need to be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \"The Court: Go ahead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"[Harris' Counsel]:\n   <em>\n    One is that the immunity statute does not immunize a witness from committing perjury at the time\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The Court:\n   <em>\n    It does not\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \"[Harris' Counsel]: And my understanding is that there is a tape recording or the prosecuting authority believes that it has a tape recording of my client saying something related to his testimony. So, I have concerns about exposure to perjury, and my understanding is that there has been an agreement that there wouldn't be\n   <em>\n    any perjury prosecution related to my client's testimony today\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]:\n   <em>\n    That's correct\n   </em>\n   , Your Honor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"The Court: Okay. Well, [counsel], I must compliment you. I have been in the criminal justice system for forty-two and one-half years. I've never heard of anybody getting that agreement. But it's an agreement the state made. That's their decision. Now, are we ready to testify?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fully immunized, Harris was then administered the oath for testifying witnesses by the clerk in the presence of the jury. Although the oath taken by Harris was not transcribed, the required contents of the oath are set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 1-25, which provides that the oath administered to witnesses shall be: \"You solemnly swear or solemnly and sincerely affirm, as the case may be, that the evidence you shall give concerning this case shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth; so help you God or upon penalty of perjury.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Harris then testified that he had been on Bedford Street on the night in question, and had been shot in the leg and hospitalized. He indicated that he and the defendant had been friends for eight years, and that he also knew Cedeno, the other gunshot victim. The state asked Harris a series of additional questions about his recollections from the night he was shot, including who he was with that night, what he and others were wearing, and whether he knew the identity of the shooter. Harris testified that he could not recall any details of\n   the night he was shot because he had been intoxicated. He also testified that he was unable to identify anyone, including himself, from the videotape of the incident, which the state played for him in court, stopping it at various points to ask questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not name the defendant as his shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The state, however, attempted to impeach Harris' testimony that he did not know the identity of his shooter by questioning him about the May 6, 2013 telephone call he made to his mother while he was incarcerated, during which he identified the defendant as the person who shot him. After establishing that he had signed\n   a consent form when he was incarcerated acknowledging that his telephone calls would be recorded, the state asked Harris if he had talked to his mother about this case. In particular, the prosecutor asked him if he had told his mother that he was not going to cooperate with the police because he believed that he could only receive a thirty day sentence for refusing to testify, the defendant was in a holding cell nearby, and the police had shown him a videotape of \"this nigga shooting at me and this dude.\" He repeatedly responded that he could not remember what he had told his mother, including whether he had told her that he could identify both himself and the defendant in the surveillance videotape he was shown by the police. At this point, the jury was excused so that the state could play the recording of the telephone call for the witness in an attempt to refresh his recollection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Outside the presence of the jury, the following colloquy between the court and the prosecutor about the immunity agreement ensued during a discussion of the admissibility of the call from Harris to his mother:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: The state will be offering [the recording of the telephone call] as a prior inconsistent statement by Mr. Harris. Now, if Mr. Harris-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \"The Court: Well, are you sure that he does not have early onset dementia ? Because for a young man, his memory's shot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: Well, this is the way you could refresh his memory, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The Court:\n   <em>\n    Well, you're the one who agreed not to prosecute him for perjury\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: I agree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The Court:\n   <em>\n    Which is probably against the public interest\n   </em>\n   , but I didn't step in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: There's a lot of issue with public interest in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"The Court: I must say\n   <em>\n    this amount of perjury\n   </em>\n   actually offends me.\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Harris was then questioned before the jury about what he had said to his mother during the prison phone call. After Harris denied having told his mother that he could identify himself and the defendant in the videotape he had been shown by the police and that he could not remember making such a statement, portions of the audiotaped recording of the phone call were played to the jury without objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   After the state had completed its direct examination of Harris, the court gave the jury the following instruction: \"Ladies and gentlemen, just as I gave you the instruction a few minutes ago on prior misconduct by a witness, evidence has been presented through this witness that statements made outside the court are inconsistent with some of his trial testimony. You should consider that out-of-court evidence only as it\n   relates to his credibility. It's not substantive evidence. In other words, you consider it evidence as you would any other evidence inconsistent with his conduct in determining the weight to give to his testimony in court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Despite the court's instruction that the phone call between Harris and his mother could not be used for substantive purposes, the prosecutor, during closing argument, drew the jury's attention to specific portions of that phone call, arguing as follows: \"One point\n   <em>\n    in his testimony\n   </em>\n   that he's talking to his mom: First, I think I am being charged with everything [the defendant] is. Cop told me the warrant is for not cooperating, and I'm like, yeah, I'll take that. Makes sense. If you woulda seen the video they showed me, I coulda got charged with the same thing he got charged with. They showed me the video. When they first\n   showed me the video, I'm telling them: I don't know who that is. That's why they saying I won't cooperate. I'm like, that's me. That's Boobie. I don't know who that is. He like, who's that? That's Ghost. That's Ghost. They showed everything. When I sat down, when I couldn't move, they showed [the defendant] walked up to me. Then they showed him run off. Then they show this girl run out, tie my leg up. They showed the whole thing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"They smacked him with the charges right there. He testified that they're arrested at the same time, that they were at [the] Hartford lockup at the police department, and they were placed in cells next to each other. They smacked him with the charges right there. They had us together. They really put us together and this 'n' shot me. They just got us together. They don't care. And then he laughs. I'm in a holding cell. I don't know how he seen me. I'm asleep. He seen me. They put him in a cell like two cells down. It's like, one, two in the morning. All I hear is: George. George. Come on, man. I know you hear me. I know you hear me. I just seen\n   you. I just seen you. I'm like, this 'n' really trying to talk to me? I'm in jail 'cause of him right now 'cause he shot me in the leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"\n   <em>\n    That's testimony, ladies and gentlemen.\n   </em>\n   That's not given to police or the state's attorney's office. Now, I'm going to-now, that's another factor, as I said. [The defendant]-\n   <em>\n    Mr. Harris places him at the scene as the shooter.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Thus, the state attempted to make substantive use of Harris' recorded phone call to his mother despite the fact that the court had admitted it only for impeachment purposes and not for the truth of any of Harris' statements made during the phone call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On October 14, 2014, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts of the operative substitute information. On January 6, 2015, the court sentenced the defendant to twenty-three years of incarceration followed by ten years of special parole. This appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The defendant claims that the state's agreement not to prosecute Harris for any act of perjury he committed while testifying for the state during the defendant's trial constituted plain error because it clearly violated a public policy against immunizing perjured testimony. This improper grant of immunity, the defendant contends, constitutes structural error that obviates the need to engage in harmless error analysis and warrants a new trial. In the alternative, the defendant argues that, if harmless error analysis applies, the state has failed to meet its burden to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, the defendant argues that we should exercise our supervisory authority over the administration of justice to reverse his conviction and order a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The state contends that, although there was error, that error was not structural in nature and did not cause the defendant manifest injustice. Additionally, the state argues that this court should not exercise its supervisory powers over the administration of justice to reverse the conviction and order a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Although we ultimately decide to reverse the defendant's conviction and order a new trial pursuant to our supervisory authority, it is, in our view, helpful to discuss the question of structural error and harm to explain why we choose to resolve the case by resort to our supervisory powers rather than by employing the structural error doctrine or through an evaluation of harm to the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rose\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20594\">\n    305 Conn. 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606-607,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%20146\">\n    46 A.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We begin with a discussion of the plain error doctrine. It is axiomatic that an unpreserved claim of error, i.e., one that was neither distinctly raised before nor decided by the trial court, may be considered pursuant to the plain error doctrine. \"[The plain error] doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment, for reasons of policy.... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and\n   public confidence in the judicial proceedings.... Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"An appellate court addressing a claim of plain error first must determine if the error is indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily discernable on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable.... This determination clearly requires a review of the plain error claim presented in light of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Although a complete record and an obvious error are prerequisites for plain error review, they are not, of themselves, sufficient for its application....

The state promised immunity to overcome Harris' invocation of his fifth and fourteenth amendment privilege against self-incrimination and to force him to testify.

In the present case, the transcript\n   of the proceedings indicates that Harris was sworn in by the clerk in the presence\n   of the jury. Without any knowledge of the improper immunity agreement, the jury presumably believed that Harris was testifying under the sanction of the oath that he took \"upon the penalty of perjury.\" General Statutes \u00a7 1-25. Unbeknownst to the jury, however, his oath had no significance because Harris knew that the immunity agreement meant he was free to lie without subjecting himself to legal jeopardy. In other words, a fraud was perpetrated on the jurors by permitting Harris to swear to a meaningless oath that gave his testimony an indicium of reliability that was not in fact present. In sum, the improper grant of immunity violates public policy and undermines the perception of and confidence in our system of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Having explained why the grant of immunity in this case violates public policy, we next turn to the question of whether this impropriety constitutes structural error that obviates the need to engage in harmless error analysis to determine whether the defendant suffered a manifest injustice. The state contends that the improper grant of immunity does not constitute a structural error that would excuse the defendant from establishing that it caused a manifest injustice to him because the harm suffered by the defendant, if any, is not \"unquantifiable or indeterminate\" and was not of \"such pervasiveness or magnitude\" to rise to the level of structural error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This question appears to be a matter of first impression, as our research has not revealed any reported cases addressing it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States Supreme Court recently set forth a comprehensive discussion of the structural error doctrine: \"The purpose of the structural\n   error doctrine is to ensure insistence on certain basic, constitutional guarantees that should define the framework of any criminal trial. Thus, the defining feature of a structural error is that it affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than being simply an error in the trial process itself.... For the same reason, a structural error def[ies] analysis by harmless error standards....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"The precise reason why a particular error is not amenable to that kind of analysis-and thus the precise reason why the Court has deemed it structural-varies in a significant way from error to error. There appear to be at least three broad rationales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \"First, an error has been deemed structural in some instances if the right at issue is not designed to protect the defendant from erroneous conviction but instead protects some other interest. This is true of the defendant's right to conduct his own defense, which, when exercised, usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavorable to the defendant.... That right is based on the fundamental legal principle that a defendant must be allowed to make his own choices about the proper way to protect his own liberty.... Because harm is irrelevant to the basis underlying the right, the Court has deemed a violation of that right structural error....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \"Second, an error has been deemed structural if the effects of the error are simply too hard to measure. For example, when a defendant is denied the right to\n   select his or her own attorney, the precise effect of the violation cannot be ascertained.... Because the government will, as a result, find it almost impossible to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt ... the efficiency costs of letting the government try to make the showing are unjustified.\n   \"Third, an error has been deemed structural if the error always results in fundamental unfairness. For example, if an indigent defendant is denied an attorney or if the judge fails to give a reasonable-doubt instruction, the resulting trial is always a fundamentally unfair one.

Permitting the testimony at a criminal trial of even a single witness who does not face the sanction of a prosecution for perjury undermines the truth seeking purpose of a trial. On the other hand, the error in this case, while egregious in nature, was related directly to a single witness who testified during a distinct portion of the trial and did not necessarily affect the entire proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The error here does not fall within the first general category of structural errors because it does not implicate a right, similar to the defendant's right to conduct his own defense, that is separate and distinct from legal protections that are designed to protect against erroneous convictions. Moreover, the second category of structural error, i.e., those errors the effect of which are simply too difficult to measure, is not applicable because there may be instances in which the effect of the improper grant of immunity on the verdict is measurable and quantifiable. For purposes of illustration, imagine a case in which twenty-five witnesses identify the defendant as the perpetrator but one of the witnesses testifies after having been given immunity from a perjury prosecution for his testimony. In such a scenario, a reviewing court could reasonably conclude that, in light of the testimony of the twenty-four other witnesses, the testimony of the one\n   improperly immunized witness was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and did not cause the defendant to suffer a manifest injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Indeed, we are aware that, at first blush, the unlawful immunity agreement in the present case appears analogous to instances in which a witness testifies at trial without properly having been sworn in through the administration of an oath. Under existing federal jurisprudence, testimony by an unsworn witness is not considered structural error and, in fact, courts have deemed such claims of error forfeited if not raised before the\n   trial court. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20Fed.%20Appx.%20647\">\n    611 Fed.

Although the two errors are similar because both involve testimony given by a witness unencumbered by the legal sanction of an oath, the situation in the present case involves a far more insidious error, warranting a different analysis. The failure to swear in a witness arising in these federal cases presumably is the product of inadvertence. Furthermore, the error typically occurs in the presence of the jury, which may be aware that the oath was not given and can evaluate the unsworn testimony accordingly. In the present case, by contrast, the jury was deceived into believing that Harris was testifying under the penalty of perjury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The error in this case is more akin to those arising in the third category of structural errors, i.e., those errors, such as the failure to give a reasonable doubt instruction, that always result in fundamental unfairness to a defendant. The defendant's sixth and fourteenth amendment right to confront the witnesses against him is vitiated in circumstances in which a witness does not testify under the penalty of perjury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the United States Supreme Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p845\">\n    497 U.S. at 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p845\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"[t]he central concern of the [c]onfrontation [c]lause is to ensure the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of adversary proceeding before the trier of fact....

In doing so, the Supreme Court eschewed the need to determine whether the trial court's actions constituted structural error or whether the defendant was prejudiced under the circumstances of the case. Similarly, for the reasons we will discuss in this opinion, we conclude that the error in the present case warrants an exercise of our supervisory authority over the due administration of justice, making it unnecessary to decide whether the error is structural in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The question of whether the defendant suffered a manifest injustice as a result of the state's improper promise of immunity to Harris is equally as thorny as the question of structural error. Although the state readily concedes that the immunity agreement was improper, it contends that the defendant is not entitled to relief under the plain error doctrine because the defendant cannot establish that he was harmed by the agreement in light of the fact that Harris' testimony did not inculpate the defendant. Specifically, the state argues that Harris' testimony did not harm the defendant because \"Harris did not testify that the defendant shot him or Cedeno,\" but instead \"testified that he did not know who shot him because he had been intoxicated during the events and so did not remember them.\" Thus, in the state's view, the error did not cause grievous consequences to the defendant resulting in manifest injustice to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We first note that the state and the defendant disagree about which party bears the burden of persuasion with respect to the question of harm.

The defendant asserts that the unlawful immunity agreement violated his constitutional rights and thus the state bears the burden of establishing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. According to the defendant, he is entitled to a new trial \" 'if there is any likelihood' \" that Harris' testimony could have affected the verdict. In support of this contention, the defendant relies on cases in which reviewing courts have imposed this high burden on the state because of a prosecutor's knowing use of perjured testimony in obtaining the conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20359\">\n    309 Conn. 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371-73,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20A.3d%20512\">\n    71 A.3d 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n   In addition to the difficulty of deciding which party bears the burden of persuasion on the question of harm; see footnote 13 of this opinion; we note that the issue of whether the defendant was in fact harmed by Harris' testimony is also a difficult one. Because Harris did not identify the defendant as the shooter at trial, his testimony, even if perjurious, should not have been used by the jury as evidence that the defendant was the shooter. It is well established that disbelief of a witness is not the equivalent of proof.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alfonso\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689205\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/195/624/#p634\">\n    195 Conn. 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 634,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=490%20A.2d%2075\">\n    490 A.2d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (\"[w]hile it is true that it is within the province of the jury to accept or reject a [witness'] testimony, a jury in rejecting such testimony cannot conclude that the opposite is true\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Thus, even if the jury found incredible Harris' testimony that he did not know who shot him, a conclusion that Harris was lying is not substantive evidence that the defendant was the shooter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   On the other hand, if the state had been unsuccessful in forcing Harris to take the\n   witness stand, it would never have had the opportunity to impeach him with his prior inconsistent statement to his mother, in which\n   he identified the defendant as the shooter. Although this statement was admitted by the court only to assess the credibility of his testimony at trial that he did not know the identity of the shooter, the state, during closing argument, argued to the jury that it should treat his statement to his mother as substantive evidence that the defendant was the shooter. In other words, the state's improper promise of immunity served as the mechanism to force Harris to testify, which ultimately presented the state an opportunity to place before the jury, albeit improperly, Harris' statement that the defendant was the shooter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We do not know the state's precise motive in promising Harris such broad and unlawful immunity. It is conceivable that the state believed that if it could force Harris to testify, he simply would \"change his tune\" and identify the defendant as the person who shot him and Cedeno. It is also possible that the state was determined to force Harris to take the witness stand in the belief that he would testify, consistently with his prior statement to the police, that he could not identify the shooter or that he could not remember who shot him. This testimony would then permit the state to impeach Harris with his prior inconsistent statement to his mother that the defendant had shot him. Finally, the state simply may have wanted to call Harris to paint him as an obstructionist (as the state argued in closing argument) so that the jury (1) would not be left to speculate as to why the state had failed to call him-an obvious eyewitness to, and victim of, the shooting-at trial, or (2) would not infer that, as a missing witness, his testimony would have been unfavorable to the state. Regardless of the state's motive, however, forcing Harris onto the witness stand was important enough to the state's case against the defendant that the state made\n   considerable efforts to immunize Harris in exchange for his testimony, which it presumably deemed \"necessary to the public interest ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 54-47a. It is incongruous for the state now to minimize the import of Harris' testimony in order to argue that the defendant was not harmed by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Again, as with the question of structural error, we find it unnecessary to resolve the difficult and close question of prejudice because we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our supervisory powers over the administration of justice and to remand the case for a new trial.

The court stated: \"Because we decide this case on the basis of our supervisory authority, we need not resolve the issue of whether a trial court's constitutionally erroneous decision to compel a defendant to stand trial before a jury in identifiable prison clothing is susceptible to harmless error analysis, as the state claims, or instead amounts to structural error, as the defendant contends and as the Appellate Court apparently concluded.\" Id., at 606,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20A.3d%201176\">\n    4 A.3d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similar to the present case, the court chose to use its supervisory authority to order a new trial while avoiding the need to determine whether the error that occurred resulted in harm to the particular defendant. \"Supervisory powers are exercised to direct trial courts to adopt judicial procedures that will address matters that are of utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also\n   <em>\n    for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)

First, the improper immunity agreement directly implicates the perception of the integrity of our justice system. The improper immunity agreement, which plainly violates our public policy, gave Harris a license to commit perjury. Historically, perjury has been characterized as a crime\n   <em>\n    against the due administration of justice\n   </em>\n   . In fact, \u00a7 53a-156 (a), which criminalizes perjury, is codified at part XI of chapter 952 in our Penal Code, which is titled: \"Bribery, Offenses Against the Administration of Justice and Other Related Offenses.\" As one legal scholar has written: \"In time perjury developed into a [crime] ... including everything which has a tendency to injuriously affect the administration of justice by the introduction of falsehood and fraud.... [T]he gist of the offense is the abuse of public justice, and\n   <em>\n    not the injury to an individual.\n   </em>\n   It does not matter whether the false oath was believed or disbelieved, or\n   <em>\n    whether it caused any injury to the person against whom it was given\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added; footnotes omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) H. Silving, \" The Oath: I,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Yale%20L.J.%201329\">\n    68 Yale L.J. 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1388 (1959).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Second, as discussed previously, the existence of the sanction for perjury plays a critical role in the truth\n   seeking process and helps to secure the defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him.\n   <em>\n    Maryland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p845\">\n    497 U.S. at 845-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6220020\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/836/#p845\">\n    110 S.Ct. 3157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Cologne\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westfarms Associates\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695295\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/141/#p153\">\n    197 Conn. at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=496%20A.2d%20476\">\n    496 A.2d 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is difficult to imagine an error that strikes more directly at the truth seeking process that is at the core of our judicial system than an agreement, implicitly endorsed by the court, that permits a witness to testify with a license to lie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Third, the reversal of the conviction will help to ensure that such an unlawful promise will not be made by prosecutors in the future. In this case, there can be no doubt that the prosecutor knew that such an immunity agreement was prohibited by \u00a7 54-47a because the statute is cited in the immunity agreement that was formally filed with the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   That knowledge, by itself, was insufficient to deter the state from promising Harris a form of immunity plainly prohibited by the statute. The decision to offer such an unlawful promise was not made in the heat of battle, like a brief\n   improper remark during closing argument, but was reached as part of an extensive\n   negotiation between the state and Harris' attorney that occurred over parts of at least two days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Fourth, the exercise of our supervisory authority is also necessary to send a clear message to our trial courts that they have an affirmative obligation to intercede in circumstances where it appears that the state has offered a witness a license to lie during the trial. Indeed, the trial court here realized that the agreement violated public policy and believed that the witness was committing perjury but did nothing to prevent it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, it is important to remember that the ability to grant immunity to a witness is a power that belongs only to the state and is not shared by the defendant. The defendant cannot compel witnesses who have concerns about exposing themselves to criminal liability to testify, even if the defendant believes that their testimony may be exculpatory to him. Thus, it is important that courts confine the state's use of this significant prosecutorial power to appropriate instances that do not further and unfairly disadvantage a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The state objects to this court exercising its supervisory authority to reverse the defendant's conviction for several reasons. The state contends that it is \"unclear\" whether the Appellate Court even has the authority to exercise supervisory powers over the administration of justice. The state also argues that this court should not exercise this power sua sponte because the defendant, in essence, through his inaction, waived any challenge to the improper immunity agreement. Finally, the state asserts that the balancing of all of the interests in this case militates against the use of our supervisory powers. We disagree with each of these assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   First, this court disagrees with the state that the Appellate Court lacks supervisory power over the\n   administration of justice. Our Supreme Court, in referring to the supervisory power over the administration of justice, has repeatedly stated that \"[a]ppellate courts\" possess that power, not just our Supreme Court itself. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Elson\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20726\">\n    311 Conn. at 768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20A.3d%20862\">\n    91 A.3d 862\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lockhart\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343903\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/537/#p576\">\n    298 Conn. at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=4%20A.3d%201176\">\n    4 A.3d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Castillo\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court was never asked to address the existence or scope of the Appellate Court's supervisory authority, and any language employed by the court in a footnote explaining why it had reformulated the\n   third certified question in that case is simply taken out of context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497360\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/672/\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 335 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12497360\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/186/672/\">\n    186 A.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   Second, we are not persuaded by the state's assertion that it is improper to exercise our supervisory powers sua sponte because the defendant waived any challenge to the illegal immunity agreement by remaining silent during the colloquy among the court, the state, and Harris' attorney. Although the trial judge remarked during this initial colloquy that in his forty-two and one-half years of experience in the criminal justice system, he had \"never heard of anybody getting that agreement,\" the defendant simply failed to object to Harris' testimony. We are not convinced, however, that the defendant's failure to challenge the propriety of the immunity agreement was due to a conscious trial strategy that amounts to a tactical waiver. Nothing in the record before us supports such a conclusion. Although, as indicated, defense counsel was present for the discussions about Harris' immunity agreement with the state, and voiced no objection to the agreement despite the court's skeptical response, we would have to resort to impermissible speculation to determine that defense counsel's inaction was the result of tactical calculation rather than inadvertence. Indeed, the defendant had no way to know with certainty that Harris' testimony would be favorable to him. Although the defendant may have hoped that Harris would not implicate him in the shooting and would disavow or explain away the recorded statement to his mother, it was also possible that, with the broad grant of immunity, Harris might feel free to implicate the defendant as the shooter. Furthermore, although the defendant cross-examined Harris about his inability to identify anyone on the surveillance videotape and relied to some degree on Harris' testimony during his closing argument, defense counsel did not go to such lengths to exploit Harris' testimony as to suggest a tactical waiver.\n   The state, moreover, seems to confound the issue of implied waiver with a mere failure to object. Ordinarily, some affirmative action on the part of a defendant is needed before an appellate court will conclude that a defendant waived his right to seek appellate review. For example, by voluntarily and knowingly entering a guilty plea, a defendant waives his right to raise any nonjurisdictional claims of error. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Savage\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5766586\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/122/800/#p802\">\n    122 Conn.

The court did not ask the defendant for input as to the propriety of the agreement, and the defendant took no affirmative position on the agreement that could be construed as an express or implied waiver of his right to challenge it. Except in the limited circumstances of challenges to jury instructions; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p469\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469-70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) ; we have not treated a defendant's inaction or failure to object to constitute an implied waiver that precludes the opportunity for appellate review. Indeed, even in that context, the Supreme Court has indicated that a defendant still may be entitled to relief\n   on an unpreserved claim of instructional error pursuant to the plain error doctrine.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/#p808\">\n    324 Conn. 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/#p808\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, we reject the state's contention that the defendant's inaction at trial regarding the unlawful immunity agreement prevents us from exercising our supervisory power to remedy such an egregious error on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, we are mindful, of course, as the state notes, that \"our supervisory authority is not a form of free-floating justice, untethered to legal principle.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Pouncey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72577\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/802/#p813\">\n    241 Conn. 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%20901\">\n    699 A.2d 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). Our Supreme Court has cautioned that, before we exercise our supervisory powers to reverse a criminal conviction, we must consider and balance all interests involved, including \"the\n   extent of prejudice to the defendant; the emotional trauma to the victims or others likely to result from reliving their experiences at a new trial; the practical problems of memory loss and unavailability of witnesses after much time has elapsed; and the availability of other sanctions for such misconduct.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%20901\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Having considered these and other factors raised by the state, we are unconvinced that, on balance, they require us not to exercise our supervisory authority under the present circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   First, as we already discussed in detail in part III of this opinion, there is a strong argument that the defendant was unfairly prejudiced by the illegal grant of immunity to Harris. The state's improper immunization of Harris served as the mechanism to force Harris to testify, which allowed the state to introduce to the jury Harris' prior statement identifying the defendant as the shooter. The impact on the defendant was then compounded by the state's improper use of the statement as substantive evidence during closing arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, the potential that a new trial would result in significant \"emotional trauma to the victims,\" as claimed by the state, seems unlikely. Certainly, both Harris and Cedeno suffered serious injuries in this case. Retrial of this case, however, will not involve the viewing of graphic and disturbing crime scene or autopsy photographs as one might expect in a more serious homicide case. Nor will a retrial require anyone to describe details of a highly personal nature, as in cases involving a sexual assault. It also does not involve a particularly sensitive victim such as a child. Further, Harris and Cedeno's claimed lack of memory of the events and their purported reluctance to aid authorities in bringing their assailant to justice undermines any assertion that a retrial would result in any grave emotional retraumatization to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Third, although practical problems like memory loss and the unavailability of witnesses can arise any time there is a new trial, such risks are not of particular concern in the present case. The assaults at issue occurred in 2013, not in the distant past. This case does not turn on the testimony of eyewitnesses whose memories are likely to have faded with the passage of time. Neither Cedeno nor Harris was able to provide useful details as to the night they were shot. Harris, in fact, claimed that he was unable to remember any of the events of that night due to intoxication. Such an utter lack of recollection is not likely to worsen over time. Additionally, although it certainly is possible that a witness might be unavailable for a retrial, there is nothing in the record to suggest that any witness has died or left the jurisdiction of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Finally, as we have discussed in part I of this opinion, the state's impropriety in immunizing Harris for future perjury, which\n   the trial court expressly recognized but failed to prevent, violated public policy and undermines confidence in our judicial system. Although we recognize that reversal of a conviction is a remedy that should be invoked sparingly, we do not believe another viable solution exists here. The state has not made us aware of the availability of any other sanction, short of reversal, that will ensure that the egregious error that occurred in this case will not be repeated in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In this opinion SHELDON, J., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   BEAR, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The defendant, Kevan Simmons, appeals from the judgment of conviction, rendered following a jury trial, of two counts of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (5), and\n   one count each of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (1) and carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35 (a). On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the prosecutor violated his constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial by committing improprieties during closing argument; (2) his due process rights were violated when the state failed to disclose a police internal affairs report detailing the misconduct of a police detective who was a primary witness for the state; and (3) the state improperly entered into an agreement to immunize testimony from George Harris, a victim of the shooting and a key witness, including any lies and falsehoods that would constitute the crime of perjury, and that agreement constituted plain error that was either structural error or otherwise not subject to a harmless error analysis; and (4) the improper agreement to immunize Harris' testimony, which the state anticipated would include Harris' perjury in denying knowledge, inter alia, about who shot him, warrants the exercise of this court's supervisory authority to reverse the defendant's conviction and award him a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   I agree with the majority that the state's illegal and improper agreement with Harris to immunize all of his anticipated testimony, including any testimony that the state anticipated would constitute the crime of perjury,\n   and the trial court's knowing acceptance and implementation of that illegal and improper agreement, warrants a reversal of the defendant's conviction and a remand of this case for a new trial. I write separately, however, because I do not agree that the majority's invocation of this court's supervisory authority in its thorough, thoughtful, and well written opinion is necessary in this case. I would, instead, reverse the defendant's conviction on the ground that the trial court's acceptance and implementation of the agreement for the illegal and improper immunization of Harris' anticipated\n   testimony, including any testimony that would constitute the crime of perjury, constituted plain error that was structural error in the context of the defendant's criminal trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Before addressing the defendant's claim of plain error, I discuss the other claims raised by the defendant in support of his argument that the conviction should be reversed to determine whether reversal is warranted on a basis separate from plain error review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   I accept the facts as set forth in the majority opinion. Additional facts are set forth as relevant to the claims that are addressed in this concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   PROSECUTORIAL IMPROPRIETY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The defendant first claims that the prosecutor violated his rights to due process and a fair trial when he committed several improprieties during closing argument. Specifically, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly (1) denigrated defense counsel; (2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   asked the jury to use impeachment evidence substantively; (3) expressed his opinion about the credibility of two witnesses; (4) appealed to the jurors' emotions; and (5) injected extraneous matters into the trial.

The prosecutor's comments were directed to defense counsel's attempts during trial to attack the credibility of the Hartford police, particularly, Detective Early's testimony regarding the manner in which he secured the defendant's confession. The defendant's apparent theory was that, because Early had secured the defendant's confession by using a fabricated confession from Harris, he must not have been truthful in the remainder of his testimony.

Subsequently, during the prosecutor's initial closing argument, the prosecutor referenced the tape-recorded conversation, which had not been admitted as a full exhibit for all purposes, and then repeated to the jury what Harris had said to his mother during the phone call for the truth of the statements.

The prosecutor's comments that Harris and Cedeno were obstructionists, therefore, were not based solely on the prosecutor's personal opinion, but on the plausible motives that they may have had to protect themselves and the defendant.

As previously set forth in part I C of this concurring opinion, the prosecutor's comments referring to Harris and Cedeno as obstructionists were not improper because they were appropriately based on evidence adduced during trial. Moreover, the prosecutor's comments referencing the community were not directed at urging the jury to find the defendant guilty because of the location of the incident, but rather, urged the jury to remember that all communities have a general right to be free from the violence that occurred in this case.

Furthermore, the prosecutor had properly impeached Harris' credibility by presenting his prior inconsistent statements through the tape-recorded phone conversation he had engaged in with his mother. Thus, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Harris was untruthful when he responded to the question about whether the defendant was at the scene of the shooting when it occurred, but, of course, the jury could not have concluded solely from those prior inconsistent statements that the facts supporting them were true.

Specifically, the defendant claims that the state deprived him of the right to cross-examine Early in regard to a Hartford Police Department internal affairs report detailing his misconduct, which was totally unrelated to the criminal incident involving the defendant and Harris, stemming from an encounter with a towing company. The state argues that\n   the report was neither favorable nor material because it was not probative of Early's untruthfulness, and it was not reasonably probable that use of the report would have changed the result of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The following additional facts are relevant to the disposition of this claim. The defendant alleges that, subsequent to the parties' filing of their initial briefs, he became aware of an internal affairs report involving Early through a January 24, 2017 article published by the Journal Inquirer newspaper. The report detailed a 2007 investigation conducted by the Hartford Police Department to determine whether Early had abused his position as a police officer in attempting to convince a towing company to release his car without charging him a fee, and whether he intentionally misled the investigation by giving a false statement as to who drove him to\n   the towing company. The report stated that an internal affairs sergeant sustained the charge of abuse of police powers as well as the allegation that Early intentionally made a false statement to investigators. The report further stated that Early was issued a written reprimand for abusing his position as a police officer but was not disciplined for making the false statements, as they did not appear aimed at misleading the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   On February 10, 2017, after discovering the report, the defendant filed a motion for permission to file a late motion for augmentation and rectification of the record with this court in order to establish a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim. Specifically, the defendant sought an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the state had failed to disclose an internal affairs investigation relating to Early at the time of trial and requested that the trial court mark the report as an exhibit. On February 27, 2017, the state filed a response to the defendant's motion, conceding the facts on which the defendant relied to establish his\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim and not opposing\n   rectification of the record. The state further conceded that the report had been in the possession of the Hartford Police Department but had not been disclosed by the state prior to or during trial. Accordingly, the state argued that because suppression of the report was not a contested factual issue, an evidentiary hearing was not necessary. On March 15, 2017, this court granted the defendant's motion for permission and ordered the defendant to formally file his motion. On March 21, 2017, the defendant filed a revised motion for augmentation and rectification of the record with the trial court, in which he agreed with the state that an evidentiary hearing was not necessary due to the state's concessions. On November 6, 2017, the court granted the defendant's motion and marked the report as an exhibit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   \"It is the duty of the state voluntarily to disclose material in its exclusive possession which would be exonerative or helpful to the defense ....

It would have been within the jury's province to assess Early's credibility on the basis of the accusations contained within the report. This court's acceptance of the state's argument would be tantamount to preventing a jury from conducting this assessment.

The state articulates that plain error analysis requires a court not only to examine the nature of the error, but also to assess the grievousness of its consequences and whether it worked a serious and manifest\n   injustice on the defendant. The state argues that the defendant was not harmed by the grant of immunity to Harris because Harris did not state during his testimony that the defendant had shot him or Cedeno. The state refers to the court's instructions to the jury that Harris' out-of-court statements, including those in which he said that the defendant shot him, could not be used substantively, but only on the issue of the credibility of his in-court testimony. The state also argues that there was other evidence to prove the defendant's guilt, and that the jury reasonably could have found, on the basis of evidence developed through a witness other than Harris, and through the state's impeachment of Harris, that Harris was lying when he testified that he did not know who shot him, and that everyone, including the jury, should have seen that. From those facts the state concludes that \"the prosecutor's error did not inflict grievous harm causing manifest injustice upon the defendant ....\" Although the state refers to Harris' immunized testimony before the jury that was permitted by the court, the state does not discuss the court's role and duty with respect to the truth seeking process that is inherent in any trial, and the constitutional, statutory, public policy and other institutional implications and ramifications of a representative of the state offering the testimony of a witness, and the court's permitting that testimony to be presented to the jury, which both was anticipated and expected\n   to contain lies about a crucial issue in the trial, i.e., whether the defendant shot Harris and Cedeno. The state also does not discuss the contradiction between the grant of immunity that was not disclosed to the jury and the usual oath to tell the truth, which Harris took before the jury: \"You solemnly swear or solemnly and sincerely affirm, as the case may be, that the evidence you shall give concerning this case shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth; so help you God or upon penalty of perjury.\" General Statutes \u00a7 1-25.\n   The following additional facts are relevant to this claim. On October 9, 2014, the prosecutor and Harris entered into an immunity agreement by which Harris was granted transactional immunity for his testimony regarding the events on March 28, 2013, the date of the shooting, and use immunity, both direct and derivative, for all other proceedings. That same day, October 9, 2014, prior to Harris' testimony in the defendant's trial, the following exchange occurred between the court, Harris' counsel, and the prosecutor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   \"[The Court]: All right.

It also includes derivative use so that his words can't be used to investigate and then come up with other evidence that can be used against him in any proceeding....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   \"[Harris' Counsel]: And my understanding is that there is a tape recording or the prosecuting authority believes that it has a tape recording of my client saying something related to his testimony.

The court, however, appears immediately to have accepted the agreement without asking the defendant to comment on its validity. The court, as it expressed on the record, was fully aware of the impropriety of, and other problematic issues raised by the agreement, and it was also aware of and commented on Harris' obviously perjurious testimony after at least some of it had occurred. In light of the clear statutory invalidity of the agreement, and the other obvious issues that were raised by the agreement, the court had a clear and unwaivable duty to act to prohibit Harris' testimony, even in the absence of any objection by the defendant to it, and its failure to do so was plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Additionally, it is reasonable to conclude, on the basis of the record of the trial, that the state provided Harris\n   with immunity from perjury in order to use his testimony as a basis to put Harris' prior inconsistent statements in front of the jury, initially to impeach his credibility. The state, however, subsequently and in violation of its representation to the court that it offered the evidence solely for the purpose of impeachment and not for the truth of the statements therein, improperly utilized those statements for their truth in its closing argument. The court's abdication of its duty to take appropriate actions, when necessary, that promoted truth finding at the trial by allowing the immunization of Harris' testimony so that he could not be charged with and convicted of perjury undermined the fundamental fairness of the defendant's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   If the court, as it should have done pursuant to \u00a7 54-47a (b) and Connecticut public policy, had rejected the agreement for Harris' testimony, there presumably would have been no testimony by Harris before the jury about the incident because Harris would have exercised his fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination, and there would have been no structural error despite the existence of the agreement. Although plain error in this case exists solely because of the court's acceptance and implementation of the agreement, which allowed the improper, overbroad, and seemingly unprecedented immunization of Harris' testimony that the state anticipated would include perjury; see footnote 2 of this concurring opinion; the collateral consequences of that testimony enhance the egregiousness of\n   the improper grant of immunity. Had the state not provided Harris with immunity for his intentional lies that it anticipated were to occur during his testimony, Harris would not have testified and, thus, the state would not have improperly been able to utilize in its closing argument Harris' prior inconsistent statements against the defendant in a way that substantively corroborated the statements made by the defendant in his confession.\n   The court's acceptance and implementation of the agreement, which allowed the improper, overbroad immunization of Harris' testimony that was anticipated to include lies that amounted to perjury thus constituted plain error that was structural in nature. As previously set forth, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations in which the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McClain\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/#p808\">\n    324 Conn. at 812-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12489137\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/155/209/#p808\">\n    155 A.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Giving a witness a free pass to lie in his sworn testimony satisfies that plain error requirement.
