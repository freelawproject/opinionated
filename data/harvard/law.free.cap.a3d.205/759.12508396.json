On appeal, the\n   plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in (1) allowing the defendant to present evidence of the condition of the laundry folding table prior to its collapse, (2) allowing the defendant to question the plaintiff regarding her disability, and (3) denying the motion to set aside the verdict. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, which the jury reasonably could have found, and procedural history underlie the appeal to this court. The defendant is a company that maintains a laundromat business in New Britain. On October 27, 2014, the plaintiff visited the defendant's business with her husband in order to do laundry. At approximately 9 p.m., while the plaintiff was folding clothes on a table in the defendant's laundromat, the table suddenly collapsed on the plaintiff's right foot. As a result, the plaintiff sustained a fracture to her right big toe. The plaintiff commenced an action against the defendant alleging that the collapse of the table and her injuries were a direct result of the defendant's negligence. The defendant denied the allegations and brought special defenses alleging negligence on the part of the plaintiff. The parties stipulated, among other things, that \"the defendant [did] not blame the plaintiff in any way for her injuries.\" At trial, the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the defendant on November 30, 2017. On December 8, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion to set aside the verdict. On February 26, 2018, the trial court denied the plaintiff's motion, and she appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The claims the plaintiff makes in this court are essentially the same claims she raised in the trial court in her motion to set aside the verdict. The plaintiff first\n   raises two evidentiary claims: (1) the trial court erred in allowing the defendant to present evidence of the condition of the table prior to the incident; and (2) the trial court improperly allowed the defendant to question the plaintiff regarding her disability and prior work history. The trial court rejected these claims, concluding that evidence regarding the defendant's prior safety experience with laundry folding tables and the plaintiff's prior work history were relevant to issues of liability and damages, respectively, and were thus properly admitted into evidence. The trial court additionally rejected the plaintiff's claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, shocked the sense of justice, or was based on partiality, prejudice, mistake, or corruption because it found no support in the record for such a claim. We have examined the record on appeal, the briefs and arguments of the parties, and conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Because the trial court's memorandum of decision as to the plaintiff's motion to set aside the verdict thoroughly addresses the arguments raised in this appeal, we adopt that court's well reasoned decision as a proper statement of the applicable facts and law on the issues.\n   <em>\n    Melendez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spin Cycle Laundromat, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of New Britain, Docket No. CV-15-6031260-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201568930\">\n    2018 WL 1568930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (February 26, 2018) (reprinted at 188 Conn.

First, the defendant should not have been allowed to ask questions regarding the defendant's prior safety experiences with laundry folding tables because of evidentiary rulings, such as\n   <em>\n    Zheutlin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1555337\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/149/364/\">\n    149 Conn. 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=179%20A.2d%20829\">\n    179 A.2d 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1962). Second, the court should not have permitted evidence relating to the plaintiff's prior work history because it was irrelevant, highly prejudicial, and should not have been admitted as evidence. Third, the court improperly asked the plaintiff's counsel whether he claimed his question in response to an objection because it drew unnecessary attention to the plaintiff's objection and created an unfair presumption that the defendant's objections were more meritorious than the plaintiff's objections. Fourth, the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, shocked the sense of justice, or was based in partiality, prejudice, mistake, or corruption. Hence, the plaintiff argues the jury's verdict be set aside and the court should order a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In the present case, following its review of the record, the court finds that the evidence concerning the defendant's prior safety experiences with laundry folding tables and the plaintiff's prior work history were relevant to material issues in the case; in this instance, liability and damages. \"Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier of fact in the determination of an issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566627\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/446/#p473\">\n    213 Conn. 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=569%20A.2d%2010\">\n    569 A.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Such evidence, therefore, was properly admitted. The third basis for the plaintiff's motion lacks merit and doesn't warrant further discussion. Finally, the jury's general verdict was supported by the evidence and the reasonable inference that could be drawn from it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A jury's verdict should not be set aside and a new trial ordered unless it is apparent that \"injustice either was, or might have been, done [at] trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Keach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"522126\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/24/73/#p76\">\n    24 Conn. 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (1855).
