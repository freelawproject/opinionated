Their protection is of the utmost importance to all involved in governance and the administration of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Consequently, numerous policies at both the federal and state level have been implemented to protect the safety and well-being of children in this country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   One such policy, the application of which is at issue here, is an immigration classification titled \"Special Immigrant Juvenile (\"SIJ\") Status,\" which protects undocumented immigrant children residing in the United States from being reunified with an abusive parent in the child's home country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J). This policy allows such children to become lawful permanent residents of the United States if they satisfy certain eligibility criteria. One criterion requires the child to obtain an order from a state juvenile court that includes certain factual findings about the child's circumstances, including, among others, that \"reunification with 1 or both of the immigrant's parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, or abandonment\" and that \"it would not be in the [child's] best interest to be returned to the\n   [child's] or parent's previous country of nationality or country of last habitual residence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J)(i)-(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The present case was initiated in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In a proceeding before that court, Celso Monterroso Romero, Petitioner, sought sole custody of his then seventeen-year-old son, R.M.P, an undocumented minor and Guatemalan native.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner further requested that the circuit court issue an order containing factual findings illustrating R.M.P.'s eligibility for SIJ status, namely that reunification with R.M.P.'s mother, Josefa Perez Carreto (\"Perez\"), was not viable due to neglect and that it was not in R.M.P.'s best interest to return to Guatemala, where Perez resides.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court granted Petitioner custody of R.M.P. but declined to find that reunification with Perez was not viable due to neglect. The circuit court was unclear about which \"standard of proof\" should apply to establish such a finding-\"clear and convincing evidence\" or merely \"preponderance of the evidence.\" Nevertheless, the court ultimately determined that, under either standard, the undisputed evidence offered by Petitioner fell short of establishing that reunification with Perez was not viable due to neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In a reported opinion, the intermediate appellate court determined preliminarily that the proper standard of proof in SIJ cases is not \"clear and convincing evidence\" but rather the lower \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard.\n   <em>\n    Romero v.

Circuit Court Proceedings.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This case began in September 2015 when Petitioner, a Baltimore City resident, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking sole legal and physical custody of his son, R.M.P. Petitioner simultaneously filed a separate\n   motion requesting the court to render the requisite SIJ status factual findings for R.M.P. Petitioner alleged that it was in R.M.P.'s best interest to remain in Maryland under Petitioner's custody and care, and that reunification with Perez was not viable because she had neglected him. Perez, who currently resides in Guatemala, did not respond to these filings, and the case proceeded to a default hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Petitioner and R.M.P. testified at the October 2016 hearing. Their testimony was uncontroverted. The testimony revealed that R.M.P. was born to Petitioner and Perez in San Juan Ostuncalco, Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, in 1998. The parties separated in 2000, and Petitioner immigrated to the United States around 2004. R.M.P. lived with Perez after Petitioner left Guatemala, but Petitioner remained in weekly contact with R.M.P. and attempted to support him financially, though Perez misappropriated those funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In 2008, when R.M.P. was ten years old, Perez began forcing R.M.P. to work in dangerous conditions. In addition to mandating farm labor (planting potatoes and \"moving earth\"), Perez also required R.M.P. to journey barefoot into the mountains, unsupervised and surrounded by venomous snakes, to gather heavy loads of firewood. Perez would punish R.M.P. if he did not haul enough wood. In 2012, R.M.P. fell and injured his wrist. Perez did not seek medical attention for her son and the injury persisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The forced labor occurred daily for seven years and ceased only when R.M.P. fled to the United States in 2015. R.M.P.'s education suffered; he was unable to complete his homework and fell behind grade level in all subjects.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since arriving in the United States, R.M.P. has lived a stable life with Petitioner. R.M.P. expects to graduate high school soon and has dreams of pursuing a college degree thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In response to this testimony, the circuit court found that Petitioner was \"fit and proper to have custody of his son and that ...

The court therefore granted Petitioner's request for sole legal and physical custody of R.M.P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The court next considered Petitioner's motion for the requisite SIJ status findings. The court easily found that \"the child is 18, under 21. The child's not married [and is] [p]resently living in the United States.\" The court also found that \"it's not in [the child's] best interest to return to Guatemala.\" The court, however, was confused about whether to apply the \"preponderance of the evidence\" or \"clear and convincing\" burden of proof to \"make a finding against reunification with\" Perez. The court noted that there was no set burden of proof for establishing such a finding and that the court believed the \"clear and convincing\" standard applied. The court ultimately determined that, regardless of which burden of proof it applied, the court was \"50/50\" on the issue of neglect, and \"at that level of evidence,\" the\n   court \"can't make a finding\" that R.M.P.'s reunification with Perez was not viable due to neglect. Consequently, the court denied Petitioner's motion for an order that included all requisite SIJ status findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Petitioner filed a motion to alter or amend that judgment, which the circuit court denied.

Notably, while laboring in such conditions, R.M.P. sustained a physical injury that Perez ignored. Moreover, the forced labor commenced when R.M.P. was merely 10 years old. In Maryland, absent certain exceptions inapplicable here, it is illegal for a child under the age of 14 to work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Code (1991, 2016 Repl.

Rather than broadly assessing whether Perez's behavior rendered reunification with R.M.P. unworkable, the circuit court conducted a narrow analysis of whether Perez was neglectful in a technical sense. The court questioned, for example, whether Perez's failure to obtain medical care for R.M.P. was a valid\n   parental \"judgment call.\" The court challenged the veracity of R.M.P.'s testimony about his injury because he was able to continue working afterward, even though the uncontroverted evidence indicated that Perez forced him to do so. The court also concluded that because R.M.P. worked for his mother and still managed to attend school, no \"Maryland standards\" were violated. While such an exacting inquiry is appropriate in a Termination of Parental Rights hearing, it has no place in an uncontested SIJ status proceeding. The circuit court's order-and consequently, the Court of Special Appeals' decision affirming that order-was therefore legally incorrect. Accordingly, we vacated both decisions in our December 7, 2018, order and required the circuit court to issue an amended order with the requisite SIJ status findings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    As shall be noted again later in this opinion, in the SIJ status context, Maryland law defines a \"child\" as \"an unmarried individual under the age of 21 years.\" Md.
