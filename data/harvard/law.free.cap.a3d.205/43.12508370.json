Section 462(c) of Article 81, Maryland Code (1957, 1980 Repl. Vol.), a predecessor of Section 13-510, which governed appeals from the decisions of the Comptroller, directed any dissatisfied entity to seek review pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 352 of Article 81 (1957). Prior to 1966, Section 352 of Article 81, the section which delineated\n   those procedures, provided that \"[a]ny taxpayer dissatisfied with any final determination of the Comptroller upon application for revision of any assessment or refusal of refund,\" may appeal from \"such determination to the circuit court ....\" (1957, 1965 Cum. Supp.). The ability of the circuit court to hear these types of appeals, including instances where the Comptroller denied a claim for a refund, however, was removed from the statutory scheme in 1966, when the General Assembly vested the primary authority to hear such matters with the Maryland Tax Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1966 Maryland Laws, Chapter 262, Section 352. The purpose of the 1966 amendment was \"to provide that appeals from final determinations ... made by the State Comptroller shall be made to the Maryland Tax Court rather than to the Circuit Court for the County or the Baltimore City Court, and to correct an error therein.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4311521,12485178\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/448/355/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For our purposes, it is evident that the General Assembly intended to remove the adjudication of refund appeals from the jurisdiction of the circuit court and maintain exclusivity of those issues within the Tax Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The next issue that arises then is whether interest on a refund is to be treated the same way as a refund for the purposes of the Tax Court's exclusive jurisdiction. As Appellants aptly point out, the term \"refund,\" as defined by the Tax-General Article, does not refer to interest on a refund.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Tax-General Article provides that a taxpayer who \"erroneously pays to the State a greater amount of tax ... than is properly and legally payable\" or \"pays to the State a tax ... that is erroneously, illegally, or wrongfully assessed or collected in any manner,\" may file a claim for a refund of that tax with the tax collector. Tax-Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 13-901(a)(1), (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Interest, albeit not a part of the refund definition, is inextricably intertwined\n   with refunds statutorily.
