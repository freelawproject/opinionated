(Apartment Association) and denied the City's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Trial Court's Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The City is a home rule municipality governed by the Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law (Home Rule Law), 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2901 - 2984.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Apartment Association\n   is a non-profit corporation whose members are property owners, managers, and landlords in the business of renting residential properties in the City. Apartment Association's 200-plus members own and/or manage approximately 30,000 residential rental units in the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Housing is provided to many low-income tenants in the City through housing subsidies, the most well-known of which is the federal Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (Section 8 Program).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (Housing Authority), 41% of City residents with housing vouchers return them unused, due in part to their landlords' refusal to accept the vouchers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2015, the City enacted Ordinance 2015-2062 (Ordinance). The Ordinance amended certain provisions of the City's Code of Ordinances by adding a new protected class based on the source of income used to pay rent. The purpose of the Ordinance was to prevent residential property owners, real estate brokers, and others from denying a person access to housing based on his or her source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 1(jj) of the Ordinance provides the following definition of \"source of income\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   All lawful sources of income or rental assistance program [sic], including, but not limited to, earned income, child support, alimony, insurance and pension proceeds, and\n   <em>\n    all forms of public assistance including federal, state and local housing assistance programs.

In its Complaint, Apartment Association alleged that the Ordinance violated both the Home Rule Law and the Pennsylvania Constitution. It also sought a preliminary injunction to stay the enforcement of the Ordinance. On February 9, 2016, the Trial Court issued an Order staying the implementation and enforcement of the Ordinance until further order of the Trial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On June 29, 2017, the City filed an Answer and New Matter, to which Apartment Association replied on July 10, 2017. On October 13, 2017, the parties filed Stipulations of Fact with the Trial Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 17, 2017, the City filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, and Apartment Association filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. The Trial Court heard argument on the Motions on January 25, 2018. Thereafter, on March 14, 2018, the Trial Court granted Apartment Association's Motion, denied the City's Motion, and declared the Ordinance invalid and unenforceable. The Trial Court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The City's Ordinance makes participation in the Section 8 [P]rogram mandatory. Landlords will be forced to comply with the numerous and often burdensome requirements of the Section 8 [P]rogram. For example, they will have to use the Housing Authority's model lease and/or submit a preferred lease to the Housing Authority for pre[-]approval. That lease must include word[-]for[-]word provisions of the HUD Tenancy Addendum. They will be prohibited from including notice of termination waivers in leases and must accept a mandatory \"cure period\" of five days in advance of issuing a Notice to Quit. Landlords will be required to accept \"reasonable rent\" obligations as established by the Housing Authority and provide at least 60 days' notice of any change in rent amounts. They will have to obtain approval from the Housing Authority to raise a tenant's rent. Finally, landlords will be forced to agree to month-to-month leases subsequent to an initial one[-]year lease term. Neither Pennsylvania common law nor [The] Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951[, Act of April 6, 1951, P.L. 69,\n   <em>\n    as amended\n   </em>\n   , 68 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 250.101 - 250.602,] contain[s] such requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   There is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the ...

The City now appeals to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Issue\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Did the City have authority to enact the Ordinance to protect its residents from being denied access to rental housing based on their sources of income?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Parties' Arguments on Appeal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The City\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The City asserts that it was well within its authority in enacting the Ordinance to combat discrimination against low-income City residents. As a home rule municipality, the City determined that discrimination in rental housing based on a person's source of income has become a proxy for discrimination on the basis of race, national origin, and familial status. The City created the Ordinance to protect its residents from discrimination and to ensure the availability of affordable, safe housing for all residents. The Pennsylvania Constitution establishes its authority to enact the Ordinance, as it expressly provides that \"[a] municipality which has a home rule charter\n   <em>\n    may exercise any power or perform any function not denied by this Constitution, by its home rule charter or by the General Assembly at any time\n   </em>\n   .\" Pa. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 2 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The City also contends that the Trial Court erroneously relied on the exception in Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law. This Court has held that Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law prohibits the placement of \"affirmative duties\" on businesses.\n   <em>\n    Hartman v. City of Allentown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    880 A.2d 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005). Here, the Ordinance simply prohibits discrimination based on a potential tenant's source of income; it does not place any affirmative duties on businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, the City contends that Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law does not bar a municipality's regulation of businesses where such regulation is within its generally applicable police powers; anti-discrimination laws are clearly within those police powers. The City asserts that without the ability to carry out its police powers, a home rule municipality would have substantially less power than its non-home rule counterparts, which contravenes the purpose of home rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Apartment Association\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Apartment Association argues that the City exceeded its authority under the Home Rule Law. Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law expressly limits the City's authority to regulate businesses, prohibiting a municipality from placing \"duties, responsibilities or requirements ... upon businesses, occupations and employers.\" 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2962(f). The Ordinance in this case prohibits residential landlords from denying a person access to housing based on his or her source of income. As defined\n   in the Ordinance, \"source of income\" specifically includes housing subsidies under the Section 8 Program. Apartment Association asserts that before enactment of the Ordinance, residential landlords in the City were not required to participate in the Section 8 Program. Now, their participation in the Section 8 Program is mandatory. To comply with the Ordinance, City landlords must comply with the numerous requirements and federal regulations governing the Section 8 Program. According to Apartment Association, Pennsylvania courts have consistently invoked Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law to invalidate ordinances where a municipality has attempted to place duties and obligations on private businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under the Home Rule Law, \"[a] municipality which has adopted a home rule charter may exercise any powers and perform any function not denied by the Constitution of Pennsylvania, by statute or by its home rule charter.\" 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2961. As the City points out, this provision must be liberally construed in the municipality's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2961 (\"All grants of municipal power to municipalities governed by a home rule charter under this subchapter, whether in the form of specific enumeration or general terms,\n   <em>\n    shall be liberally construed in favor of the municipality\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added). Our Court has recognized that \"[t]he essential principle underlying home rule is the transfer of authority to control certain municipal affairs from the state to the local level.... This transference results in home rule municipalities having\n   <em>\n    broader powers\n   </em>\n   of self[-]government than non-home rule municipalities.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    880 A.2d at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Notwithstanding a home rule municipality's broad powers, the Home Rule Law imposes a statutory limitation on its authority to enact certain types of legislation. Specifically, Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law prohibits a home rule municipality from \"determin[ing] duties, responsibilities or requirements placed upon businesses, occupations and employers.\" 53 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2962(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pennsylvania appellate courts have consistently struck down municipal ordinances that violate this prohibition against the regulation of private businesses. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Building Owners &amp; Managers Association v. City of Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196670\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/603/506/\">\n    603 Pa. 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n    985 A.2d 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712 (2009), the City passed an ordinance requiring employers with new service contracts to retain the employees of prior contractors for at least 180 days. On appeal, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court concluded that the ordinance was invalid because it directly regulated the contractors in violation of the Home Rule Law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n    at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court determined that \"the [o]rdinance exemplifies the very essence of the invasive regulations that Section 2962(f) [of the Home Rule Law] is designed to prevent and, indeed, strictly prohibits.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n    at 715-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the Supreme Court held that \"[b]ecause the [o]rdinance imposes an affirmative duty upon contractors by requiring them to keep employees of prior contractors for a transitional period, the [o]rdinance reaches beyond the powers granted to the City ... as a home rule municipality in direct violation of Section 2962(f).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n    at 716\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Smaller Manufacturers Council v. Council of City of Pittsburgh\n   </em>\n   , 85 Pa.Cmwlth. 533,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20A.2d%2073\">\n    485 A.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (1984), the City passed an ordinance requiring manufacturing plant owners to notify the City's Bureau of Business Security of any plans to close, relocate, or reduce operations if such actions would affect more than 15% of their employees. Although the purpose of the ordinance -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to reduce\n   the economic disruption caused by plant closings - was an important public policy concern, this Court nonetheless invalidated the ordinance because it unlawfully determined the duties, responsibilities, and requirements of businesses in violation of Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20A.2d%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20A.2d%2073\">\n    at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We concluded that the ordinance's requirement that businesses notify a City-created Bureau if a business decision was made went directly to the heart of business management and \"fl[ew] in the face of the express language\" of the Home Rule Law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=485%20A.2d%2073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The City attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Building Owners\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smaller\n   </em>\n   and instead relies on\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   to support its position on appeal. The City asserts that, like the anti-discrimination ordinance at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   , the instant Ordinance \"does not require or mandate anything on businesses\" but \"simply prohibits discrimination.\" City's Br. at 15 (emphasis omitted); City's Reply Br. at 1. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   , the City of Allentown adopted an ordinance that added sexual orientation and gender identity to a list of prohibited bases of discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    880 A.2d at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We began by analyzing \"how broadly [ Section 2962(f)'s] limitation on home rule authority should be interpreted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    at 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We examined the use of the phrase \"regulation of business\" in other, similar statutes regulating non-home rule municipalities and found that those \"statutes are quite specific and focus on or limit the affirmative duties that non-home rule municipalities can place on businesses and employers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, we held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of the City of Allentown's police powers and did not violate Section 2962(f) of the Home Rule Law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    at 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We conclude that the Ordinance at issue here is more akin to the\n   <em>\n    Smaller\n   </em>\n   ordinance than the\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ordinance. While it is true that anti-discrimination ordinances are a valid exercise of a municipality's police powers, the Ordinance here, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ordinance, does more than just ban discrimination against certain protected classes of people.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Building Owners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7292498,4196670\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/985/711/\">\n    985 A.2d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ordinance \"simply disallowed discrimination based upon sexual orientation and gender identity generally\"). By defining \"source of income\" to include Section 8 Program subsidies, the Ordinance in this case necessarily mandates that all residential landlords in the City comply with the federal Section 8 Program requirements, when previously their participation in the Section 8 Program was voluntary. That is clearly an affirmative obligation and more invasive to the operation of a rental business than the type of general anti-discrimination ordinance at issue in\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   . Like the ordinances in\n   <em>\n    Building Owners\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Smaller\n   </em>\n   , the requirements of the City's Ordinance \"go to the heart of business management and usurp the role of management.\"\n   <em>\n    Hartman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939290\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/880/737/#p746\">\n    880 A.2d at 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, implementation of the Ordinance will require all residential landlords to significantly alter their business practices in order to accommodate Section 8 Program participants. Contrary to the City's contention, the Ordinance does, in fact, place affirmative \"duties, responsibilities or requirements\" on private businesses and employers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Ct. Op., 3/14/18, at 4-5 (outlining a potential lessor's Section 8 Program requirements).
