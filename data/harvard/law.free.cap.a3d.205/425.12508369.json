The College asserts that the trial court erred because redress for the alleged partial strike falls\n   under the trial court's equitable jurisdiction under the Pennsylvania Public Employe Relations Act (PERA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 15, 2017, the College filed a Complaint and a Petition for Preliminary Injunction requesting the trial court to enjoin the Union's partial strike pursuant to Section 1003 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1003. The College asserted that the full-time faculty's refusal to perform required assessment work constituted a strike that met Section 1003's \"clear and present danger\" standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The College is a \"public employer\" within the meaning of Section 301(1) of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(1). The Union is an \"employe organization\" under Section 301(3) of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(3), representing full-time faculty at the College, among others. The College and the Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which expired on August 31, 2016. The parties continue to operate under the terms of the expired agreement, with Union-represented faculty continuing to receive full pay and benefits. The parties are currently in negotiations for a successor agreement under the supervision of the Bureau of Mediation. Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 10a-11a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The College is an open admission institution serving the Philadelphia area and approximately 30,000 students each year, offering associate degrees and academic and proficiency certificates. The College alleged that, in order for it to maintain its accreditation, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education requires the College to engage in a continuous cycle of assessment of student learning outcomes and to use the results of the assessment to improve and update courses, curricula, teaching methods and student learning. These assessments require full-time faculty to examine and review courses and curricula to ensure students are meeting established course, program and institutional level learning outcomes. The performance of assessment work is a professional responsibility of each full-time faculty member and a required duty under the expired CBA and past practice. R.R. at 12a-14a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The College asserted that the failure of full-time faculty members to complete and submit the required assessments places the College's accreditation in jeopardy. Without accreditation, the College would lose federal and certain state funding. Additionally, the College's students would no longer be eligible for federal and state financial aid, including Pell grants, because that aid is conditioned on a student attending an accredited institution. Further, without the assessments, the College would be unable to adequately assess whether students are achieving the learning objectives of courses and programs. R.R. at 14a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The College alleged that, in the 2012-2013 academic year, during ongoing negotiations for the parties' previous CBA, the Union instructed faculty to refuse to perform assessments. As a result, the College received a formal written notice from the Middle States Commission that its accreditation may be in jeopardy. The College remained on warning until early 2016, when full-time faculty resumed performing assessments on a continuing basis. R.R. at 15a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The College further alleged that, beginning in November 2016, and continuing through the present, the Union once again instructed full-time faculty to refuse to perform mandated assessment work, while continuing to accept full pay and benefits. The College demanded the Union to cease and desist from instructing full-time faculty to refuse to perform assessment work while receiving full pay and benefits. The Union did not stop. Full-time faculty are refusing to perform assessments. The College claims that this concerted refusal to perform assessment work constitutes a partial strike. R.R. at 15a-16a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The College requested an injunction of the partial strike because it is creating a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public in violation of Section 1003 of the PERA. The College claimed that the partial strike threatens the College's accreditation, which if lost, would likely cause the College to cease operations. Such a loss threatens the health, safety and welfare of the public by jeopardizing the community's access to affordable higher education, decreasing the number of skilled workers entering the labor force and reducing tax revenue for the City of Philadelphia. R.R. at 17a-22a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The College requested the trial court to enjoin the Union and its members from refusing to perform the required assessment work; to order the full-time faculty to complete all forms of required assessment work immediately; and to order the Union to terminate the partial strike and direct all full-time faculty to return to the full performance of their duties, including assessment work. R.R. at 22a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In response, the Union filed POs, which included a challenge to the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Union asserted that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over the College's Complaint because the College seeks redress of Union conduct, which arguably constitutes an unfair labor practice under Section 1301 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1301. R.R. at 139a, 142a-43a. The Union alleged that the performance of assessment work has always been a voluntary activity by full-time faculty. R.R. at 5a. Further, the Union asserted that the College already filed a charge with the Board asserting that the very same conduct constituted an unfair labor practice, and as a result, should be precluded from proceeding in the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   R.R. at 4a-5a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court sustained the Union's POs on subject matter jurisdiction, dismissed the College's Complaint, and ruled that the College's Petition for Preliminary Injunction was moot. From this decision, the College timely appealed to this Court. The College filed a statement of errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa. R.A.P. 1925(b), as directed by the trial court. The trial court filed an opinion in support of its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Pa. R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the College had already filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board raising the same issues based on the same conduct. The gravamen of the College's Complaint is that of an unfair labor practice because it involves questions of whether completion of assessment work by full-time faculty is voluntary or mandatory and whether the College can unilaterally impose this requirement during ongoing negotiations, thereby altering the status quo. The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to prevent any person from engaging in an unfair labor practice under Section 1301 of the PERA. Therefore, the trial court concluded that the College's Complaint properly belongs in the Board's exclusive jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the College contends that the trial court erred in determining it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the College's Complaint. Section 1003 of the PERA expressly grants the courts jurisdiction to enjoin strike activity that poses a clear and present danger or a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public. In its Complaint, the College alleged that its full-time faculty is engaged in a partial strike that poses a clear and present danger or a threat to the health, safety and welfare of the public. The College claims that the trial court disregarded its statutory duty to determine whether the faculty is on strike, and whether that strike should be enjoined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The courts and the Board play separate roles in the adjudication of matters arising under the PERA. To wit, the courts have equity jurisdiction over strikes prohibited under Article X of the PERA. Sections 1001, 1002 and 1003 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.1001, 1101.1002, 1101.1003 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong School District v.

Section 301(9) of the PERA defines a \"strike\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [C]oncerted action in failing to report for duty, the wilful absence from one's position, the stoppage of work, slowdown,\n   <em>\n    or the abstinence in whole or in part from the full, faithful and proper performance of the duties of employment\n   </em>\n   for the purpose of inducing, influencing or coercing a change in the conditions or compensation or the rights, privileges, or obligations of employment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(9) (emphasis added). Article X of the PERA governs strikes and directs public employers to seek relief from strikes in the courts. Sections 1001, 1002 and 1003 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.1001, 1101.1002, 1101.1003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Specifically, Section 1001 of the PERA prohibits strikes by guards at prisons or mental hospitals or employees directly involved with the functioning of the courts. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1001. \"If a strike occurs[,] the public employer shall forthwith initiate\n   <em>\n    in the court of common pleas of the jurisdiction where the strike occurs,\n   </em>\n   an action for appropriate equitable relief including but not limited to injunctions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1722135\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/469/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

The union argued that its complaint did not assert an unfair labor practice, but rather a breach of contract claim and that jurisdiction belonged in the common pleas court. The Supreme Court, citing\n   <em>\n    Hollinger\n   </em>\n   , held that the complaint\n   clearly alleged a breach of contract claim and that the common pleas court exercised proper jurisdiction over the matter.\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1829829\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/528/355/\">\n    598 A.2d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It is our view that the present case falls within the\n   <em>\n    Hollinger\n   </em>\n   exception. Just as the courts of common pleas have jurisdiction to hear breach of contract claims, they also have jurisdiction to enjoin prohibited strikes pursuant to Sections 1001, 1002 and 1003 of the PERA. A court of competent jurisdiction is not divested of its jurisdiction merely because the allegations involved may arguably be an unfair labor practice.\n   <em>\n    See City of Philadelphia ;\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollinger\n   </em>\n   . To conclude otherwise would implicitly abrogate the express power given to the courts to grant equitable relief to public employers when public employees engage in prohibited strikes under Sections 1001, 1002 and 1003 of the PERA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 1922(a)(2) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1922(a)(2) (General Assembly intends the entire statute to be given effect);\n   <em>\n    Snyder Brothers, Inc. v.

The College filed its Complaint to enjoin a partial strike under Section 1003 of the PERA. In support, the College alleged that the full-time faculty are required to perform assessment work. R.R. at 13a. The Union is instructing its members to refuse to perform required assessment work. R.R. at 15a. In accord therewith, the members are refusing to perform assessment work, while continuing to receive full pay and benefits. R.R. at 15a. The College further alleged that the partial strike is creating a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public by jeopardizing the College's accreditation. R.R. at 17a-22a. The College requested the trial court to order the Union to enjoin the partial strike. R.R. at 22a. In short, the gravamen of the College's Complaint seeks redress for a strike, not an unfair labor practice. Therefore, jurisdiction of the College's Complaint is vested with the trial court, not the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The fact that the College also filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board based on the same conduct does not alter our analysis. Although two causes of action may arise from the same set of operative facts, that does not mean they are the same. The PERA establishes two distinct avenues for relief based on the conduct for which redress is sought. As discussed above, the statutory provision vesting the Board with exclusive original jurisdiction over unfair labor practices does not divest the courts of jurisdiction to entertain equity actions to enjoin a strike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Nevertheless, the Union and the trial court argue that the trial court cannot exercise jurisdiction once a labor practice charge is filed, even where the Secretary dismisses the charge. In support, they rely on\n   <em>\n    Philipsburg-Osceola\n   </em>\n   , which holds that an adverse ruling by the Secretary of the Board does not divest the Board of exclusive jurisdiction or invest jurisdiction in another forum.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1452549\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/159/124/#p224\">\n    633 A.2d at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Philipsburg-Osceola\n   </em>\n   , after a strike, the union filed a charge with the Board, alleging that the school district had committed an unfair labor practice by unilaterally deducting money from members' paychecks for each day they were on strike. The Secretary of the Board refused to issue a complaint on the basis that the school district had not engaged in unlawful conduct. The union then filed\n   the exact same claim seeking relief from the trial court. The union did not dispute the Board's jurisdiction, but rather argued that, because of the Secretary's dismissal of its charge, the trial court could now exercise equitable jurisdiction of its complaint and enjoin the school district's conduct under the Pennsylvania Wage Payment and Collection Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The school district filed POs asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the dispute.

The doctrine of primary jurisdiction is not applicable here. While the Board has the authority to hear unfair labor practice disputes, it does not have the general authority to enjoin prohibited strikes under Sections 1001, 1002 and 1003.

Rather, the College requested the trial court to enjoin a \"strike\" that was presenting a clear and present danger or threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public.

If the trial court determined assessment work was not mandatory, and there was no strike as alleged, the trial court could have simply denied the relief requested.
