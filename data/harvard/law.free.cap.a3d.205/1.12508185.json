Four Counts of Aggravated Trafficking\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b63] In December 2016, an agent with the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) began conducting a series of controlled purchases of crack cocaine from Brown using a confidential informant. Brown resided on the second floor of an apartment building located at 72 Walnut Street in Lewiston, in the vicinity of the Governor James B. Longley Elementary School, which is located on Birch Street. The apartment building has two entrances: one at the front of the building on Walnut Street and another on the right side of the building on Prince Street. The entrance on the Prince Street side proceeds up a flight of stairs to the second floor. On the second floor, a door off the stairs leads into the kitchen area of the apartment. There is a living room to the left of the kitchen and off of the living room are two bedrooms. The bedroom closest to Walnut Street belonged to the owner of the apartment building, and the other bedroom was Brown's.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] During the first day of trial, the confidential informant testified about the three controlled buys from Brown, each of which took place somewhere in Brown's apartment. The confidential informant testified that she entered the apartment from the Prince Street side door and would meet Brown in either his bedroom or the living room. With regard to the actual location of the controlled buys, she testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Q And where would you meet when you go inside of 72 Walnut?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A Usually, if it wasn't the living room, it was his bedroom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Q Okay. Okay. So you would go into that [bedroom] and you ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   A I usually wouldn't go into the room. I wouldn't go [nowhere] past the door. I would stand at the door like ... out the door. And he had a dresser, do his thing, give me -- if it wasn't there, it was on that end table in the living room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b65] The first count of aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs stems from the first controlled purchase, which occurred on December 23, 2016. During this controlled buy, Brown sold the confidential informant 2.8 grams of crack cocaine in exchange for $ 400. Describing this buy, the confidential informant testified that Brown was \"in the bedroom\" and that she gave the money to him in return for crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b66] The second controlled purchase, which was the basis of the second count of aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs, took place on December 29, 2016. During this controlled buy, Brown sold the confidential informant 1.737 grams of crack cocaine in exchange for $ 400. The confidential informant did not testify about precisely where she was inside the apartment during this buy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b67] The third and final controlled purchase was conducted on February 10, 2017, when Brown sold the confidential informant 1.69 grams of crack cocaine for $ 300. This controlled buy led to the third count of aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs. Again, the confidential informant did not testify about the precise location of this buy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b68] Following the three controlled buys, law enforcement officers obtained and executed a search warrant for the apartment at 72 Walnut Street. While searching Brown's bedroom, a DEA agent discovered a bag of crack cocaine weighing approximately 27 grams. This formed the basis for a fourth count of unlawful trafficking in schedule W drugs based on the permissible inference provided in 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(3)(B) (2018) that Brown's possession of fourteen grams or more of cocaine constituted unlawful trafficking in scheduled drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b69] The State charged all four counts as aggravated trafficking, alleging that the drugs were discovered, and the controlled buys occurred, within 1,000 feet of the real property of Longley Elementary School.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B. Evidence Concerning the Distance Between 72 Walnut Street and Longley Elementary School\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b610] The court held a three-day jury trial from September 25 to September 27, 2017. On the first day of trial, a DEA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   agent testified that he used a measuring wheel to measure the distance between the front entrance of 72 Walnut Street and the property line of Longley Elementary School. Specifically, the DEA agent started his measurement at the \"front step\" of 72 Walnut Street, took a diagonal route across Walnut Street, and proceeded down Howe Street in a straight line to Longley Elementary School, where he ended the measurement \"four or five feet\" onto school property. This measurement totaled 958.9 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b611] The following morning, after being informed that the \"vertical distance\" to the location where the drug transaction occurred should be accounted for in the measurement, the DEA agent returned to the apartment and conducted additional measurements. When he testified about his second set of measurements, the DEA agent explained that he entered the building using the Walnut Street entrance and then \"measured from the living room to the exterior of the building, which was 16.9 feet. And from that second-floor exterior of the building to the ground, which was, I believe 12.4 feet.\" He then added in the distance from the spot on the ground out to the location on the platform where he had begun his initial measurements. All four measurements, added together, totaled 996.2 feet. On cross-examination, the agent acknowledged that, in taking his interior measurements, he had begun at the doorway to Brown's living room, and that it was \"unlikely\" that the buys had occurred in that doorway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C. Jury Instructions and Verdict\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b612] During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note to the court asking whether vertical distance must be included in measuring the distance from the trafficking to the school and requesting \"[c]larification on the law on what is 1,000 feet: a straight-line distance, a walking path, a radius?\" Despite defense counsel's objection-that there was no evidence presented about what a straight-line measurement would be-the court gave the jury a new written instruction, stating, \"The 1,000 feet is a straight-line measurement from the location where the offense occurred to the property line of the school. Maine law is silent as to vertical feet. If there is a reasonable doubt or ambiguity because of a vertical measurement, it must be resolved in favor of the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b613] The jury returned a guilty verdict on all four counts of aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs. On December 4, 2017, Brown was sentenced to ten years in prison on the four convictions of aggravated trafficking in schedule W drugs. Brown timely appealed the judgment of conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 M.R.S. \u00a7 2115 (2018) ; M.R. App. P. 2B(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b614] Brown argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that his drug trafficking occurred within 1,000 feet of the real property of Longley Elementary School. \"When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a conviction, we determine, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, whether a trier of fact rationally could find beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense charged.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although we considered a similar issue in\n   <em>\n    State v. Barnard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    2003 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    828 A.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we have yet to explicitly determine how the distance ought to be measured in order to sustain a conviction under 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E)(1)-(6) (2018). We do so today by determining (1) what two points must be measured, (2) whether the straight-line or the pedestrian-route approach applies, and (3) whether the 1,000-foot distance includes any difference in elevation between the two points to be measured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Measuring the Distance Between the Real Property of the School and the Location of the Offense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b616] In order to conduct a measurement, one must know the two points that mark the distance to be measured. In\n   <em>\n    Barnard,\n   </em>\n   \"we assume[d], without deciding, that interior distances from the entrance closest to the school property to the site of the transaction should be counted in calculating the 1,000-foot distance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    2003 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24 n.7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    828 A.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Today, we explicitly hold that, in order to sustain a conviction under 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E)(1)-(6), the distance to be measured is the distance between the real property of the school and the location of the drug trafficker at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   [\u00b617] Pursuant to 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n   A person is guilty of aggravated trafficking in a scheduled drug if the person violates section 1103 and:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n   At the time of the offense, the person is on a school bus or within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising a private or public elementary or secondary school or a safe zone ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Read carefully, the language of the statute provides a key distinction between the two points between which the distance is to be measured. The statute requires that a measurement be made between a point on \"the real\n   <em>\n    property\n   </em>\n   \" of the school or safe zone and the point at which \"the\n   <em>\n    person\n   </em>\n   \" is trafficking. 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b618] The Legislature's use of the terms \"real property\" and \"person\" in section 1105-A(1)(E) is critical because, had the Legislature intended to have jurors and courts determine the distance between the school property and the property where the trafficking occurred, it would have used different language. Instead, the Legislature chose to focus on the location of the trafficker at the time of the drug transaction. For us to disregard this distinction would be to render the term \"the person\" mere surplusage, and \"because no language is to be treated as surplusage if it can be reasonably construed, we must give meaning to this language.\"\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2097\">\n    2018 ME 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12498668\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/189/262/\">\n    189 A.3d 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration omitted) (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   [\u00b619] Although the plain language of section 1105-A(1)(E) is dispositive in our analysis, we note that federal courts have interpreted comparable federal statutes the same way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Additionally, in cases where the State fails to offer a precise measurement of the distance between the two points but the spatial leeway is great enough to make up for such evidentiary gaps, the jury reasonably may infer that the trafficking occurred within 1,000 feet of the school. The concept of spatial leeway does not excuse the State from proving the 1,000-foot distance, however; it only recognizes that jurors are well-equipped in appropriate cases to apply their \"common sense, common knowledge, and rough indices of distance\" when facts proved beyond a reasonable doubt permit a jury to reasonably infer distances not precisely accounted for.\n   <em>\n    Barnard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    2003 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    828 A.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   E.

First, the distance between the \"front step of 72 Walnut Street,\" which is at the Walnut Street entrance, and \"four or five feet\" onto the real property of Longley Elementary School amounts to 958.9 feet. Moreover, because the DEA agent testified that a terminus of his measurement was \"four or five feet\" past Longley Elementary School's property line, the jury could reasonably infer that the actual distance between the front step of 72 Walnut Street's front entrance and the real property line of Longley Elementary School was 953.9 feet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    2003 ME 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 23,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105385\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/828/216/\">\n    828 A.2d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, the jury rationally could have found, based on the DEA agent's testimony about his additional measurements and from other testimony regarding the layout of the apartment, that the distance between the \"doorway that opens into the living room\" from the Walnut Street entrance and the front step of 72 Walnut Street, where the initial measurement began, constitutes an additional 37.3 feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Therefore, based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury rationally could conclude that the distance between the \"doorway that opens into the living room\" and the real property line of Longley Elementary School was 991.2 feet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the evidence established, at a maximum, 8.8 feet of spatial leeway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   [\u00b633] In an attempt to use the spatial leeway exception, the State contends that, because its measurements included a vertical distance using the method suggested in\n   <em>\n    Soler\n   </em>\n   and employed a pedestrian-route measurement rather than a straight-line route measurement, the jury could have reasonably inferred that the apartment was even closer to the school. We are unpersuaded by this argument for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [\u00b634] First, because the difference in elevation between the school boundary line and the location of the trafficker at the time of the offense must be accounted for in the measurement required by 17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E), the vertical distance included in the State's measurement does not provide more spatial leeway that the jury could have applied in reasonably inferring that Brown trafficked within 1,000 feet of Longley Elementary School. Second, the State's argument that the jury could reasonably infer that a straight-line measurement would have provided even more spatial leeway that the jury could have applied in reasonably inferring that Brown was trafficking within 1,000 feet of Longley Elementary School is also unavailing. The DEA agent measured the distance from Longley Elementary School to 72 Walnut Street using a pedestrian-route measurement, and the State provided no \"straight-line\" measurement for the jury to consider. Therefore, there was\n   <em>\n    no evidence\n   </em>\n   from which the jury reasonably could have inferred that, if a straight-line measurement had been conducted, the distance would have been within 1,000 feet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3617163,7413868\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/46/1166/\">\n    46 F.3d at 1169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b642] Accordingly, we vacate the aggravating elements of the convictions of Counts 1-4 and remand to the Superior Court for resentencing on four counts of trafficking in schedule W drugs (Class B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1103(1-A)(A), (3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The entry is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Judgment vacated in part. Remanded for entry of modified judgment and resentencing on Counts 1-4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   SAUFLEY, C.J., with whom MEAD, J., joins, concurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   [\u00b643] We concur completely in the Court's opinion. We write separately to draw attention to the broader consequences of the statute making drug trafficking an aggravated offense if the transaction occurs within 1,000 feet of the real property of a school.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-A M.R.S. \u00a7 1105-A(1)(E)(1) (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   [\u00b644] To be clear, the Legislature's adoption of a statute designed to keep school children from obtaining drugs, witnessing the sale of drugs, or being exposed to the violence that could arise during a drug transaction is laudable. Protecting our children from exposure to this pernicious activity and the presence of a culture that includes violence, misery, and death is a critically important legislative goal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   [\u00b645] The statute put in place to effectuate such goals, however, misses its mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The case at bar is a perfect example of the unintended consequences of this blunt instrument. The drug sales at issue occurred in a private dwelling, outside the view of any children, youth, or participants in school activities. The transactions had no connection to the school. Had the sales occurred in an apartment closer to the part of the building that was nearest to the school, rather than in the apartment at issue, the aggravating factor would likely have been proved, subjecting the defendant to a longer period of incarceration for each crime, even in the absence of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   school involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   [\u00b646] Worse than the arbitrary nature of this aggravating factor is the potential that it may disproportionately affect defendants in more densely populated geographic areas, where neighborhood schools are present throughout a municipality. The result could include a disparate racial or poverty-based impact that was unintended by the drafters. Meanwhile, in suburban or rural areas where much of the population resides more than 1,000 feet from school property, drug transactions between adults in private homes are significantly less likely to incidentally result in convictions of aggravated trafficking based on proximity to a school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   [\u00b647] Although this challenge was not raised in the matter before the court, likely because challenges to similar laws based on assertions of constitutional infirmity have regularly been unsuccessful,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the fact that a law meets minimal constitutional standards does not make it a good law. Hence, we raise this issue for consideration by the people's elected representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b648] In short, although the noble goal of the statute is to protect schoolchildren from the ills of drug trafficking, the statute may disproportionately expose people living in diverse, urban areas to aggravated convictions and harsher sentences for conduct that may have no effect whatsoever on the schoolchildren the statute seeks to protect. A more descriptive definition of the activity to be proscribed would greatly enhance the justice of this aggravating factor, and we hope that the Maine Legislature will seriously consider the consequences of the provision as written.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Brown was also convicted of four counts of violating a condition of release (Class E), 15 M.R.S. \u00a7 1092(1)(A) (2018) (Counts 6-9), after he waived his right to a jury trial on those charges pursuant to M.R.U.
