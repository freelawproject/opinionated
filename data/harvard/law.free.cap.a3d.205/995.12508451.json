The incident culminated in the stabbing death of one of its participants. A jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City found Robertson guilty of accessory after the fact to murder, but acquitted him of first- and second-degree murder and of carrying a weapon openly with intent to injure. On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court erred in permitting the State to question Robertson regarding his participation in a previous, unrelated incident during which a knife had been brandished (\"previous incident\"), because the door had not been opened for questioning by the State. The Court of Special Appeals also held that, because the introduction of the previous incident was not harmless error, Robertson's conviction for accessory after the fact must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial. On appeal, the State presents the following questions for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. What is the appropriate standard of review of a trial court's ruling that a party has opened the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Applying the appropriate standard of review, did the [Court of Special Appeals] err by substituting its judgment for the trial court's determination that [Robertson] had opened the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , we find that application of whether particular evidence may be admitted based on the legal principle of \"opening the door\" is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   . We further conclude that defense counsel opened the door, thereby enabling the State to question Robertson regarding the previous incident. However, despite the application of the open door doctrine, the State used the evidence of Robertson's participation in the prior incident in a manner that exceeded\n   the scope of the doctrine. Accordingly, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the evening of February 1, 2016, Robertson, then a student at Coppin State University, was involved in an altercation between two groups of men near the Morgan State University campus. The fight concluded after one of the participants, Gerald Williams (\"the decedent\"), was stabbed and ultimately died from his wounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The impetus for the fight began nearly a week earlier. Daequon Gordon, a Prince\n   George's Community College student, purchased ten dollars' worth of marijuana from Brandon Parker, a Morgan State University student. Gordon purchased the marijuana with a counterfeit fifty-dollar bill and received the marijuana and forty dollars in return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Parker learned that the fifty-dollar bill was counterfeit, he contacted Gordon and demanded his money back. A meeting was arranged, and both Parker and Gordon showed up to the meeting with friends. Among them was the decedent, who was one of Gordon's friends, and Robertson, who was one of Parker's friends. The subsequent details were in dispute at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Gordon, testifying for the State, contended that when the two groups met that evening, he told Parker, \"I got your money. You'll have to take it from me. I'm not paying you.\" Gordon then punched Parker, provoking a larger fight among the group. As Robertson and others ran from the area, the decedent collapsed and Gordon, observing that the decedent was bleeding, called an ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Another State witness, Isaiah McClin, who fought as part of the decedent's group, testified that \"all hell broke loose\" after the groups met, and though he did not recall who was fighting, he heard the decedent yell something during the fight, shortly after which the fight abruptly ended. Thereafter, McClin\n   observed the decedent lying on the ground and \"bleeding out.\" Although McClin did not see the stabbing, or observe Respondent in possession of a weapon, he recalled Robertson and the decedent fighting at some point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   D'ana Glenn, another witness for the State, testified that she observed the altercation and never saw a large group fighting with each other. Rather, Glenn testified, only Robertson and the decedent were fighting. She stated that she saw the decedent charge towards Robertson, and Robertson, in an effort to \"push forward toward him,\" stabbed the decedent. Upon further examination, Glenn conceded that her view of Robertson was not \"that clear\" and that she only saw Robertson holding a knife after \"[he] and the decedent 'impact[ed].' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Robertson denied stabbing the decedent and further denied having a knife. He contended that he fought two men during the fight: Mathew Agogo and McClin. Robertson also testified that he heard the decedent say \"I'm bleeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Robertson testified that after the men dispersed, he told his cousin, Ron, who was also engaged in the fight, that they should leave. Robertson got into Ron's car along with four of their friends. One of the friends was Abayomi Akinwold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the drive, Robertson testified that Akinwold was \"beating himself up\" and had blood on his hand and jacket. At one point, the car stopped, Akinwold exited, and tossed a knife into a storm drain. The car subsequently stopped at a friend's home, which Akinwold entered. When Akinwold returned to the car moments later, his hands were clean. Ron drove the friends to their respective homes, leaving Robertson at his mother's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following his arrest, Robertson was detained at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center. James Alston, who was also detained at the facility on a probation violation, testified that Robertson admitted that he had killed someone during a fight. Alston denied receiving anything in exchange for his testimony, but admitted that his probation violation had been dropped prior to Robertson's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Proceeding in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the beginning of the trial, Robertson faced charges of first-degree murder, second-degree\n   murder, and carrying a dangerous weapon openly with intent to injure. At the end of Robertson's case, at the suggestion of the court and with agreement from counsel, an accessory after the fact charge was added. The jury subsequently found Robertson guilty of accessory after the fact to murder, but acquitted him of the remaining charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At trial, the following colloquy occurred between Robertson and his counsel during direct examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Now did you ever get into any trouble as a juvenile?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [ROBERTSON]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Ever just stopped for some minor issue?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [THE STATE]: Again Your Honor, I'm going to object to the leading nature of his questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, I'm going to overrule that one. Go ahead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you. Any kind of trouble when you were a juvenile?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [ROBERTSON]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: How about as an adult, when you turned 18?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [ROBERTSON]: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Ever even arrested for anything?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [ROBERTSON]: Never been arrested. This is my first time being arrested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During cross-examination, the State inquired about Robertson's participation in a previous, unrelated incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense\n   counsel objected, and a bench conference ensued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on defense counsel's questioning during Robertson's direct examination, the trial judge asserted that defense counsel had opened the door to enable the State to inquire about the previous incident.\n   <em>\n    Proceeding before the Court of Special Appeals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Robertson raised two issues on appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [1.] Whether the trial court erred in permitting the State to question him about his participation in an earlier fight during which a knife had been brandished.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [2.] Whether the evidence was sufficient to support his conviction for accessory after the fact to murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals held that defense counsel had not opened the door for the State to introduce the previous knife incident because defense counsel had limited his questioning to Robertson's criminal and juvenile record. Because defense counsel's questioning was limited in scope, Robertson had \"opened the door, at most, to being cross-examined ... as to his claim that he had never been previously involved with the justice system, as either an adult or juvenile[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson v. State of Maryland\n   </em>\n   , No. 2731, slip op. at 8 (Md. App. June 6, 2018). The Court held that, because the introduction of the previous incident was not harmless error, Robertson's conviction for accessory after the fact must be vacated and remanded for a new trial (\"Given the similarity of the earlier incident ... we cannot say, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the decision to permit inquiry about the previous incident was harmless error.\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Regarding the second issue, the Court held that Robertson had not preserved his insufficiency claim and declined to review the issue for plain error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A trial court's ruling on the admissibility of evidence is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Hopkins v.

The Court of Special Appeals observed that defense counsel's questioning did not open the door, and if it did, the questioning was limited to rebuttal evidence pertaining to Robertson's previous involvement with the justice system.\n   <em>\n    Robertson\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 8. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that defense counsel's questioning was narrowed by the context of Robertson's engagement with the law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Given the narrowed scope of questioning, had the door been opened, proportional rebuttal evidence\n   could solely address Robertson's previous engagement with the criminal justice system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the previous incident did not result in any criminal charges, but merely related to Robertson's suspension from Morgan State University, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the trial court abused its discretion regarding the proportionality of the State's rebuttal evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The general nature of defense counsel's questioning opened the door for the State to rebut evidence of Robertson's good character.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   We first analyze the issue of whether defense counsel's questioning opened the door to rebuttal evidence from the\n   State. We find that defense counsel's questioning was not specific to Robertson's previous engagement with police, but was general in nature. He asked whether Robertson was ever in\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   kind of trouble as a juvenile. Counsel's next question-\"How about as an adult?\"-carried over from the previous question, implying the same general questioning regarding Robertson's character. The use of the term \"any\" expands defense counsel's questioning beyond Robertson's previous engagement with the justice system. The Court of Special Appeals's selective quotations from counsel's questioning and Robertson's arguments about the use of legal terminology are unconvincing to limit the State's rebuttal evidence to Robertson's criminal history. The State, under the open door doctrine, was permitted to introduce evidence to rebut the image of Robertson as an upstanding individual who had never been in\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   trouble.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 5-404(a)(2)(A) ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 5-608(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such rebuttal evidence was within the ambit of the open door doctrine. We agree with the trial judge's rationale that the door was open for the State's rebuttal evidence. At a bench conference, the following colloquy occurred between the trial judge and defense counsel after defense counsel's objection over the State's questioning about the previous incident:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   THE COURT: If - - you put your witness on and he testified. You asked him and he testified, he's never been in trouble, he's a good boy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Now, it seems to me that would open up testimony on number one, credibility, and number two, maybe he did have trouble in someplace [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]. I think it's legitimate to bring [the previous incident] in at this point. The door is open....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Beyond the issue of credibility,\n   <em>\n    see.\n   </em>\n   n.5, we agree that the general nature of defense counsel's questioning generated an issue as to Robertson's good character. Robertson attempted to benefit from his good character, which opened the door to the State's questioning about his previous\n   disciplinary action at Morgan State University.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Though defense counsel opened the door for the State to introduce evidence of the previous knife incident, the State's use of the evidence exceeded the scope of the open door doctrine.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Though the State was entitled to question Robertson about the previous knife incident to rebut the assertion that he had never been in any trouble, the State improperly used the evidence throughout the trial. The State's evidence exceeded the scope of the open door doctrine. Rather than simply introducing the previous incident to rebut Robertson's general good character, the State elicited details about the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Khan v.

However, near the end it misapplies that reasoning to hold that the trial court abused its discretion. Accordingly, I dissent from that holding and the Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   This appeal concerns application of the \"opening the door\" doctrine. Under that doctrine, a party \"opens the door\" to the\n   admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence when the party injects an issue into a case and the opposing party is allowed, as a matter of fairness, to respond with evidence that, although previously inadmissible, has thereby become relevant.\n   <em>\n    Little v.

I agree with this reasoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   With respect to the second issue, the Majority Opinion conducts a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record and concludes that Mr. Robertson's testimony on direct examination that he was (literally) a Boy Scout and had never previously been in \"any trouble\" opened the door to cross-examination about his involvement in a knife fight a year earlier that resulted in his suspension from college. Majority op. at 358-61, 205 A.3d at 1004-06. Again, I agree with that analysis. So far, so good.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Majority Opinion then turns to the third question - whether the trial court abused its discretion in how it permitted the prosecution to respond to the testimony that \"opened the door.\" The Majority Opinion concludes that \"the State improperly used the evidence [of the prior knife fight] throughout the trial.\" Majority op. at 360-61, 205 A.3d at 1005-06. In fact, the evidence of the prior knife fight appeared late in the trial only during the cross-examination of Mr. Robertson, the last witness on the last day of the trial. That testimony occupies approximately four pages of the trial transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   At the outset of that testimony, Mr. Robertson's counsel objected to any reference to the prior knife fight, calling it \"outrageous.\" He cited what he referred to as a \"motion in limine,\" but stated no particular basis for the objection. As the Majority Opinion notes, no motion in limine appears in the record of this case, so the basis and scope of this defense objection are not clear - other than that the topic of the prior knife fight should be completely off limits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   It appears from the colloquy quoted in the Majority Opinion that defense counsel eventually conceded - or at least accepted the trial court's ruling - that he had opened the door to the topic in his direct examination of Mr. Robertson.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority op. at 360-61, 205 A.3d at 1005-06. Defense counsel did not thereafter object to any of the specific questions posed by the State on the topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In discussing this issue, the Majority Opinion lays out why it would have reached a different outcome than the trial court but that, of course, is not the standard for abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   <em>\n    Nash v.

In that case, a security guard in a cosmetics store was charged with assault and third-degree sex offenses when he sprayed perfume on two teenage girls in the store and then touched various parts of their bodies. One of the issues on appeal concerned the introduction of evidence of prior customer complaints of inappropriate touching by the security guard. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the trial court that the door had been opened to testimony concerning those complaints when defense counsel elicited positive testimony from the security guard's employer concerning his past work performance. When the defense objected to testimony concerning details of the prior complaints, the trial court excluded that evidence of those details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals affirmed that exercise of discretion by the trial court in response to the defense objection, stating: \"While the proverbial door was opened to the disputed testimony, it remained for the trial court to balance its probative value against its prejudicial nature, and here we see no abuse of discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676839\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/213/554/#p575\">\n    213 Md.

The intermediate appellate court thus made clear that, in applying an abuse-of-discretion standard, it was deferring significantly to the trial court's judgment in responding to the defense objection to evidence of the details of the prior incident. Contrary to the suggestion of the Majority Opinion, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   indicates that it was declaring a one-size-fits-all approach for trial courts when a party opens the door to\n   the introduction of certain evidence. The abuse-of-discretion standard inherently involves a case-by-case assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In making that case-by-case assessment, an appellate court cannot overlook the fact that in this case, unlike\n   <em>\n    Khan\n   </em>\n   , there was no objection registered at trial to the testimony concerning the details of the prior incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Majority Opinion suggests that, in not interrupting and limiting the cross-examination\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the trial court \"failed to follow guiding principles.\" Majority op. at 365, 205 A.3d at 1008. But a critical guiding principle here is that an objection must be made to evidence when the grounds become apparent, or the objection is waived. Maryland Rule 4-323(a). The purpose of that rule is \"to prevent 'sandbagging' and to give the trial court the opportunity to correct possible mistakes in its rulings.\"\n   <em>\n    Bazzle v.

This would seem to establish\n   a standard under which a trial court must act as back-up defense counsel (without the benefit of having defense counsel's knowledge of where the questions will likely lead), and intervene\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in a cross-examination or risk being found to have abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   I cannot agree that the failure of the trial court to interrupt cross-examination\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   in these circumstances was, in the oft-quoted description of the abuse-of-discretion standard, \"well removed from any center mark ... and beyond the fringe of what [is] minimally acceptable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Judge Watts has advised that she joins this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    The previous incident was a fight which occurred a year before the incident at issue.
