The Court granted certification on this issue. The issue has been briefed and argued. The Court should not stop the parties from agreeing to settle their private coverage dispute and keep it confidential. The private concerns of the parties, however, should not prevent the Court from discharging its public duty to decide the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In my view, this appeal raises issues of substantial public importance and those legal issues should be resolved now.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nini v.

Deciding this case is my\n   preferred course of action, and I therefore voted against dismissal of the appeal and remand of the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Further, registering a nay vote on the application is not enough. In light of the public importance of the issue, I find it necessary to address the legal error that should be corrected. I believe that the Appellate Division and trial court erred in categorizing the insurance contract's provisions affecting the minimum mandatory coverage for the dealership's cars as an\n   enforceable step-down clause and not an impermissible escape clause. In my view, it is important to shine a light on flawed legal reasoning that imported the use of a step-down analysis into an analysis of the adequacy of an insurance contract's provisions governing compliance with required minimum mandatory automobile insurance coverage by auto owners. Accordingly, I write in the hope that by highlighting that analytic error, the error will not be perpetuated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Briefly stated, plaintiff Patricia Engrassia filed this action seeking compensation on behalf of the estate of James Marles. Marles was killed by Erick Uzcategui when Uzcategui struck him while driving a loaner vehicle from Hunterdon BMW (Hunterdon). When Uzcategui took possession of the loaner vehicle, he executed a rental agreement stating that his automobile liability insurance would be primary and the dealership's automobile liability insurance would be secondary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the accident, Geico Indemnity Company (Geico) insured Uzcategui with a Family Automobile Insurance Policy having liability limits of $ 100,000 per person and $ 300,000 per accident. Geico accepted coverage for this accident and paid the liability limit of its policy, $ 100,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff sought to hold Federated Mutual Insurance Company (Federated), Hunterdon's insurer, liable under Hunterdon's garage policy, which had coverage limits of $ 500,000. In New Jersey, automobile dealerships are required by the Motor Vehicle Commission to submit to several requirements in order to be\n   licensed as a motor vehicle dealer, including N.J.A.C. 13:21-15.2(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) (requiring demonstration of liability insurance in the amounts of $ 100,000 per person/$ 250,000 per incident covering all vehicles owned or operated by a license applicant). It is not disputed that Hunterdon relied on the garage policy in its license submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The garage policy includes a provision that excludes Hunterdon customers from coverage unless the customer does not have statutorily required minimum insurance coverage. In those instances, customers are insured under the garage policy, but only up to the \"compulsory law limits.\" This provision is set forth under the insurance contract's section addressing \"Who is an Insured.\" The garage policy defines \"insured\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Anyone else while using with your permission a covered \"auto\" you own, hire or borrow except:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (d) Your customers. However, if a customer of yours:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (I) Has no other available insurance (whether primary, excess or contingent), they are an \"insured\" but only up to the compulsory or financial responsibility law limits where the covered \"auto\" is principally garaged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (II) Has other available insurance (whether primary, excess or contingent) less than the compulsory or financial responsibility law limits where the covered \"auto\" is principally garaged, they are an \"insured\" only for the amount by which the compulsory or financial responsibility law limits exceed the limit of their other insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the key issue that prompts this writing, cross-motions for summary judgment were filed with the trial court. Federated claimed that Uzcategui did not constitute an \"insured\" under the garage policy. That said, because the clause would have provided Uzcategui coverage if he did not\n   have proper insurance under the New Jersey requirements on his vehicle, Federated claimed that the clause is not an \"illegal escape clause,\" and is therefore enforceable. Plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against Federated, arguing that Uzcategui was a permissive user of Hunterdon's vehicle covered under the garage policy and therefore the owner of the vehicle (Federated's insured) was obligated to maintain liability coverage for him. Plaintiff asserted that the language that excluded Uzcategui from coverage constituted an\n   unenforceable \"escape clause\" and that it should therefore be voided and coverage under the garage policy provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court concluded that the clause was not an \"illegal escape clause\" because it did not deny coverage; rather, it merely limited coverage to the compulsory minimum in New Jersey, which the court identified as the amounts in the omnibus statute, N.J.S.A. 39:6B-1(a) (requiring $ 15,000/$ 30,000 in minimum compulsory automobile liability insurance for private automobiles). Further, the court described the clause as a step-down clause, which is generally permitted under law and thus valid. The court held that Uzcategui was an \"insured\" under the garage policy subject to the statutory liability limit of $ 15,000, and ordered Federated to pay plaintiff that amount. Both plaintiff and Federated appealed from the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   An appellate panel affirmed the trial court as to its findings that the \"insured\" provision was an enforceable step-down provision, but reversed the trial court's remedy that required Federated to pay Uzcategui the $ 15,000 statutory liability minimum.

Therefore, even if a provision -- like Endorsement No. 4 -- would never leave an injured third party without coverage, it was still in violation of the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The language at issue in the Federated policy for Hunterdon closely tracks the illegal escape clause in Endorsement No. 4 in\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   . Instead of creating different limits of insurance for different classes of drivers, the Hunterdon policy entirely eliminates groups of drivers from coverage. While a properly written step-down provision would be logically placed in the \"limit of insurance\" section of a policy -- as the Federated policy does in its UIM and UM endorsements -- the Hunterdon customer exclusion is placed within the definition of an insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although there are exceptions to the customer exclusion under the \"insured\" definition, it is still an exclusion. In the instant matter, Uzcategui did not fall within either of those exceptions, and therefore Hunterdon's vehicle was walled off from coverage by Federated for liability to this injured third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The operation of this policy provision eviscerates the public policy that all autos be covered for prescribed mandatory minimum liability coverage obtained by their owner for injury to third parties caused by those vehicles. The shifting of responsibility to ensure that an injured party receives from someone -- here the customer (or his insurer) -- the minimum compulsory liability insurance amount does not fulfill the public policy of the compulsory insurance requirement and its related permissive user doctrine. It is nothing other than an invalid, illegal escape clause, attempting to circumvent the initial permission rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This conclusion is four-square with the analysis of the Appellate Division in\n   <em>\n    Rao v.

The\n   <em>\n    Aubrey\n   </em>\n   Court did not find the \"insured\" definition enforceable as it pertained to legally mandated liability insurance, but instead dealt with UIM insurance -- an optional form of first-party insurance. The questions before the Court did not implicate an automobile owner's legally mandated insurance requirements, nor the permissive user, step-down, or escape clause doctrines that have since flowed from those requirements. It is an inappropriate basis upon which to dispose of the instant matter. Its reasoning was extended beyond its facts and logic to achieve a result in this matter that is contrary to public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Hunterdon policy, in my view, contains an illegal \"escape clause\" and is unenforceable. As established by\n   <em>\n    Willis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Rao\n   </em>\n   , the proper next step is to reform the offending provision so that the policy complies with the legally required minimums. While past cases have applied the $ 15,000 minimum established by N.J.S.A. 39:6B-1(a), the instant case presents an additional question of public importance: whether N.J.A.C. 13:21-15.2, which governs the application process for dealership licenses, establishes a higher legally required minimum for dealership insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (the Commission) enacted a regulation requiring that, before a dealership license is issued, the applicant must\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   submit a certificate of insurance demonstrating liability insurance covering all vehicles owned or operated by the applicant, at his or her request or with his or her consent. This insurance shall be in the amount of $ 100,000 per person per incident up to $ 250,000 per incident for bodily injury or death, $ 25,000 per incident for property damage, and $ 250,000 combined personal injury and property damage per incident. This insurance shall be renewed as necessary to ensure that it remains valid for the entire prospective license term.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [ N.J.A.C. 13:21-15.2(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   During the Notice and Comment period, the Commission received several comments alleging that the insurance limits\n   required were prohibitively expensive, and questioning the Commission's authority to enact a regulation that increased a dealership's requirements beyond those stated in N.J.S.A. 39:6B-1. 38 N.J.R. 1324(a). The Commission responded that the regulation was within its authority because it \"is entrusted to enforce the law concerning the conduct of automobiles dealers in order to regulate the purchase and sale of motor vehicles.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"331474\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/140/397/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regarding the cost of the increased insurance, the Commission acknowledged that this would impose some hardship onto dealerships, but that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   the exposure occasioned by the proliferation of dealer plates and the use of those plates by what are essentially unknown quantities required increased protection more in line with current economic realities, which is directly related to the public welfare....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   While the Commission is not insensitive to the effect of increased costs on the dealer, as a matter of simple fairness, the costs of injuries to third parties should be borne by the commercial entity who benefits by the use and sale of the vehicle and not by the innocent victim of an accident in which that vehicle may be involved. The Commission, therefore, declines to amend the rules to impose on motor vehicles dealers the requirements ... which apply only to private passenger automobiles and not to dealership inventory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In my view, the Commission clearly and explicitly indicated that N.J.A.C. 13:21-15.2(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) was expressly intended to increase the legally required minimums of insurance for permissive users of dealership owned cars. That policy choice is a logical application of the animating principles of the initial permission rule and the illegality\n   of escape clauses. The case law is clear: an insurance policy cannot contract around its mandated duty to the public to maintain minimum limits of insurance on owned vehicles through escape clauses. In my view, there is no reason that an increase of that minimum limit -- instituted in light of the heightened risk posed by the automobiles involved -- would alter that long-held stance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To the extent that Federated suggests that the Commission was not within its power to enact this regulation, I note only that at oral argument Federated conceded that it never challenged the regulation when it was enacted or during this litigation. Moreover, it does not appear that any other entity has challenged the regulation since its enactment. Absent a valid challenge to the regulation's enforceability, this Court should not interpret the legally required insurance minimum -- to which an invalid insurance policy provision should be reformed -- to fall below the representations of coverage the dealership is required to provide in order to be licensed to do business in this state.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    UIM coverage will pay its insured, if a non-fault driver, for the discrepancy between the payment received from an at-fault driver's policy and the UIM policy limit of the first-party insured. A policy's UIM limit cannot exceed its general liability limit. N.J.S.A. 17:28-1.1(b).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
