Respondent filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment, alleging that Petitioners lacked the requisite taxpayer standing to maintain their case. Following a hearing, the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss, ruling that Petitioners failed to allege a specific harm unique to them or their property and that Petitioners lacked taxpayer standing. Petitioners filed a notice of appeal, and while this case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals, they filed in this Court a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   . Before the Court of Special Appeals heard oral argument or issued an opinion, we granted the petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Floyd v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499010,12499013\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/460/494/\">\n    460 Md. 494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12499010,12499011,12499012,12499013\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/190/1037/\">\n    190 A.3d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Against this backdrop, we decide whether the circuit court properly determined that Petitioners failed to establish the requisite taxpayer standing to proceed with this case, and, in turn, whether the circuit court erred in granting the motion to dismiss. We hold that the circuit court correctly granted the motion to dismiss because Petitioners failed to allege facts sufficient to establish taxpayer standing to maintain a challenge to the comprehensive rezoning and zoning map. We conclude that Petitioners failed to show a special interest in the subject matter of this case distinct from that of the general public by failing to sufficiently allege illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts by Respondent that may result in a pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes. Moreover, we determine that Petitioners failed to demonstrate a nexus between any alleged potential pecuniary harm and the challenged act,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a connection between the allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   act and the harm caused to the taxpayer. Petitioners also failed to seek a remedy that, if granted, would alleviate any alleged tax burden or pecuniary loss. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 22, 2012, City Council Bill 12-0152, also known as \"TransForm Baltimore,\" was introduced, and assigned to the Council's Land Use and Transportation Committee (\"the Committee\"). Bill 12-0152 involved comprehensive rezoning in Baltimore City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over the next several years, the Committee held a public hearing on\n   Bill 12-0152 that was recessed and reconvened numerous times. On October 20, 2016, the Committee voted on a Committee Report, in which the Committee recommended that the Council consider Bill 12-0152 favorably with amendments. On October 24, 2016, the Council held a meeting and voted favorably on Bill 12-0152 with amendments. On December 5, 2016, the Council voted to pass Bill 12-0152, the Mayor signed it, and it was enacted as Ordinance 16-581. The Mayor and the Council President also signed the accompanying Zoning Map, which was dated October 24, 2016. Ordinance 16-581 was to take effect on June 5, 2017. As of the date it was enacted, Ordinance 16-581 stated, in relevant part, that it was \"ORDAINED[ t]hat the Zoning Map dated October 22, 2012[,] and accompanying this Ordinance is enacted as a part of new City Code Article 32 - Zoning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Ordinance 16-581 was enacted, typographical errors in the Ordinance were noticed, and, on February 27, 2017, City Council Bill 17-0021 was introduced. Bill 17-0021 was entitled \"Baltimore City Zoning Code - Legalization - Corrections[,]\" and included the following purpose paragraph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   FOR the purpose of legalizing new City Code Article 32 ... as enacted by Ordinance 16-581 ... and edited, codified, and published by the Baltimore City Department of Legislative Reference; further amending new Article 32 to correct various technical errors, omissions, and inconsistencies and to correct, clarify, and conform various references and language; providing for a special effective date; and generally\n   relating to the zoning and development laws of the City of Baltimore.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 5, 2017, the Committee held a public hearing on Bill 17-0021, and voted favorably on the bill with amendments. On April 24, 2017, the Council held a meeting, and approved amendments to Bill 17-0021. One of the amendments that was adopted was the inclusion of the following language (with additions shown by capitalization, and deletions shown by brackets):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   That the Zoning Map dated [October 22, 2012] OCTOBER 24, 2016, and accompanying this Ordinance, AS THAT MAP WAS SIGNED AND APPROVED BY THE MAYOR AND CO-SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE CITY COUNCIL, BOTH UNDER DATE OF DECEMBER 5, 2016, is enacted as part of new City Code Article 32 - Zoning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In other words, from the amended language, it appeared that reference to the October 22, 2012 Zoning Map, as opposed to the October 24, 2016 Zoning Map, was a typographical error or inadvertent discrepancy. On May 8, 2017, the Council voted to pass Bill 17-0021. On May 16, 2017, the Mayor signed Bill 17-0021, which was enacted as Ordinance 17-015. Ordinance 17-015's effective date was the same as Ordinance 16-581's,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , June 5, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ten days later, on May 26, 2017, Petitioners filed in the circuit court a complaint for declaratory judgment against Respondent, challenging the comprehensive rezoning, adopted and enacted through Bill 12-0152/Ordinance 16-581 and Bill 17-0021/Ordinance 17-015, as\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal. In the complaint, Petitioners alleged that they were Baltimore City taxpayers who were bringing the \"action on behalf of all Baltimore City taxpayers pursuant to the principle of taxpayer standing as set forth in\"\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    442 Md. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    113 A.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, according to Petitioners, the comprehensive rezoning would \"injuriously affect the property of Baltimore City taxpayers, who [would] suffer pecuniary losses or increased taxes as a result.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the complaint, among other things, Petitioners\n   alleged that various required notices were not mailed or published.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the complaint, Petitioners also alleged the following in paragraphs thirty-six through fifty:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   36. The approval and enactment of the \"October 22, 2012\" Zoning Map as part of Bill 12-0152/Ordinance 16-581 was\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and illegal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   37. The \"October 24, 2016\" Zoning Map signed by the Mayor and City Council President on December 5, 2016 had not been adopted by the [ ] Council.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   38. The notice, hearing, and other due process requirements of the Land Use Article and Baltimore City Zoning Ordinance were violated, both in letter and in spirit, in the processing, approval[,] and enactment of new Baltimore City Zoning Maps as part of Bill 12-0152/Ordinance 16-581 and Bill 17-0021/Ordinance 17-015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   39. The\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal imposition of a new Zoning Map on Baltimore City will cause Baltimore City taxpayers to suffer pecuniary losses or tax increases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   40. A Zoning Map adopted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means lacks the presumption of validity afforded in Maryland to lawful comprehensive rezonings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   41. With no statute of limitations for claiming error in a comprehensive rezoning, an unlawfully adopted Zoning Map will bring prolonged instability to Baltimore City.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   42. The presumption of validity will effectively be replaced by the presumption of error, and rezoning applications based on allegations of mistake in the comprehensive rezoning will be the norm rather than the exception.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   43. A Zoning Map adopted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means will be challengeable whenever a permit or zoning authorization is applied for or issued.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   44. A Zoning Map adopted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means may overburden the taxpayer-funded resources of City agencies, boards[,] and commissions that review and issue permits and zoning authorizations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   45. A Zoning Map adopted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means will place extra burdens on the taxpayer-funded resources of the City Law Department, which routinely defends decisions made by City agencies, boards[,] and commissions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   46. The efforts by private entities and [Respondent] to respond to or correct errors and allegations of mistake will be costly to Baltimore City taxpayers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   47. Baltimore City real property will be plagued by uncertainty over regulations as to the potential construction and use of buildings and properties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   48. A Zoning Map adopted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means may cause the assessed value or market value of real property to erroneously increase or decrease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   49. Property tax credits for the improvement of property may be erroneously granted or denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   50. Bonds may be issued to support the development of unlawfully rezoned property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the complaint, Petitioners sought declaratory judgment that Respondent had failed to mail and publish certain notices; that Bill 17-0021/Ordinance 17-015 was \"null and void as to its adoption and enactment of a Baltimore City Zoning Map\"; that the adoption and enactment of the \"Zoning Maps was\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal, and [thus] null and void\"; and that the Zoning Maps were \"of no effect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On May 26, 2017, the same day that the complaint was filed, Petitioners filed a motion for summary judgment and accompanying memorandum in support,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which\n   they argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The procedures by which [Respondent] adopted and enacted new Baltimore City Zoning Maps, first in December of 2016 and later in May of 2017, are not found in the Land Use Article and Baltimore City Zoning Ordinance. There were multiple[ ] egregious failures: failure to provide Baltimore\n   City property owners with notice of changes proposed to the zoning or their properties; failure to conduct all required hearings; failure to provide required hearing notice, both mailed and advertised; and[,] in the case of the most recent action, failure to hold Bill 17-0021 over for one regular City Council meeting before giving final approval to the new Zoning Map. That Zoning Map, scheduled to become effective on June 5, 2017, was adopted and enacted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and illegal means and must not become the new Baltimore City Zoning Map.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A few days later, on May 31, 2017, Petitioners filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to block the Zoning Map from going into effect on June 5, 2017. On June 2, 2017, Respondent filed an opposition to the motion. On the same date, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion for a temporary restraining order. During the hearing, Petitioners' counsel argued that Petitioners were bringing this case \"as a taxpayer suit, ... [b]ased on the fact that the taxpayers of the City of Baltimore will be taxed to the limit for challenges that will occur\" to the Zoning Map. Petitioners' counsel contended that \"irreparable harm\" would occur to all Baltimore City taxpayers, in \"that permits will be issued under the new illegal zoning map ... [t]hat will then cause challenges[.]\" When asked to clarify what the irreparable harm would be, Petitioners' counsel asserted: \"Irreparable harm is the City will be forced to defend [ ] multiple violations of issuing a permit based on an illegal map.\" Petitioners' counsel contended that the harm to Baltimore City taxpayers would be \"higher [cost]s, more money spent[,]\" and that, \"[b]ecause it's a taxpayer's suit in which monies will be expended by the City[,] that will ultimately be bo[ ]rne by the taxpayer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The circuit court heard argument from Respondent's counsel and brief rebuttal argument from Petitioners' counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, ruling orally from the bench, the circuit court denied the motion for a temporary restraining order. On the same day, the circuit court issued an order denying the motion for a temporary restraining order, stating, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Petitioner]s have not shown by any \"specific facts\" in their motion, affidavit, and memorandum that any harm will result. They assert that taxpayers \"may\" suffer a pecuniary loss. This is insufficient for a motion for such extraordinary relief. The list of potential burdens and uncertainty does not bolster [Petitioner]s' position. Without a defined harm, [Petitioner]s cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On June 5, 2017, the new Zoning Code and Map became effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Respondent filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment and opposition to Petitioners' motion for summary judgment, and an accompanying memorandum of law. Respondent argued that Petitioners failed to establish taxpayer standing for three reasons: (1) Petitioners failed to \"allege a special interest in the subject[ ]matter of the suit distinct from that of the general public\"; (2) the allegedly illegal and\n   <em>\n    ultra\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    vires\n   </em>\n   acts had \"no reasonable relationship to the likelihood of a potential tax increase\"; and (3) Petitioners failed to establish a nexus between the potential pecuniary damage and the challenged act. (Cleaned up). As to the failure to allege a special interest, Respondent asserted that Petitioners alleged a harm that was applicable to the general public, and was not specific to them. Respondent maintained that taxes in Baltimore City were not being raised as a result of the comprehensive rezoning, and zoning classifications in the ordinances and accompanying Zoning Map had no relationship to taxes, as a \"property taxpayer's tax rate is not based or premised upon his or her zoning classification[.]\" And, as to the nexus requirement, Respondent contended that Petitioners were not seeking a remedy that, if granted, would alleviate an impact on taxes as alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On July 19, 2017, Petitioners filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. In pertinent part, Petitioners contended that they had taxpayer standing, and that the relief they requested-voiding of the Zoning Maps-was an available remedy. Petitioners argued that they had established taxpayer standing under\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    442 Md. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    113 A.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that \"[a]dministration of an unlawfully updated Zoning Map [would] be costly to the taxpayers.\" Petitioners asserted that, in the complaint, they had alleged \"numerous negative impacts on the taxpayers if\" the \"unlawfully adopted Zoning Map\" were utilized, and that the allegations of the complaint demonstrated the necessary \"nexus between the taxpayers and an unlawfully adopted Zoning Map[.]\" (Cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On August 7, 2017, the circuit court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss.

Petitioners argue that the circuit court's grant of the motion to dismiss essentially constituted a determination that there could never be taxpayer standing sufficient to challenge comprehensive rezoning in Baltimore City. Petitioners assert that, in the complaint, they alleged numerous potential effects that unlawful comprehensive rezoning could have on Baltimore City taxpayers. Petitioners maintain that, in the complaint, as to potential harm, they alleged, among other things, that \"[t]he ultra vires or illegal imposition of a new Zoning Map ... will cause Baltimore City taxpayers to suffer pecuniary losses or tax increases[,]\" and that \"[t]he efforts by private entities and [Respondent] to respond to or correct errors and allegations of mistake will be costly to Baltimore City taxpayers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Respondent counters that the circuit court properly granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that Petitioners had failed to establish taxpayer standing. Respondent contends that Petitioners failed to adequately demonstrate a special interest distinct from that of the general public, and that the alleged harm,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   act, has no reasonable relationship to taxes in Baltimore City. Respondent argues that taxpayer standing is usually satisfied in cases where taxpayers challenge a government action in the form of \"a large[-]scale public expenditure, capital investment, or\n   transaction for which the government could reasonably be expected to raise taxes to effectuate.\" Respondent asserts that, by contrast, in this case, the bills at issue were not spending or tax bills, taxes are not being raised as a result of the enactment of the ordinances, and zoning classifications and the Zoning Map have no relationship to taxes. Respondent maintains that Petitioners did not clearly show potential pecuniary loss or a reasonable relationship to government expenditure or taxation. Respondent contends that Petitioners failed to show the required nexus for taxpayer standing and argues that there is no meaningful connection between the specific allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts and the harms claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Respondent argues that Petitioners fail to seek a remedy that, if granted, would alleviate the tax burden they allege will result if the Zoning Map is allowed to remain in place. Respondent asserts that Petitioners, in actuality, allege that Baltimore City will be forced to expend funds to correct errors allegedly made under the Zoning Map and to enact new legislation to replace the Zoning Map. Respondent maintains that the remedy sought-nullification of the new Zoning Map, but not of the new Zoning Code-would create chaos because Baltimore City would be governed by a Zoning Code that is designed for a Zoning Map that would no longer be valid, and the remedy does not alleviate any alleged pecuniary loss or increase in taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As a final matter, Respondent contends that concluding that taxpayer standing exists in this case would run counter to public policy as recognized in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    442 Md. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    113 A.3d 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court eliminated property owner standing as a basis to maintain a challenge to comprehensive rezoning. According to Respondent, permitting Petitioners to proceed under their \"theory of taxpayer standing would be no different than allowing property owner standing to exist in the comprehensive rezoning context because every taxpayer, like every property owner, could\n   bring such a challenge.\" (Emphasis omitted).\n   In a reply brief, Petitioners contend that applying taxpayer standing to a comprehensive rezoning challenge as in this case does not conflict with or undermine the doctrine of taxpayer standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State Ctr., LLC v.

This means that a plaintiff must show \"that the action being challenged results in a pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes[,]\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 578, 113 A.3d at 662 (cleaned up), and that \"[t]he harm alleged must be particularized and pecuniary, as opposed to harms to the general public ..., and caused potentially by the comprehensive zoning[,]\"\n   <em>\n    Zimmer Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337790\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/444/490/\">\n    444 Md. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   509 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337790\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/444/490/\">\n    120 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   688 n.10 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In this case, Petitioners have failed to show a special interest in the subject matter of this case distinct from that of the general public by failing to sufficiently allege pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes. Put plainly, Petitioners simply have not shown that the allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts by Respondent may result in a pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes. Rather, the allegations of the complaint demonstrate that Petitioners' theory of pecuniary loss or increase in taxes is vague and not easily understandable. At oral argument, Petitioners' counsel argued that Petitioners had sufficiently alleged pecuniary loss and an increase in taxes, and drew this Court's attention to paragraphs 39 through 50 of the complaint, set forth above. A review of the complaint, however, demonstrates otherwise. In the complaint, at paragraph 39, Petitioners baldly alleged that \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal imposition of a new Zoning Map on Baltimore City will cause Baltimore City taxpayers to suffer pecuniary losses or tax increases.\" Petitioners did not allege, with any explanation or\n   particularity, the pecuniary losses or tax increases expected or how the new Zoning Map potentially would result in such harm. Petitioners simply stated that pecuniary loss and tax increases would\n   occur. This is a bare allegation that, in and of itself, is insufficient to establish taxpayer standing. Were we to conclude otherwise, anyone could establish taxpayer standing by merely using the magic words \"pecuniary loss and an increase in taxes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Similarly, in paragraphs 44 and 45, Petitioners alleged that adoption of the Zoning Map by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means could \"overburden the taxpayer-funded resources of City agencies, boards[,] and commissions that review and issue permits and zoning authorizations[,]\" and would \"place extra burdens on the taxpayer-funded resources of the City Law Department[.]\" The meaning of these allegations is difficult to discern. More importantly, the allegations fall far short of alleging any pecuniary loss or increase in taxes potentially caused by the comprehensive rezoning, and instead appear to refer to potential costs caused by defending challenges to the comprehensive rezoning and Zoning Map. In addition, in paragraph 50 of the complaint, Petitioners alleged that \"[b]onds may be issued to support the development of unlawfully rezoned property.\" Again, this allegation lacks any explanation or specificity. Overall, the complaint fails to allege any injury resulting in a pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes due to the comprehensive rezoning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In the complaint, Petitioners alleged harm that has no connection whatsoever to a pecuniary loss or tax increase. For example, in paragraph 40 of the complaint, Petitioners alleged that \"[a] Zoning Map adopted by\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   or illegal means lacks the presumption of validity afforded in Maryland to lawful comprehensive rezonings.\" And, in paragraph 41, Petitioners alleged that \"an unlawfully adopted Zoning Map w[ould] bring prolonged instability to Baltimore City\" because there is \"no statute of limitations for claiming error in a comprehensive rezoning[.]\" The alleged harms-lack of presumption of validity and instability-are not the types of injury on which taxpayer standing is predicated. These types\n   of alleged harms have no relationship to the expenditure of public funds or taxation in Baltimore City. The comprehensive rezoning ordinances are not spending or tax bills, and there was no well-pled allegation that taxes were, or would be, raised as a result of the enactment of the ordinances, or that the enactment of the ordinances would result in pecuniary loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, we determine that, even had Petitioners satisfied the specific injury part of the special interest requirement, Petitioners failed to establish taxpayer standing because they failed to show a nexus between the potential pecuniary damage and the challenged act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184915\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/442/539/#p576\">\n    442 Md. at 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 113 A.3d at 663. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 579, 113 A.3d at 663, the nexus requirement \"is perhaps the most frequent stumbling block for complainants claiming taxpayer standing\" because, to demonstrate a nexus, \"the taxpayer must be asserting a challenge and seeking a remedy that, if granted, would alleviate the tax burden on that individual and others; otherwise, standing does not exist.\" (Cleaned up). Stated otherwise, \"[t]here must be ... a connection between the alleged[ly] illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   act, the harm caused to the taxpayer, and the potential for the remedy to alleviate the harm incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 579, 113 A.3d at 663 (citation omitted). Here, there is no meaningful connection between the allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts and the harms claimed;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , there is no connection between the comprehensive rezoning and any alleged pecuniary loss or tax increase. Put simply, a sufficient nexus was not alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In the complaint, Petitioners alleged that Respondent engaged in illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts by enacting the Zoning Map without the required notices, publication, and public hearings. Significantly, however,\n   the harms alleged are not related to those allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts. As explained above, Petitioners alleged vague, unspecified harm; and any alleged potential pecuniary loss or tax increase is simply not related to lack of notice, publication, and public hearings. Rather, the potential pecuniary loss or tax increase, as alleged in the complaint, appears to hinge on the increase in taxes that\n   Petitioners posit will occur as a result of challenges to zoning under the new Zoning Map to, among other things, \"respond to or correct errors and allegations of mistake[.]\" As best as we can glean, Petitioners' main claim of increased tax burden appears to be based on the allegation that an invalidly enacted Zoning Map will result in Baltimore City having to raise taxes to pay for the legal defense to litigation that Petitioners predict will arise from an allegedly unlawful Zoning Map. Petitioners' reasoning is circular, and depends on the Zoning Map being, in fact, invalid, and on taxpayers challenging the Zoning Map. In other words, the harms alleged are unrelated to Respondent's allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Additionally, Petitioners failed to seek a remedy that, if granted, would alleviate any alleged tax burden or pecuniary loss that would result if the Zoning Map remains in place. In the complaint, as to the remedy, Petitioners sought declarations that Respondent failed to comply with applicable notice, publication, and public hearing requirements in adopting and enacting the Zoning Map, and that the Zoning Map was null and void. However, it is difficult to comprehend how nullifying the Zoning Map would alleviate an alleged tax burden, which depends on challenges being made to the Zoning Map. In short, we fail to discern not only a nexus between the allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts and the harms allegedly caused to taxpayers, but also any nexus between the requested remedy and its ability to alleviate the alleged harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As a final matter, we note that this case's circumstances are readily distinguishable from cases in which this Court has concluded or observed that plaintiffs had established taxpayer standing to maintain their actions. Significantly, Petitioners failed to allege with any particularity or specificity the expenditure of public funds or an increase in taxes potentially resulting from the allegedly illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   acts. By contrast, in several cases in which this Court concluded or observed that taxpayer standing had been established, the plaintiffs had specifically alleged pecuniary loss or increased taxes. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Boitnott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"169994\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/356/226/#p228\">\n    356 Md. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"169994\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/356/226/#p228\">\n    738 A.2d at 885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged that Baltimore City had expended\n   $ 20 million in development costs prior to the litigation, and we observed that such an allegation was sufficient to show \"potential pecuniary damage by way of [a] tax increase[.]\" In\n   <em>\n    State Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    438 Md. at 577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    92 A.3d at 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the plaintiffs alleged that the project at issue was expected to cost $ 1.5 billion, that a State agency had agreed to contribute up to $ 28 million in taxpayer funds toward the cost of designing and constructing an underground garage for the project, and that issuance of $ 33 million in bonds supported by taxpayer revenues to build the garage had been approved. In that case, we determined that the plaintiffs \"pleaded sufficiently a loss of revenue from the public funds as contributed by them as taxpayers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    92 A.3d at 478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, Petitioners did not allege that Baltimore City has expended funds or that taxes have been increased as a result of the enactment of the comprehensive rezoning ordinances and Zoning Map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   reiterate that Petitioners' allegations of harm are imprecise and, for the most part, undefined, and do not pertain to a type of loss caused by the comprehensive zoning, but rather a type of loss caused by the cost of defending against challenges like the one brought by Petitioners. We observe that this case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   , 442 Md. at 584-85, 113 A.3d at 666-67, in which this Court determined that the plaintiffs had failed to establish taxpayer standing because they failed to allege with any particularity \"that their taxes would be increased or that the illegal action would result in any other form of pecuniary loss.\" (Footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Accordingly, for all the reasons set forth above, we hold that Petitioners did not satisfy the requirements of taxpayer standing, and that the circuit court properly granted the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Judge Harrell, authoring\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   , undertook a close examination of that history in an effort to clarify the doctrine and, in my estimation, succeeded in untangling the web of earlier cases. For this reason, when examining a taxpayer standing issue, I tether my analysis\n   to\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   , eschewing any earlier law that is ambiguous or inconsistent therewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   explained that to establish eligibility to bring a taxpayer suit, the plaintiff must demonstrate that: (a) \"the complainant is a taxpayer,\" and (b) \"the suit is brought, either expressly or implicitly, on behalf of all other taxpayers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second broad requirement is that parties must assert a \"special interest,\" alternatively referred to\n   as the \"special damage\" requirement. Special interest requires a taxpayer to allege: (i) an action by a municipal corporation or public official that is illegal or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   ; and (ii) that the action may injuriously affect the taxpayer's property, meaning that it reasonably may cause an increased burden relating to taxation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    at 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/#p496\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 426-27.
