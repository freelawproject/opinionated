Yet, these suits have the potential to substantially burden the time and treasure of local governments, impeding their efforts to serve the citizenry. Maintaining a balance between these competing forces has sometimes resulted in varied, complicated, and seemingly contradictory\n   legal edicts. But our task, as we again address this topic, is eased by the recent and important decision in\n   <em>\n    State Center, LLC v. Lexington Charles Ltd. Partnership\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    438 Md. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), which did much to untangle the web of taxpayer standing in Maryland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   With\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   as our beacon, we resolve this case in favor of Petitioners, holding that they possess the requisite taxpayer standing to pursue their claim against Baltimore County. This is despite the County's assertion that the \"minor\" harm alleged by the taxpayers will not cause an increase in taxes, especially considering it has not raised the property tax rate in 26 years or the income tax rate in 22 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL OVERVIEW AND PROCEDURAL POSTURE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The present case involves three Baltimore County taxpayers, Anne George, Jody Kesner, and Jody Rosoff (collectively,\n   \"Petitioners\" or \"Taxpayers\"), and their lawsuit against Baltimore County (\"County\") and various County administrators. Petitioners' suit revolves around the County's operation of the Baltimore County Animal Shelter (\"BCAS\") and alleged waste at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December 2014, Taxpayers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions, a declaratory judgment, and a writ of mandamus. Taxpayers alleged they were entitled to bring suit under the taxpayer standing doctrine because they were \"injured by the increased tax burden caused by [the County's] illegal acts, in addition to other pecuniary injuries from having to care for animals that have been harmed by [the County's] acts.\" They also claimed that various County actions resulted in over-expenditure on medical care and staffing and under-collection of fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their complaint, Taxpayers alleged that the County, in its management of BCAS, violated numerous provisions of Baltimore County Code, Article 12. Specifically, Taxpayers stated that the County failed to \"[a]ppoint, train, and qualify\" appropriate individuals to work in animal control, Balt. Cty. Code \u00a7 12-1-103(2); maintain a program to assist volunteers,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-1-103(3); provide appropriate facilities and care for animals,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-1-103(4); attempt to locate owners of stray animals,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 12-1-202(a), 12-3-203(a); hold animals for four business days in a \"humane manner,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 12-3-201(b), 12-3-202(b); put animals up for adoption only if they meet certain standards,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-3-204(d); and maintain holding facilities that meet the minimum standards of Article 12,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12-6-103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers alleged that these regulations are routinely violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The County responded with a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, motion for summary judgment, claiming, among other things, that Taxpayers lacked standing to bring their\n   claim. The County argued that Taxpayers \"failed to adequately allege any illegality or\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   act that reasonably may result in a pecuniary loss or a tax increase to survive [the] motion.\" The motion was accompanied by an affidavit from the Director of Budget and Finance for\n   Baltimore County, Keith Dorsey (\"Dorsey Affidavit\"). The Dorsey Affidavit asserted that Baltimore County property taxes had not been increased in 26 years, the income tax had not been increased in 22 years, and that BCAS constituted such a small fraction of the overall budget \"that no taxes would be increased as a result of operation of the Animal Shelter.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Taxpayers' response characterized the County's motions as merely alleging a failure to show that taxes will increase, not rebutting Taxpayers' charge of \"other pecuniary loss.\" Relying mainly on their complaint, the County's motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, and the Dorsey Affidavit, the response asserted that Taxpayers suffered a pecuniary loss \"from the illegal expenditure of taxpayer funds,\" which included the waste of tax-derived funds \"on excess veterinary care and medications, food and other necessities, euthanasia, and employees.\" Moreover, with fewer animals suitable for adoption, Taxpayers asserted a loss of revenue from adoption and licensing fees. Taxpayers also alleged other pecuniary losses, separate from those involving the waste of tax-derived funds, caused by veterinary expenses they incurred caring for three different animals adopted from BCAS and allegedly mistreated while in the County's care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Significantly, on the same day that Taxpayers filed their response, they also filed a separate motion for preliminary injunction and request for hearing. Attached to the motion were 18 separate affidavits. We summarize the motion and affidavits as follows. After adopting animals from BCAS, numerous individuals discovered that their pets were \"severely underfed.\" There were allegations that animals had been left wet and sitting in pooled water, resulting in rashes, irritation, and bleeding. Several affiants claimed that BCAS routinely failed to provide veterinary care, \"isolate contagious animals from other animals,\" or scan for identification microchips.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   These failures resulted in deteriorating health conditions, unnecessary euthanasia, and animals being held in the shelter without their owner's knowledge. BCAS also failed to sterilize animals before they were offered for adoption. Additionally, affiants claimed that employees and volunteers were improperly trained and inadequately supervised.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing, the judge denied the motion to dismiss and focused on summary judgment. On two occasions, the parties pointed the judge to the complaint and the preliminary injunction motion and attached affidavits for additional details regarding Taxpayers' alleged injury. There was significant debate, and some confusion, regarding the type of harm required to grant taxpayer standing under\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   , a leading taxpayer standing case authored by Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. for this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The debate was twofold. First, there was disagreement regarding the requirement that \"the\n   <strong>\n    taxpayer\n   </strong>\n   must allege ... a special interest distinct from the\n   <strong>\n    general public\n   </strong>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    438 Md. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The dispute centered around the interpretation of the word \"taxpayer\" as a subset of \"general public\"-i.e., whether such a relationship compared specific taxpayers in a political subdivision to taxpayers generally in the same subdivision, or specific taxpayers in the political subdivision to residents generally. Second, the parties disagreed about whether the Dorsey Affidavit, stating that taxes had not and would not be raised, foreclosed Taxpayers' argument that illegal County actions could reasonably be expected to result in \"pecuniary loss or an increase in taxes,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis removed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In a written opinion, the hearing judge concluded that, while Taxpayers pled sufficient\n   facts to withstand the motion to dismiss, the alleged pecuniary injury must be more developed to survive summary judgment. The judge ruled that Taxpayers did not \"specifically allege 'waste of tax dollars' in their Complaint.\" In the court's view, Taxpayers' argument centered entirely around the question of a potential tax increase or decrease. Significantly, the court determined that Taxpayers\n   never rebutted the Dorsey Affidavit, which \"established that any alleged illegal acts have not and will not result in increased taxes or pecuniary loss to [Taxpayers].\" For these reasons, summary judgment was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In an unreported decision, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George v.

The intermediate appellate court held that \"the County's actions were not reasonably likely to result in a pecuniary loss to [Taxpayers] because the County's actions were not likely to affect [their] taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. In dissent, Senior Judge Harrell, sitting by designation, stated that the majority erred when it \"reduce[d] the disjunctive standard of potential pecuniary loss or tax increase into a single category,\" one entirely about taxation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In Maryland, a court shall grant summary judgment only if \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Maryland Rule 2-501(f). \"Whether summary judgment was granted properly is a question of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Lightolier, a Division of Genlyte Thomas Grp.

Taxpayers maintain that a material dispute exists as to whether Baltimore\n   County wasted government funds through the various actions described above. The County, on the other hand, asserts that Taxpayers' response to the motion for summary judgment was insufficient, as their arguments are unsupported and \"speculative at best.\" Taxpayers' response, according to the County, did not contain the admissible evidence required under Md. Rule 2-501 and, therefore, failed to sufficiently rebut the Dorsey Affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Under Maryland Rules, \"[a]ny party may file a written motion for summary judgment of all or part of an action on the ground that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Md.

Thus, we narrowed the universe in which waste results in an adequate claim of pecuniary loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The County claims that Taxpayers inadequately raise the issue of taxpayer waste. We disagree. In their response to the motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, Taxpayers specifically allege that \"the County wastes taxpayer derived funds through numerous specific violations of law ....\" Examples of such waste include excess expenditures on veterinary care, food, and medications; the cost of maintaining animals that, if cared for properly, would be eligible for adoption; lost revenue due to these non-occurrent adoptions; and excessive staffing resulting from an inadequate volunteer program. Taxpayers' complaint also specifically alludes to \"other pecuniary injuries,\" beyond increased taxes, and claims that various County actions result in over-expenditure on medical care\n   and staffing and under-collection of fees-i.e., waste.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The County points us to the line in\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   providing that \"the issue is not what 'type' of harm is sufficient necessarily, but rather a much more forgiving question of whether the type of harm is one that may affect the complainant's taxes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    438 Md. at 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They argue that this demonstrates that a tax increase, or threat of one, is required for taxpayer standing. Our interpretation of\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   differs somewhat, as we view the term \"affect\" in a slightly broader context. To limit the type of harm that can \"affect\" taxes only\n   to harms that actually result in tax increase is to ignore the statement-ten words earlier-that the standard elucidated is a \"much more forgiving\" one. It is sufficient for a given harm to affect taxes by increasing them. But, such an effect is not necessary. We are willing to recognize substantial waste in government operations, even without potential tax increase, as a pecuniary loss sufficient to confer standing. This is because taxpayers, as \"shareholders,\" are reasonably entitled to a sound and careful use of funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This analysis sheds light on why the Circuit Court erred in placing almost total reliance on the Dorsey Affidavit, concluding that it \"established that any alleged illegal acts have not and will not result in increased taxes or pecuniary loss to [Taxpayers].\" The Dorsey Affidavit certainly establishes that Baltimore County has not raised the property tax rate in 26 years and has not increased the income tax rate in 22 years. The affidavit also appears to appropriately contextualize the \"Animal Services Program\" within the broader County budget.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet, it does not address whether the government expenditure was wasteful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Taxpayers' 18 affidavits, on the other hand, relate to the issue of waste. Upon review, the affidavits state the following facts, at least for the purposes of a summary judgment motion. First, affiants attested that multiple animals were not sterilized, and any record of sterilization was inadequate. Multiple affiants also alleged personal knowledge of animals that BCAS never scanned for microchips, and, at least one animal is alleged to have been euthanized as a result of this failure. Many allegations related to generally inadequate veterinary care, food, and water supply. Specifically, water appeared to have been inaccessible to many animals. Many affiants stated that animals recovered or adopted from BCAS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   were ill. Moreover, others observed that BCAS failed to separate sick animals from healthy ones. Numerous individuals observed damp conditions and sitting water on the floors of the shelter. Finally, affiants claim that there were too few qualified staff and an inadequate volunteer program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Consequently, Taxpayers contend, the County has wasted taxpayer funds. They claim that the County's actions \"increase the number of animals that must be housed at BCAS and therefore impose increased maintenance costs.\" Such actions allegedly are wasteful in that they impose expenses on the public purse \"for materials like medications for animals that avoidably fall ill and euthanizing agents for animals that are unnecessarily euthanized.\" Finally, Taxpayers assert, with fewer animals suitable for adoption, the County lost revenue from adoption and licensing\n   fees. These allegations of waste amount to substantial inefficiency and unlawful misuse of public property and treasure, regardless of whether they are likely to cause an increase in taxes. Taxpayers have successfully alleged that, because BCAS's ineffectual management resulted in the provision of more expensive shelter services and decreased revenue, its use of taxpayer funds was wasteful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As discussed previously, Taxpayers must also establish a \"special interest\" in the wasted funds that is \"distinct from the general public.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    438 Md. at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4317883\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/438/451/\">\n    92 A.3d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Surely the \"taxpayer\" to which we referred means any individual who may be liable to replenish the relevant fisc. Conversely, the \"general public\" includes all\n   those not subject to such liability. Hence, \"taxpayer\" means those in the relevant jurisdiction subject to the taxation which is alleged to have been increased or wasted, while the \"general public\" amounts to those who are not subject to such taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To explain, the taxpayers presently at issue are all those liable to replenish the fisc, via taxation, from which BCAS is funded, as this is the money that is allegedly being misused or wasted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, this includes any Baltimore County taxpayer contributing to general fund tax revenues, as BCAS operates using monies supplied from the Baltimore County general fund.

For example, the Majority states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Consequently, [Petitioner]s contend, the County has wasted taxpayer funds. They claim that the County's actions \"increase the number of animals that must be housed at [Baltimore County Animal Shelter] and therefore impose increased maintenance costs.\" Such actions allegedly are wasteful in that they impose expenses on the public purse \"for materials like medications for animals that avoidably fall ill and euthanizing agents for animals that are unnecessarily euthanized.\" Finally, [Petitioner]s assert, with fewer animals suitable for adoption, the County lost revenue from adoption and licensing fees. These allegations of waste\n   amount to substantial inefficiency and unlawful misuse of public property and treasure, regardless of whether they are likely to cause an increase in taxes.

Although the Majority indicates that these allegations of waste may result in pecuniary loss regardless of whether they are likely to increase taxes, what the Majority describes as waste are actually expenses or lost revenue that could potentially result in an increase in taxes.

As I see it, ultimately, the Majority attempts to have it both ways by claiming that potential pecuniary loss and a potential increase in taxes are different types of harm-and I quite agree with the Majority on this point-yet, acknowledging that the waste alleged by Petitioners may result in a potential increase in taxes. The Majority provides no definition of pecuniary loss\n   other than to imply that it may be different than a potential increase in taxes, and proceeds to identify as pecuniary loss circumstances such as \"waste\" that may result in an increase in taxes.

Stated otherwise, alleging a potential increase in taxes is sufficient to satisfy the specific injury prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Here, although the Majority does not rule out the possibility that pecuniary loss could be different than a potential increase in taxes, the situation in this case is that the Majority describes the pecuniary loss alleged by Petitioners by stating: \"We are willing to recognize substantial waste in government operations, even without potential tax increase, as a pecuniary loss sufficient to confer standing. This is because taxpayers, as 'shareholders,' are reasonably entitled to a sound and careful use of funds.\" Maj.

Clearly, the County's sound and careful use of funds is necessary to avoid a potential increase in taxes. Similarly, the Majority states that Petitioners \"allege a nexus between the potential pecuniary damage-waste of government resources within a program funded from a pot that Petitioners are liable to replenish-and the challenged illegal act[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12508447\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/205/928/#p257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12508447\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/205/928/#p257\">\n    at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12508447\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/205/928/#p257\">\n    205 A.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With these observations, the Majority likens pecuniary loss to a potential increase in taxes. The Majority also recounts Petitioners' allegations as including increased maintenance costs, taxpayer expenses for items such as medications, and lost revenue from adoption and licensing fees. These additional costs and lost revenues are circumstances that could theoretically result in an increase in taxes. For these reasons, the Majority is correct that Petitioners have sufficiently established taxpayer standing. To the extent that the majority opinion expressly states that pecuniary loss and an increase in\n   taxes are distinct harms, and does not rule out that pecuniary loss could be different from a potential increase in taxes-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that pecuniary loss is not limited to a potential increase in taxes-I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Significantly, in this case, in the Court of Special Appeals, in a dissenting opinion, Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr., indicated the same-that pecuniary loss and an increase in taxes are distinct types of harm-explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [T]he Majority opinion in its analysis reduces the disjunctive standard of potential pecuniary loss or tax increase into a single category-it is all about taxation. Although I understand that the name of the legal concept at issue is \"taxpayer\" standing, that does not mean (or justify) collapsing the alternative basis of \"potential pecuniary loss\" into the separate category of increased taxation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The cases, albeit without crystal clarity, distinguish that \"potential pecuniary loss\" is indeed a separate category for standing from increased taxation. For example, the Court of Appeals, in\n   <em>\n    James v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2077477\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/281/137/#p142\">\n    281 Md. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20A.2d%20865\">\n    377 A.2d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977), held that alleging a \"decrease in efficiency which would result from the alleged [governmental] ultra vires acts\" was \"sufficient for a taxpayer of the county involved to maintain a suit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2077477\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/281/137/#p142\">\n    281 Md. at 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=377%20A.2d%20865\">\n    377 A.2d at 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Dorsey's (the County's Budget &amp; Finance Director) affidavit, in which the circuit court and the Majority opinion place much stock, made no attempt to counter [Petitioners'] claims of potential or actual pecuniary loss, except as to the unlikelihood of increased or decreased taxes.
