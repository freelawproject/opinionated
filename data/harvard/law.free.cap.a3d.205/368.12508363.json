Specifically, the selection of a location as well as the operation of the checkpoint met constitutional requirements. Accordingly, we are constrained to reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The facts of the case are not in dispute. The Common Pleas Court summarized them as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 31, 2015 at 10:45p.m., Philadelphia Police Officers [Eric] Kornberg and Soto\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   stopped Appellee at a DUI checkpoint located on the 300 block of East Allegheny Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Officer Kornberg noticed that Appellee had bloodshot, glassy eyes and detected the odor of burnt marijuana coming from both Appellee's vehicle and breath. Officer Kornberg stated that Appellee admitted to smoking marijuana [twenty] minutes prior to their interaction. Subsequently, Appellee submitted to a field sobriety test and was placed in custody for suspicion of DUI. Appellee was transported to the Police Detention Unit for a blood test.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Lieutenant James McCarrick is responsible for selecting locations for DUI checkpoints throughout the City of Philadelphia. To determine the location of the DUI checkpoint in question, Lieutenant McCarrick tabulated all DUI-related incidents in Philadelphia over the previous two years and broke those figures down by DUI-related incidents per police district. He found that the 25th\n   Police District, which is 2.3 square miles, was \"the number one district in the city for DUIs,\" but confirmed that there was nothing in the statistics that indicated that the 300 block of East Allegheny Avenue had a higher frequency of DUI incidents than anywhere else in the 25th Police District because the figures are not location-specific.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The Lieutenant explained that a DUI checkpoint operation \"roughly consists of eighteen police officers, two police cruisers and one large processing center [that is] about the size of a fire truck.\" He testified that he would be unable to set up a DUI checkpoint in the \"majority of locations\" within the 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Police District because it is a \"highly congested residential area.\" Lieutenant McCarrick selects DUI-checkpoint locations that are \"large enough and safe enough\" to accommodate such an operation. He noted that the 300 block of East Allegheny Avenue is \"a main vein of travel\" within the district.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Common Pleas Court Opinion, 7/06/16, at 1-2 (record citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellee Mercado filed a motion to suppress the DUI evidence, which the Municipal Court granted, after a hearing. The Commonwealth appealed to the Court of Common Pleas. On April 18, 2016, the Court of Common Pleas denied the Commonwealth's appeal, after a hearing, in effect affirming the grant of suppression. The Commonwealth now appeals to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Our standard of review in addressing a challenge to the grant of a motion to suppress is well-settled.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   When the Commonwealth appeals from a suppression order, we follow a clearly defined standard of review and consider only the evidence from the defendant's witnesses together with the evidence of the prosecution that, when read in the context of the entire record, remains uncontradicted. The suppression court's findings of fact bind an appellate court if the record supports those findings. The suppression court's conclusions of law, however, are not binding on an appellate court, whose duty is to determine if the suppression court properly applied the law to the facts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Our standard of review is restricted to establishing whether the record supports the suppression court's factual findings;\n   <strong>\n    however, we maintain\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    review over the suppression court's legal conclusions\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The possibility of arbitrary roadblocks can be significantly curtailed by the institution of certain safeguards.

Relying on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Garibay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the suppression court and Appellee interpreted the \"specific checkpoint location\" phrase in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Garibay\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to require evidence of arrests and/or accidents at the exact spot of the checkpoint (Block 2700 of North Hermitage Road). Because at the exact location of the checkpoint there were only two DUI arrests reported, the suppression court concluded that the Commonwealth failed to meet the criteria for a constitutionally acceptable DUI checkpoint. The suppression court also noted it could not take into account the other [forty-four] arrests made on North Hermitage Road because those arrests did not occur at the specific location of the checkpoint. Accordingly, the suppression court concluded that the stop was illegal, and suppressed all evidence stemming from the illegal stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    The suppression court and Appellee misconstrue the specificity required in choosing a checkpoint location.\n   </strong>\n   Our cases have held that the police, in setting up a DUI checkpoint, must articulate specifics such as the reason for the location and the number of prior DUIs\n   <strong>\n    in the area of the checkpoint\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.
