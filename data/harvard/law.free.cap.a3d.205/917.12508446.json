While the Supreme Court has recognized that this respect for the sanctity of the home is most often implicated within the context of the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement, in the present appeal we are asked to determine a subsidiary question. Particularly, we must determine, pursuant to the \"direct result\" requirement of Criminal Procedure Article (\"CP\") \u00a7 11-603(a), whether an award of restitution is proper for rekeying household locks where the corresponding keys were stolen during an armed robbery. For the following reasons, we answer this question in the affirmative and therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this juvenile matter, a set of stolen keys to three different households constitute the central issue of restitution. Two juveniles, J.S. and J.Y., were walking home from school in the Largo area of Prince George's County on May 1, 2017. During their commute, the two were approached by a group of juveniles, including respondent G.R. An altercation ensued and the assailants robbed J.S. and J.Y. at knifepoint. The assailants took from J.S. his backpack and a Samsung cell phone. Within his backpack was a key ring holding the three housekeys, two pairs of Jordan sneakers, and a binder. The keys\n   corresponded to the locks of the exterior doors of three homes, the homes of J.S.'s mother, father, and sister.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the course of the robbery, J.Y. attempted to intervene and assist his friend. As a result, G.R. approached J.Y. armed with a boxcutter and demanded several items from him, ultimately taking his iPhone and wallet. Thereafter, police responded to the incident and took statements from J.S. and J.Y. As the responding officers transported J.S. and J.Y. in a police cruiser to the police station to take further statements, J.S. observed three of the alleged assailants walking down the street. The officers pulled over the police\n   cruiser, exited the vehicle, and attempted to apprehend G.R. and the other assailants. When the officers beckoned the group of juveniles, the alleged assailants took flight. Although officers were unable to catch the assailants, during the pursuit G.R. dropped a backpack. Police later determined that the backpack belonged to J.S. At the time the backpack was recovered, the keys were missing but it contained J.Y.'s iPhone and the box cutter used by G.R. in the robbery. Subsequently, police apprehended G.R.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of his apprehension, he possessed several items stolen from J.S. These items included the set of housekeys as well as the second pair of Jordan sneakers stolen from J.S. G.R. was then taken, processed, and detained at Cheltenham Youth Facility (\"Cheltenham\"), a juvenile detention center located in Prince George's County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At this point, the arresting officers apparently failed to properly inventory the keys stolen from J.S. According to the record, the keys were impounded by police and mistakenly held with G.R.'s personal property at Cheltenham. As a result, neither J.S. nor his family members, whose homes the keys corresponded to, were aware that the keys were in police custody. Consequently, J.S.'s family members decided to have the locks of their homes rekeyed, because of the security risk associated with the stolen keys which, unbeknownst to J.S. or his family, were being held at Cheltenham at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 18, 2017, before the Circuit Court for Prince George's County, sitting as a juvenile court, G.R. was charged with robbery, second-degree assault, and openly carrying a dangerous weapon. In response, he pleaded involved to all the charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 16, 2017, the juvenile court held a restitution hearing. The State sought $ 120 in restitution for J.S. as follows: (1) $ 65 dollars to rekey the locks of the three homes of which the keys were stolen; (2) $ 50 for replacing the cellphone; and (3) $ 5 for the binder that was never recovered. During the restitution hearing, defense counsel brought to the State's, the court's, and J.S.'s attention that the keys had been recovered by police and mistakenly held with G.R.'s personal belongings at Cheltenham. Prior to this point, including the period in which the locks were rekeyed, G.R., his family, the court, and the State's Attorney were entirely unaware that the keys had been recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the restitution hearing, counsel for G.R. argued to deny restitution for rekeying the locks under\n   <em>\n    Williams v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    385 Md. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    867 A.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) contending that there was insufficient direct causation to justify the $ 65 restitution. In contrast, the State argued that pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Goff v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583467\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/327/\">\n    387 Md. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583465,583467\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/875/132/\">\n    875 A.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005), the cost of rekeying the locks was a direct result of the robbery and assault. The circuit court agreed with the State and ultimately found G.R. liable for the entire $ 120 in restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Subsequently, on August 15, 2017, G.R. filed a notice of appeal of the juvenile court's decision and appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion filed on May 17, 2018, the intermediate appellate court affirmed in part and vacated in part the juvenile court's order, determining that the court erred in ordering $ 65 in restitution to rekey the three locks. The court determined that the costs of rekeying the locks was not a direct result of the underlying robbery and concluded that \"while there is undeniably a causal link between the theft of the keys and J.S.'s decision to\n   replace his locks, that nexus does not partake of the directness\n   required by the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    In re G.R.\n   </em>\n   , No. 853, Sept.

As the present case centers around an interpretation of the \"direct result\" language of CP \u00a7 11-603, we review the circuit court's restitution order under the de novo standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The statutory framework providing a court's authority to order restitution is Subtitle 6, Title 11 of the Criminal Procedure Article. Particularly, CP \u00a7 11-603 identifies appropriate\n   grounds for restitution and, in pertinent part, provides the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (a) A court may enter a judgment of restitution that orders a defendant or child respondent to make restitution in addition to any other penalty for the commission of a crime or delinquent act, if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) as a direct result of the crime or delinquent act, property of the victim was stolen, damaged, destroyed, converted, or unlawfully obtained, or its value substantially decreased;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) as a direct result of the crime or delinquent act, the victim suffered:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (i) actual medical, dental, hospital, counseling, funeral, or burial expenses or losses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (ii) direct out-of-pocket loss;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (iii) loss of earnings; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (iv) expenses incurred with rehabilitation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b) A victim is presumed to have a right to restitution under subsection (a) of this section if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) the victim or the State requests restitution; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) the court is presented with competent evidence of any item listed in subsection (a) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CP \u00a7 11-603. This case turns on the meaning and scope of the term \"direct result\" in CP \u00a7 11-603(a). However, this term is not defined in the definitions section of CP \u00a7 11-601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State argues that rekeying the locks was a direct result of G.R.'s delinquent\n   act because when the keys were stolen, the sanctity of the home which those locks protected had been jeopardized. As a result, the locks had been damaged or their value \"substantially decreased\" to an extent cognizable under CP \u00a7 11-603(a)(1). The State describes the choice to rekey the locks as a \"reasonable and prudent\" or \"reasonable and proportional\" response to the theft of the keys. In contrast, counsel for G.R. argues that the rekeying of the locks\n   was an intervening act too far removed from the robbery to constitute a direct result. Maryland Crime Victims Resource Center, Inc., pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-511(a)(1), filed an amicus curiae brief that argues similar to the State that the security of the homes the locks belonged to had been diminished when the keys were stolen; thereby, the costs incurred rekeying the locks was a direct result of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In prior cases, this Court has considered the direct result language of CP \u00a7 11-603(a).\n   <em>\n    In re Cody H.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314724,12489349\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/452/169/\">\n    452 Md. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314724,12489349\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/452/169/\">\n    156 A.3d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    385 Md. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    867 A.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583467\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/327/\">\n    387 Md. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583465,583467\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/875/132/\">\n    875 A.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Pete v.

Primarily, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the decision to rekey the locks was an intervening occurrence that\n   directly resulted in any diminishment in value of the locks or out-of-pocket costs associated with rekeying instead of a result from the underlying robbery. Although the court found our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   instructive, the court distinguished it from the instant appeal on the basis that there was no intervening act or occurrence in\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   and the assault and subsequent damage to the shower insert occurred in close temporal proximity. Instead, the intermediate appellate court determined that that this case is analogous with\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    385 Md. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    867 A.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   A majority of G.R.'s arguments are based on the contention that the decision to rekey the locks was an intervening occurrence that directly resulted in the associated costs of rekeying them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Overall, G.R.'s contentions overlook a subtle yet important nuance. Restitution may be ordered where the value of a victim's property is substantially decreased as a direct result of a crime or delinquent act. CP \u00a7 11-603(a)(1). Despite this, G.R. attempts to frame the substantial decrease or damage to the locks as occurring when the locks were rekeyed. However, as the State and Amicus point out, the value of the locks was substantially decreased when the keys were removed from the possession of J.S. during the course of the underlying robbery. For several reasons, we find G.R.'s contentions unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Household locks and the corresponding keys represent a greater ideal that can often be forgotten in the context of the everyday objects we encounter in our daily routines. Primarily, they represent the safety and sanctity of the home by protecting individuals from unwanted intrusions upon their personal privacy and safeguard against property crimes. Essentially,\n   household locks and keys ensure the sanctity and security of the home. When such keys are taken by assailants through an armed robbery, such personal security is drawn\n   into question. A victim can only be left to wonder whether future intrusions on the sanctity of the home may occur as a result of the stolen keys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On this point, the Court of Special Appeals commented,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [G.R.'s] delinquent act of robbing J.S. caused no immediate damage to any of the locks,\n   <strong>\n    even if common sense might suggest that a loss of confidence in home security might flow from the theft of the keys.\n   </strong>\n   Instead, the damage occurred when J.S. incurred costs by choosing to replace the three locks, presumably to restore his family's security.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    In re G.R.\n   </em>\n   , No. 853, Sept.

App. May 17, 2018) (emphasis added). As is evident, the intermediate appellate court declined to engage in an analysis concerning whether the value of the locks had substantially decreased as a direct result of the underlying robbery. Instead, the court focused on determining that the locks were contemporaneously undamaged when the keys were stolen. CP \u00a7 11-603(a)(1) does not require that the locks be damaged. Rather, a substantial decrease in their value is sufficient to justify an award of restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court of Special Appeals erred in its direct result analysis by holding that the decision to rekey the locks was an intervening occurrence. The court distinguished the instant appeal from\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   by stating that \"[h]ere, however, J.S. acted as an intervening agent when he made the decision to replace the locks at his family members' homes following the robbery of his keys.\"\n   <em>\n    In re G.R.\n   </em>\n   , No. 853, Sept.

In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the victim could have negated any damages incurred through the loss of the motorcycles by sufficiently proving ownership of the vehicles because he would have been able to regain them.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    385 Md. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"853619\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/385/50/\">\n    867 A.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If Jones can muster some means of proving ownership and satisfy the Baltimore City authorities, he presumably will be able yet to recover the undamaged vehicles.\") Based on the facts before us, the substantial decrease in the value of the locks could only be remedied by return of the keys without them being copied, or by rekeying the locks. Here, there is neither an indication that the victim was culpable to any degree nor that the cost associated could have been avoided independently of\n   the underlying theft. Therefore, the facts of this case distinguish it from\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The direct result analysis of the current appeal leads us to a different conclusion when compared to\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Pete\n   </em>\n   . In the instant case, the decision to rekey the locks cannot be described as an intervening occurrence to the extent that it would negate a direct causal relationship between G.R.'s armed robbery of J.S. in which the house keys were stolen. This case is more analogous to\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   , the damage to the shower was directly and contemporaneously caused by Mr. Goff's assault on the victim.\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583467\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/387/327/\">\n    387 Md. at 331-332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"583465,583467\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/875/132/\">\n    875 A.2d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite the lapse of time between the robbery and the decision to rekey the locks, rekeying the locks was remedial in a similar fashion to replacing the damaged shower insert in\n   <em>\n    Goff\n   </em>\n   . The rekeying was necessary to repair the substantial decrease in the value of the locks - the compromised security of the homes those locks protected. Accordingly, the decision to rekey the locks was not an intervening event as their substantial decrease in value can be directly attributed to G.R.'s delinquent act of robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   To hold otherwise and require \"immediate damage\" to sustain an order of restitution would largely contravene cases in which we have held that restitution may be ordered for lost wages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cody H.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314724,12489349\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/452/169/\">\n    452 Md. at 189-90, 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314724,12489349\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/452/169/\">\n    156 A.3d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that restitution for lost wages was permissible, where a juvenile's jaw was broken during an assault and he was later unable to participate in a work study program which he had yet to start).

We cannot say\n   that this should be determinative of the outcome. If J.S. was aware that police recovered the keys, before the locks had been rekeyed, our conclusion may differ. In that situation, although copies of the keys could have been made, there would be a more substantial question as to the substantial decrease in value of the locks as a direct result of the theft. However, these are not the facts before us. Neither J.S. nor the State was aware that the keys had been recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Accordingly, we determine that G.R.'s robbery of J.S., in which the house keys were taken, substantially decreased the value of the corresponding locks. This necessitated rekeying the locks to protect the security and sanctity of the homes to which those keys belonged. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We next briefly turn our analysis to consider the State's reasonableness arguments regarding the decision to rekey the locks and its resemblance to a tort causation analysis. In prior cases, we have rejected interpretations of CP \u00a7 11-603(a) that attempted to predicate proximate or mere nexus causation standards as incompatible with the statute's plain language.\n   <em>\n    Pete\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419062\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/47/#p60\">\n    384 Md. at 60-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"419062\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/384/47/#p60\">\n    862 A.2d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consequently, the State's reliance on these cases in an attempt to justify imparting a reasonableness requirement unto the direct result standard of CP \u00a7 11-603(a) is unpersuasive, as both reference a different statutory provision - CP \u00a7 11-615. Accordingly, the reasonableness of a replacement or repair should not be determinative or play a substantial role within this Court's direct result analysis pursuant to CP \u00a7 11-603(a). Nevertheless, the reasonableness of a restitution order is relevant and ensured through CP \u00a7 11-615. Therefore, we additionally conclude that the State's references to reasonableness, within the context of the direct result requirement of CP \u00a7 11-603(a), are misguided as attempting to posit a tort causation standard within the context of direct result analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In summation, we conclude that G.R.'s robbery of J.S., in which several house keys were stolen, directly resulted in a substantial decrease of value of those locks because it brought into question the underlying security of the homes those keys belonged to.
