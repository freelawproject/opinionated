Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 13, 2017, the College filed a charge of unfair labor practices (Charge) against the Union with the Board. Certified Record (C.R.) at 1-3. The College is a \"public employer\" within the meaning of Section 301(1) of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(1). The Union is an \"employe organization\" under Section 301(3) of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(3), representing full-time faculty at the College, among others. The College and the Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which expired on August 31, 2016. The parties continue to operate under the terms of the expired agreement, with the Union-represented faculty continuing to receive full pay and benefits. The parties are currently in negotiations for a successor agreement. C.R. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The College is an open admission institution serving the Philadelphia area and approximately 30,000 students each year, offering associate degrees and academic and proficiency certificates. The College alleged that, in order for it to maintain its accreditation, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education requires the College to engage in a continuous cycle of assessment of student learning outcomes and to use the results to improve and update courses, curricula and teaching methods. These assessments require full-time faculty to examine and review each course and curriculum to ensure that students are meeting established course learning outcomes. The performance of assessment work is a professional responsibility of each full-time faculty member and a required duty under the expired CBA and past practice. C.R. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The College asserted that, beginning in November 2016, and continuing through the present, the Union instructed the full-time faculty \"to refuse to perform mandated assessment work,\" while continuing to accept full pay and benefits. C.R. at 3. The College demanded the Union to \"cease and desist from unlawfully instructing its members to refuse to perform assessment work.\" C.R. at 3. Despite this demand, the Union has continued its unlawful instruction to its members. C.R. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The College charged that the Union and its members are engaging in an \"unlawful partial strike\" in violation of Sections 1201(b)(3) and 1006 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.1201(b)(3), 1101.1006. C.R. at 3. The College claimed that the Union's conduct is creating a clear and present danger to its accreditation and programs. Loss of accreditation would severely impact the College's eligibility for government funding and its students' eligibility for financial assistance. The College requested the Board to order the Union and its members \"to immediately cease and desist from their unlawful conduct and resume performance of the assessment work.\" C.R. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By letter dated February 22, 2017, the Secretary of the Board declined to issue a\n   complaint on the basis that the Board lacked the authority to enjoin a strike under the PERA. The Secretary advised that a public employer's request to enjoin a strike by public employees must be filed in the court of common pleas. C.R. at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 15, 2017, the College filed timely exceptions to the Secretary's refusal to issue a complaint. The College clarified it was \"not asking the Board to enjoin any conduct\" of the Union or its members. C.R. at 6. Rather, the College asserted that it was requesting the Board to \"declare [that] the [Union's] instructions to its members to refuse to perform assessment work\" is unlawful under Sections 1201(b)(3) and 1006 of the PERA. C.R. at 6. The College amended its Charge to reflect it was seeking a declaration and not an injunction. C.R. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 18, 2017, the Board issued a final order dismissing the College's exceptions and affirming the Secretary's decision declining to issue a complaint and dismissing the Charge. C.R. at 13-16. The Board concluded that the legality of a strike must be determined by the courts rather than the Board.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Where an alleged strike has not been enjoined by the courts, it does not constitute a failure to bargain in good faith.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From this decision, the College petitioned for review in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, the College contends that the Board erred by dismissing its exceptions on the basis it lacks the authority under the PERA to issue a complaint under the facts presented. The College asserts that the Board has exclusive authority under Section 1301 of the PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1301, to prevent the Union from engaging in any unfair practice, including refusing to bargain collectively in good faith under Section 1201(b)(3). According to the College, the Union has engaged in bad faith bargaining by instructing its faculty members to refrain from performing mandated assessment work while continuing to receive full pay and benefits, without acknowledging that it is engaged in a partial strike. The Union's conduct allows its members to gain the benefits of striking while avoiding any of the associated burdens, thereby disrupting the PERA's delicate balance of collective bargaining rights and obligations. The College maintains that the Board's failure to act has had real consequences for the College, which must continue to negotiate with the Union in the face of bad faith bargaining tactics.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

In\n   <em>\n    West Chester\n   </em>\n   , the public employer charged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the union violated Section 1201(b)(3) of the PERA by withholding services and engaging in a deliberate slowdown of work activity. The Board exercised jurisdiction because the allegations involved an interpretation of the definition of a strike. The Board found that the\n   \"slowdown\" was undertaken for the purpose of inducing, influencing or coercing the employer to change the employees' obligations of employment. The Board concluded that the action constituted a strike. The Board also determined that the union's unilateral action of refusing to attend faculty meetings prior to the exhaustion of the PERA's impasse procedures disrupted the status quo and constituted a violation of the union's duty to bargain in good faith with the employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As the Board points out,\n   <em>\n    West Chester\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and not controlling here.\n   <em>\n    West Chester\n   </em>\n   involved charges filed by the union and the employer in a consolidated action. The gravamen of the charges alleged acts of refusing to bargain, refusing to sign an agreement, harassment, and other unfair practices expressly prohibited by Section 1201 of the PERA, properly within the Board's exclusive jurisdiction. Although the Board found that the union's actions constituted a partial strike, it did not enjoin the strike. Further, the Board's jurisdiction over the strike was not questioned in\n   <em>\n    West Chester\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    West Chester\n   </em>\n   was not appealed to this Court. Decisions of the Board, while instructive, are not binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    Capital City Lodge No. 12, Fraternal Order of Police v.

Moreover,\n   <em>\n    West Chester\n   </em>\n   is at odds with the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1829801\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/528/170/\">\n    595 A.2d at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Scranton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1345007\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/95/510/#p1363\">\n    505 A.2d at 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which clearly hold that the courts of common pleas maintain jurisdiction over strikes prohibited under Sections 1001, 1002 and 1003 of the PERA, not the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, although the College charged that the Union engaged in an unfair practice under Section 1201(b)(3) of the PERA, C.R. at 1, it did not allege any facts that the Union refused or failed to bargain collectively in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State System\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Ford\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the College alleged that the Union \"instructed its members to refuse to perform mandated assessment work.\" C.R. at 6, 12. The College refers to the faculty's refusal to perform assessment work as a \"partial strike.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1345007\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/95/510/#p1363\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The College also alleged that the faculty members are continuing to receive full compensation despite their refusal to perform mandated work in violation of Section 1006 of the PERA. C.R. at 6, 12. The College and Union are currently engaged in contract negotiations. C.R. at 6, 12. And, the College alleged that the Union's behavior is \"creating a clear and present danger\" to the College's accreditation, which mirrors the language contained in Section 1003 of the PERA. C.R. at 6, 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the College initially requested the Board to order the Union and its members to \"cease and desist,\" C.R. at 6, it later amended the Charge by asking the Board to \"declare\" the Union's instructions unlawful and grant such other relief as appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   C.R. at 12. However, merely changing the nature of the equitable relief sought did not change the nature of the offending conduct - an alleged partial strike. C.R. at 3, 12. Once a public employer seeks relief from a strike as prohibited under Sections 1001, 1002 or 1003 of the PERA, jurisdiction is vested with the courts of common pleas, not the Board. 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.1001, 1101.1002, 1101.1003 ;\n   <em>\n    Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1829801\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/528/170/\">\n    595 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1143 ;\n   <em>\n    City of Scranton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1345007\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/95/510/#p1363\">\n    505 A.2d at 1363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Insofar as the College asks this Court to treat the Union's instructions to its members\n   to refuse to perform assessment work as separate from the members' subsequent refusal to perform assessment work in order to maintain an unfair practice claim with the Board, we decline to do so. The Union's instruction to its members to cease performing assessment work is akin to calling or instituting a strike. As such, it is part and parcel of a \"concerted action\" to strike.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(9). Thus, we conclude that the Union's instruction and its members' actions in accord thereto are inextricably intertwined for purposes of establishing jurisdiction under the PERA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Upon review, the Board assumed the truth of the alleged facts and determined that the College did not allege an unfair labor practice but rather a partial strike that was creating a clear and present danger to the College's accreditation, over which jurisdiction is vested within the courts of common pleas.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.1003. Thus, the Board did not err or abuse its discretion by upholding the Secretary's decision declining to issue a complaint and dismissing the College's charge of unfair practices. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   AND NOW, this\n   <em>\n    13\n    <sup>\n     th\n    </sup>\n   </em>\n   day of\n   <em>\n    March\n   </em>\n   , 2019, the order of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, dated April 18, 2017, is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    This case was argued seriately with\n    <em>\n     Community College of Philadelphia v.
