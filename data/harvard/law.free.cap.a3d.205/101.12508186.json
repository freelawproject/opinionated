On the other hand, should the incompetency\n   lapse, the entitlement to a speedy trial would concomitantly revive, but on a new and inevitably altered calendar. Its latter-day calculation could not escape the shadow of the earlier incapacity. This\n   appeal presents an interesting interplay between the thrust and counterthrust of speedy trial versus no trial at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The appellant, Steven Hogan, was convicted in the Circuit Court for Carroll County by a jury, presided over by Judge Thomas F. Stansfield, of the unlawful possession of a firearm and the unlawful possession of ammunition by a person disqualified from possessing either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On this appeal, the appellant raises, in effect, six contentions. He claims\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   1. that at one point in the proceedings, Judge Fred S. Hecker, over the appellant's objection, erroneously ruled that he was incompetent to stand trial;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   2. that the appellant was denied his right to a speedy trial pursuant to Maryland statutory law and Maryland caselaw per\n   <em>\n    State v. Hicks\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   3. that the appellant was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth Amendment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   4. that Judge J. Barry Hughes erroneously denied the appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of Public Safety Article, Section 5-113 ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   5. that the State was permitted to make an improper rebuttal argument to the jury; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   6. that Judge Stansfield gave an improper instruction to the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As of the critical confrontation of July 14, 2016, between the appellant and members of the Westminster City Police Department, the appellant was a 66-year-old man who had spent most of his adult life in law enforcement. As he told the story at his trial, he spent two and a half years with the Anne Arundel County Police.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I was a cadet, and when I made patrol, then I quit and retired. Or I quit and went with the state because it paid more.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State employment consisted of 23 years as a prison guard.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Q And you were with the Department of Corrections as a prison guard, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A Yeah, at -- Institution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Q How long were you there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   A Twenty-three years. I was the regional tactical commander for the Jessup region.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Q And at one point you got hit in the head, correct, and had injuries to your head?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The State employment was followed by a job in Howard County \"in charge of central booking.\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Q And did that cause your retirement eventually?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A No. No, that didn't. I just got tired of that kind of work and went with Howard County and became in charge of central booking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q And then you retired from Howard County?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A Yes, I did. After 15 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On July 14, 2016, the appellant's conduct was unsettling to the police. From his home at 438 Spalding Court in Westminster, the appellant called 911 and asked the dispatcher to have the police respond to his home, but to do so \"one at a time\" because of his broken front door. He specifically asked the dispatcher to send \"that Darby,\" presumably referring to Westminster\n   Police Sergeant Radcliffe Darby. Sergeant Darby, however, was committed to another assignment and Sergeant Richard Lambert led the team that responded to the appellant's call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While Sergeant Lambert was waiting for the appellant to respond to his knocks on his door, he looked for damage to the door but found none. When, after the third knock, the appellant answered the door, he appeared distraught and was\n   holding what the sergeant believed was a silver cell phone in his right hand. The appellant's first response was to ask if Sergeant Lambert was the \"real police\" and then to ask, \"Where the fuck is Darby?\" The appellant revealed that the purpose of his 911 call was that he wanted his property back and that \"all Darby gave him was this fucking Derringer.\" He was actually turning the object referred to in his hand when Sergeant Lambert realized that the appellant was holding a small gun and not a cell phone. Sergeant Lambert attempted to grab the gun from the appellant's hand, but the appellant said, \"Hell no,\" retreated into the house, and shut the door. Sergeant Lambert called for backup, including the SWAT team and hostage negotiators.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The backup team shortly responded. Sergeant Darby heard of this ongoing encounter over the police radio and also responded to the scene. He had recognized the address mentioned on the radio dispatch as the appellant's. He also knew that the appellant was disqualified from possessing a handgun because of a disqualifying criminal conviction in an assault case for which Sergeant Darby had arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After the backup team arrived, the appellant came out of the house on several occasions. Sergeant Darby, Officer Michael Beaumont, and Officer Martin Runk all testified that the appellant was \"agitated,\" \"hostile,\" and \"argumentative.\" He was continuously \"demanding evidence\" that he wanted returned. Sergeant Darby tried to engage him in conversation and to convince him to come down off the front porch. When the sergeant got within 12 feet of him, he fired his taser and hit the appellant. The appellant, however, was able to pull out one of the probes and to run back inside the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   He shortly reemerged and asked to speak with Sergeant Darby again. When Sergeant Darby convinced him to step off the front porch, Officer Beaumont was able to come from the side of the house and to fire his taser into the appellant's back. As the appellant fell backward, a small Derringer .38 revolver fell out of his pocket. The appellant was arrested. The Derringer was loaded with two rounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A Topsy-Turvy Threshold\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It is not normal for a party in a case to appeal from a ruling on which that party prevailed. The appellant, however, now does just that. On the day first scheduled for the trial of this case, defense counsel, explaining his reasons for grave concern, requested Judge J. Barry Hughes to order a psychiatric examination and then to hold a hearing to determine the competence of the appellant to stand trial. Judge Hughes, over the vociferous protest of the appellant himself, granted the defense request. The appellant, whether he was aware of it or not, had the absolute constitutional right not to be tried if he was incompetent to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    Medina v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/#p449\">\n    505 U.S. 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/#p449\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1481180\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/437/#p449\">\n    120 L.Ed.2d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) ;\n   <em>\n    Drope v. Missouri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    420 U.S. 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    95 S.Ct. 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11643095\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/162/#p171\">\n    43 L.Ed.2d 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At a time when the appellant was alleged to be incompetent and when the subsequent hearing confirmed that the appellant was, indeed, incompetent, defense counsel was, of necessity, authorized to\n   speak for the appellant. Defense counsel made the defense request, and the request was granted. At the subsequent competency hearing, the defense prevailed and the appellant was found to be and to have been incompetent. The appellant was thus protected from going to trial under the handicap of not being competent to stand trial. The appellant was thus protected from himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   There are, to be sure, instances in the law where defendants challenge positions earlier taken by defense counsel. Most of those instances, however, occur in hearings pursuant to the Post-Conviction Procedure Act. In most of those instances, moreover, the defendants claim to have suffered inadequate assistance of counsel. The appellant has made no such claim in this case. In this case, of course, counsel's suggestion of incompetency was confirmed as having been correct. Defense counsel's judgment was thus fully vindicated. The appellant's first contention, challenging a procedure theoretically requested by him (through counsel) and for his unquestioned benefit, is almost nonchalant with no citation of authority for its\n   unusual procedural posture. We will not quibble, however, and will entertain the contention as it is framed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if the appellant were,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , to prevail on this first contention, a very poignant question would then loom as to what conceivable prejudice the appellant has suffered. He now claims that he was competent to stand trial as early as January of 2017. He was ultimately determined to be competent and, thus competent, stood trial 11 months later. He was found guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The only possible adverse impact would have been on his right to a speedy trial. In the multi-factored analysis of a speedy trial claim, both under\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   and under the Sixth Amendment, a pertinent factor would be the reason for the extra period of delay to resolve the incompetency question. To mount such an argument, however, the appellant would have to attribute the reason for that extra delay to the State. He would have to take a delay requested by defense counsel and for the exclusive benefit of the defendant and, with unquestionable ill grace, blame it on the State. Ironically, almost hopelessly lost in the hurly-burly of the criminal trial postponement hearing of January 17, 2017, is the State's official position, from which it never wavered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: No questions, Your Honor. I just want the record to reflect that\n   <em>\n    the State was ready to proceed today.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). In all of the incompetency hullabaloo, the State was simply an innocent and unobtrusive spectator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, as we stand before this strange threshold, the appellant's primary contention about the competency hearing loses all independent or free-standing viability of its own and is reduced to a mere factor in the speedy trial analyses. The oddity, moreover, remains that the appellant is appealing from an aspect of the trial he himself, through counsel, requested; that was granted for his exclusive benefit; and that ultimately turned out to be of significant benefit to him. It would have been outrageous to have tried and convicted an incompetent defendant. Of which, more\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   !\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    The Competency Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The answer to the appellant's first contention is easy. It is the established law of the case that the finding of Judge Fred S. Hecker on May 11, 2017, that the appellant was incompetent to stand trial was erroneous is a moot question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Following the May 11, 2017, hearing on competency and well before the appellant's criminal trial on December 6, 2017, the\n   appellant filed an appeal with this Court raising precisely the same issue he now raises in this contention. His question in that earlier appeal of August 3, 2017, was \"[w]hether the circuit court erred in ruling that [he] was incompetent to stand trial.\" Argument on that earlier single-issue appeal was heard on April 5, 2018, and this Court filed its unpublished opinion on April 27, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Hogan v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 1078, September Term, 2017, filed on April 27, 2018. We are chagrined that, in the current case, the appellant made no mention of or remote allusion to that earlier appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This Court there held that, because of the later December 5, 2017, ruling that the appellant was competent, the earlier appeal from an incompetency filing was moot. We held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   In this case, Hogan appealed the circuit court's May 11, 2017 finding that he was incompetent to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    When the circuit court found Hogan competent to stand trial on December 5, 2017, it ended the controversy that was the subject of this appeal\n   </em>\n   , such that\n   <em>\n    this Court can no longer fashion an appropriate remedy.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cottman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5262965\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/395/729/#p744\">\n    395 Md. 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5262965\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/395/729/#p744\">\n    912 A.2d 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006) (a case is moot when \"there is no longer any existing controversy between the parties\" and the appellate court \"can no longer fashion an effective remedy\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The only impact that the competency evaluation and the respective findings of first incompetency and then competency could have had on the present appeal would be as a factor in the speedy trial analyses. In that earlier appeal, Judge Stuart Berger, writing for the Court, observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   At oral argument, Hogan's\n   <em>\n    counsel contended that this appeal is not moot because the circuit court violated his right to a speedy trial by ruling that Hogan was incompetent\n   </em>\n   , which prolonged his case beyond 180 days. Indeed, we have scoured the appellant's brief, and\n   <em>\n    we find just one sentence alleging an infringement of his right to a speedy trial.\n   </em>\n   Hogan has failed to provide a modicum of factual or legal support for his claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van Meter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2318955\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/30/406/#p408\">\n    30 Md.

Further, we need not decide this issue at this time because there is no record for which we could decide this issue.\n   <em>\n    The record is absent of any reference to a motion to dismiss filed in the circuit court\n   </em>\n   and any indication whether the circuit court made a good cause finding to extend the case beyond 180 days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   In our view,\n   <em>\n    the far preferable course is to permit Hogan to raise the speedy trial issue in the appeal from his convictions\n   </em>\n   , to the extent he has preserved that issue. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    to the extent Hogan asserts that his right to a speedy trial was violated\n   </em>\n   because of an erroneous competency finding, if preserved,\n   <em>\n    he can make that argument in the direct appeal of his convictions.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   (Emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The appellant does now raise speedy trial issues and, accordingly, we shall address them. The contention concerning the incompetency finding of May 11, 2017, however, is, as we have already held, dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v.

Accordingly, the 180-day clock began to tick on that day and the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   deadline became February 7, 2017. The trial date was set for January 17, 2017, and all parties were in\n   court ready for trial on that morning. It was at the appearance before Judge Hughes that morning that the issue of the appellant's suspected incompetence first arose. Defense counsel first raised the subject:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   THE COURT: Good morning, sir. All right. This matter was set for trial today. [Defense counsel].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.

Nor need we entertain protestations about the absence of a personal waiver of a right to a speedy trial by one who was at the time certifiably incompetent to waive that or any other right.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In such a state of impairment, a client enjoys the services of counsel to act on his behalf\n   and the two will necessarily be treated as an indivisible entity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The 180-Day Rule In This Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In this case, the 180-day clock of\n   <em>\n    State v. Hicks\n   </em>\n   began to tick on August 11, 2016. On the scheduled trial date of January 17, 2017, the day on which Judge Hughes granted defense counsel's request for a competency hearing, the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   calendar was at Day 159. There were still 21 days to go before the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   deadline of February 7, 2017. As we have already held, \"good cause\" existed for ordering the competency evaluation, the order that necessarily carried the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   trial date beyond the 180-day deadline. All parties agree that as of\n   January 11, 2017, there had been no even arguable\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Beyond that date, a monolithic, overriding, and absolutely neutral circumstance took complete control of the entire trial scheduling process. Neither the court nor the defense nor the State could countermand the imperative that the appellant could not be tried unless and until the appellant was judicially determined to be competent to stand trial. Neutral circumstances, beyond the control of any (or, indeed, all) of the parties, were in total control of the scheduling process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   The full range of psychiatric evaluations and studies of the appellant were duly conducted. Judge Hughes was informed on April 5, 2017, that the competency evaluation had been made. Accordingly, a full competency hearing was scheduled for May 11, 2017, and was conducted on that day before Judge Hecker. The determination of that hearing, which we have heretofore affirmed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , was that the appellant was, indeed, incompetent to stand trial. That determination\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   negates any claims of the appellant that his trial could have been somehow rescheduled to a time before May 11, 2017. Such a rescheduling would have been during a period of incompetency. Looking forward from May 11, 2017, it was equally obvious that no trial date could be scheduled for the appellant unless and until he was judicially determined to be competent to stand trial, whether or not such a change in the appellant's circumstances would take weeks or months or years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   During the summer of 2017, Dr. Hightower reached the conclusion, apparently because the appellant was on his prescribed medications, that the appellant was then competent to stand trial. Her report to that effect was received by the court on September 25, 2017. A competency hearing was promptly scheduled for October 3, 2017. That hearing date, however, was postponed at the request of defense counsel because of a scheduling conflict involving counsel. On October 10, 2017, there was another postponement of the competency hearing, apparently because of a scheduling conflict involving the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The rescheduled hearing on the appellant's competency status was set for December 5, 2017. At the rescheduled competency hearing of December 5, 2017, Judge Hughes found him to be competent to stand trial. The appellant's rescheduled trial began the following morning, December 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Once a competency evaluation of the appellant was ordered on January 17, 2017, it was obvious that a criminal trial of the appellant could not be held until the court determined that the appellant was competent to stand trial. That determination was made on December 5, 2017. The appellant attempts to ensnare us, nonetheless, in the internal chronology of the evaluation process. That is uncharted territory for a\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   is focused on the scheduling, postponing, and rescheduling of criminal trials. That is classic grist for the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   mill.\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   is not concerned with the passage of time that may transpire between the various stages in the evaluation process. A\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   analysis is not focused, e.g., on how long it takes to get a defendant into a mental health facility; with how long it may take to get a defendant transferred from one facility to another; with how many psychiatrists, psychologists, and other personnel are available and their respective workloads; with how long it may take to get test results; or how long it may take for a mental health facility to communicate its findings to the court. The\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   analysis, deferred for the period of a competency evaluation, resumes when the defendant is back in the criminal justice system, to wit, eligible to be scheduled for a criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Loath as we are to conflate the scheduling of a competency hearing with the scheduling of a criminal trial, we will indulge the appellant in one regard. Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   scrutiny was again operational when the court received Dr. Hightower's report on September 25, 2017, that the appellant was competent to stand trial, the State would seem to be chargeable for the delay of one month and 26 days between October 10, 2017, and December 5, 2017. Such a modest delay, however, was clearly not an \"inordinate delay\" within the\n   contemplation of\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   . The 180-Day Rule was not violated in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    Sixth Amendment Speedy Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Distinction Between 180-Day Rule And Constitutional Right\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Although the appellant merged his claims pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   Rule and pursuant to the Sixth Amendment into a single contention, we have separated them into two contentions because of the widely divergent analyses they entail. Both, to be sure, are concerned with the trial scheduling calendar. Essentially beyond that point, however, they veer off in very different directions. A\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   claim is not a junior varsity speedy trial claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Sixth Amendment right is constitutional. The\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   Rule is only statutory. It can be changed at any time at the whim of the Legislature or of the Court of Appeals (with an assist from the Rules Committee).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The guarantee of a speedy trial is a constitutional right vested in a criminal defendant personally.

The length of delay is no longer \"presumptively prejudicial.\" That threshold has been passed. It is, moreover, now largely controlled by the other factors, most especially the reason for the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Reason For The Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   As\n   <em>\n    Ratchford\n   </em>\n   suggests, the length of delay in this case, as it bears on the ultimate speedy trial merits, is massively, indeed, critically, affected by the reason for the delay. In this case, there was only one delay of any constitutional significance. The reason for that delay is dispositive of the entire speedy trial claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   As of the originally scheduled trial date of January 17, 2017, there had been no delay problem of any sort. The trial was still well within the\n   <em>\n    Hicks\n   </em>\n   Rule (Day 159 on the 180-Day\n   calendar). The passage of time to that point was uncontestedly for the neutral reason of routine trial scheduling. No one was complaining about the scheduling in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   It was on January 17, 2017, at the express and exclusive request of defense counsel that Judge Hughes postponed the trial and ordered that the appellant be examined to determine if he was competent to stand trial. Defense counsel's request in that regard was fully vindicated when the ensuing competency examination showed that the appellant was indeed incompetent to stand trial. From that point forward, a trial date could not, as a matter of law, be rescheduled unless and until the appellant was legally adjudicated to be competent to stand trial. That did not happen until December 5, 2017. As a legal matter, of course, the appellant was competent to stand trial not when his psychiatrist said so but only when the trial judge declared that to be so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The delay for the entire incompetency saga, measured from January 17, 2017, was one of 10 months and 19 days. Even if,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , we should opt to charge the State with responsibility for the delay in scheduling the final competency hearing from October 10, 2017, to December 5, 2017, that subtraction of one month and 26 days from the overall incompetency delay would be negligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   That massive delay, moreover, is chargeable exclusively to the defense. It was requested by defense counsel. It was exclusively for the benefit of the defendant. Its result verified the fact that it benefitted the defendant by preventing the trial of one who was incompetent to stand trial. Judge Hughes never,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , suggested a competency hearing. The State, of course, stood unobtrusively by and never requested anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   The appellant, to be sure, vigorously protested his counsel's request. This issue we have already fully analyzed and decided\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , under the subheading of \"E. When\n   Defendant And Defense Counsel Disagree.\" It would be self-evidently incongruous if the defense could both request a delay and then\n   claim reversible error on the basis of the granting of that requested delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   The entire incompetency episode, from start to finish, was attributable to the defense side of the trial table. The overarching reason for the delay, moreover, was not a matter of defense trial tactics. It was, far more seriously, a matter actually controlled by the appellant's medical and mental condition. This reason for the delay resolves the entire speedy trial issue. The other factors are inconsequential. The appellant was not denied a constitutionally guaranteed speedy trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    A Ghost Contention: The Second Amendment's Right To Bear Arms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The appellant's fourth contention first appeared before us as a ghost contention. We were initially nonplussed as to whether it was sufficiently preserved to permit the appellant even to argue it on appeal. In appellate brief, the appellant, out of the blue, launched into an abstract discussion asserting that Maryland Code, Public Safety Article, Sect. 5-133, pursuant to which the appellant was convicted of the wrongful possession of a firearm, has been rendered unconstitutional by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Nowhere in the trial transcript was there any even remote reference to this unconstitutionality argument. The appellant did not cite any such reference in the transcript. Nor did he mention that he ever filed a possible pre-trial motion in this regard. There was no mention that the State was ever served with such a motion or that it ever responded to such a motion. There was no mention that such a motion was ever referred to a judge; no mention that a hearing was ever held on the motion; and no mention as to what disposition was ever made. The abstract Second Amendment argument simply appeared out of the blue in the middle of the appellant's brief. We could as readily have been asked to debate the applicability to the appellant's case of the United Nations Charter or of the Magna Charta. As it first appeared, the contention was completely adrift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The State, however, has come to the rescue and has seen that the record has been supplemented.

In the case at bar, the applicable statutory prohibition, PS 5-133, does prohibit the possession of a firearm whether it be within or outside of one's home. The Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , however, would still carry over to the constitutionality of PS 5-133.

Maryland Public Safety Code Annotated \u00a7 5-133 is exactly the type of restrictive statute that is permitted under the Supreme Court holdings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   The Motion To Dismiss was submitted to Judge Hughes, who signed an order on April 21, 2017, denying it. There is no indication that there was any hearing on the Motion To\n   Dismiss nor that legal memoranda were submitted by counsel. Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that this heretofore incorporeal apparition now looms palpably before us like the Spirit of Christmas Present,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   we hold that Judge Hughes was not in error in denying the Motion To Dismiss. This conviction will not imperil the \"well regulated Militia.\" U.S. Const. Amend. II.\n   The very oddity of this contention provokes a sense of bafflement as to whether the contention was truly substantive or only spectral. Was what appeared to be before us really before us? The entire life span of this phase of the litigation was no more than a flash, from April 4 through April 21 of 2017. It was a flash, moreover, that happened off stage, apparently without a live word having been uttered by anyone in a courtroom. But for eleventh-hour heroics by the State to correct the record, this phase of the litigation would have suffered (or enjoyed) a premature burial. It would have been gone, and no one would have known that it ever happened. Theoretically, there would appear to be no reason why a dozen such abstract issues could not arise, reaching into a dozen far-flung corners of constitutional and non-constitutional law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   It is hard, however, to conceptualize as\n   <strong>\n    a phase of the appellant's trial\n   </strong>\n   a self-contained sub-litigation that occurs, from start to finish, during the time when the appellant himself was committed to a mental health hospital and was under a court-ordered evaluation to determine whether he was incompetent to stand trial. Could a significant stage of the appellant's trial take place before it had been determined that the appellant was competent to stand trial? Did not the appellant have a right to be there? Did not the appellant have a right both to be there and to be there competently? To what extent may an appellant's non-trial (and/or period of non-triability) serve, therefore, as a platform for deciding (and then appealing) a variety of issues not directly involved with the appellant's competency status? The appellant has offered us no guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    Suppose The Allegedly \"Plain Error\" Is Not Plain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   The secondary charge on which the appellant was convicted in this case was the unlawful possession of ammunition by one forbidden to possess it. The ammunition possessed by the appellant consisted of two bullets, both of which were loaded into the unlawfully possessed handgun. Two bullets might seem trivial, but in rebuttal argument to the jury, the State was making the point that two bullets (or even one bullet) would be enough to justify a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-234\">\n   Regarding the bullets, there are two bullets. There are two bullets in the evidence and there are two bullets that were in the gun. And that is all you need is two bullets.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   Were there more? You have a piece of paper in the evidence that the Defendant referred to as an inventory. That inventory was of the living room and the kitchen. It wasn't of the rest of the house. It was just an inventory of what was in the living room and kitchen. And that is in evidence. And there is no bullets on there, there were no other bullets in the living room and the kitchen. But it doesn't matter because we only needed those two anyway. We only needed one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   At that point, no one made any comment and the Assistant State's Attorney went on uninterruptedly with her rebuttal argument. Post-trial, however, in the course of a hearing on the appellant's Motion For A New Trial, the appellant suddenly realized that in that segment of rebuttal argument there lurked a clear and plain instance of prosecutorial misconduct in which the Assistant State's Attorney had \"flagrantly lied\" to the jury about the state of the evidence. \"Flagrantly lied.\" That's a harsh charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Although it might initially appear that the appellant had failed to make a timely objection and had thereby failed to preserve this objection for appellate review,\n   the appellant now claims that raising the objection in the course of the hearing on the Motion For A New Trial sufficed for preservation purposes. Cases dealing with the preservation requirement, on the other hand, make it incontrovertibly clear\n   that a primary function of the timely objection requirement is to permit the trial judge to correct an obvious error while the jury is still in the box before a verdict has been rendered. That was self-evidently no longer possible at a hearing on a post-trial motion. The appellant's objection to the prosecutor's rebuttal argument has self-evidently not been preserved for appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   In the alternative, the appellant asks that we take notice of plain error. In the exercise of our discretion, we decline to do so. That is all that need be said on the subject. The appellant's argument on the subject is so strained, however, that we cannot refrain from making at least brief passing comment on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   We are cognizant of the concept of an appellate court sometimes taking notice of unpreserved \"plain error.\" Does that concept embrace, however, the taking notice of unpreserved \"arcane error?\" In\n   <em>\n    Wieland v.

The possibility of noticing \"plain error\" does not exist in order to reach out and to solve involved and intricate legal problems. It exists to correct glaring miscarriages of justice. Those miscarriages are \"plain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   As we look for the needle of \"plain error\" in the haystack of the rebuttal argument, we are sorely challenged. The search is convolutedly subtle and its theory is enigmatic. The existence of an alleged error depends upon a defense thesis that is by no means solid. The thesis is that the appellant was not guilty of the unlawful possession of a firearm if he was, essentially until the last minute, oblivious to the fact that he possessed the firearm. His, however, was a crime of simple possession, and he plays a bit fast and loose with the\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of such a crime. We will discuss this more fully\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   in dealing with the appellant's final contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   A crime of simple possession does not require any specific intent nor does it require any special scienter.\n   <em>\n    McNeal v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3989556\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/200/510/#p524\">\n    200 Md.

It is essentially a\n   <em>\n    malum prohi\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    bitum\n   </em>\n   , if not quite. Simple possession is a general intent crime. The appellant need only be aware that he is then in possession of the forbidden item. This appellant was clearly so aware as he waved the gun about in the presence of Sergeant Lambert. He knew it as he said, \"Hell, no,\" and retreated into his house, and slammed the door. That is all that is required. There is no requirement that he was necessarily aware of his possession of the firearm an hour earlier or a week earlier. The defense belief in \"plain error,\" however, depends upon this defense thesis that the appellant was innocent of unlawful possession if he was unaware of the presence of the firearm in his house on the days and weeks preceding the confrontation of July 14, 2016.\n   The defense thesis of innocence then went one step further and conjectured that an earlier awareness of the very presence of the gun would have suggested the appellant's at least occasional use of the gun. The ensuing conjecture is that if the appellant knew of the existence of the gun and at least periodically used the gun, there would be circumstantial evidence of such use. The circumstantial evidence supporting or negating such awareness and use would be the tell-tale presence or absence of ammunition about the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   The appellant's suggestion of \"plain error\" then turns to the presence or absence of such circumstantial evidence. After the appellant was arrested on July 14, 2016, the police obtained a search warrant and searched his house. The inventory of items seized, a copy of which was given to the appellant, listed an item of evidence seized from the living room and an item of evidence seized from the kitchen. Neither of those items were bullets. The only bullets seized were the two bullets found in the handgun itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Clearly, what the defense wanted to do was to make the argument that if no bullets were found anywhere in the house, that would be circumstantial evidence supporting the inference that the appellant had no awareness of the presence of the firearm. The State, for its part, never gainsaid that argument. It never said, or even suggested, that bullets had been found somewhere in the house other than in the kitchen and living room. By pointing out that the inventory only spoke with respect to the living room and the kitchen, however, the State weakened the argument that the defense wanted to make. The inventory did not oppose the defense argument. It simply did not speak with respect to other rooms in the house one way or the other. The other rooms in the house may indeed have been as free of bullets as were the living room and the kitchen. That was almost certainly the case or the inventory would have said so. What the inventory failed to do, the appellant now complains, was affirmatively to support the defense argument based on circumstantial evidence. With respect to inventories, it is interesting to note that Maryland Rule 4-601, dealing with Search Warrants says, in subsection (e)(1):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   (1) An officer shall make, verify, and sign\n   <em>\n    a written inventory of all property seized\n   </em>\n   under a search warrant, including a general description of electronically stored information received pursuant to the warrant in electronic, disk, paper, or other form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). What the inventory must list, as was properly done in this case, is the property that was actually seized, not the rooms that were searched. To describe the scope of the search is not the function of an inventory list.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   In any event, we find it inconceivable that so strained and attenuated an allegation of error could ever be described as\n   \"plain.\" It takes pages even to describe it. It is more than arcane; it is almost invisible. It was hardly an extraordinary miscarriage of justice. That fortunately is beside the point, however, for our basic decision, announced before engaging in this rambling dicta, remains that, in our discretion, we decline to notice this unpreserved objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   <strong>\n    The\n    <em>\n     Mens Rea\n    </em>\n    Of Simple Possession\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   The appellant's final contention is that Judge Stansfield erroneously refused to give his requested instruction to the jury to the effect that the appellant could not be convicted of illegally possessing a firearm if his possession was designed solely to hand over the firearm to the police in order to comply with the law.
