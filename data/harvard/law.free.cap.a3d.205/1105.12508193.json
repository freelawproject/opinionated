The primary issue on appeal is whether the plaintiff and her husband were \"tenants\" entitled to remedies under that chapter. The trial court concluded that they were not \"tenants,\" and, thus, were not entitled to RSA chapter 540-A remedies. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We briefly recite the facts necessary to decide this appeal. The defendant is the general manager of the Homewood Suites by Hilton (Homewood) hotel in Nashua. Homewood is a branded product of Hilton\n   Worldwide, Inc. and is an all-suite residential-style hotel. Individuals may stay at Homewood for durations of any length, including extended stays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In November 2015, the plaintiff and her husband began residing at Homewood. According to the plaintiff, she and her husband shared a full-size apartment with a fully-equipped kitchen, a separate bedroom, separate bathroom, spacious living room, and a dining area. They were charged $ 84 per night plus tax for the unit. Their stay was originally intended to last approximately one year. The plaintiff asserts that their stay was extended until May 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the plaintiff, on or about January 4, 2017, the defendant informed her by e-mail that her stay would not be extended past January 6. The plaintiff contends that the deadline was later extended to January 10. She asserts that she and her husband were told that if they did not leave on January 10, the police would be called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiff brought the instant petition under RSA chapter 540-A on January 9, requesting, in addition to statutory damages, that the trial court enjoin the defendant from ejecting her and her husband from their residential unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's action, to which she objected. Both parties appended to their pleadings documentary evidence to support their assertions. At a January 18 hearing, the parties agreed that the dispositive issue before the court was whether the plaintiff and her husband were \"tenants\" entitled to remedies under RSA chapter 540-A. They further agreed that the court could decide the matter based upon the parties' pleadings. The trial court found in favor of the defendant, concluding that the plaintiff and her husband were not \"tenants\" entitled to RSA chapter 540-A remedies. The plaintiff unsuccessfully moved for reconsideration, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Resolving the plaintiff's appeal requires that we engage in statutory interpretation.

Accordingly, when determining who is a \"tenant\" for the purposes of RSA chapter 540-A, we cannot confine our review to the definition in that chapter, but must examine the definition in RSA chapter 540 as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   RSA 540:1-a, IV provides that \"[t]he term 'tenant' or 'tenancy' shall not include occupants or occupancy\" in certain places and that the provisions of RSA chapter 540 shall not apply to those places. RSA 540:1-a, IV (Supp. 2018). Such places include \"[r]ooms in hotels, motels, inns, tourist homes and other dwellings rented for recreational or vacation use.\" RSA 540:1-a, IV(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court found that Homewood \"conducts its daily business comparable to any major hotel-branded organization,\" including such things as having a front desk at which guests can check in and providing fully-furnished rooms, linens and towels, daily room cleaning, onsite maintenance, and onsite security personnel. In light of those factual findings, which the plaintiff does not challenge and the record supports, we agree with the trial court that, because the plaintiff and her husband lived in a residential unit in a hotel, they were not \"tenants\" entitled to remedies under RSA chapter 540-A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In arguing for a contrary result, the plaintiff asserts that, although Homewood has \"characteristics of a hotel,\" it is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a hotel because it does not \"act and behave like a traditional hotel in every way.\" She contends that Homewood is, instead, a \"hybrid\" because its guests include travelers who stay for short durations and those who stay for extended durations. According to the plaintiff, RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) exempts only \"traditional\" hotels from the purview of RSA chapter 540. The plain meaning of the statutory language does not support these arguments. RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) exempts from the terms \"tenant\" and \"tenancy\" occupants and occupancy in\n   rooms in\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   hotels, not just those that the plaintiff terms \"traditional\" hotels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Alternatively, the plaintiff contends that in determining whether her occupancy constituted a \"tenancy,\" even in a facility that RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) specifically excludes from that term, we must examine \"the totality of the circumstances.\" Here, she asserts, the totality of the circumstances supports a determination that she and her husband were \"tenants,\" notwithstanding the fact that they lived in a hotel. She argues, in effect, that RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) does not establish \"a categorical exemption for all dwelling units described therein.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plain language of RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) does not allow for the case-by-case determination the plaintiff urges us to conduct. RSA 540:1-a, IV provides that \"[t]he term 'tenant' or 'tenancy'\n   <em>\n    shall not include\n   </em>\n   occupants or occupancy\" in \"[r]ooms in hotels.\" (Emphasis added.) \"The use of the word 'shall' indicates a legislative mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    Appeal of Lake Sunapee Protective Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049407\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/165/119/#p127\">\n    165 N.H. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 127,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%20213\">\n    72 A.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff next argues that, even if RSA 540:1-a, IV(b)\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   establish \"a categorical exemption for all dwelling units described therein, the exemption does not apply\" here because she and her husband did not rent their \"unit at Homewood for recreational or vacation use.\" She contends that the phrase \"rented for recreational or vacation use\" modifies\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the terms in RSA 540:1-a, IV(b). In other words, she asserts that the phrase \"rented for recreational or vacation use\" modifies the specific dwellings listed (\"[r]ooms in hotels, motels, inns, tourist homes\"), as well as the phrase \"other dwellings.\" RSA 540:1-a, IV(b). Thus, she argues, RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) exempts from \"[t]he term 'tenant' or 'tenancy' \" occupants or occupancy in \"[r]ooms in hotels, motels, inns, tourist homes\"\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   when they are \"rented for recreational or vacation use.\" She asserts that when, as in this case, such rooms are rented for residential use, the terms \"tenant\" and \"tenancy,\" and thus the procedures under RSA chapter 540, apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We think that the more common-sense interpretation of RSA 540:1-a, IV(b) is that \"rented for recreational or vacation use\" modifies only the phrase \"other dwellings\" and does not modify the specific dwelling units enumerated in the statute (\"[r]ooms in hotels, motels, inns, tourist homes\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merrill v.

City of Laconia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6787758\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/168/52/#p57\">\n    168 N.H. 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20146\">\n    120 A.3d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). To the extent that the plaintiff relies upon decisions in other jurisdictions, we find those decisions unpersuasive given that our legislature, by enacting RSA 540:1-a, IV, has determined that occupants of hotel rooms are not \"tenants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff next points to the process for ejecting hotel guests under RSA chapter 353, arguing that ejectment was not available to Homewood in this case because she and her husband rented their unit for more than a year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA ch. 353 (2009). She contends that because New Hampshire law only provides two avenues for removing an occupant from rented residential premises,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one process under RSA chapter 540 and another under RSA chapter 353, then if RSA chapter 353 does not apply, RSA chapter 540 does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We disagree with the premise of the plaintiff's argument - that ejectment under RSA chapter 353 was not available to Homewood because of the duration of the rental at issue. RSA 353:3-c allows a hotel keeper to remove a guest from a \"rental unit\" under certain circumstances \"by notifying such guest that the establishment no longer desires to entertain him or her and requesting that the guest immediately leave.\" RSA 353:3-c. For the purposes of RSA 353:3-c, \"the term 'rental unit' shall include residential property rented for one month or less.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20146\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20146\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The plaintiff contends that because the term \"rental unit\" includes property rented for one month or less, it necessarily\n   <em>\n    excludes\n   </em>\n   property rented for one month or more. However, \"[t]he term 'includes' in a statutory definition does not necessarily exclude things not specified,\" and \"ordinarily is a term of enlargement rather than limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Fassberg Construction Co. v.

Thus, contrary\n   to the plaintiff's assertions, the mere fact that the term \"rental unit\" includes units rented for one month or less does not require the conclusion that it cannot also include units rented for longer durations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The plaintiff next relies upon RSA 78-A:3, VII, a provision of the New Hampshire Meals and Rooms Tax Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA ch. 78-A (2012 &amp; Supp. 2018). RSA 78-A:6, I, imposes a \"tax of 9 percent of the rent\" upon \"each occupancy.\" RSA 78-A:6, I (2012). However, for the purposes of the meals and rooms tax law, the term \"occupancy\" does not include occupancy by a \"permanent resident.\" RSA 78-A:3, VI(b)(1) (2012). RSA 78-A:3, VII defines a \"permanent resident\" of a hotel as \"any occupant who has occupied any room in a hotel for at least 185 consecutive days.\" RSA 78-A:3, VII (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The plaintiff argues that the definition of \"permanent resident\" for the purposes of the meals and rooms tax law indicates legislative \"recognition that at some point in time an occupant of a room in a hotel sheds his or her status as a guest and becomes a permanent resident, a status that is entirely consistent with 'tenant.' \" However, there is no language in RSA chapter 78-A demonstrating a legislative intent to equate the definition of \"permanent resident\" in RSA 78-A:3, VII with the definition of \"tenant\" for the purposes of either RSA chapter 540 or RSA chapter 540-A. RSA chapter 78-A is not part of the statutory scheme governing the relations between landlords and tenants, and we decline to add language equating the definition of \"permanent resident\" in RSA 78-A:3, VII with the definition of \"tenant\" in RSA chapters 540 and 540-A that the legislature did not see fit to include.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Conduent\n   </em>\n   , 171 N.H. at 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503436\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/942/\">\n    196 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In light of our decision upholding the trial court's determination that the plaintiff and her husband were not tenants entitled to remedies under RSA chapter 540-A as a matter of law, we decline to address the plaintiff's remaining arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   LYNN, C.J., and BASSETT and DONOVAN, JJ., concurred.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
