We address both appeals in this opinion. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    State v. McCray\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 16, 2017, Antoine McCray was charged in complaint-warrant W-2017-1274-2004 with second-degree robbery, during which force was used and bodily injury inflicted, in violation of N.J.S.A. 2C:15-1(a)(1). The State thereafter filed a motion for his pretrial detention pursuant to the CJRA. After conducting a hearing, the court denied the State's motion and entered an order dated April 27, 2017, which stated that McCray was released pretrial subject to certain non-monetary conditions. One of the\n   conditions was that defendant \"[s]hall not commit any offense during the period of release.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 29, 2017, McCray was charged in complaint-warrant W-2017-0904-1205 with the disorderly persons offense of theft by unlawful taking, N.J.S.A. 2C:20-3(a) ; fourth-degree credit card theft, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-6(c)(1) ; third-degree identity theft, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-17(a)(1) ; and fourth-degree forgery, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-1(a)(2). He also was charged in complaint-summons S-2017-1155-1205 with fourth-degree contempt of court under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a), for violating the court's April 27, 2017 pretrial release order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 16, 2017, a grand jury returned Indictment No. 17-11-1345, which charged McCray with conspiracy to use a credit card fraudulently, contrary to N.J.S.A. 2C:5-2(a) and N.J.S.A. 2C:21-6(h), and other offenses. The grand jury also returned Indictment No. 17-11-1346, charging McCray with contempt of court under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) for violating the pretrial release order. The indictments alleged that he committed the offenses on or about August 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 7, 2017, a grand jury returned Indictment No. 17-12-1391, which charged McCray and others with third-degree conspiracy to use a credit card fraudulently, on or about August 2, 2017. In addition, on December 13, 2017, a grand jury returned Indictment No. 17-12-1418, which charged McCray and another person with several counts of third-degree conspiracy to use a credit card fraudulently, on or about August 4, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 5, 2018, McCray pled guilty to four counts of third-degree conspiracy to use a credit card fraudulently, specifically count four of Indictment No. 17-11-1345, count three of Indictment No. 17-12-1391, and counts one and three of Indictment No. 17-12-1418. He also pled guilty to fourth-degree contempt of court as charged in Indictment No. 17-11-1346.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the plea hearing, McCray provided a factual basis for the pleas. Regarding the contempt charge, he admitted that the court previously had entered an order permitting his pretrial release,\n   and as a condition of his release, he was \"supposed to remain offense free.\" He also admitted that he committed the offenses for which he was pleading guilty while he was on pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judge who accepted the plea advised counsel that he had concerns about the validity of the contempt charge. The judge stated that on the sentencing date, he would determine whether to reject the plea to that offense and dismiss the indictment on the ground that it was \"defective as a matter of law.\" The judge questioned whether the State could charge a defendant with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) based on a violation of the terms of a pretrial release order. The judge directed the parties to file briefs addressing the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The judge heard oral argument on April 13, 2018, and filed a written opinion that day, in which the judge ruled that the contempt charge must be dismissed. In his opinion, the judge stated that neither the CJRA nor the court rules implementing the Act authorize a charge of contempt\n   under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) as a sanction for violating conditions in a pretrial release order. The judge also reasoned that the constitutional protections against double jeopardy preclude the State from punishing a defendant for violating a provision in a pretrial release order, based on the commission of a new offense, and also punishing defendant for committing that offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The judge entered an order dated April 13, 2018, dismissing the indictment with prejudice. The judge denied the State's motion for a stay of the order pending appeal, and later sentenced defendant on the other charges to which he pled guilty. The judge imposed concurrent terms of four years of incarceration, each without a period of parole ineligibility. The State's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    State v. Gabourel\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant Sahaile Gabourel was charged under complaint-warrant W-2018-2988-0906 with seven charges related to the possession and distribution of a controlled dangerous substance (CDS), including second-degree possession of a CDS with intent to distribute\n   within 500 feet of a public park, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7.1(a) ; and third-degree possession of a CDS with intent to distribute within a school zone, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In an affidavit of probable cause, an officer of the Jersey City Police Department (JCPD) stated that on July 10, 2018, he observed Gabourel distribute heroin to another individual, in exchange for currency. The officer arrested Gabourel and found that he was in possession of twenty-nine glassine bags of heroin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 11, 2018, the State filed a motion under the CJRA for Gabourel's pretrial detention. The judge conducted a hearing on July 16, 2018, and denied the State's motion. The judge stated that he was \"going to put a curfew in place\" and instructed Gabourel on this condition. The judge told Gabourel he had to remain in his residence from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. The judge stated, \"If you go out you're violating the terms of your release.\" The judge asked Gabourel if he understood those terms, and he replied, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The judge entered an order dated July 16, 2018, ordering Gabourel's release on his own recognizance, subject to certain conditions. Among other conditions, the order stated that he must report to Pretrial Services telephonically and in person once every other week, and that Gabourel \"[s]hall comply with the following curfew: 6pm-6am.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 23, 2018, at 8:09 p.m., two officers of the JCPD observed Gabourel standing on a street corner in Jersey City, in violation of the curfew. The officers apparently were aware of the curfew requirements of the pretrial release order, and determined that Gabourel was violating the order. The officers stopped and arrested him. He had three Percocet pills in his possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Gabourel was charged in complaint-warrant W-2018-3276-0906 with fourth-degree contempt of court, N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) ; and possession of a prescription legend drug, N.J.S.A. 2C:35-10.5(a)(1), a disorderly persons offense. The State then filed a motion pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:162-24 for revocation of Gabourel's pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The judge thereafter conducted a hearing on the State's motion. The judge found that Gabourel had disobeyed the pretrial release order by violating the curfew. The judge also found that the State met its burden for revocation of defendant's pretrial release. The judge found, however, that the CJRA did not permit a contempt charge for violating the pretrial release order. The judge entered an order dated August 9, 2018, dismissing the charge. We thereafter granted the State's motion for leave to appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On appeal, the State argues that the trial court judges erred by dismissing the contempt charges against defendants. The State contends the judges erred by finding that the CJRA and the court rules implementing the Act do not permit the State to charge a defendant with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) if the defendant violates a pretrial release order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"[I]ndictments are presumed valid and should be dismissed only upon the clearest and plainest ground and only if palpably defective.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Among other conditions, McCray was ordered not to commit a new offense while on release, and Gabourel was ordered to comply with a curfew. Thereafter, McCray committed new offenses and Gabourel violated the curfew. Thus, the State had prima facie evidence that defendants purposely or knowingly disobeyed judicial orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The State contends that the trial judges erred by finding that the CJRA does not permit the State to charge defendants with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) for violating a condition of pretrial release.

N.J.S.A. 2A:162-24 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Upon motion of a prosecutor, when an eligible defendant is released from custody before trial pursuant to [ N.J.S.A. 2A:162-17 or N.J.S.A. 2A:162-22 ], the court, upon a finding that the eligible defendant while on release has violated a restraining order or condition of release, or upon a finding of probable cause to believe that the eligible defendant has committed a new crime while on release, may not revoke the eligible defendant's release and order that the eligible defendant be detained pending trial unless the court, after considering all relevant circumstances including but not limited to the nature and seriousness of the violation or criminal act\n   committed, finds clear and convincing evidence that no monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the eligible defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the eligible defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The rules adopted by the Supreme Court to implement the CJRA also discuss the trial court's authority to address violations of the conditions of release.\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:26-2(d)(1) states that on a motion by the prosecutor\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   the court, upon a finding, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant while on release violated a restraining order or condition of release, or upon a finding of probable cause to believe that the defendant has committed a new crime while on release, may revoke the defendant's release and order that the defendant be detained pending trial where the court, after considering all relevant circumstances including but not limited to the nature and seriousness of the violation or criminal act committed, finds clear and convincing evidence that no monetary bail, non-monetary conditions of release or combination of monetary bail and conditions would reasonably assure the defendant's appearance in court when required, the protection of the safety of any other person or the community, or that the defendant will not obstruct or attempt to obstruct the criminal justice process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although N.J.S.A. 2A:162-24 and\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   3:26-2(d)(1) do not state that criminal prosecution for contempt is one of the potential sanctions for a defendant's failure to comply with a pretrial release order, the CJRA and the court rule do not preclude the State from charging a defendant with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) in these circumstances. The statute and the rule set forth the actions a court may take if a released defendant violates a condition of release. The statute and the rule do not address the State's authority to charge a defendant with criminal contempt based on a violation of a pretrial release order because the statute and the rule deal with the court's authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Indeed, the court does not have authority to charge a defendant with a\n   criminal offense.

This section of the Act provides, however, that a court's failure to do so does \"not preclude any remedy authorized under the law for any violation committed by the eligible defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"820765\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/144/216/#p236\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   On appeal, the State argues that the term \"remedy\" in N.J.S.A. 2A:162-23 includes a criminal contempt charge. The more plausible interpretation, however, is that the term \"remedy\" includes the actions a court may take to address a defendant's failure to comply with the conditions of release. Because the court does not have the authority to charge a defendant with a criminal offense, it is not one of the remedies referred to in N.J.S.A. 2A:162-23. Nevertheless, the statute does not preclude the State from charging a defendant with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) for violating a pretrial release order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendants argue, however, that because there is no provision in the CJRA that specifically authorizes a criminal contempt charge, the Legislature intended that the remedies in N.J.S.A. 2A:162-23, including revocation of release, are the only sanctions that may be imposed for a violation of a condition of pretrial release. In support of this argument, defendants rely upon the legislative history of the CJRA.

In this regard, we note that when the legislation was first introduced, N.J.S.A. 2A:162-24 stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   In addition to revocation of release as authorized by this section, a violation of\n   a condition of pretrial release imposed pursuant to [the CJRA] or any other law, may subject the defendant to civil contempt, criminal contempt, forfeiture of bail, or any combination of these sanctions and any other sanctions authorized by law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    S. 946\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    A. 1910\n   </em>\n   (2014).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In addition, when the legislation was first introduced, N.J.S.A. 2A:162-15 stated that the Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purpose of relying upon contempt of court proceedings or criminal sanctions instead of financial loss to ensure the appearance of the defendant, that the defendant will not pose a danger to any person or the community, and that the defendant will comply with all conditions of bail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    S. 946\n   </em>\n   /\n   <em>\n    A. 1910\n   </em>\n   (2014).]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   These provisions were deleted from the versions of N.J.S.A. 2A:162-15 and N.J.S.A. 2A:162-24 passed and enacted into law. There is, however, no statement by a sponsor of the legislation or any legislative committee that explains why the references to\n   criminal contempt initially proposed for inclusion in N.J.S.A. 2A:162-15 and N.J.S.A. 2A:162-24 were deleted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In the absence of such a statement or some other evidence of legislative intent, it is reasonable to conclude that the members of the Legislature believed there was no need to include a provision in the CJRA similar to the provisions in the federal BRA and D.C. Code authorizing a criminal contempt prosecution for a violation of a pretrial release order. It is also reasonable to infer that the members of the Legislature believed a pretrial release order was a judicial order under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) and that statute sufficiently addressed the potential criminal consequences of a violation of a pretrial release order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The State further argues that New Jersey's case law confirms its ability to charge a defendant with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) if the defendant purposely or knowingly violates a condition in a pretrial release order.

The elements of criminal contempt and the new offenses are not the same offense for double jeopardy purposes. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude the State from charging McCray with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) and the related offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We therefore conclude that in the CJRA, the Legislature did not preclude the State from charging a defendant with contempt under N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a) for violating a condition in the court's pretrial release order. A pretrial release order is a judicial order for purposes of\n   N.J.S.A. 2C:29-9(a), and an eligible defendant may be charged under that statute if he or she purposely or knowingly violates the order. Furthermore, defendants were clearly informed of the conditions in the pretrial release order, and defendants had adequate notice they could be charged with criminal contempt if they violated the order. In addition, double jeopardy principles do not bar the State from prosecuting McCray for criminal contempt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.
