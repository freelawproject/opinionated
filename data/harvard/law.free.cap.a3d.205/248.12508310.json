Our mandate clearly precluded resentencing without a final disposition of the three theft-of-immovable-property counts, yet the trial judge simply shelved those counts and resentenced defendant on the other six convictions to the same aggregate sentence. So, when defendant appealed for the second\n   time, we vacated that new judgment of conviction and remanded for a final disposition of the shelved counts.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The State then voluntarily dismissed the three theft-of-immovable-property counts, and the judge again resentenced defendant to the same aggregate sentence originally imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant appeals and argues, among other things, that the judge: (1) by \"reviving\" a dismissed count, imposed the same aggregate sentence and thereby violated his double jeopardy and due process rights; (2) imposed an extended fifteen-year term on a conviction for which he previously sentenced defendant to a seven-year prison term, thereby violating double jeopardy and due process principles; and (3) imposed an excessive sentence. We reject the first two of these arguments, but, on consideration of the third, we remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The factual circumstances, as well as many of the procedural events in this convoluted\n   matter, are explained in our earlier reported decisions and need not be repeated here. We only briefly traverse some of that well-trodden ground to explain why defendant's argument about a \"revived\" dismissed count is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant was charged with committing numerous offenses described in two indictments: 13-05-0187 and 13-05-0188, which we will refer to as 187 and 188. To be precise, 187 and 188 each contained ten counts. In 2014, defendant was tried on eleven of those twenty counts: all of 188's ten counts and one of 187's. As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Kosch I\n   </em>\n   , the one count from 187 that was part of the trial was 187's tenth count, which, to confuse the reader further, was designated at trial as \"count eleven.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222543\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/444/368/\">\n    444 N.J.

At sentencing, the judge imposed prison terms on the seven counts from 188 for the following periods of time:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 count one (second-degree theft of immovable property): fifteen years, subject to a six-year period of parole ineligibility\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 count two (third-degree forgery): five years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 count six (second-degree theft of immovable property): eight years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 count seven (third-degree theft of movable property): five years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 count eight (third-degree theft of immovable property): five years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 count nine (third-degree theft of movable property): five years\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 count ten (third-degree forgery): five years\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The judge also imposed on \"count eleven\" - again, 187's tenth count, which charged second-degree trafficking in items containing personal identifying information, N.J.S.A. 2C:21-17.3 - a seven-year prison term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   What we referred to in\n   <em>\n    Kosch I\n   </em>\n   as \"the first group\" of convictions - counts one, six, eight and eleven - were ordered to run concurrently with each other, and the convictions in \"the second group\" - counts two, seven, nine and ten - were ordered to run concurrently with each other.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222543\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/444/368/\">\n    444 N.J.

The concurrent terms of the first group, however, were ordered to run consecutively to the collection of concurrent terms in the second group.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222543\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/444/368/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This produced an aggregate twenty-year prison term with a six-year period of parole ineligibility.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222543\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/444/368/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    Kosch I\n   </em>\n   reversed the theft-of-immovable-property convictions: counts one, six, and eight, which were all part of the first group. Of that group, count one carried the lengthiest term, indeed, the only extended term and the only term subject to a period of parole ineligibility of all defendant's convictions. With the State's voluntary dismissal of counts one, six, and eight, the only remaining conviction in the first group of convictions is count eleven, which, as we have noted, was the only count of 187 that was adjudicated. That is why defendant's argument about this so-called \"revived count\" is meaningful. Without a conviction on count eleven, no convictions would be left in the first group, and defendant\n   would be left to serve - absent further alteration through resentencing - the concurrent prison terms imposed on the second group, which amount to five years: a prison term that defendant may have by now completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With these convoluted circumstances in mind, we consider defendant's contentions\n   about the \"revived\" count, 187's tenth count, which we have referred to as count eleven. The centerpiece of this argument is an order entered by the trial judge on April 6, 2015, well after both the trial, which occurred in September and October 2014, and the sentencing proceeding, which occurred in December 2014. The April 6, 2015 order granted \"defendant's motion for dismissal of [187] with prejudice.\" The judge noted at the bottom of the order that defendant's motion for prosecutorial misconduct was unopposed. The record on appeal also reveals that a month later - on May 5, 2015 - the judge signed an order rescinding the April 6, 2015 order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ORDERED, that the previous order dated April 6, 2015 which erroneously states that defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice is \"GRANTED,\" be amended to accurately reflect the record below and defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment with prejudice is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There are a number of reasons for rejecting the importance defendant attributes to the April 6, 2015 order. First, as we have mentioned, the judge realized it was mistakenly entered soon after. Second, to the extent defendant argues that the April 6, 2015 order was the product of a reasoned disposition and not a mere mistake, defendant had by that time already been convicted on the only count from 187 that was tried; the idea that the judge would grant a motion to dismiss the indictment that already produced a conviction and intended that order to eviscerate the jury's determination on that count seems preposterous. And, in any event, defendant initiated his appeal three months before the April 6, 2015 order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   so the judge was without jurisdiction to do\n   anything about a count of that indictment that was adjudicated by way of the judgment under review in this court.\n   <em>\n    R.\n   </em>\n   2:9-1(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Unlike\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Blacknall\n   </em>\n   , although mistaken, a trial judge dismissed a first-degree kidnapping charge at the close of the State's presentation of its evidence, but later, near the end of defendant's direct testimony, the judge realized his error and allowed the jury to consider the first-degree kidnapping charge, on which the jury eventually convicted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 470-71,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"753678\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/288/466/\">\n    672 A.2d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

What\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   requires had occurred by the time the State voluntarily dismissed counts one, six, and eight. When defendant was resentenced following those dismissals, the judge was constitutionally barred from increasing the sentence defendant was already serving. The judge recognized this limitation\n   and, indeed, he did not increase what was originally imposed in the aggregate; he only increased a term on one of the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To reach the same aggregate sentence, despite the absence of the prior convictions on counts one, six, and eight, the judge imposed a fifteen-year extended term, with a six-year parole ineligibility period, on count eleven when - previously - he had only imposed a seven-year term.

In\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   , the sentencing judge originally opted to impose two lesser consecutive terms instead of an extended term. When one of the two convictions was overturned, we found no constitutional violation in the defendant being resentenced to an extended term on the only remaining conviction. And so, here, we conclude that to adhere to the principles well established in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and our subsequent cases, double jeopardy and due process principles did not preclude the judge's imposition, for the first time, of an extended term on count eleven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even though we find no merit in defendant's constitutional arguments, his argument about the overall sentence and its alleged excessiveness are not insubstantial. And those arguments\n   are certainly not precluded by our rejection of defendant's constitutional arguments. The judge may have had the constitutional authority to impose the same aggregate sentence but that doesn't mean he should have. The sentence ultimately imposed after the prior appellate proceedings must still adhere\n   to this State's well-established sentencing philosophy and may not be so excessive as to shock the judicial conscience. Indeed, as Justice Handler wrote for the unanimous\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   Court, a sentencing judge in such an instance, while not barred by constitutional principles in imposing the same aggregate term, remains obligated to impose a sentence that \"will properly reflect the sentencing guidelines of the [New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1384299\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/97/263/#p270\">\n    97 N.J. at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20A.2d%20408\">\n    478 A.2d 408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"621229\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/379/498/\">\n    379 N.J.
