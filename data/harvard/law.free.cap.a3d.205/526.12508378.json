Plaintiff H. Brooke Paige, a taxpayer and resident of Washington, Vermont, appeals the civil division's dismissal of his complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the State of Vermont and the Washington Town School Board. In his complaint, he asserted that Act 46, a 2015 state law related to education funding, spending, and governance, impermissibly coerced town residents into voting to merge school districts. He further alleged that Act 46 deprived town residents of local control of education and would result in unequal educational opportunities in violation of the Education and Common Benefits\n   Clauses of the Vermont Constitution. We conclude that plaintiff lacks standing to bring this action and therefore affirm the decision below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 2. In 2015, the Vermont Legislature enacted Act 46 to address a statewide trend of declining student enrollment and increased education costs. 2015, No. 46, \u00a7 1. The law was intended \"to move the State toward sustainable models of educational governance\" by encouraging local action to \"maximize operational efficiencies through increased flexibility to manage, share, and transfer resources, with a goal of increasing the district-level ratio of students to full-time equivalent staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 2. To achieve this goal, Act 46 established a multi-year process for merging existing school districts into newly created districts with preferred governance structures. The law contained financial incentives for districts to voluntarily merge.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 6 (providing for decreased homestead property tax rate, merger support grant, and transition facilitation grant to districts that merged before July 2017);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 7 (providing for decreased homestead property tax rate and merger support grant to districts that merged between July 2017 and July 2019). The law directed the State Board of Education to order districts that had not acted by November 2018 to merge or realign where necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 3. Plaintiff is a registered voter, taxpayer, and justice of the peace in the town of Washington. In May 2017, Washington residents voted to merge the Washington school district with that of the neighboring town of Orange pursuant to Act 46. That August, plaintiff filed an administrative complaint with the Secretary of State alleging that the merger vote violated Vermont and federal election laws because he and fellow Washington residents were coerced by Act 46 into voting for the merger. The Secretary dismissed the complaint, stating that administrative relief was unavailable because the merger vote was not a primary or general election in which a federal office appeared on the ballot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 4. In September 2017, plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the civil division against the State of Vermont, the Vermont Board of Education, Secretary of Education Rebecca Holcombe, Secretary of State James Condos, and the Washington Town School Board. In his amended complaint, he alleged that Act 46 deprived Washington residents of local control of education in violation of the Education Clause of the Vermont Constitution, ch. II, \u00a7 68 ; deprived town residents of the right to equal educational opportunities expressed in\n   <em>\n    Brigham v. State\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Brigham I\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548926\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/166/246/\">\n    166 Vt. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548926\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vt/166/246/\">\n    692 A.2d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) ; and impermissibly coerced voters in violation of the Vermont Constitution and state and federal election laws. He asked the court to void the merger vote and order the Washington Town School Board restored to its previous governance structure. He also asked the court to reverse the Secretary of State's decision dismissing his administrative complaint. He sought an award of $10,000 in compensatory and punitive damages to the Washington Town School Board, and $1.00 in damages to him for bringing this action, plus costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 5. The State moved to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for lack of standing and failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The trial court held that plaintiff had standing as a Washington taxpayer because he alleged that as a result of the merger, Washington residents would bear an increased financial burden due to the additional costs associated with the Orange school. However, it determined that plaintiff failed to state a claim that Act 46 violated the Education Clause or the Common Benefits Clause as interpreted\n   in\n   <em>\n    Brigham I\n   </em>\n   , or that the law impermissibly coerced voters in contravention of Articles 8 or 18 of the Vermont Constitution or state or federal election statutes. The court therefore dismissed plaintiff's complaint and upheld the dismissal of his administrative action. Plaintiff appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in dismissing his claim that Act 46 violates chapter II, \u00a7 68 of the Vermont Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that plaintiff lacks standing to assert his claim, and therefore affirm the trial court's dismissal of plaintiff's action.

In that case, a group of public-school students and a group of taxpayers from the towns of Whitingham, Wilmington, and Andover challenged the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1997, also known as Act 60. The students alleged that Act 60 failed to protect their right to an equal educational opportunity under the Vermont Constitution because it left their schools with less money to fund instruction and curriculum or make necessary renovations. The taxpayers alleged that they paid disproportionately high state and local education taxes compared to similarly situated taxpayers of other Vermont towns. They also alleged that because the State was inadequately funding education under Act 60, they were forced to pay higher education taxes than other taxpayers who owned property of the same value and had identical adjusted gross incomes. We held that both the students and taxpayers met the elements of standing because they had adequately alleged that the law injured them personally and their injuries would be redressed if they prevailed on the merits of their claims.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 12. Here, plaintiff alleged that he is a resident and taxpayer of the town of Washington; has faithfully attended town meetings and school-board meetings since becoming a resident in 1988; and currently serves as a justice of the peace in the town. He asserted that the Act 46 merger will subject Washington residents to higher education costs and school taxes and make them responsible for the rehabilitation of the Orange Village School, while depriving them of the ownership of their town school and the sole right to make educational decisions for their students. In an exhibit attached to his amended complaint-an informational pamphlet regarding the Washington-Orange merger that he prepared-he claimed that the Washington school business manager stated that Orange and Washington would equally share the cost of education under a merger, and that Orange's 2017 school budget is about $350,000 greater than Washington's. Accordingly, he asserted, the merger would result in Washington taxpayers paying approximately $175,000 more than they would have otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further alleged that Act 46's incentives will create disparities in funding between towns, thereby denying equal educational opportunities in violation of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Brigham I\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 13. Accepting these allegations as true, they are insufficient to give plaintiff standing. It is undisputed that plaintiff is neither a public-school student nor a parent of a public-school student enrolled in a school subject to Act 46. He therefore is not personally affected by the law's alleged\n   deprivation of equal education opportunities and lacks standing to challenge it on that basis.

Plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege on the face of his complaint that he has been or will be directly injured in a cognizable way by Act 46. Unlike the taxpayers in\n   <em>\n    Brigham II\n   </em>\n   , he does not allege that he pays disproportionately high state and local education taxes compared to similarly situated taxpayers of other Vermont towns, or that he pays higher education taxes than other taxpayers who own property of the same value and have identical adjusted gross incomes. His allegation that as a result of the merger, Washington residents as a whole will be subjected to higher education costs and school taxes is insufficiently specific to confer standing on plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 16. Plaintiff argues in the alternative that he has standing to bring this action as a justice of the peace because\n   when he took office, he swore an oath that he \"will not, directly or indirectly, do any act or thing injurious to the Constitution.\" Vt. Const. ch. II, \u00a7 56. Plaintiff cites no law in support of this assertion, which we hold to be meritless. Justices of the peace are empowered to solemnize marriages, notarize documents, and serve on the board of civil authority in the town where they reside. 18 V.S.A. \u00a7 5144 ; 24 V.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 441, 801. No statute vests justices of the peace with official standing to bring actions to challenge state laws, even if the laws are allegedly unconstitutional. The oath sworn by plaintiff simply requires him not to do anything injurious to the Constitution; it does not impose an affirmative duty to bring civil actions against the State. As with any other plaintiff in a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff must allege some direct injury to himself to have standing. He failed to do so, and his complaint therefore was properly dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Affirmed\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In his appeal to this Court, plaintiff does not challenge the trial court's dismissal of his claims under the Common Benefits Clause, Articles 8 and 18, and state and federal election statutes, or the dismissal of his administrative appeal. He has therefore waived review of these claims, and we do not consider them in assessing plaintiff's standing. See\n    <em>\n     R. Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v.
