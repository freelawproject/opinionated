The contractor\u2019s failure to pay subcontractors was likewise a default under its contract with the district \u201cto provide all . . . labor and materials.\u201d <em>Bender </em>v. <em>Neillsville Bank, </em>10 Wis. 2d 282.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">It follows that by the terms of the assignment from the contractor to the surety of all moneys due from the district, the surety became fully entitled on or before April 4, 1958 to the balance retained by the district. <em>American Employers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>School District, </em>99 N. H. 188. See 4 Corbin, Contracts, <em>s. </em>875, <em>p. </em>512.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>It is expressly provided by the statute creating the liens of the United States for taxes, that the liens \u201cshall arise at the time the assessment is made.\u201d 26 U. S. C., s. 6322. The earliest assessment in this case was on December 12, 1958, or better than eight months after the rights of the surety under its assignment had become absolute. The federal statute further provides that the lien \u201cshall be . . . upon all property and rights to property . . . belonging to\u201d the taxpayer. 26 U. S. C., s. 6321. And while interpretation of the statute rests with the United States Supreme Court <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Gilbert Associates, </em>345 U. S. 361, 363), that court holds that the issue of \u201cwhether and to what extent the taxpayer had \u2018property\u2019 or \u2018rights to property\u2019 to which the tax lien could attach\u201d is to be determined by state law. <em>Aquilino </em>v. <em>United States, </em>363 U. S. 509, 512-513. See also, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Durham Lumber Co., </em>363 U. S. 522; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bess, </em>357 U. S. 51, 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\">Under the law of this state, on the date of the earliest assessment of federal taxes, which was December 12, 1958, the contractor had no property or right of property in the funds retained by the district. It had previously assigned to the surety all of its interest in the funds, as \u201cmoneys . . . due and payable at the time of . . . default,\u201d which had also previously occurred. As assignee, the surety was then entitled to proceed directly against the district. <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Garney, </em>69 N. H. 236. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Durham Lumber Co., </em>363 U. S. 522, <em>supra, </em>525. If the interest of the surety at the outset could be regarded as a security interest only (see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ball Construction Co., </em>355 U. S. 587), when default occurred it became immediately enforceable, and complete right to the funds vested irrevocably in the surety which was thereupon obligated to satisfy the subcontractors\u2019 claims. RSA 447:15-18. See 4 Corbin, Contracts, s. 903 supp. and footnote 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">As taxpayer, the contractor had no property interest in the funds to which the lien of the United States could attach. <em>Central Surety &amp; Insurance Corp. </em>v. <em>Martin Infante Co., </em>272 F. 2d 231 (3d Cir. 1959); <em>Matter of City of New York (USA </em>v. Coblentz) 5 N. Y. 2d 300, <em>cert. den. </em>363 U. S. 841. It could not compel the district \u201cto pay the retained percentage to [it] because of [its] failure to pay the laborers and materialmen.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>281 F. 2d 862-864, 866 (10th Cir. 1960); <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. </em>v. <em>New York City Housing Authority, </em>241 F. 2d 142 (2d Cir. 1957). It follows that the claim of the surety to the funds in the hands of the district takes precedence over the tax claims of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>States, and that the ruling and order of the Trial Court were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider whether the surety is likewise entitled to prevail by subrogation to the rights of the district by reason of the statutory transfer to the surety of the district\u2019s liability to subcontractors. RSA ch. 447, <em>supra. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Durham Lumber Co., </em>363 U. S. 522, 525, <em>supra; American Bridge Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>87 N. H. 62, 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\n<em>Exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b399-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
