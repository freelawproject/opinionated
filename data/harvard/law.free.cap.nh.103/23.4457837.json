H. 177, 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The question thus presented is whether there was evidence to support the finding of the Court that the plaintiff was not domiciled in this state at the time of the filing of the petition. The answer to this question depends upon whether the evidence warranted a finding that the plaintiff had no intention of actually making her home here after May 17, 1957. <em>Sworoski </em>v. <em>Sworoski, </em>75 N. H. 1, 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">There is nothing in the statute, <em>supra, </em>which requires the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>domicile of the plaintiff to be in this state merely because of the marriage relationship. Under appropriate circumstances, a wife may acquire a separate domicile. <em>Payson </em>v. <em>Payson, </em>34 N. H. 518; <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>35 N. H. 474; <em>Eckstrom </em>v. <em>Eckstrom, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The sum total of the several meetings between the parties when they resumed marital relations, whether in Jericho, New York, or in Hopkinton, was less than thirty days. Furthermore the plaintiff regularly filed her federal income tax returns in New York as well as the New York income tax returns. She has filed no Now Hampshire interest and dividends tax return, nor has she paid a poll tax, or voted in this state. On May 13, 1957, she executed a will in this state reciting that she was of Jericho. There was evidence from which it could be found that the parties finally separated by mutual agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The plaintiff, relying upon <em>Masten </em>v. <em>Masten, </em>15 N. H. 159, contends that it must be ruled as a matter of law that the plaintiff\u2019s domicile was in this state at the time of the filing of her petition. The <em>Masten </em>case is distinguishable since the parties there had lived together in this state for some seventeen years and the wife left the state temporarily in order to support herself and children. The court said that under these circumstances she had a right to claim domicile here.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We are of the view considering all the circumstances of this case that the evidence warranted although it did not compel a finding that the plaintiff did not have a domicile in this state for the purpose of bringing these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-9\">Kenison, C. J. and Blandin, J., concurred specially; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b63-10\">Kenison, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AV\"><em>concurring specially: </em>I concur in this opinion solely because the result is dictated by RSA 458:31 as construed in <em>Eckstrom </em>v. <em>Eckstrom, </em>98 N. H. 177. However the result is unfortunate and points up to the Bar the desirability of legislative consideration and change in order to eliminate the wife\u2019s domicile as a jurisdictional requirement in seeking separate maintenance in this state. Not only does the <em>Eckstrom </em>decision represent a distinct minority view (anno. 36 A. L. R. 2d 1369) but it is presently out of harmony with more recent statutes which allow marital support to be enforced without the requirement of domicile on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the wife. Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act. RSA ch. 546 (supp), Laws 1959, c. 271; Uniform Civil Liability for Support Act, RSA ch. 546-A (supp), Laws 1955, c. 206; RSA 460:23 (supp), Laws 1959, c. 5; <em>State </em>v. <em>Echavarria, </em>101 N. H. 458. New Hampshire will continue in part to be a jurisdictional haven for husbands avoiding marital support unless this requirement of the wife\u2019s domicile is eliminated under RSA 458:31.</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-5\">Blandin, J., joined in the concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
