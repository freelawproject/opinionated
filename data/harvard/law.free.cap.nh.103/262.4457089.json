It would authorize the issue of ten million dollars of state bonds the proceeds to be used exclusively for purposes of the act. Its stated purposes include the preservation and development of scenic, historic, scientific, and recreational areas, to the end that as tourist attractions they may promote the welfare and economy of the state and its inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">The purposes of the bill are public ones, for which public funds may properly be used. Cf. RSA chs. 216, 218, 219. All undertakings by the Commission are subject to approval by the Governor and Council, which presumably would be withheld if private rather than public benefits were likely to result.
