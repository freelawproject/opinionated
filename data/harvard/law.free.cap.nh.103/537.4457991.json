In <em>Dziatlik </em>v. <em>Holy Trinity &amp;c. Church, </em>86 N. H. 234, a petition for redemption and an accounting was begun under P. L., c. 345, ss. 26 and 34, now RSA 529:26, 34. The purchasers of the property at an execution sale sold it to the defendant. The plaintiff was the assignee of the judgment debtor. All parties and the court \u00e1ppear to have assumed that the defendant assignee, who occupied the position of the Chandlers in the case before us, and not the purchaser at the execution sale \u2014 in the position of the defendant in our case \u2014 was the proper party against whom the action should have been brought. The court stated: \u201cThis assignment vested in the plaintiff 'all the rights, privileges and remedies\u2019 belonging to his assignor.\u201d <em>Id., </em>235. By this token, the assignment to the Chandlers placed them in the position of the defendant in the <em>Dziatlik </em>case, and it is against the Chandlers and not the defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>remedy lies. To the same effect, see <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Fabyan, </em>27 N. H. 529, 536, 537; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>45 N. H. 574, 577; <em>Gilbert v. Berlin, </em>70 N. H. 396, 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The generally established law also is that the proper person against whom a petition for an accounting and redemption should be brought is the one who holds record title at the time the petition is brought. Jones on Mortgages (8th <em>ed.) s. </em>1433.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">When the question arose in Maine under provisions essentially similar to RSA 529:26, 35 (Maine Revised Statutes (1930) c. 104, <em>ss. </em>7, 15), the court had no hesitation in holding unequivocally that a petition for redemption and an accounting must be brought against the party having the record title to the property at the time the petition was begun. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>137 Me. 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Such is our holding here and the order is</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b577-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
