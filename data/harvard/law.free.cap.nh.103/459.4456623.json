H. 306. The plaintiff contends that the ruling of the Trial Court denying her motion to strike the judgment of dismissal and for leave to file a reserved case should be set aside and permission granted because \u201c [t] here is nothing in the record to show that the Court exercised any discretion in its ruling in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The record before us contains no transcript of the proceedings in the Trial Court at the hearing upon the motion to strike the entry of judgment, and it is undisputed that no record of the hearing was kept. The parties do not agree upon what there transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The burden is upon the moving party to establish that discretion was not exercised, or if it was that it was abused. See <em>Dunne </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>97 N. H. 43, 44. The Trial Court had undoubted authority to suspend Rule 57 if justice required. <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 65; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>91 N. H. 6, 8. \u201cWe find nothing to indicate that the ruling was not made in the Court\u2019s discretion, and the presumption is that it was. <em>Vallee </em>v. <em>Company, </em>89 N. H. 285, 291; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Associates, </em>100 N. H. 247.\u201d <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Waumbec Mills, </em>102 N. H. 200, 204. \u201cIt follows that so far as the record here shows, the court\u2019s duty in determining what justice required was properly performed.\u201d <em>LaMarre </em>v. <em>LaMarre, </em>84 N. H. 553. See also, <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Scribner, </em>101 N. H. 314, 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
