In this article, the defendant Allstate contracts to insure the defendant Tickler against all damages which Tickler shall be legally obligated to pay on account of the \u201cownership, maintenance or use ... of the owned automobile, a substitute automobile or a non-owned automobile.\u201d On page 2 of the policy appears Article X with the heading in large letters, \u201cDefinitions,\u201d under which the insured and the three classes of automobiles covered by Article I are defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201c1. The unqualified word \u2018insured\u2019, wherever used with respect to the liability insurance, includes the named insured, spouse, and: (a) with respect to the owned automobile or a substitute automobile, any other person or organization legally responsible for its use, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named insured or spouse or with the permission of either; and (b) with respect to any non-owned automobile, any other person or organization, not owning or hiring it, but legally responsible for its use by the named insured or spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201c2. \u2018Owned automobile\u2019 means the vehicle described on the Supplement Page, including its equipment. A trailer shall not be deemed to be equipment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201c3. \u2018Substitute automobile\u2019 means an automobile not owned by the named insured but temporarily used as the substitute for the owned automobile while withdrawn from normal use because of its breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201c4. \u2018Non-owned automobile\u2019 means any automobile other than: (a) the one described on the Supplement Page, (b) a substitute automobile, or (c) an automobile owned by, hired as a part of a frequent use of hired automobiles by, or furnished for regular use to, the named insured or a member of his household, except a servant.\u201d Admittedly the panel truck driven by Tickler and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>volved in the accident was not his \u201cowned automobile,\u201d or a \u201csubstitute automobile,\u201d as defined above. We come then to the question of whether it was a \u201cnon-owned automobile.\u201d The Court has found upon undisputed evidence that the panel truck was \u201cfurnished for regular use to Mr. Tickler,\u201d the named insured. Under Article X it would appear this truck was not covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The plaintiff seeks to avoid this result by arguing that none of the definitions under Article X apply and that the defendant Allstate has undertaken to insure Tickler when driving this truck notwithstanding the exclusions, because the policy is really one of \u201cexcess insurance.\u201d Paragraph 9, under the head of \u201cThe following conditions apply to the coverages indicated\u201d provides in part: \u201cWith respect to a . . . non-owned automobile Coverages A and B shall be excess insurance over any other collectible liability insurance of any kind available to the insured . . . . \u201d Under such a policy the plaintiff contends that Allstate is liable under Article I to pay any loss if it \u201cexceeds the limits of another insurance policy.\u201d In summary, the plaintiff says Allstate has agreed to act as \u201csurety\u201d for Tickler and \u201cto pay any claims in excess of $5,000.00.\u201d The argument of the plaintiffs, though able and ingenious, is in effect that, under Article I, Allstate has contracted to insure for the premium for insuring one automobile, not only Tickler\u2019s own car but all others, and pay all damages in excess of the coverage of $5,000 provided by the American Mutual Insurance Company arising out of their \u201cownership, maintenance or use\u201d by Tickler.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The interpretation of this policy is of course for our court. <em>Pettee </em>v. <em>Chapter, </em>86 N. H. 419, 424. It is to be considered as a whole, in the light of all the circumstances, and interpreted as a reasonable person in the position of the insured should understand it. <em>Farm Bureau Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>94 N. H. 389, 392. Bearing this in mind and the frequency with which verdicts in automobile accidents now far exceed the $5,000 limit, covered by the defendant American Mutual, as well as the various illustrations and other forms of self-advertising in the policy to which the plaintiff directs our attention, we hold that the parties contemplated no such sweeping and extraordinary coverage as the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation demands. We arc content with the Trial Court\u2019s implicit finding that the parties intended the definitions under Article X to apply to Article I, the coverage clause and that they also extended to the excess insurance provisions. <em>Newcomb </em>v. <em>Ray, </em>99 N. H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>463, 465. It follows that the track involved here was not a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\">The case of <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Association, </em>68 N. H. 305, relied upon by the plaintiffs, is clearly distinguishable from the present situation. In the <em>Hunt </em>case, the facts were agreed upon as follows: A insured B against loss by fire, C reinsured A for one-third of A\u2019s risk and the defendant reinsured C for one-half of its risk. A loss occurred and C having become insolvent, the court held that the defendant was bound to pay its full share or one-sixth of the loss to A, without waiting to see what amount of the damages the insolvent could satisfy. This is an indemnity contract plain and unqualified between C and the defendant for the benefit of B as to the property insured. The defendant Allstate did not agree to indemnify any other insurer against any loss, but rather to indemnify Tickler against loss in excess of other coverage available to him, provided such loss arose out of a risk covered by the Allstate policy. The <em>Hunt </em>case appears not in point in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The plaintiffs also excepted to the Court\u2019s refusal to grant their requests for a finding that a total figure of $27,500 was a reasonable value to set on their claims and that the defendant American Mutual may reasonably \u201ccompromise or settle the claims of the plaintiffs for any sums\u201d within the above limits and thereby be released from further liability. The record convinces us that the Court was not compelled as a matter of law to grant their request that the specified value of $27,500 was reasonable or to rule that the defendant American Mutual must enter into the agreement suggested by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Finally the plaintiffs claim the Court erred in denying their requests for findings of fact and rulings of law made at the close of the hearing after their motion to reopen the transferred case had been granted. These requests were in substance that Allstate is estopped to deny its obligation to satisfy any judgment in excess of the $5,000 coverage furnished by American Mutual because it assumed the defense of the civil actions and also failed to act seasonably to petition for a declaratory judgment. An examination of the record convinces us that the Court\u2019s finding that Allstate did not assume the defense of the civil actions is supported, and therefore it is upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">With regard to the failure of Allstate to seek a declaratory judgment, nothing appears in the statute (RSA 491:22) to suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>that there is a legal duty on an insurer to invoke such a remedy. There is no such legal duty. While more dispatch in the entire conduct of this case would certainly have been in the interests of justice, no legal obligation was violated by the defendant Allstate, and the Court\u2019s action denying this request was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">What we have decided renders unnecessary discussion of other issues raised. Upon examination it appears that the Court\u2019s rulings upon the remaining exceptions of the plaintiffs disclose no error. The order is</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b335-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
