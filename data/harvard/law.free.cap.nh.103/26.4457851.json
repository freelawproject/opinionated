H. 200. In such a situation it cannot be found \u201cthat injustice has been done by the decision of the judge\u201d of probate as required by said section 9. <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>92 N. H. 33, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">It has been settled law in this jurisdiction for many years that under RSA 561:1, 6, an aunt takes to the exclusion of cousins. <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>71 N.

The decree of distribution made by the probate court is in conformity with this established principle and the denial of plaintiffs\u2019 petition by the Superior Court was proper. <em>Broderick </em>v. <em>Smith, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">In view of the result reached it is unnecessary to pass on the propriety of the ruling made by the probate court that certification of the proposed question of law pertaining to this issue could not be made under RSA 547:30 after its decree of distribution was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-12\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
