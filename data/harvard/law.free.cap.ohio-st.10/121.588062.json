The general issue was pleaded, and a verdict and judgment given for the defendant in error, in the court of common pleas, which is now sought to be reversed by the prosecution of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-4\">But one error is assigned. It is in these words: <em>\u201c </em>The court of common pleas erred in refusing to permit the deposition of Eli 122] Atwood, mentioned and set forth in the bill of ^exceptions, to be read in evidence to the jury in behalf of the defendant below.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF2b\">It appears by the bill of exceptions, that upon the offer to read this deposition, an objection was made to the competency of the witness, for the reason that his principles, or want of proper religious belief, disqualified him from giving testimony. To sustain this objection, it was proved that about <em>three years before, </em>the witness, Atwood, stated that \u201c there would be no accountability hereafter, in relation to matters of this life. That beyond the grave, there would be no accountability for anything done here. That there was neither heaven nor hell, and when a man died that was the last of him.\u201d It was also proved that about the same time, Atwood stated, that \u201c a man was like the beast, had nothing to do after death ; and that after that period, there would be no more of him.\u201d On this evidence of Atwood\u2019s declarations, the court of common pleas sustained the objection, and rejected the deposition.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-6\">H. H. Hunter, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aib\">insisted, that he who. makes the objection must show, that at the time of the trial the witness wants a proper religious belief; and that declarations made <em>three </em>years before the trial, are no evidence of the present sentiments of a witness. He claimed the rule of law to be, that a witness is competent, if he believes in the existence of Hod, <em>or, </em>in a future state of rewards and punishments, <em>or, </em>in the obligation of an oath. He cited Easterday <em>v. </em>Kilbourn, Wright, 345.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">He also relied on section 3, of article 8, of the constitution of Ohio, which provides \u201c that no human authority can in any case whatever control or interfere with the rights of conscience.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-8\">H. Stanbert &amp; Yan Trump, for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2R\">insisted, that the rule of law which excludes a witness for defect of religious principle, did not grow out of a <em>sectarian </em>spirit in the administration of the law, but was the result of a comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123, 124\">*123, 124</page-number>and philosophical estimate of human character *and motives [123 in balancing the incentives and checks to good and evil. Omychund <em>v. </em>Barker, 1 Atk. 21; Willes, 549; Rex <em>v. </em>Taylor, Peake, 11; Rex <em>v. </em>White, 1 Leach C. C. 430; Curtis <em>v. </em>Strong, 4 Day, 51; 1 Phil. Ev. 20. The law does not rely upon the abstract principles of'human nature, in laying down its rules for the regulation of testimony, but it appeals to the <em>conscience </em>of men \u2014 to their <em>fear </em>of doing wrong springing out of the <em>belief of a future accountability.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">They further insisted that section 3, of article 8, of the constitution, was intended merely to secure to every citizen his <em>political </em>rights, an entire freedom of religious faith, to hold and enjoy, or to disbelieve and reject, any or all religious creeds and systems, just according to the pleasure of his own will; but it was never the intention of the constitution, that in the judicial tribunals of the country, the property, the reputation, or the life of the citizen should be made to depend on the mere words of one who openly avows that his conscience neither recognizes nor feels any obligation under the sanction of an oath.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b113-6\">Wood, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATc\">The question raised upon the record, in this case, is, whether the court of common pleas erred in the rejection of Atwood\u2019s deposition ? Much learning has been expended by many of the ancient writers, in defining the nature and obligations of an oath. Fleta. 344, lib. 5, c. 22; Brae. fol. 116; Brit, de Chal, de Jurors, 135, c. 53; Fortes. de Laud. Leg. Anglica. 58, c. 26; 2 Co. Inst. 479 ; 3 Inst. 165, c. 14; 1 Atk. 22, etc. But by Chief Justice Abbot, in the queen\u2019s case, an oath is declared to be the calling upon God to witness, that what is said by the person sworn is true, and invoking the divine vengeance upon his head, if what he says is false; and, upon interrogatories put to the judges by the lords, it was responded by that very learned and distinguished judge, that if the witness states he considers the oath binding on his conscience, it is periectly unnecessary and irrelevant, to ask any further questions. 3 Stark. Ev. 1734, note <em>m. </em>In many of our elementary treatises, it is laid down as the ^invariable [124 rule, that, before a witness takes the oath, he may be asked whether he believes in the existence of a God, the obligations of an oath, and in a future state of rewards and punishments; and if he does not, he can not be sworn. 1 Stark. Ev. 122; 11 Peak. N. P. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>That the principle here given would exclude a professed atheist, as incompetent to testify, is very clear, and there are perhaps few subjects on which there has been a greater uniformity of decision in both the English and American courts than that <em>such </em>person is totally incompetent. 1 Atk. 45; Bul. N. P. 202; Leach\u2019s O. C. L. 483; Bract. 116; 2 Cow. 431; 18 Johns. 98; 4 Day, 51; Yerger, 224; 7 Conn. 82; 4 N. H. 444; 2 Term, 96. The reason, as given in the books, is, that upon the conscience of such a witness, the oath has no binding force or obligation. But it does, by no means, follow, laying out of view section 3, article 8, of the constitution of Ohio, and proceeding upon the broad basis of the common law, that a witness, to be competent, must believe in a state of existence after death, or in a future state of rewards and punishments. If it have been so declared, in a very few instances from the bench, and a witness occasionally required so to square his opinions, the origin is undoubtedly to be traced to those gloomy times of papal superstition, when sectarian influence and fanaticism overspi\u2019ead the land of our ancestors, and to deny the <em>real presence </em>was but the prelude to the stake! When human penalties were considered as nothing, in controlling the conduct \u00f3f a witness; and that neither his obligations to society, nor his admissions of the moral influence of an overruling power, <em>in this </em>world, were a sufficient guaranty to bind his conscience, and guard the community against falsehoods, unless the witness also believed <em>in a future state of rewards and punishments. </em>But in 1744, such notions were found by experience to be too contracted for the purpose of substantial justice, and \u00edd Omychund <em>v. </em>Barker, before Lord Chancellor - Hardwick, assisted by the lord chief baron of the exchequer, and the lord chief justices of the king\u2019s bench and common pleas, it was held that the deposi125] tion *of a Gentoo, sworn according to the custom and religion of his own-country, was competent testimony, because he believed in a God, the creator of the world. 1 Atk. 40. Lord Chief Justice Willes, in the same case, page 43, asserts his opinion that some infidels, under some circumstances, may be admitted to testify; that Lord Coke\u2019s opinion was too narrow; he would exclude <em>Jews, </em>as well as heathen ; that Lord Coke was a very great lawyer; but our <em>Savior </em>and <em>St. Paul </em>were much better authority, and they had declared that \u201c <em>God was no respecter of person.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Lord Chief Justice Lee declares, that rules of evidence are arti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ficial, but one rule can never vary \u2014 the eternal rule of natural justice; that the case before him was to be looked upon in that light, and the evidence to be considered \u00abin that way which was agreeable to the laws of England. Id. 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It would seem that the opinion of Chief Justice Abbot, before cited; the rule in Starkie, that.the witness must believe in a God, the obligation of an oath, etc.;' and the opinion of the court in Omyehund <em>v. </em>Barker, are perfectly reconcilable, and indeed support each other, and they are certainly sustained by the current of the American decisions. 15 Mass. 184 ; 2 Cow. 431, 433 ; U. S. C. 345. Though there are cases opposed to be found in the books 7 Conn. 66; Swift\u2019s Dig. 739. But to reconcile the authorities, the' three several propositions in 1 Starkie\u2019s Ev. 122, must be disjunctively considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">We think, then, that it may, at this time, be considered as pretty generally settled, both in England and in the United States, that <em>whoever believes in the moral influence and control of an overruling Providence in this life, and that an oath is binding on his conscience, </em>is competent to testify; for, aside from the penalties imposed by civil enactments, if the witness believe in the moral obligations of an oath, the <em>reward </em>of good and <em>punishment </em>of evil action, by some superior power, is irresistibly implied. And it is worthy of consideration, whether the great ends of justice, the object of all law, would not be promoted, even if <em>this </em>requisition were swept away, and no inquiry permitted *as. to what concerns the duties [126 of the creature to his Creator only, in order to determine the competency of the witness. We are, however, to declare the law as we find it, and, if defective, it belongs to another forum to remedy the evil.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In this case, it is apparent that the deposition should not have been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The witness disbelieved in a future state of rewards and punishments, accountability or existence after death ; but this was at a period long anterior to the taking of his testimony. But if such disbelief continued, it is consistent with the most perfect conviction of a superintending power, the obligation of an oath, morally considered, and the influence of God\u2019s providence and government in this life, and fully within the principle decided in Easterday <em>v. </em>Kilbourn, Wright, 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">It has been questioned, whether the declarations made out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>court, by a witness, are competent evidence to prove his want of religious belief. This is settled, in the affirmative, by several adjudicated cases. Norton <em>v. </em>Ladd, 4 N. H. 444 ; Atwood <em>v. </em>Welton, 7 Conn. 66. It is questionable, however, whether such declarations should not be confined to some period shortly anterior to giving evidence by the witness, so that no change of opinion might reasonably be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">From the view we take of this case, it is unnecessary to consider the constitutional question presented, whether the rejection of a witness for the defect of l\u2019eligious belief interferes with the rights of conscience? And sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The judgment of the court of common pleas is reversed, with costs, and the case remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Judgment reversed.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b116-12\"> Where a father and son were called as witnesses, and it was proved that the son had often declared he did not believe in the existence of a God or a future state; and that the father had declared he did not believe in the latter, had read Tom Paine's works, and did not know whether he (the witness) believed anything, Story, J., rejected both as incompetent.
