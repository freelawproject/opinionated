The execution of this deed is admitted, but its delivery is denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b244-12\">To prove the delivery, the defendant offered the declaration of his father, made after the execution of the deed. Those declarations were rejected at the trial, and the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The motion for a new trial is made because of the exclusion of this evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-5\">B. S. Cowen, for the motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-6\">The admissions of an ancestor are evidence against the heir. Jackson <em>v. </em>McCall, 10 Johns. 377; Allen <em>v. </em>Parish, 3 Ohio, 107.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-7\">Admissions of the delivery of a deed by the party making the deed is evidence of the fact of delivery. Sicard <em>v. </em>Davis, 6 Peters, 136.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-8\">*Dewey and Stanton, contra: [274</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b245-9\">No admissions of the grantor ought to be admitted except such as form a part of the transaction at the time of the alleged delivery. Otherwise, land may be conveyed by parol \u2014 for the delivery is as much a part of the deed as the sealing of it. The defendant is not without remedy; if his title is defective at law* and he has equity, he knows where to go for relief.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-10\">Lane, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaN\">The title of the owner of property is bound by his admissions. While one holds the title, the admissions he makes may be given in evidence against him and against his privy. The heir, pursuing the estate of his ancestor, takes his right and interest, incumbered by all that rests against it, before, descent. If this deed had been set up against John Ross, the father, while holding the land, his own admissions would have been competent evidence; they are equally competent when offered against his heir. New trial granted; costs to abide the event.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Declarations made by the person under whom the party claims, after the declarant has parted with his right, are inadmissible to affect any one claiming under him. Watson <em>v. </em>Cris, 11 Johns. 437; Weidman <em>v. </em>Rohr, 4 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>Rawle, 174; Bartlett <em>v. </em>Delprat, 4 Mass. 702. And if it be doubtful whether the declaration was before or after the deed, it can not be received. Stockett <em>v. </em>Watkins, 2 Gill &amp; Johns. 326. Declarations of the owner of property are admissible against one claiming his estate by purchase or by descent, by act of law or by act of the parties; and, in such case, it makes no difference whether the declarant be alive or dead. 2 Phil. Ev., Cowan &amp; Hill\u2019s Notes, 644. And where such declarant is himself a competent witness, and present in court, his admissions are receivable. Woolway <em>v. </em>Rowe, 28 Eng. Com. Law, 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">The defendant in an ejectment claimed by a deed from Hughey. A question arose whether this deed had been delivered to the defendant. The plaintiff offered to prove that Hughey acknowledged before he conveyed to the defendant, that he had not paid the purchase money, and had no title. The evidence was rejected on the ground that it would affect a third person. But the reporter thought this a hasty decision. Clark <em>v. </em>Arnold, 2 Hayw. 287.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
