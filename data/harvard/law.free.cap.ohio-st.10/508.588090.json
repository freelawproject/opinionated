To make the survey close, however, the last course has to be changed so as to terminate at B, two red oaks and a white ash, upper corner on the creek, of survey No. 534.

The original corners are on the ground; and the rule is well settled that monuments shall control course and distance. If the defendants are confined to the actual calls of their patents, they have no reason to complain. If they intended to make the creek the boundary, they would have called for it as a controlling monument.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ari3\">The plaintiff\u2019s survey and patent is bounded on the east line of the defendants\u2019 two patents, so that when the defendants\u2019 line is found it settles both. The description begins at a corner, which it describes by its timber, being the upper corner of Parker\u2019s survey, on Darby creek, running \u201cup the creek,\u201d many stations described by course and distance only, to another corner, described by timber. The other patent calls are like this, beginning at the last named corner, thence up the creek, by course and *distance to a third timber corner. The corners are [510 all identified and stand on the bank of the creek. No original line was marked, but the described line corresponds, generally, with the meanders of the creek, and is found, on survey, to be but few poles from it. The case, then, is settled by a single point, whether a call \u201cup the creek,\u201d by course and distance, means <em>with </em>the creek and <em>bounded on </em>the creek, or whether the notice of the creek is intended to indicate the general direction of the line, which is to remove locality by the course and distance.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Some cases are understood to have been decided on the circuit, many years ago, recognizing the latter as 'the true rule. Those decisions probably depended on special circumstances, not now known to us. The general principle is, first look for visible monuments, one of the most natural of which is a stream, and a line extended, referring to a stream, is presumed to lie on it, unless some circumstances appear indicative of a different intention. The present case furnishes abundant reason to reject any such intention. All the corners are on the creek, and it would be one of the most improbable suppositions; to presume a tract of land, lying for miles on a stream, and described by a line running parallel with its meanders, within a few poles or yards, was not intended to be bounded by the water.
