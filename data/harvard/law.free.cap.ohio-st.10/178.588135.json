By section 5 it is enacted, \u201c That the minimum price of the public lands shall be two dollars per acre, and payable in installments.\u201d Where the conditions of the sale were not complied with, relief was extended, with various modifications, up to April, 1820, when the credit system was abolished. By the act of 1821, persons holding certificates of purchase were authorized to file a relinquishment, in writing, of any legal subdivision of tracts of land entered, and have the money paid on the parts so relinquished applied on those retained, toward completing payment. This act also provides for the forfeiture of the lands, if not so paid for, within a limited period, after the transfer of the payments, and the expiration of the extended time. These enactments, in favor of purchasers, in different forms, and by subsequent statutes, were continued until July 4, 1829.

At his death, he had an incontestable equity in the lands entered by him, which, under the provisions of the acts of Congress, had he lived, he might have made available, until July 4, 1829. By the act of May 23, 1828, passed one day after Hulburd\u2019s death, that right was made available in scrip. This scrip was to be issued <em>\u201c </em>to the person, or persons, legally entitled to the benefit of\u201d the provisions contained in the act, \u201c his, her, or their legal representatives or assigns.\u201d Harriet Hulburd, the heir at law, availed herself of these enactments, and the scrip was issued to her, which was afterward converted into money. She received it, not as an original right, conferred upon her by the act of Congress, but as a right conferred upon the estate to which she stood in the relation of heir at law. In other words, it is clear that she is in possession not <em>by purchase, </em>but <em>by descent. </em>It follows, then, that the scrip, though issued to the heir, is <em>assets </em>which belongs to the estate. It has descended, <em>liable to the payment of debts of the ancestor, </em>and the heir must account to the administrator for the avails; for the heir holds property descended, in trust, for the benefit of creditors, as far as the liabilities of the ancestor extends</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">Decree for the complainant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
