While in possession under the lease, he made a mortgage to George Leiby, which the plaintiffs, his executors, now seek to enforce. The mortgage was duly recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">Wolf, while in possession, sold his estate in the land to Marcus Smith, who had actual notice of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">Marcus Smith procured a new lease from the commissioners, which was duly recorded. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Marcus Smith afterward sold the lease to Samuel S. Smith, who denies, by his answer, any notice of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">Samuel S. Smith afterward sold to David Boring, who also purchased without actual notice of the mortgage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">Upon this state of facts, the question is raised, whether Boring holds the land free from the mortgage or not.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-7\">W. R. Morris, for the plaintiff:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">The registry of the mortgage is conclusive notice against all subsequent purchasers or incumbrancers. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. 390 ; 8 Amer Com. Law, 303. The record estops the defendants from saying that they are innocent purchasers, without notice, nor can the plaintiffs be called upon to prove notice at all. 1 Story\u2019s Eq. 392. Under the registry act of Ohio, a deed or *other instrument [84 duly recorded, is notice to all the world. Nor can the effect of such notice be evaded by any subsequent management between the original vendor and any other purchaser.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-9\">But the case shows that the defendant had actual notice. Where a subsequent purchaser, by the use of reasonable diligence, can acquire the knowledge of a fact, the law presumes him to know it. Cunningham <em>v. </em>Buckingham, 1 Ohio, 264; Ohio Cond. 127 ; Reader <em>v. </em>Barr, 4 Ohio, 446 ; Sug. Tend. 484, 498; 8 Amer. Com. Baw, 305 ; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. 384.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-10\">A more <em>possessory </em>interest in land may be mortgaged; also, a mere <em>equitable </em>right. Powell on Mortg. 23; Parkert <em>v. </em>Alexander, 1 Johns. Ch. 394.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-11\">Wolf, while in possession, with at least an equitable title, for a valuable consideration, gave the plaintiff this mortgage, which is duly executed and duly recorded. How, then, is the title of a subsequent purchaser to be preferred to that of the plaintiff?</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-12\">Storer and Fox, for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b79-13\">Lane, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASR\">Whenever the state of the title on record would lead a searcher of incumbrances, who was using common prudence and care in investigating the title, to a knowledge of the fact, the law assumes that he acquired the knowledge of it. A purchaser\u2019, therefore, from Wolf, ought to learn all conveyances, from Wolf, existing on record at the time- of his purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">But where the series of deeds runs on a line entirely different, and there is nothing to connect the name or the interests of a third person with any part of it, it would be unreasonable to im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>pule to the searcher a knowledge of the acts of such third person. Here Wolf was not in the connection of title at all; Loring, searching for incumbrances, would, be led, first, to Samuel S. Smith ; next, to Marcus Smith, and third, to the commissioners, 85] without any indication of Wolf\u2019s interests,- or *the notice of any fact showing his relation to the estate. It seems that such a purchaser should be protected from claims which no ordinary prudence could detect.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u25a0Bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
