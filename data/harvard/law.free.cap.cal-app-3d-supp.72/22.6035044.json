Thomas (hereafter Thomas).</p>\n<p id=\"pAFu\">On June 8, 1971, Surety issued its \u201cContractor\u2019s Bond\u201d to Thomas pursuant to the provisions of section 7071.5 et seq. of the Business and Professions Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On June 14, 1971, Surety issued a like bond in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 26\">*Supp. 26</page-number>of defendant Lee C. Thompson, listed therein as the qualifying employee on Thomas\u2019 contractor\u2019s license. After amendment to the bonds in 1972 to conform to amendments to the law, the penal sum was increased to $2,500 each. Thus, at the time of commencement of this litigation in municipal court on May 27, 1975, the afforded protection to Thomas and Thompson as principals aggregated $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">On November 9, 1973, plaintiff Mary L. Boliver entered into a written agreement with Thomas for the construction of a four bedroom home pursuant to plans and specifications referred <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claiming a failure of completion and substantial defects in the construction work done, plaintiff commenced this action on April 28, 1975, in municipal court, naming as defendants Thomas, Thompson and Surety, and incorporating the aforementioned contractor\u2019s bond by reference. The complaint was based on breach of the contract alone, did not allege fraud, and sought attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">After trial, the municipal court filed its memorandum of decision on January 5, 1976, which memorandum was incorporated into the settled statement on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pursuant thereto the court found: (1) against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 27\">*Supp. 27</page-number>defendant Thomas for $4,000 plus $1,000 attorney\u2019s fees; (2) against defendant Thompson for $2,395 plus $1,000 attorney\u2019s fees; (3) against defendant Surety for $2,395 plus $1,000 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">The sole appellant, Surety, directs our attention to three areas of disagreement with the municipal court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-6\">(1) The disciplinary provisions of the Contractor\u2019s License Law cannot be utilized to collect a debt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-7\">(2) Surety cannot be made liable for attorney\u2019s fees as it is not within the class of persons affected by Civil Code section 1717; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-8\">(3) The award of attorney\u2019s fees unfairly infringes on the rights of competing and future bond claimants..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">In rejecting these contentions and affirming the judgment of the municipal court the points adverted to will be examined in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">(1) Plaintiff\u2019s Rights Are Derived From Contract And Not From Disciplinary Provisions Of The License Law</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">Plaintiff is a direct, intended beneficiary of the bonding contract between the contractor, his responsible managing employee Thompson, and Surety. Civil Code section 1559 provides: \u201cA contract, made expressly for the benefit of a third person, may be enforced by him at any time before the parties thereto rescind it.\u201d It is not necessary that an express beneficiary be specifically identified in the contract; he may recover on it if he can show that he is one of a class of persons for whose benefit it was made. <em>(Rexroth &amp; Rexroth Inc. </em>v. <em>General Cas. Co. </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 363 [51 Cal.Rptr. 505].)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-12\">Surety agrees that the bond in question was issued pursuant to section 7071.5 of the Business and Professions Code. The section cited provides in part \u201c.. . Such contractor\u2019s bond . .. shall be for the benefit of (a) any person damaged as a result of a violation of this chapter by the licensee, (b) any person damaged by fraud of the licensee in the execution or performance of a contract. . . .\u201d In addition, the express wording of the bond itself, as set forth above (fn. 1) restates the statutory guidelines as a condition for recovery by the designated class of beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 28\">*Supp. 28</page-number>Surety does not attack the trial court\u2019s finding that the contract between Thomas and plaintiff was breached directly by Thomas, and thereby vicarious responsibility attached to Thompson. Thomas\u2019 acts and omissions are clearly within the purview and ambit of article 7 of chapter 9, (commencing at \u00a7 7090) of the Business and Professions Code. Appellant has not challenged the trial court\u2019s finding that the acts of Thomas were fraudulent as to plaintiff, despite the lack of allegations of fraud in the pleadings:</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">Faced with the express statutory language of section 7071.5 and the terms of the bonding agreement itself, Surety\u2019s reliance on <em>Swickheimer </em>v. <em>King </em>(1971) 22 Cal.App.3d 220 [99 Cal.Rptr. 176], is inapposite. Its facts are not in accord with those here. In <em>Swickheimer </em>recovery was sought directly against a licensed managing employee of a contractor for breach of contract. In the matter at bench the action is premised on the contractual and statutory liability of Surety on a bond issued for the direct benefit of plaintiff. No complaint is made here of the judgment against defendant Thompson by Surety, and Thompson himself has not appealed from the judgment against him. Plaintiff\u2019s rights against Surety were clearly derived from the contract itself and section 7071.5, and liability resulted therefrom rather than any disciplinary violation of article 7 of the contractor\u2019s law by Thomas or Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">(2) Surety Is Liable For Attorney\u2019s Fees Even Though Civil Code Section 1717 Is Not Applicable To It</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Surety contends that it cannot be held liable for the attorney\u2019s fees awarded against it by the trial court in the absence of either a contract or statute providing for such remedy. Respondent Boliver relies on section 1717 of the Civil Code as a basis for the trial court\u2019s award of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">A. <em>Surety is Not Directly Liable for Attorney\u2019s Fees by Virtue of Civil Code Section 1717</em></p>\n<p id=\"b962-8\">The construction contract between plaintiff Boliver and Thomas had a unilateral attorney\u2019s fees clause (fn. 2) for the sole benefit of Thomas. The contractor\u2019s bond contained no provisions for fees. In enacting section 1717 of the Civil Code the Legislature sought to eliminate the unfairness of unilateral provisions for attorney\u2019s fees by making their enforcement reciprocal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Coast Bank </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1971) 19 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 29\">*Supp. 29</page-number>581 [97 Cal.Rptr. 30]; <em>System Investment Corporation </em>v. <em>Union Bank </em>(1971) 21 Cal.App.3d 137 [98 Cal.Rptr. 735]; <em>International Industries Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cal.App.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Plaintiff Boliver was clearly entitled to the benefits of section 1717 and the judgment in her favor properly included an award of fees for her attorneys. However, Surety entered into no contract with the homeowner. It correctly contends that it cannot be held accountable for fees pursuant to section 1717 unless it was a party to an agreement containing some arrangement for the award of fees to one of the parties. Surety relies on section 1021 of the Code of Civil <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Browne </em>(1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 386 [103 Cal.Rptr. 775].</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">In <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Browne </em>the scope of Civil Code section 1717 was limited to parties \u201cto the contract\u201d and not enlarged to include \u201cparties to litigation involving attorney\u2019s fees clauses.\u201d The distinction, and extension, of this rule applied in <em>Babcock </em>v. <em>Omansky </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 625 [107 Cal.Rptr. 512] cited by respondent is likewise inapplicable here. As explained in <em>Schlocker </em>v. <em>Schlocker </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 921, 923 [133 Cal.Rptr. 485] \u201cIn that case <em>(Babcock </em>v. Omansky) the defendant\u2019s wife (who was awarded fees) was sued on allegations that, although not a signatory of the contract, she was liable thereon because of a joint venture between her and her defendant husband, who had signed the document in question. In other words, the wife was sued <em>on </em>an alleged contractual liability.\u201d No assertion is made here that Surety was a coventurer, agent or partner of Thomas. It is neither wise nor appropriate to further expand the benefits of Civil Code section 1717 to ensnare guarantors or other nonsigners of the contract who become parties to litigation as a result of corollary transactions or agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 30\">*Supp. 30</page-number>B. <em>Surety\u2019s Liability on the Bond Incorporates the Attorney\u2019s Fees Obligation of Contractors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Although foreclosed from collection of attorney\u2019s fees from Surety pursuant to Civil Code section 1717, another avenue is available to respondent in pursuit of her remedies. This involves an examination of the basic principles of suretyship law underlying Surety\u2019s contractual obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">Initially, Surety disclaims applicability of such principles to the statutory bond issued by it pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 7071.5. However, no distinction properly should be made, as contended, that a statutory license bond, such as that issued here, is of a different species than other typical bonds such as performance bonds, of labor and material bonds. All are of the same genre.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">\u201cA surety or guarantor is one who promises to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another....\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2787.)</p>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">While the statute, Business and Professions Code section 7071.5, and the contract at bench also include words of indemnity (\u201creimburse and hold harmless\u201d), it is well established that such verbiage will not destroy the contract as an agreement of surety. <em>(Mahana </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(1927) 88 Cal.App. 111 [263 P. 260]; Cal. Surety and Fidelity Bond Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1969) pp. 9, 10.) As indicated in the cited text, \u201c... a surety may offer any number of different kinds of protection to an obligee, and may condition and circumscribe its obligation in any manner acceptable to the obligee or required by statute; this may take the form of a promise to perform the contract if the principal fails to do so, or it may take the form of an indemnification against loss or liability through failure of the principal to perform; but it is all suretyship as long as the surety is answering for the debt or default of another person who is primarily responsible to the obligee.\u201d The bond before the court is patently a surety bond and is to be governed by the law of surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-9\">California has defined the obligation of a surety: \u201cWhen one assumes liability as surety upon a conditional obligation, his liability is commensurate with that of the principal . . . .\u201d Civil Code section 2808; \u201cThe obligation of a surety must be neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal. . . .\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 2809.) In this case the decreed liability of the principals Thomas and Thompson included an attorney\u2019s fee assessed by the court at $1,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 31\">*Supp. 31</page-number>each. If the obligation of Surety is commensurate with that of each of the principals, it properly should include their burden of attorney\u2019s fees as well as the basic liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">In <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1918) 37 Cal.App. 764 [174 P. 682], a contractor as principal, and defendants as sureties, executed a bond in favor of plaintiff-owner saving him harmless from all damages arising out of a building contract. The contract between owner and contractor did not have an attorney\u2019s fees clause. Certain lien claims were filed against the premises and not satisfied by the contractor. Judgment was rendered in favor of the owner for the amount required to pay the lien claims <em>and </em>for owner\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in contesting the action against him by lien claimants. The court held: \u201c \u2018The contractors failing to perform their covenant, plaintiff\u2019s only course of safety was to secure a release of his property by proceedings in court. To accomplish this result it was necessary to employ an attorney to represent him in such actions as were brought to enforce the liens.\u2019 The reasonable amount paid to his attorneys for those services was a direct and proximate damage resulting from the contractor\u2019s breach of his contract, and of a covenant thereof for which the bond was security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\"><em>Grace </em>v. <em>Croninger </em>(1922) 56 Cal.App. 659 [206 P. 130], involved a suit against a guarantor to recover rent due under a lease. The case is analagous to that before this court in that the basic lease had an attorney\u2019s fees clause in favor of the landlord. The guarantee included no such provision. The court interpreted section 2808 of the Civil Code as determinative of the issue and found that the liability of the guarantor thereunder was commensurate with that of the tenants, and found the guarantor liable for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">In the foregoing text, California Surety and Fidelity Bond Practice, <em>supra, </em>page 72, the authors state: \u201cIf the principal contract provides that the owner is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees if he successfully sues the contractor, he may recover attorney\u2019s fees incurred in a successful suit against the surety on the contractor\u2019s bond.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">Counsel have cited no applicable California precedents construing or interpreting Business and Professions Code sections 7071.5 and 7071.11 in conjunction with the factual posture presented by this case. They allege it to be a case of first impression in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 32\">*Supp. 32</page-number>Other courts, both state and federal, have dealt with the problem. Almost uniformly, when confronted with the elements of this case\u2014(a) a construction contract, (b) providing for attorney\u2019s fees to the successful litigant,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (c) supported by a contract of surety with a third party, (d) which surety contract does not specifically provide for the surety\u2019s liability for attorney\u2019s fees\u2014they impose liability for attorney\u2019s fees\u2014 they impose liability for attorney\u2019s fees upon the surety. Such liability is grounded upon several distinctive legal theories. Some courts ground the obligation on general equitable principles, others utilize the law of contracts prevailing in the jurisdiction. However, a majority of jurisdictions rely on general principles of surety law similar to that delineated in Civil Code sections 2808 and 2809, <em>supra. </em>Exemplars of such diverse applications are the following: <em>State </em>ex rel. <em>Grinnell Co. </em>v. <em>E. H. White Co. </em>(1960) 224 Ore. 483 [356 P.2d 943]; <em>Dale Benz Inc., Contractors </em>v. <em>American Casualty Company </em>(9th Cir. 1962) 303 F.2d 80; <em>Ferrier Brothers </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(Tex.Civ.App. 1962) 362 S.W.2d 181; <em>D &amp; L Construction Company </em>v. <em>Triangle Elec. Supply Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1964) 332 F.2d 1009; <em>National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburg, Pa. </em>v. <em>D &amp; L Construction Co. </em>(8th Cir. 1965) 353 F.2d 169; <em>City of Grandview, Missouri </em>v. <em>Hudson </em>(8th Cir. 1967) 377 F.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">We find no basis for departing from the general principles of suretyship law as pronounced in the early California cases, our legislative scheme, or as enunciated by the sister jurisdictions which have considered the issue. Surety\u2019s liability in the premises is prescribed by a harmonious consideration of the referenced Civil Code sections, and the Business and Professions Code sections, all of which manifest their remedial purpose of rendering whole the owner who contracts in reliance on a surety bond. Integration of the legislative purpose with the parties\u2019 contractual intent imposes liability for attorney\u2019s fees upon Surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">C. <em>Business and Professions Code Section 7071.11 Does Not Preclude an Award of Attorney\u2019s Fees Against Surety.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">The sixth paragraph of Business and Professions Code section 7071.11 provides, \u201cLegal fees may not be charged against the bond or cash deposit by the board.\u201d To construe this provision as exempting Surety from liability for attorney fees herein would require a strained construction of the statutory verbiage. If the section read, \u201cLegal fees may not be charged against the bond (by the surety) or the cash deposit by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 33\">*Supp. 33</page-number>board,\u201d it might then be interpreted as exempting both surety bonds and cash deposits in lieu of bonds from diminution by judgments or administrative determinations as to contractors\u2019 liability under the procedure established by the section. But the Legislature chose not to add the three words, \u201cby the surety,\u201d and as the statute is now written it must be interpreted that the Contractors State License Board may not charge for <em>its </em>legal fees in enforcing the disciplinary or bonding provisions of the act, and particularly section 7071.11 therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed. <em>(Metropolitan Water District </em>v. <em>Adams </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 620 [197 P.2d 543]; <em>Atherton </em>v. <em>Templeton </em>(1961) 198 Cal.App.2d 146 [17 Cal.Rptr. 680].) When not jurisdictional in their nature, remedial statutes of doubtful meaning must be liberally construed to effect their objects and suppress the mischief at which they are directed. They should not be given a strained construction that might impair their remedial effect. (45 Cal.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7 182; <em>California Grape etc. </em>v. <em>Industrial Welfare Comm. </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 692, 698 [74 Cal.Rptr. 313].)</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">The purpose of the bonding provisions of the contractors\u2019 law being to remedy the losses sustained by owners due to the improper or fraudulent activities of contractors, we hold that, as now written, section 7071.11 does not exempt Surety from payment of the fees claimed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">(3) Competing and Future Bond Claimants Are Not Prejudiced by the Payment of Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Surety contends that, by allowance of attorney\u2019s fees in this case, the amount available for payment to competing or future claimants will be diluted to their prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">First, there was no proof in the court below that there were conflicting claimants. If the aggregate sum of such conflicting claims exceeds the penal amount of the bond, the statute provides for proportionate distribution among all claimants. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7071.11, 1st par.) Even had there been competition among claimants, under the statutory scheme each would have the opportunity to make demand on the bond or deposit in the total or gross amount of their several claims. The statute does not distinguish between different types of claims, or segregate those including interest, court costs, attorney\u2019s fees, or punitive damages, for distinctive treatment. Had the Legislature intended such a result, it could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 34\">*Supp. 34</page-number>have molded the statute accordingly. As to future claimants, the statutory scheme sets forth no time schedule or limitation period, nor does it require the surety or board to await passage of a specific amount of time before payment is made to the claimant. As there has been no evidence of the existence of future claimants, further discussion of Surety\u2019s point in this regard is rendered futile by its speculative nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Second, it is asserted that the amount of the judgment, together with attorney fees, exceeds the penal sum of the bond. Section 7071.11 specifically states, \u201cThe aggregate liability of the surety for all claims of said persons shall, in no event, exceed the penal sum of said bond.\u201d The judgment against Surety was in the sum of $2,395, together with attorney fees in the sum of $1,000. While the total amount of $3,395 did exceed the $2,500 penal sum of <em>each </em>bond, it was not greater than the aggregate penal sums of both bonds. Surety\u2019s position in this regard is refuted by reference to section 7071.10 of the Business and Professions Code. This section provides for double coverage for claims such as the one before the court where the licensed contracting business is under the guidance of a licensed managing employee, other than the proprietor, a partner, or a responsible managing office*;. None of these exemptions being applicable here, the aggregate penal sum of $5,000 is the amount available for satisfaction of plaintiff\u2019s claim against Surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that it is appropriate and proper to allow recovery of attorney\u2019s fees against the surety on a contractor\u2019s bond issued pursuant to Business and Professions Code section 7071.5, where as here, the beneficiary on the bond has a statutory or contractual right to such fees from the principals thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">The judgment in the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Kirkpatrick, P.
