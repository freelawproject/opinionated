While it is within the jurisdiction of this court, under the statute, (Chapter 3129, Laws,) to award a <em>habeas corpus </em>and have a preliminary examination of a party arrested after affidavit and warrant, and discharge, commit to hail or remand into custody, still, the general rule is that this court should, under such circumstances, remand the party to the custody of the sheriff to be delivered to the magistrate issuing the warrant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b192-7\">2. While in such case au affidavit of the party that he has reason to believe, and does believe, that he cannot get a fair examination or secure justice before such magistrat\u00e9, coupled with the fact that two persons, charged with the murder with the aiding and abetting of which the prisoner is charged, and deemed by him to be essential witnesses, are confined in the jail of the county in which this court is sitting, are not deemed sufficient grounds upon which this court would have such examination ; still, if the ground of the alleged belief be on account of alleged prejudice against the party, and the Attorney-General for the State consents to such examination on the ground that it will \u201c save great expense to the State of Florida,\u201d this court will make such examination, and the testimony of witnesses may, in such case, by consent,,be taken before a commissioner.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b192-9\">The petition for a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was filed in the Supreme Court February 15, 1881.

The other allegations of the petition are stated in the opinion. It prays a writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>and an investigation by this court of the whole charge. Mr. Moseley, the sheriff, made return that he held under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>said warrant.' This warrant, a copy of which accompanies the return, recites that affidavit has been made that on February 8,1881, Charles Savage murdered Frank Paterson in Madison county, and that Eagan and one Howard E.

That the Supreme Court, both under the common law and the statutes of this State, possess ample power under the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>to exercise original jurisdiction over all matters relating both to the cause and manner of the detention of any person detained in custody charged with a criminal offence, and as the statute limits the inquiry to no particular form of process or cause of detention, it must extend to all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-10\">TT- That the extent to which the court shall exercise this power is a question entirely within the sound discretion of the court, itself, depending upon the circumstances and necessities of each case; the court pursuing such course as the interest of the public, the ends of justice and the rights of the petitioner may require.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-11\">The main question in this case then is : Can the interest of the public, the ends of justice and\u2019the rights of the pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>titioner best be subserved and protected, by remitting tbe examination to the magistrate who issued the warrant or can they best be subserved and protected by an examination before this court ? \"What is the wisest and best course-to pursue for the State and for the petitioner ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">The petition shows upon its face that the petitioner cannot obtain a fair examination before th\u00e9 magistrate who issued the warrant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">There is no law of the State which authorizes the trans-fer of the case by any proceeding to any other magistrate; and therefore unless the matter can be brought on an investigation had upon <em>habeas corpus </em>before another court, the petitioner is entirely without remedy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-7\">The petition shows that two important witnesses for the petitioner are now confined in the jail in this city, and, though not stated in the petition, it is a matter of public notoriety that these witnesses could not be taken to Madison without great difficulty and expense to the State. Either then the State must be put to a great expense and inconvenience to facilitate an object which might be as wbII accomplished here, or the prisoner must be deprived of important witnesses in the examination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-8\">The statute of 1819 evidently intends to confer upon both the Supreme and Circuit Judges, under the writ of <em>habeas corpus, </em>all the original powers of committing magistrates, and no other reasonable construction can be placed upon its various provisions. The object was to give these courts concurrent jurisdiction, or either to enable them to assume jurisdiction to the exclusion of inferior magistrates whenever the ends of justice and the interest of the public require such action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-9\"><em>John F.

The warrant is regular in form, and is properly endorsed by a Justice of the Peace for the county of Leon, of which county the respondent is sheriff. Respondent holds him as sheriff of Leon county under such warrant. There is no traverse of his return.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-5\">He is not held \u201c without lawful authority.\u201d The question is, does the statute (Chapter 3129) of 1879 propose or provide that the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>shall be used to release a prisoner from a <em>lawful holding ? </em>The writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>was not originally, nor do we believe our statute is, intended to interfere with the lawful and ordinary course of judicial proceeding. The statute does not propose to give to every one under arrest on a criminal charge, and before there has been an inquiry or committal examination, the arbitrary right to remove the inquiry or examination from the magistrate issuing the warrant to a Circuit or the SuSupreme Court, or the Judge of one of these courts. Hurd, 331, 332, 333, 334.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-6\">Assuming that the statute, by its terms, gives the <em>power </em>to the court or Judge, before whom the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>is returnable, to interrupt the proceedings of the Justice of the Peace before he has made an examination, and to finally dispose of the matter by committing without bail, or by requiring bail or by discharging the petitioner,we respectfully submit that such power should be exercised only upon the soundest discretion, and with such limitations as will give security against the abuse of this statute into a means of arbitrarily removing criminal examinations from Justices of the Peace to other tribunals. Kran\u2019s Case, 1 B. &amp; C., 257; Ormalie vs. Wentworth, 65 Me., 129; Gorsline\u2019s Case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>21 How.

No preliminary examination by the magistrate issuing the warrant followed its issuance. The petitioner here seeks an examination and proper order at the hands of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The first question which it is suggested arises concerns the jurisdiction and power of the court. We have examined this question. We have no doubt of our power, under the statute of this State, to hear the evidence, and to commit, admit to bail or to discharge, as' the facts may justify. In a case of this character, however, the exercise of this power is discretionary. The general rule, we think, would require us to commit the petitioner to the custody. of the sheriff of this court, with directions that he be taken before the magistrate for the purpose of investigating the charge. Ex-parte Krans, 1 Barn. &amp; Cress., 258. This rule, however, is subject to the exception that the court may, in its discretion \u2019and for good cause shown, have the examination itself. It is suggested by petitioner that the petition here discloses good cause, in that it is alleged that he has reason to believe, and does believe, that he cannot get a fair examination, or secure justice, before the said Justice of- the Peace in Madison county, and also because Charles Savage and H. James, tw'o important witnesses of petitioner, are now. confined in jail in Leon county, having been removed here for safe-keeping under the charge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>murder which it is alleged petitioner is charged w-ith aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">We cannot, in view of the results which must follow in .the matter of the exercise of their jurisdiction by magistrates, establish the rule that upon the pimple affidavit by a party arrested of reason to believe, and actual belief, that he will not get justice before the magistrate, we will arrest the exercise of his constitutional power and functions. To do so would be to establish a precedent which would practically destroy his power as a committing magistrate. The party should at least show 'by affidavit or otherwise some good reason for his belief, some good cause for this court; contrary to its general rule, to supersede the jurisdiction of this officer, and assume to ourselves 'functions which, under the Constitution arid the general legislative policy of the State, belong to another. Nor do we think the fact alleged as to the two witnesses sufficient. Under proper process of law, their testimony, if admissible, may be had before a proper magistrate. Again, from the nature of .this case it is more than probable that persons, other than those charged with the crime, witnessed whatever occurred, and if this be true there must be witnesses for the State, resident in Madison county, to be brought here. We cannot see from the pleadings before the court that there is any greater reason why the two witnesses for the petitioner should not be carried to Madison county rather than the witnesses for the State should be brought here. We think this is a matter to be controlled to a great extent by the officers representing the State in this cause, and their views would very properly influence our action to a considerable degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Upon the present pleadings we must remand the case to the magistrate for investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>After the foregoing opinion was delivered, Mr. John E. \"White,- State Attorney, and the Attorney-General,' seeing that great expense would be saved to the State by having the examination before the Supreme Court, determined for-this reason to consent to its proceeding with the case, and the Attorney-General so announced in open court, and the court thereupon decided to hear the case ; and by consent of counsel for the State and the petitioner an order was entered authorizing John M. Beggs, Clerk of the Circuit Court for Madison county, to take the testimony of certain witnesses residing in that county, and report the same to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The following testimony was taken by Mr. Beggs in Madison county; State Attorney John E. White, representing the State, and Mr. P. W. White, representing the petitioner, being present:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">C. W. Stephens being sworn on behalf of the petitioner says : I live in Madison, Madison county, Ela.; I am an attorney-at-law ; I know Dennis Eagan; I was in Madison on Tuesday the 8th Eebruary, 1881; I was with Mr. Eagan part of the morning of that day ; Mr. Eagan was acting as Notary Public in taking testimony in the case of Bisbee vs. Einley; Mr. S. Y. Einley and myself represented Mr. Einley in taking testimony; one witness had been examined and cross-examined, and another witness was just called to go on the direct examination when Mr. Eagan said we would not take any more testimony here; I think this occupied about three-quarters of an hour; Mr. Horatio Jenkins was representing the contestant, Mr. Bisbee; Mr. Eagan was recording the testimony, and I was also taking a copy of the testimony; there was firing of pistols in the far end of the room ; I presume caused him to get frightened and desist; I was sitting with my back towards the firing when I first heard it on the east side of the table <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>next to the door ; Mr. Einley was sitting on the same side of the table on my right; Mr. Eagan was sitting opposite me on the other side of the table with his face to the door, when we began taking testimony; 'Mr. Jenkins was sitting at the north end of the table with his face towards us ; the witness who had been on examination was a little to the left of Mr. Jenkins, about ea9t of the north end of the table; the remark made by Mr. Eagan, that he would take no further testimony, was after the shooting was over and I had gone down and returned to the court room; Mr. E. P. Paterson came in the room whilst we were taking testimony and sat down by me, and I did not notice when he got up and left me ; it was about fifteen or twenty minutes after he came in until the shooting occurred ; while sitting by me I think he was reading some testimony that was taken the day before on the Eagan plantation in the same case, or rather a copy of some testimony; I did not see the commencement of the shooting ; immediately after hearing the reports of the pistols in quick succession I jumped up and saw Howard E. James and Charles H. Savage and E. P. Paterson all together near the door of the court room; I saw Paterson as though he seemed to be pulling off from the two negroes, Savage and James; I left my seat and ran towards them as fast as I could ; by the time I got there Mr. Paterson had fallen and gotten up again; I had to look where I was going, as I was jumping from one bench to another to get to where they were standing, and made some noise going over benches ; Savage was standing about six or eight feet from the door in the court room ; I had heard distinctly three reports of a pistol before I got to them; when I was on the last bench, about five feet of Savage, who was in front of me, he leveled his pistol at me and said, \u201c don\u2019t you come hereI said, \u201cdon\u2019t you shoot me, sir,\u201d and immediately jumped off the bench and went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>to Mr. Paterson, who had just gotten up; I asked him, \u201c what is the matter, Frankhe answered, \u201c I am shot I then asked him if he was hurt much; he answered, \u201c yes, I am killed,\u201d and put his left hand up to his breast; we then walked by Savage and James, and I assisted him down stairs, where he got on a bed in a room down stairs; I then immediately went back up into the court room with the intention of seeing that the parties did not escape; by the time I got in the court room, Mr. Pollard, the town marshal, came in, and some one on the outside locked us up in the court room ; there were present in the room then Mr. Finley, Mr. Eagan, Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Pollard, the two negroes, Savage and James, a negro by the name of Burk Stevens, who had come up after the shooting, I think, and myself, were all that I remember that were locked up in the room ; we were awaiting the arrival of the sheriff with his posse; at the time the shooting occurred I think there was in the room Mr. Florrid, but he went down ahead of us ; Mr. Church had been in the room; I do not remember seeing him after the shooting, until I came back in the court room; if I remember right he was guarding the door; I did' not see Mr. Eagan after the shooting commenced, until after I had come back from down stairs ; the last I saw of him before I went to the parties he was sitting at the table before I got up; I was busy looking over a list of witnesses for the name of one who had been called for the contestant; when I got up and went to Mr. Paterson my impression is that Eagan and others were within the bar; I do not know that Mr. Eagan followed me, none that were engaged in the examination followed me out of the bar that I know of; my whole mind was fixed upon Paterson\u2019s danger; I do not remember hearing Mr. Eagan say anything, or any other person say anything more than I have related; Mr. Savage and James had both been in front <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>part of the court room ten minutes before the shooting, but they had disappeared from the bar, but I do not know whether they went out of the court room or not, and do not know of Mr. Eagan sending them out on any errand whatever-; the examination up to the time of the shooting was conducted in a perfectly quiet and orderly manner; Mr. Eagan did not take any part in the difficulty that I saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Cross-examined by the State:</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Mr. Eagan did not do anything to prevent the difficulty that I saw after it was commenced; I do not know that he got up off his chair until after I left the room witb Mr. Paterson; my impression is that Eagan, Savage and James were inside the bar when I came up from below,but I know that after that, while we were locked up waiting for the sheriff, Savage and James walked round in the room with their pistols in their hands; I saw James reloading his pistol inside the bar near where Mr. Eagan was standing; Mr. Eagan did not expostulate with him against reloading his pistol in my hearing ; I did not hear Mr. Eagan at any time speak to Savage and James in condemnation of their shooting of Paterson from the time he was shot until Eagan left; Mr. Paterson, while in the room prior to the shooting, conducted himself in a perfectly quiet and peaceable manner; there had not been any demonstration made either by Mr. Paterson or his friends to prevent from first to last the taking of the testimony prior to the shooting ; when I heard the first of the shooting I presume I must have been greatly excited; there was considerable noise and confusion in the room ; I do not remember what any person said, except what I have related, while the shooting was going on; there were five hundred and something more names on the paper I was looking over when the shooting began, which was a list of contestant\u2019s witnesses, and all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>that I knew were negroes ; the testimony of Charles Savage was taken the day before the killing, and was completed on that day, and was the only testimony taken on that day; the testimony was taken on the Eagan plantation two and a half miles from: town, in an out-house in the yard of Dennis Eagan ; I do not know why he (Savage) was in the court-house on the 8th, as his testimony had been taken and completed the day before; I was very .well acquainted with Savage prior to the time as to which I have been deposing, and also with Howard James; they had both been absent from this county some time, perhaps two months; I saw them in Jacksonville during the time; I am personally acquainted with Mr. Eagan; he claims to be a citizen of Madison county; he votes here, I know ; he had been absent for some time, in fact I think I have not seen him here since the November election, until a few days before Paterson was killed; Mr. Eagan said he was acting as Notary Public in taking testimony, and that he received his appointment from Governor Drew just before he went out of office; he showed his commission to Mr. Finley.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 Do you know of your own knowledge, or from Mr. Eagan\u2019s statements, why evidence in the contested election case of which you have deposed was taken at Eagan\u2019s plantation, and not at the couRt-house ?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 -I do not know of my own knowledge; General Jenkins remarked in the presence of Mr. Eagan that it was because they could take better care of the witnesses at the Eagan place.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 You have stated that you are well acquainted with Eagan, Savage and James. Do you know what the character of their relations were ?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 I consider them on very friendly terms; 'they were of the same political party.

Stephens sworn for the State says: I was present at the election in Madison November 2,1880, as one of the inspectors at Poll No. 2 ; during the day I saw Paterson, Eagan and Charles Savage, but not Howard James; I do not recollect seeing him, but think he was present before we completed the count; Mr. Paterson was a very ardent supporter of the Democratic ticket, and worked very hard for the nominees Mr. Eagan and Savage were leaders in the Republican party in this county ; Mr. Savage was one of the nominees for the Assembly by the Republican party; Mr. Eagan was a very ardent supporter of Savage as well as of the whole ticket; I did not on that day see any crimination or disturbances between said parties, but next morning very early, just after completing the count of the votes, there were some words passed between Eagan and myself, I think relative to a paper which Mr. Eagan desired to read to the inspectors; there were some words passed between Mr. Eagan and Paterson I think relative to that; I have forgotten what the words were, but I remember Mr Paterson stated something-about its being a hatched-up matter; I remember his using the words \u201chatched-up;\u201d he and Mr. Eagan had no kind feeling for each other, which this conversation indicated; this took place about daylight in the morning; when Mr. Paterson came into the court room the morning he was killed, Eagan and he did not speak to each other to my knowledge ; I was pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>\u2022ent and heard and copied the most of the testimony which Savage gave in the contested election case at the Eagan plantation the day before Paterson was killed; part of his testimony referred very materially to Mr. Paterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 Were those material allegations touching Mr. Paterson, to your knowledge, true or false ?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 Knowing Savage well, and also knowing Mr. Paterson well, and seeing Mr. Paterson\u2019s conduct during the day of the election, I believed that Mr. Savage testified falsely; I knew Mr. Paterson well, and regarded him as one of the most unoffending, amiable and most peaceable young men of my acquaintance in this or any other community.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">I cannot state whether the witness whose name I was looking for came into the court-house; I don\u2019t remember that I saw him ; I mean the second witness ; the first witness whose examination had been completed I am of the opinion left the room, for I saw him start out before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\"><em>W. </em>N. Densler being sworn deposed as follows : I reside in Madison, Ela.; my occupation is a merchant; I was in the court-house about the 8th February, 1881, at the examination of witnesses in the contested election case between Bisbee and Finley; I saw Mr. Frank P. Paterson in courthouse that day ; he was sitting at the table inside the bar, I think reading some testimony ; I don\u2019t think I saw him there more than one minute ; I had just got in wdien he handed the testimony to Charles S. Church that he was reading ; I sat down to read it with him, Charles Church ; I do not know what became of Mr. Paterson at the time, suppose he got up to go out; I was sitting just outside of the bar, on second bench, and Church was sitting in front of me on the first bench; I did not see Mr. Paterson any more until after the first pistol was fired; when I heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the first pistol fire I jumped up off' the bench, saw Charles Sayage with .his left arm around Frank Paterson\u2019s neck, and about that time I saw the second shot fired ; saw the flash of the pistol of Charles Savage; in a very short while Paterson-tore loose from Savage, and just as he tore loose from Savage and started to stumble I heard the third shot, but saw no flash ; Mr. Frank Paterson fell on the floor ; I don\u2019t remember whether he was helped up or got up by himself; he was taken by the arm by some one and led out at the door; Charlie Church, deputy sheriff, ordered no more shots to be fired in the house, and ordered Savage and Howard James to surrender and give up their pistols; Savage and James swore they would die before they would be arrested; Savage and James both had their pistols drawn all the while I was in the room ; Savage and James both retreated back towards the bar where Eagan was, and when they got back to where I was, being between them and Eagan, Mr. Pollard, the town marshal, ordered Mr. Church to close the door to keep them from going out and to keep others from coming in ; just at that time I left the room ; I do not know what Mr. Eagan was doing, more than sitting at the table, as I had just gone in ; I did not notice Mr. Eagan from the time the pistols fired until Mr. Paterson was led out at thedoor after he was shot; I never looked behind me but once; the firing of the pistols was the first knowledge I had of the difficulty; Savage and Paterson were about two or three feet from the door when I first saw them; I did not notice James at the time; I suppose the intervals between the reports of the pistols was about the time it would take to count four or five; Savage and Paterson separated after the second fire ; no one got to them, but Charlie Church got near there; Savage and Paterson were near the length of the room from Eagan when the firing commenced; I do not know whether Ea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>gan said or did anything on that occasion or not; I did not hear Eagan say anything; I did not hear Mr. Eagan say anything to Savage, James or Paterson ; I was sitting about ten or twelve feet from Mr. Eagan at first; I do not know whether he moved or not; I was sitting very nearly between Eagan aud the parties shooting when I first heard the pistol report; I did not advance towards Savage and-Paterson until the firing ceased ; I only stood up and turned around, facing them; I suppose I was about 35 or 40 feet from Savage and Paterson when the firing commenced ; when the firing occurred I think there was in the room myself, C. W. Stephens, Charlie Church, Howard James, Mr. Paterson, Charles Savage, Mr. Eagan, Mr. Finley and Mr. Jenkins, are all that I can remember being in the room, but others came in after; I do not remember seeing Mr. Florrid in the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Cross-examination by the State:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">From the time I jumped up and turned around, when I heard the pistol fired, my attention was mainly directed to the combatants; from the time I got up I was looking at' them until the firing was all over; I do not remember hearing anything said behind me in the bar until after the.-firing ceased ; during the time of the firing I was intensely engaged in what was going on in front of me; after the. firing ceased I heard Mr. Finley say, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake dis-' arm those men ;\u201d\"that was all I heard from any one behind me in the bar ; if Mr. Eagan said anything I did not hear him ; Mr. Finley was on his feet when he spoke ; I do not remember seeing Mr. Eagan at that time; neither do I! recollect- seeing Mr. Jenkins at that time ; Mr. Eagan was the only citizen of Madison county that remained behind-the bar after the firing commenced; Mr. Stephens and Eagan Avere the only citizens of Madison county behind the bar that I remember Avhen the firing commenced, and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Stephens ran immediately to the combatants ; I do not know that Mr. Eagan changed his position at that time at all; when the firing commenced I suppose the parties were about forty feet from me, and when it ceased they were about thirty feet from me ; Charles Savage fired the second shot; I saw him shoot it and the flash of his pistol; I am satisfied he did not fire the third shot; from the shots being in the room I could not tell from what direction the sound came, nor did I see the smoke or flash from the third shot; Paterson had just torn loose from Savage, and was stumbling or falling when the third shot was fired ; judging from the position J ames was in when the firing ceased, Paterson was nearer him than he was when the first or second shot was fired ; Mr. Paterson was not making any resistance or assaulting either of the parties when the second and third shots were fired, but was trying to get away; from the position Savage occupied,held his pistol when the second shot was fired, the ball would have entered Paterson\u2019s breast; after the shooting, when James and Savage had their pistols in their hands, when they were ordered by the deputy sheriff, Church, to surrender, and swore they Would die before they would be arrested, Mr. Eagan did not in my hearing say anything to induce them to surrender ; I did not hear Mr. Eagan tell Savage and James to give up their pistols, Avhen they were ordered to do so by the deputy sheriff; the order of the deputy sheriff to them to surrender and give up their pistols was made in the presence of Mr. Eagan, and loud enough for him to have heard the order; Eagan was about thirty feet from the deputy sheriff when he made the order for Savage and James to surrender and give up their pistols ; Savage and James were at the time about five or six feet from the deputy sheriff; this occurred immediately after the firing; Mr. Paterson had left the room at the time these orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>were made by the deputy sheriff; from where Eagan was sitting at the table when I went in he had full view at the door ; the conduct of Mr. Paterson, while I saw him in the court room in the bar, was peaceful and respectful to those therein; Eagan\u2019s conduct was also peaceful and quiet to those therein, so far as I saw ; Mr. Eagan did not speak to Mr. Paterson in my presence at all; Mr. Paterson was remarkable for his peaceable and quiet disposition in this community; I have known him since the fall of 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">B.

Hankins sworn on the part of the State says : I am sheriff of Madison county, Fla., and was on the 8th February inst.; this gun I have in my custody I took from Edmond Burroughs; I think it is known as a Springfield cavalry army rifle; it is a breech-loader, and shoots Cartridge No. 45; it was loaded when I took it from Burroughs ; I took the gun on the 8th February, the day that Paterson was shot; I have been handling guns since I was eight years old; I cannot say positively whether it had ever been shot or not, but from the looks of the gun I thought it never had ; it is a new gun; when I got the gun the tallow that is used in packing new guns for shipment was still to be seen on the breech and muzzle of the gun ; from my knowledge of fire-arms I consider this a very deadly weapon, and one that can be fired very rapidly ; I found some cartridges in Howard James\u2019 coat-pocket that fits this gun; I found the cartridges after Paterson was killed; the cartridges would not fit any other gun that I could find; there has been five military companies here and the cartridges would not fit any of their guns ; I arrested Savage and James after Paterson was shot; the arrest was made in the court room; when I first entered the court room they were standing between the table and the judge\u2019s stand; Mr. Eagan was on the side of the table they were, and Mr. Jenkins was at the north end of the table ; Savage and James each had a pistol in the hand at the time; I thought at first, from their actions, they did not intend'to give up; I then told Savage that I had a warrant for him, and said I was going to arrest him ; I went ahead of the posse; he met me and asked me to protect him, and handed me his pistol; James walked across the floor for perhaps a minute with pistol in hand, myself and Savage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>between him and the posse; he finally gave his pistol, I think to the town marshal, Mr. Pollard, who handed the pistol to me, and surrendered ; Savage\u2019s pistol was a large British bull-dog self-cocking pistol, carried a Cartridge No. 44 ; it is a five-shooter ; it is not a new pistol; the pistol taken from James is a small nickle-plated new five-shooter ; shoots No. 82 cartridges ; when I got the pistol from Savage it had but one empty shell in it, the other chambers were loaded; the pistol taken from James was fully loaded, but had been snapped, as the pistol showed, by the indention on the cartridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 Do you know whether their pistols had been reloaded after Paterson was shot, and if so, how do you know it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 Howai\u2019d James said to me in the presence of Mr. Eagan, \u201c you know I did not shoot for my pistol is all loadedhe ran up to me in the excitement and said, <em>\u201c </em>what do you want with me, I did not shoot, my pistol is all loaded,\u201d and repeated this several times on the way to the jail; about the time we got to the jail Savage said, \u201c hush, Howard, you reloaded as I didHoward remarked, \u201c I did not shootI said to Savage, \u201c one barrel of your pistol is empty he said, \u201c no sir, I shoved all the empty cartridges out with Mr. Eagan\u2019s pen-holder and reloaded I examined the wound in Mr. Paterson\u2019s left hand; the wound was on the finger next to the little finger ; it was shot right through; from my knowledge of fire-arms it was impossible for the wound to have been made by a ball from Savage\u2019s pistol; I think as large a ball as Savage\u2019s pistol carried it would have cut off the finger ; the wound was a round hole through the finger, looked like it might have been made with a buck-shot; Mr. Paterson had a very small finger; I don\u2019t think the ball tote out on either side of the finger, but went right through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>finger; when I came to make the arrest there was a large crowd of excited people around the court-house; I placed a guard at the door to keep the negroes from going up stairs uutil I made the arrest; some of the negroes were armed; I saw one double-barrel gun, and some of them had sticks ; Burk Stephens\u2019 wife was in a wagon with a gun calling to the crowd to come on and show themselves as men ; the wagon that Burk Stephens\u2019 wife was in was about twenty feet from the court-house door; I do not know whether that wagon left when Mr. Eagan left or not; I did hot see Mr. Eagan when he left; I saw a crowd running in the direction of the colored school-house, and Burk Stephens\u2019 wagon with them; I did not see Eagan in the crowd ; I was about one hundred and fifty yards from the crowd; there was a warrant placed in my hands for the arrest of Eagan that P. M. at half-past five o\u2019clock ; I got to his place about or near dusk; I did not arrest him, as I did not find him; I searched for him; I never saw Mr. Eagan any more after the day of the killing of Paterson until I saw him in jail in Tallahassee.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">I do not know Mr. Einley ; do not know whether he was in the room or not; I saw in the room Mr. Pollard, C.

Stevens and Pollard were on the north side of the house outside of the bar; I was excited and might have overlooked others in the'house; I kept my eyes on Savage and James, as they had pistols drawn; Savage and James were about ten feet from where Eagan was standing, who was a little to the north of the centre of the table on the west side of l^ie table; Savage and James were about the middle of the hallway, between the table and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>judge\u2019s stand, on the west side of the table, and to Eagan\u2019s right; they were all facing towards me; I do not know whether Mr. Eagan heard the remark of Howard James about reloading the pistol or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Redirect examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The remarks of Howard James about reloading his pistol was uttered in language sufficiently loud to have been heal\u2019d by Mr. Eagan from the position they occupied.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The remark was addressed to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 Is it probable that Mr. Eagan, under the excitement of the occasion, would have heard or paid any attention to the remark as addressed to you unless his attention was there drawn to it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 I do not think he would have heard it unless his attention had been called to it, for he was badly excited at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">W. R. Boyd being called and sworn in behalf of the State says: I am a lawyer bj* profession, and live in the town of Madison ; I use as a law office a room under the room used as a court room, the same also being used as a sheriff\u2019s office; I was in my office on the morning of the 8th February inst. when Frank Paterson ivas shot; I was reading at the time; I heard two shots fired in quick succession in the court room above, and considerable commotion of persons moving about, or appeared to be ; immediately after the firing of those two shots I heard .some person in the room over head speak very loudly, saying, \u201c shoot him again,\u201d and another shot was then immediately fh\u2019ed ; before the last shot was fired I jumped up out of my seat, threw my book down and went directly to the door of the room I occupied; I think the last shot was fired about the time I jumped up; I am certain it was fired before I got to the door; I was in the act of getting up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>wlien I heard the words \u201c shoot him again the door of my office that I went to is the door that opens to the street on the south side of the building ; when I got. to the door I saw several colored men in the street moving towards the entrance that leads to the stairs of the court room ; nearly every one was armed with a stick, and seemed to be considerably excited; I started into Judge Witherspoon\u2019s office which was adjoining mine, and met him as he was descending the steps of his office; he said, \u201c Boyd, run across the street and get a doctor, the first you meet;\u201d I asked him, \u201c who for ?\u201d he said, \u201c Frank Paterson ;\u201d he said, <em>\u201c </em>he is shot or killed,\u201d I forget which, I disremember; I ran across the street and saw Dr. Sessions, and called to him to come over to the court-house; I came immediately back; T passed by a crowd of negroes in front of the court-house, all along in front of the building ; I suppose there must have been between seventy-five and one hundred negroes in front of the building; some of them had been sitting on my steps; they jumped up when the firing commenced ; I saw this crowd of negroes as they commenced gathering that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 Did you see anything in connection with the assembling of the negroes at the court-house that morning before the shooting that attracted your attention ?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 I noticed particularly nearly all of them were armed with sticks ; I can swear that I saw Savage in the crowd that\u2019 morning; I do not know Howard James; I did not see Eagan in the crowd; I saw him pass the front street, but did not see him go to the court-house.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 \"Were any fire-arms exhibited by the people congregated in front of the court-house door, about or near the time of the shooting ?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 There were fire-arms exhibited soon after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>shooting; I saw them when I returned from across the street, which was five or ten minutes after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 Who had them, and what was their deportment?</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 There was a negro woman standing in a wagon about ten or fifteen feet from the court-house, and about twenty-five feet from the court-house entrance, holding in her hands a double-barrel shot-gun, crying out to the negroes, \u201c to go up in to the court-house and take them men and not to let them take them, and not to go up with nothing, but come there and get the gun or guns,\u201d I do not know which; she told the negroes to be men and not to be cowards; this she repeated frequently; I went to the wagon and told her to put down the gun; she laid it down across the seat; I saw her immediately with the gun in her hands again exhorting them as before; this woman was Yine Stephens, the wife of Burk Stephens; \u2019 among other things she said the white men would soon be there with their guns, now is the time; when I first saw her with the gun the sheriff\u2019 and posse had not gone up stairs, but went up immediately; when the posse came down stairs with the prisoners, and afterwards there were several parties trying to calm the crowd of colored people below, I for one said to those people that the prisoners were in the hands of the law, and let the law take its conrse; Mr. 8. Y. Einley, Judge Witherspoon, Dr. Sessions and Mr. Spradley were among those who made an effort to calm them; after the posse came, and while Einley and others were trying to calm the colored people, or about that time, I observed Mr. Eagan and General Jenkins ; if they were endeavoring to calm the crowd I did not observe it; Mr. Eagan remained but a very short time in front of the court-house; Mr. Jenkins and he started off, and the negroes crowded around them, and they went off together; they went off in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>direction of the drug store, which is in the direction of his house, immediately this side of the drug store; I saw him last still surrounded by the negroes; it is about 150 yards from the court-house to where I saw him last; I think there were fifty or sixty negroes went off with Eagan and Jenkins ; there might not have been that many ; I could not tell what part of the room the words came which I heard, \u201c shoot him again ;\u201d my office is under the court room, between the centre and east end of the court room ; I am certain the words \u201c shoot him again \u201d was spoken before the last fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">I don\u2019t think it was exceeding three seconds between the second and last fire ; I heard three reports, and no more; I did not recognize anything else that was said in the i\u2019oom above; I did not recognize the voice; there was not any perceptible excitement among the negroes outside of the court-house before the firing commenced ; I did not notice any guns in the hands of the negroes that day, except the shot-gun the woman had ; the crowd that went off with Eagan and Jenkins did not display any fire-arms that I saw ; I never saw Eagan and Jenkins until immediately after the sheriff came down from the court room with the prisoners; Eagan looked very pale; he did not speak as though he was much excited; he spoke to Jenkins something about going home ; was the only words I heard him utter; I am not personally acquainted with Mr. Eagan; my acquaintance with him was not sufficiently so as to recognize his voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">J.

F. Florrid sworn on behalf of the State says: I reside in the town of Madison, Madison county, Fla.; I am a merchant ; I was in the court room on the morning of the 8th February inst. when Frank Paterson was shot; he was shot by Charles Savage; I am sure there were three shots fired ; I was standing up at or near the bar ; there was one seat between me and the bar; when the shooting commenced I was about four feet north of the entrance of the bar; when the second shot was fired I had turned around and walked up near where the combatants were; I suppose I was within five or six feet of them when the second shot was fired; immediately after the second fire I heard a voice in the room say, \u201c shoot him again\u2019 this was just before the third fire ; I did not see any person in front of me at the time but those three men, Savage, James and Paterson ; I don\u2019t remember there being any person either on my right or left at the time I heard the voice; I did not recognize the voice ; there was such an excitement in the room I cannot tell from what part of the room the sound of voice came; I looked around to see, but could not see or discover from which direction the sound of the voice came; my face was to the east before I looked around ; there were some gentlemen behind me at that time, but I cannot call any names, neither do I know how many ; I mean in the west end of the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 At the time you heard the words \u201c shoot him again,\u201d was Mr. Eagan in the front or on either side of you ?</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>Answer </em>\u2014 I do not know where Mr. Eagan was at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"AqUi\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 At the time, you heard those words, did you see any one on your right or left, or in front, other than Savage, James and Paterson ?

R. Spradley sworn on behalf of the State says : I live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>in Madison county, Fla., about twenty-six miles from the court-house; my occupation is that of a farmer; I was in Madison at the court room the morning of the 8th February inst. when Frank Paterson was killed ; I came to town that morning to bring a load of cotton and to pay my taxes; I had a letter for Mr. Frank Paterson, and was informed he was at the court-house; went over to see him; I know Howard James, Charles Savage and Dennis Eagan, all three; I saw them all that day; I first saw Savage and James that day on the stair steps leading up into the court room as I was going up to see Mr. Paterson; I had stopped on the platform where the steps turns and was coughing; they (James and Savage) passed me while I was stopping ; they were going up into the court room; they were together ; I noticed as they turned up the steps from where I was standing coughing Savage had a pistol in his right hand holding it behind him under his coat tail; in about a minute after this I went up to the court room door ; I did not go into the court room because I saw Mr. Paterson coming towards me when I got to the door; Mr. Paterson had just left the table in the bar and was coming towards me when I first saw him; I saw Howard James and Charles Savage also at that time; Savage was standing about seven or eight feet inside from the door, and James about ten or twelve feet from the door inside towards the bar'; I do not know what they were doing there; they were just standing there; they were near the carpet leading to the door to the left or south side of the carpet; when Mr. Paterson got to where Savage was he (Paterson) had a paper in his hand.; I cannot say what was the position of the hands of either James or Savage were at that time; Mr. Paterson held out the paper he had in his hand to Savage and said, \u201cthe man that swore to that perjured himself;\u201d Savage blustered out with an oath, \u201c damn you,\u201d and about that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>time he gathered hold of Paterson and fired a pistrtl at him; Savage caught Paterson with the left hand around the neck and by the coat collar; that was when he fired the first shot; he jerked Mr. Paterson back and put the pistol against his breast and fired the second shot; there were three shots fired in all; between the second and third shots I heard some person say, \u201c shoot him again ;\u201d those-words were spoken in the court room ; I am well acquainted with Dennis Eagan, and have been ten or twelve-years ; I was tolerable well acquainted with his voice; I cannot swear point blank that it was Eagan\u2019s voice, but was impressed at the time that it was his voice that uttered the words \u201cshoot him again ;\u201d the voice appeared to come from the direction of the bar ; the third shot was fired immediately after I heard the words ; it was a very short time between the second and third shots ; I reckon I could have counted one, two, three, four between the shots; I did not go in the court room ; I came down stairs immediately after the firing, and found a large crowd around the door of the courtrhouse, principally colored people, and there appeared to be a good deal of excitement among them; I saw one woman have a double-barrel shot-gun in her hands ; I saw three other guns in a wagon ; one of the guns in the wagon was a double-barrel shot-gun, the others I cannot describe as they were covered up with a shawl; I only saw the breech of them ; the woman I saw with the gun was standing up in the wagon where the other guns wTere ; she was telling the men around the wagon to take the guns up stairs and take those men out of there ; I saw the wagon go off from that place when it left; there were forty or fifty went off with the wagon; Eagan and Jenkins stai\u2019ted off and the wagon and crowd followed after them; they went by Dial\u2019s store, which is in the direction of Eagan\u2019s place from the court-house ; I saw Eagan and Jenkins as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>they came down from the court-room; they remained but a very short time; they just come down and went right off; did not remain more than three to five minutes; at the time they came down there were several persons endeavoring to pacify these people; Mr. Beggs and Judge Witherspoon I recollect, and I also was endeavoring to talk to several; Mr. Eagan and Jenkins did not make any effort to quiet the crowd, as I saw they did not stay long enough; I saw a great many sticks and clubs in the hands of the colored people around the court-house door; Eagan and Jenkins were afoot the last I saw of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">I cannot tell exactly how long it was between the first and second shots ; I reckon it was about two or three sec onds ; it wTas just as quick as it could be, one shot right after the other ; it was about four or five seconds between the second and third shots; when Savage said to Paterson \u201c damn you,\u201d he gathered Paterson ; Paterson done nothing that I saw, except tried to shove him off; I saw Mr. Eagan before Mr. Paterson came out of the bar ; there was no disturbance in the court-house before this encounter took place ; about the time of the first fire Eagan and all the rest in the bar got up and advanced towards the door, or I think so; there might have been some left there; they were crowding in the aisle, so that I don\u2019t know that all advanced ; this was after the first fire; I do not know that I saw Eagan after the first firing; the last time I saw him in the court he was about eight or ten feet from the table outside of the bar; I did not take any particular notice; the second shot had been fired before he came out of the bar; I think he started, about the time the second shot fired; I saw Savage when he fired the second shot; I saw Paterson and this man James and several others around the scene of the shooting at this time; I was standing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>left hand side of the door on the outside facing the judge\u2019s stand, leaning against the facing of the door; from the beginning of the shooting to its termination did not include a space of time more than seven or eight seconds ; it was a very short time after the firing of the first shot; there was much excitement and confusion in the room, but little noise except the shooting; I was somewhat excited of course, but not much ; I was not scared; I did not hear any other words that I can recall during the time of the shooting, except the words \u201c shoot him again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Redirect examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">I heard other words during the shooting, but I cannot recall them ; the words I heard, \u201c shoot him again,\u201d were louder than any I heard ; when Savage said to Paterson, \u201c damn you,\u201d he then gathered Paterson around the neck with his left arm ; if Paterson had struck Savage I would have seen it; I was looking right at them; they were close to me.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Mrs. E. A. Miller sworn on the part of the State says: I live near the suburbs of the town of Madison, Ela., about three-quarters of a mile from the court-house; I am the wife of J. L. Miller; my residence is on the route from the Eagan place to town ; I reside about one hundred yards from the colored school-house; I was at home on the morning of the 8th February, 1881.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\"><em>Question </em>\u2014 If you saw or heard anything that morning at the colored school-house, or near it, that attracted your attention, please state what it was, and as near as you can who were present ?</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\"><em>Answer </em>\u2014 My attention was attracted to the gathering of a large crowd of negro men at the corner of the schoolhouse next to the road ; they continued to gather there, some going up town and back again, and boy on a horse up to town and back again several times ; seemed to be acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>as a courier; I did not see any guns at that time; they had sticks and were gesticulating to each other excitedly; I don\u2019t think there were less than a hundred in the crowd ; I noticed a wagon there and one woman and one man in the wagon; Mr. Eagan and another gentleman came up in a buggy; it could be called a stop he made; he turned his head as if speaking to them, and drove on, and the whole crowd followed him towards town; I noticed particularly that nearly every one had a stick as they moved on towards 'town; the man and woman that were in the wagon went on with the crowd and carried the wagon with them; I do not know the names of the man and woman that was in the wagon ; I think it was ten or eleven o\u2019clock when they left the school-house ; I did not notice the time particularly ; I know Mr. Eagan well enough to know that it was him in the buggy ;\u25a0&gt; I was very much excited after my servant returned from towards the school-house after talking with some of the crowd; this servant is a colored woman; her name is Amelia; you mistook her name in the summons for her; her name was down as Milley ; she is still at my residence; I saw Mr. Eag%n again that day as he returned in the direction of his place; it was over an hour I expect after I saw him going towards town ; I was more excited then because he came with such a crowd, and because of his usual direction towards his place, passing near my gate; there was not less than fifty, nearer one hundred, with him, all colored people, except one white man whom I took to be a United States Marshal; I did not notice any weapons or sticks in that crowd, but noticed the same wagon and the man in it, but the woman I did not notice; there was no other person in the wagon; Mr, Eagan was on foot, with a cigar in his mouth, but it was not lighted; the crowd and wagon were close to Eagan; I did not see any weapons or sticks; the excitement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>high, and I did not notice; there was a crowd going to the jail; I did not know at that time that Paterson had been shot; very soon after Eagan passed towards the schoolhouse ; there was squads of negro men coming in from the direction of the school-house towards town armed with guns; they came in squads; I saw a squad of four on horseback, and a squad of three on horseback with arms, and a squad of four on foot with arms, and other single persons with arms ; I don\u2019t know how many ; they were moving rapidly and excitedly; it was not a half hour after Eagan passed out of my sight until I saw the first of the armed colored people; they came the route Eagan went off on ; the bulk of the crowd passed my house with Mr. Eagan going to town, and Judge Tidwell came on in the rear; he had a stick also ; he usually walks with a stick.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">I did not recognize the negroes that came in squads with arms as those that had gone out with Eagan, for I did not notice them individually, as they went out with him, nor those that came in armed, sufficiently to say whether they were the same or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">John L. Stewart*sworn by the State says: I am a Presbyterian minister of the Gospel; when at home I reside in Trenton, Ontario, Canada; on the morning of the 8th February, 1881, I was at Major John L. Miller\u2019s; I left home in Canada the 9th day of December last; I first came to Jacksonville and remained there two weeks, and then came to Madison. At this point by consent, and the witness being an invalid, the evidence of Mrs. E. A. Miller was read over to witness, and he was asked if the testimony of Mrs. Miller is correct, and if he had heard what was therein stated. To which the witness replied, it is correct up to the time that we got the word that Mr. Paterson was shot; I then immediately left Major Miller\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>to go to Mr. Paterson, and remained with him until he \u2022died ; it was not more than fifteen minutes after Mr. Eagan passed by Major Miller\u2019s on his way towards his place before we heard of the shooting; I saw a few colored people in the morning armed with guns who went up towards town after the gentleman who was pointed out to me as Mr. Eagan; he drove through the crowd and spoke, and the buggy drew up a little, and the crowd filed in after him, and those having arms were with the crowd ; I only noticed a few with arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Amelia Daniels sworn on behalf of the State says: I live at Major John Miller\u2019s; I was living there the day Mr. Paterson was killed ; I am cooking for Mrs. Miller; on that morning of that day I saw a crowd of colored people at the colored school-house; that school-house is near Mr. Miller\u2019s ; I could not do my work, I got so scared ; I had to go and tell Mrs. Miller of it; I did not talk with any of them; I did not go out of the house to them; I saw a little boy running by the gate, and he said <em>\u201c </em>the white people had been killing up the black people and they were not going to stand it any longerI can\u2019t tell how old the boy was; he was a good sizable child ; I believe he must have been about thirteen years old; he came right from the school-house; I do not know the name of the boy; I never saw him since ; I was cleaning off the breakfast table when this occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">I can\u2019t tell you how high he was; he was a good sizable child; the boy was about four feet high ; I had never seen the boy before as I know of; I am hard of hearing, and not so very hard neither; I do not know how old I am; I am not so very old.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">D. L. M. Walker sworn on behalf of the State says : I live about one mile from this place on the road leading to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Mr. Eagan\u2019s; I was at home working in my garden the day that Mr. Paterson was killed; it is about one mile and a. half from my house to Mr. Eagan\u2019s; I know Mr. Eagan when I see him; I saw Mr. Eagan that morning as he was coming to town, him and another gentleman in a buggy; they passed my house about eight o\u2019clock; it was pretty early, the sun was not very high ; there were several colored footmen and some, three or four riding passed with him ; I saw him again that day ; as near as I can come at it I think it was between eleven and twelve o\u2019clock I saw him ; he was going back towards his house ; he passed by my house; he was in a two-horse wagon ; there was another white man with him, and I suppose between ten and fifteen colored men with him in the wagon; it was about as full as it could get; there was also between 40 and 50 colored men on foot in a run trying to keep up with the wagon ; I did not hear any conversation byr the parties that were with the wagon ; a short time after a colored woman and four or five men came along going the same way towards Mr. Eagan\u2019s walking fast; I heard her say that Burk Stephens was too smart for them, they would not get him; she made this remark to the colored men that was with her ; she used the remark as they passed by my house; I know Burk Stephens and his wife ; it was his wife that made use of the remark I have related; I had not seen that wagon before on that day that. I recollect of; I took it to be Dennis Eagan\u2019s own wagon ; I had seen infrequently before that day passing my house; I did not see any arms with the crowd that, went out with Mr. Eagan, but in about twenty-five or thirty minutes after Mr. Eagan passed my place, I suppose there was twelve or fifteen men came back from towards Mr. Eagan\u2019s with guns ; I took some of them to be some of the same men that was following after the wagon; some of them were riding and some of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>them were on foot; they passed by my house and went on towards town ; they were walking pretty fast ; I do not know where Burk Stephens was living on the 8th February; I know where Burk Stephens lived last year; he was living on a place he contracted with Captain Inglis for, near what is known as the Croom place, about two and a half miles south of town; I suppose the nearest route you could go it would be a mile and a quarter, or a mile and a half, from Eagan\u2019s place; in coming from that place to town it would not be the nearest way to come by Eagan\u2019s; when the wagon passed my house going towards Eagan\u2019s they were going at full speed, between a loap and a run, the footmen could not keep up.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">After the preceding testimony had been filed in the Supreme Court, the following witnesses were examined on February 25th, 1881, in open court:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">S. Y. Finley, sworn as a witness for the petitioner, testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">I-reside in Jacksonville ; name S. Y. Finley ; am a lawyer ; on the 8th of February, A. D. 1881, was in Madison, Madison county, Florida; was there as' counsel for contestee in the contested election case of Bisbee vs. Finley ; the proceeding being had was taking testimony before D. Eagan, acting as Notary Public, on Tuesday the 8th February, A. D. 1881; I was taking the testimony at what was called \u201c the old court-house;\u201d on that day one witness had been called by contestant\u2019s counsel; I think I had cross-examined him ; the taking of testimony up to this time had been going on about 15 or 20 minutes ; there were present beside myself General Jenkins, representing Bisbee, and a lawyer named Stevens who was assisting me; the official testimony was being reduced to writing by Mr. Eagan; the room in which testimony was being taken was up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>stairs ; the position of parties during the taking of the testimony of first witness was about as follows: Mr. Eagan sat with his back to Judge\u2019s bench, being between bar-table and bench, with face to the east and towards the door; General Jenkins sat at north side of bai\u2019-table to the left of Mr. Eagan; Mr. Stevens and I sat with backs to the door on the east side of the bar-table confronting Mr. Eagan, Stevens on my left; the first witness sat on my right, occupying the relative position to Mr. Eagan that Mr. Stevens and I did to Mr. Eagan; the diagram is correct according to my recollection, except that Mr. Eagan sat a little nearer to the centre of the table; during the examination of this witness I have a very positive impression that Mr. Prank Paterson was in the bar i\u2019eading a document which 1 supposed was the testimony in the ease taken the day before; Paterson sat at this time, according to my impression, in the rear and rather to the left of Mr. Stevens ; the man, Charles Savage, was all about there, in and out of the bar; he (Charles Savage) was, according tq my best impression, engaged in no duty; his testimony had been completed in the county the day before ; it had been, as I understood, signed up and completed at Eagan\u2019s house the night before in the country; as explanation I would state that on the previous day we vu-ote no testimony except as to examination as to first witness; on the day before we had some talk about inconvenience of meeting at Mr. Eagan\u2019s house, the matter was alluded to several times; before adjournment it was agreed that we would meet next morning in town; no particular place was designated ; Mr. Stevens, my associate counsel, invited the party to take testimony at his office, saying that he would have a fire, and it would be convenient, but there was no definite place determined upon in town ; next morning when Mr. Eagan and General Jen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>kins came to town they went to the court-house,not to Mr. Stevens\u2019 office, and when we found them they were there; Mr. Steveus and I went around there too; when we got-there we found a great many colored people assembling there and around there; when we got there we went up stairs and found 'Mr. Eagan in the court room sitting about as marked on the diagram ; don\u2019t know whether General Jenkins was there then or not, if not he came in soon; General Jenkins had obtained leave to take testimony there, and we were proceeding to business; there was some talk between Mr. Eagan and General Jenkins, some inquiry as to how the witnesses were to be gotten up stairs ; it was suggested either by General Jenkins or Mr. Eagan that somebody be instructed to call witnesses as needed, and Mr. Eagan suggested Charles Savage as the party to perform that duty; he (Savage) was there seeming to take great interest in the matter; it just happened that way I think; there was no concert in the matter; I don\u2019t know whether he called the witnesses or not; after the examination of the first witness I can\u2019t say positively whether another was called or not; up to that time the proceeding was conducted in an orderly, pleasant and a peaceable way; Mr. Eagan during the examination of this witness was pleasant and respectful; he discharged his duty quietly; there was no disorder in the room at this time; at this time I don\u2019t know whether there was any disorder outside of the court room or not; the proceeding was interrupted after we had examined the first witness and were preparing to examine the second witness ; there was an interruption and confusion produced by the firing of a pistol; after hearing this I looked around towards the door and saw Charles Savage near the door with a bright and glittering pistol in his hand, and another party very close to him; Savage seemed to be moving his pistol about as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>though he was trying <em>to get the </em>range of the other party ; did not know who the other party was at the time; I can\u2019t say when I first saw them whether they were clinched or not; my attention was mainly directed to Savage and his movements; both of them receded from their first positions near the door coming in the direction of us and the middle of the room; it appeared to me from the relative movements of the parties that Paterson was dodging around, Savage continuing to advance upon and endeavoring- to get the range of his pistol upon him until he shot the second time; I think he shot the third time before Paterson fell, which was perhaps near the longitudinal centre of the room; my back was to the door, face to table, when I heard first report of pistol; there was a good deal \u2022of confusion, and I was a little excited myself; I hallowed at this man Savage and tried to get him to stop shooting ; I cannot repeat exactly what I said;, I think I told him to stop shooting, and told the others to stop him ; 1 said this I think between the second and third shots, and I think perhaps afterwards; I think I remained up to third shot within the bar, but think I had walked to the entrance of the bar ; up to the time of the third shot I think Mr. Ear gan, as well as myself, went to the entrance of the bar; I am not positive as to this; as to Mr. Eagan I don\u2019t know whether he had gone out of the bar before the third shot was fired ; between the first and third shots I can\u2019t swear whether Mr. Eagan said anything or not; my attention was directed to Savage; I can\u2019t swear where General Jenkins and Mr. Eagan were relatively during this time ; General Jenkins I think was near the bar and inside of it; after the third shot a deputy sheriff came in and confronted Savage and prevented his escape; Mr. Paterson went or was taken down stairs; I can\u2019t swear as to the position of Mr. Eagan ; after awhile General Jenkins took his position at the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the table, and Mr. Eagan I think resumed his position standing up, and something was said as to going on with the testimony; General Jenkins said he was ready to go on; Mr. Eagan said he would adjourn to his house; from the time I commenced to take the testimony to the time Mr. Paterson was taken from the room, I heard Mr. Eagan say or do nothing during the taking of the testimony, nor did I hear him say anything indicating that he had anything to do with the difficulty between Paterson and Savage during the taking of the testimony ; after the firing commenced I cannot swear as to what was said or done by Mr. Eagan, because I don\u2019t know ; Mr. Eagan did not appear to be excited ; he was very cool.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">After the firing commenced my attention was directed to the combatants, particularly to Savage; the fiijst witness\u2019 name I think was Wren ; after his examination can\u2019t say where he went; think he retired; I never saw him after that; Mr. Eagan\u2019s position was such that he could have had a full view to the door where the combatants were engaged, unless there was some intervening object, and I know of none ; General Jenkins\u2019 face was not exactly confronting the door; he could see the door by turning his head without leaving his position; Mr. Eagan was sitting at the table, as I described when Mr. Stevens and I entered the court room ; we did not go to work at once; we had a pleasant conversation before commencing; I don\u2019t know when Mr. Paterson came in ; I have a recollection of his coming in ; he was sitting there quietly ; would hardly have known he was there ; I supposed he was reading the testimony ; Savage\u2019s appearance caused me to revert to his testimony as to Mr. C. Smith, Forrester and F. Paterson; he stated that Mr. Paterson stood near the polls and would fold two tickets in one and sive them out to vote; we were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>there taking testimony before Mr. Eagan, a Notary Public, under the act of Congress, in a contested election case ; my attention was attracted to Savage on the morning of the 8th on account of remarks that he made the day before; he had said that he expected to be kulduxed or killed ; I was impressed that he had no business there that morning; he was acting in a very officious and brave kind of way, and did not appear to be afraid as he had pretended the day ' before ; seeing him there I was reminded of the testimony \"that he had given the day before in z-egard to Mr. C. ;Smith, Fz\u2019ank Patez-son and the inspectors; he had testified the day before that on the day of the election Mr. Frank Paterson would stand near the poll or voting place and would fold ballots together and would give them to o'thers to vote; General Jenkins chose Mr. Eagan to take the testimony as a Notary Public; we had had some talk before leaving Jacksonville in regal\u2019d to takizig the testimony at Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation; we also talked about it afterwards; he seemed to regard it more conveniezzt to the ' Witnesses, and for taking care of the witnesses, to take the testimony at Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation ; his (Eagan\u2019s) house was about two miles from town ; I have a good deal of experience in taking testimony in cozitested election cases ; I dorz\u2019t z\u2019ecollect ever taking testimony in such cases at a private house befoz\u2019e ; yes, sir, Mr. Stevens and I went to the court-house after we heard that Mr. Eagan and General Jenkins had gone there; we had been waitizzg at Mr. Ste- ' vens\u2019 office where we thought the testimony would be taken, as Mr. Stevens had tendez\u2019ed it the day before; we had no explanation given us by Messrs. Eagan and Jenkins why they had concluded to take the testimony at the courthouse izistead of at Mr. Stevens\u2019 office; we did \u2018 not ask azi explanation; I do ziot know whether the second'witness had come in the room when the firing disturbed us; I may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>have taken the name of the witness preparatory to taking his testimonyhe was called I suppose, as there were no white witnesses there that I know of; I am not positive whether this second witness had come in the room; I do not recollect seeing him at all; my attention was entirely directed to Savage ; I am not positive that Howard James was in the court room; I know of a man by that name, but do not know him ; I do not know of any colored man in the court room but Savage; I cannot swear to any other colored man in the room but Savage ; when I saw Deputy Sheriff Church, cannot state how close Paterson and Savage were together when firing commenced ; I think there were parties between the bar and combatants before the difficulty ended ; I think Mr. Stevens was one ; so much confusion I could not tell how long between the firing of the second and third shots, long enough for me to tell Savage to quit or stop shooting, I think; I was trying to stop affray ; cannot swear to making use of any particular expression ; the time between the first and last shots was long enough for Mr. Paterson in a zigzag way to stagger off from Savage to about the middle of the room; at or after the firing of the third shot Mr. Paterson fell (there might have been four shots);. at time of last shot I think Savage was six or seven feet from Paterson, or thereabouts ; Savage fired deliberately ; don\u2019t remember of Mr. Eagan saying anything until the talk -was had about resuming the testimony ; about the time or after Paterson fell Savage was, as I feel positive and certain, with his face east confronting deputy sheriff, threatening to shoot the deputy sheriff; Savage afterwards sauntered around to where Mr. Eagan was, and between him and the window, north window; a short time after the firing, and after we were shut up in'the room, I ordered Savage to surrender to the sheriff; cannot say that Mr. Eagan spoke at all; he was quite cool; X. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>know of no conversation between him and Savage after the firing; we were all pretty close together behind the bar I think after firing commenced; when I hallowed at Savage I'did it aloud so that all present could hear it; no one asked him to surrender as I know of but myself; I did not see any arms among the colored people when we went up in the court room that morning ; Savage\u2019s expression about \u201c kuklux\u201d and being shot made out at Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation the day before w^s in the presence of us all; Mr. Eagan made no reply to it that I know of.</p>\n<p id=\"AgR\">Direct examination resumed:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">I don\u2019t know what Mr. Paterson said; I did not approach him at all; I saw him fall as though he was killed; when the sheriff and his posse came in I got out of the room ;. I have not read the testimony taken at Madison; I think that Mr. Stevens went to Mr. Paterson after he fell; I cannot testify to anything that Mr. Paterson said.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">H. Jenkins, Jr., sworn as a witness for the petitioner, testified as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">I am a lawyer, and reside in Jacksonville; I was in Madison on the 8th day of February representing Mr. Bisbee before Dennis Eagan, Notary Public, in the contested election case of Bisbee vs. Finley; I secured the court room by note to the sheriff; I found Mr. Eagan in the court room with Mr. Finley and Mr. Stevens when I went there, near the table at the west end of the room; I proceeded to get ready ; Mr. Eagan took his seat on the west side of the table facing towards the door; Mr. Finley and Stevens sat fronting him on the opposite side of the table, Stevens on Finley\u2019s left; I was at the north end of the table facing it lengthwise; I asked Eagan to get Savage to call the witnesses as they were wanted; we examined one witness yhose name I do not recall; another had been called and taken his seat, and I was about to interrogate him when I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>heard a few words in a high tone of voice or voices, and quickly a violent scuffle; I looked and saw two men scuffling together in conflict, very near to the door, and with the utmost rapidity heard two shots in succession; after the second shot was fired one of the parties turned his face towards me, his back had been towards me; I think he began to turn when the first shot was fired, because it struck me he was hit; after the second shot he fell, recovered himself quickly, and went out of my sight, and out of the room; after the firing very soon I saw Einley and Eagan very near the seats they had been occupying; I don\u2019t recollect that any one was outside of the bar who had been there before ; I remember that Mr. Einley said, \u201c stop!\u201d or \u201c stop there!\u201d or words to that effect; that was as I recollect after the shots were fired; I remained inside of the bar during the shooting ; all remained inside of the bar ; can\u2019t say that I recollect Stevens leaving ; during the shooting I think I was about six feet from Eagan ; I don\u2019t remember being separated from Eagan more than that distance ; I did not hear him say anything ; if he had spoken in a loud tone of voice I think I could and would have heard him; I did not hear Mr. Eagan during the shooting make any such exclamation as \u201c shoot him again,\u201d or anything like it; I don\u2019t think it would have been possible for him to have spoken them so as to have been heard in the room below, and I have not heard them ; the negroes around the court-house were witnesses; they had been summoned or rather notified to attend ; they were quiet; saw nothing otherwise; everything was very quiet and peaceable in the court room; nothing indicated violence in the room or outside prior to the difficulty ; after the shooting I saw Savage retreating before a white man who had a pistol in his hand; Savage came back to the west end of the room where we were, talking and explaining about the shooting; some one locked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the door, and for a few moments Eagan and the counsel in the case and the white man I saw Savage retreating before remained in the room until the door was opened by the sheriff; when Savage was retreating he had a pistol in his hand; a posse of armed men were with the sheriff, Han-kins, and advanced towards Savage ; the sheriff\u2019 seized and called upon him to surrender, which he seemed reluctant to do ; Mr. Eagan turned to me and said, \u201c he should surrender I said, \u201c yes,\u201d and Eagan told Savage to surrender, asking the sheriff at the same time to protect the prisoner against violence, which the sheriff said he would do, and Savage submitted ; Eagan and I followed the posse out of the room and went down into the.street; the witnesses and Mr. Finley and others were there gathered around, some were expressing fears for the prisoners, and we moved down towards the jail and the way leading out to Eagan\u2019s plantation; there appeared to be a good deal of excitement in town; I saw white men coming out the stores, some with guns; the general look of things indicated trouble ; no attacks however were made that I saw ; no guns were fired ; about this time I spoke to Albert Willard, one of the guards of the prisoners then, though not one of' the original posse, he told me then of Patersen\u2019s dying condition, or of his being mortally wounded; Eagan and I then went out to the plantation ; Savage said, when he came back to the west end of the room, that Paterson had \u201c jumped \u201d him and struck him, and that he had to \u201c shoot him to save his life,\u201d or words to that effect; this statement he made immediately after, the shooting took place; I did not see the first witness examined in the room at the time the shooting commenced ; I did not see him leave the room before the shooting; I do not remember seeing either of the witnesses during that day after the shooting began ; they may have been in my presence during that time; I did not know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>them personally; besides Savage and James I do not remember seeing any colored person in the room after the difficulty commenced that day; from the commencement of the difficulty to the end of the firing the persons in the room were Eagan, Einley, Stevens, Savage, James, second witness, name not known, Paterson, a man whose name was said to be Church, and that he was a deputy sheriff, and myself; I don\u2019t recollect seeing the second witness after my attention was called from his examination to the parties in difficulty ; the difficulty started late in the forenoon, I think about eleven o\u2019clock ; I had been in the court room about three-quarters of an hour before difficulty commenced ; I saw no shot fired ; I heard two; I sprung to my feet at the first shot; the relative position of combatants at first shot was thus: Paterson was between myself and Savage, facing Savage with his back towards me ; at first shot they were close, can\u2019t tell exactly how far apart; at the first shot, when I first saw them, can\u2019t say whether Savage had hold of Paterson ; can\u2019t say whether one had hold of the other; they were in violent motion, and appeared to have hold of each other; I did not see any blow struck by either; I saw no arms in the hands of either at the time of first shot; the second followed first shot almost immediately; I think not more than a second or two intervening; the position of combatants at second shot was about the same ; as to the room at first shot Paterson turned partially and quietly towards the end of the room where I was so that I could see his full face, and his manner and motion indicated that the shot had taken effect; at the second shot the parties were not so near together as at first; the distance had increased by Paterson moving backwards; I think they did not have hold of each other at the second shot; they were apart not more than two feet, perhaps three, difficult to tell exact distance from where I was; when second shot fired Pater<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>son staggered to the floor; don\u2019t think he fell prone; think he recovered before he actually fell upon the floor ; at that instant I did not see Howard James; as Paterson staggered and fell to the floor I do not recollect hearing a third shot; I was startled at that time, but not what you would call excited; my attentiou at that time was drawn particularly to what was going on between the combatants, particularly to Paterson, because I thought he was hit; between firing of second shot and Paterson falling the only words I heard was Mr. Einley\u2019s exclamation, which was at the time of the second shot or immediately thereafter, his exclamation was: \u201c Stop! Stop there !\u201d he used the word \u201c\u2022 stop \u201d and other words with it; don\u2019t remember exactly what they were ; with my attention fixed on combatants if there had been a third pistol fired about the time Paterson was falling I think it very probable that it would have attracted my attention ; I may have heard it and have forgotten it; I can\u2019t recall hearing third shot; I first saw Howard James after firing coming towards west end of room where I was, I think in company with Savage ; this was about a minute or a minute and a half after second shot; there was some loud talk between Savage and deputy sheriff before Savage retreated to the end of the room where I was, which lengthened the time of comibg back somewhat; it was possibly not more than a minute ; can\u2019t recall exactly where James was when I first saw him after second firing; I think he came down the aisle with Savage; my best l\u2019ecollection is that James when I first saw him was about half way between my position and where second shot was fired. \"Witness referring to diagram says : It is possible that James might have been in the aisle and I not have seen him, as my direct line of vision from my-position to the point where the shooting was (as shown by diagram) would not strike the eye; I was north of the aisle ; James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>was armed when I saw him immediately after the shooting; he had his pistol out; the sort of pistol he had I do not know ; it was a revolver ; don\u2019t know whether it was new or old, or its pattern or make; when Savage and James were coming towards the bar they were very near each other; don\u2019t remember which was in front; I think the deputy sheriff had taken his seat between Savage and James and the door; when I saw them approach Savage and James came to the south end of the table, I being at the north ; Savage and James were about six or seven feet from Mr. Eagan; I did not hear any conversation between Savage and James and Mr. Eagan at that time; I heard Savage\u2019s remark about shooting which seemed to be addressed generally to all of us ; during the firing I did not speak ; I did not have time to take in the situation, and said nothing; if I did I don\u2019t recollect it; during the firing, or at its close, there was in the bar no one else as I recollect except Mr. Einley and Mr. Eagan and myself; I think there was no one between me and the combatants opposite during the firing and up to its close; I did not notice any one inside of the bar between myself and combatants during the firing ; after the shooting was over Mr. Eagan and I went down in the street, the posse having preceded us; there were below then about 80 or 40 colored people whom I took to be witnesses; they were considerably excited; the witnesses were brought there at my request to be examined in behalf of contestant in the contested election case of Bisbee vs. Einley ; they were the same witnesses I understood who had been notified to and had assembled at Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation for examination the day before, and word of the change was given them when the change was made in the place of taking testimony; I think there were about thirty at Mr. Eagan\u2019s the day before; I did not count them; I do not know who was the direct messenger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>to summon them ; it was understood in Jacksonville that Savage was to take charge of that matter, and he came up to Madison when I did for that purpose on Sunday night the 6th of February, as I recollect; we arrived at Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation at almost five o\u2019clock next morning; don\u2019t think the sun was up when we arrived at Madison; commenced taking testimony on the 7th about 11 o\u2019clock, and continued taking it all day ; I examined nobody but Savage that day; when I came out of the court room I did not notice a wagon; when we got some distance from the court-house, about 800 yards, I saw wagon in front of Livingston\u2019s store; I remember some of the colored people asked Mr. Eagan and myself to get into wagon and ride out to his plantation, which we declined to do, saying we would walk ; I think I saw the same wagon at the place where we first found the witnesses assembled in the morning at what I supposed was the edge of the town, some distance from the court-house; I don\u2019t know who had it in charge when T first saw it; when I saw it the second time it was in charge of a man who I understood was named Burk Stephens, a colored woman being with him in the wagon ; Burk Stephens was a witness in the contested election case; his wife was not; don\u2019t recollect seeing any arms in the wagon, except one double-barrelled gun ; I have an impression that when I got into the wagon about three-quarters of a mile out of town, on the way to Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation, there was a gun in the bottom of the wagon that interfered with the comfort of my feet; there was but one in the wagon ; can\u2019t state positively whether it was a double or single-barrelled gun; think it was a double-barrelled gun; the wagon .after I got into it went to Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation, stopped there at the front gate, Mr. Eagan and I got out, and the wagon was driven off on the road; I saw it going from the front gate, about 20 or 30 yards, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>we went into the gate; from the statement of Mr. Eagan I know the wagon belonged to Burk Stephens ; this statement was made last evening since my testimony taken then I asked him about it; I left Mr. Eagan\u2019s plantation to take testimony on the morning of the 8th, betwen 9 and 10 o\u2019clock; at the edge of the town, where I first saw witnesses and the wagon, there were about 50 or 60 persons, all sizes included, men, women and children; I did not'notice any excitement among the white people of the town until after the killing of Mr. Paterson; toward the attorneys taking the testimony and the- counsel representing the parties everything was pleasant and courteous; previous to shooting I noticed no excitement among the colored people; at the edge of the town where I met the witnesses first in the morning there was a long building which I understood was a school-house; Mr. Eagan spoke to me about getting the building for taking the testimony ; when we got nearly to the building I saw the heads of children, and Mr. Eagan remarked there was a school in session there ; of the 50 or 60 persons there I can\u2019t say how many were women and children ; can\u2019t say what proportion of them ; when the colored people were notified of change of place of examination to town I do not think any place was stated to them; I think the court-house was alluded to as the place in their presence at which the examination might be had; when Mr. Eagan and I drove past the school-house there was hardly any stop ; there was some little conversation about the taking of the testimony in town, and the conversation narrated as occurring between Mr. Eagan and myself; T had not given these persons instructions to meet at this particular place, and don\u2019t think that Mr. Eagan had; I have been informed that Burk Stephens lives about two miles from Mr. Eagan, on the same road beyond from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>town ; I learned the facts as to place of residence of Burk Stephens from Mr. Eagan last evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On the 26th day of February the court made an order discharging the petitioner as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The testimony taken in this case having been heretofore submitted to the court by counsel for both the petitioner and the State without argument, and the same having been read by the court, and the matters contained therein having been duly and maturely considered, it seems to the court now here that there is not sufficient evidence to warrant the detention of the said petitioner, Dennis Eagan, in the custody of the sheriff; it is therefore considered and or dered by the court that the said petitioner be and he is discharged from custody, and it is further considered and ordered that the costs herein incurred in the prosecution of this matter be taxed against the State of Florida.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
