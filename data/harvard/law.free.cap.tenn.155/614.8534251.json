Chiee Justice Gbeen</author>\n<p id=\"A7i\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-13\">This case is before us upon petitions of counsel and of tlie clerk of this court at Jackson seeking a construction of chapter 100' of the Acts of 1925, creating the Court of Appeals. The controversy presented is as to the time \u25a0when an execution may issue upon a judgment of the Court of Appeals, and as to the effect of filing a petition for <em>certiorari </em>upon, the right of the judgment creditor to have execution issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-14\">Section 131 of the Act provides that the judgments of the Court of Appeals \u201cunless superseded, reversed, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>modified by the Snpreme Court, shall, after expiration of thirty days from final decree as hereinafter defined, be executed by all necessary and proper writs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Section 14 outlines the practice with reference to the removal of canses from the Conrt of Appeals to this, conrt by petition for <em>certiorari, </em>and provides that \u201cthe Snpreme Conrt or one of the judges thereof may order the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>in aid of the <em>certiorari </em>upon such terms and bond as such conrt or judge may prescribe.\u201d The Act then continues, \u201cPetitions for <em>certiorari </em>to require the removal of any case from the Conrt of Appeals to the Snpreme Conrt for review, shall be filed in the Snpreme Conrt within forty-five days after final decree in the Conrt of Appeals, including decree upon any application to that court for a rehearing or for different or additional findings; provided, the Snpreme Conrt or any of the judges thereof, upon application, may extend such time for filing- petitions for <em>certiorari </em>for an additional time not to exceed ninety days after final decree as above defined in the Court of Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Upon the expiration of thirty days from the judgment of the Conrt of Appeals, the judgment creditor herein demanded an \u2022 execution from the clerk; later after a petition 'for <em>certiorari </em>was filed by the defendant in judgment, this demand for an execution was renewed. The clerk has been doubtful of his proper course in the premises and he and counsel have brought the matter before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We are of opinion that the judgment creditor was entitled to the execution thirty days after the entry of judgment of the Court of Appeals. The plain language of section 13 requires this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">The filing of a petition for <em>certiorari </em>in this court to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>stay the execution of that judgment. The hare filing of such a petition does not even remove the case to this court. Recognizing this condition, the Legislature provided in -section 14 that this court or one of the judges thereof might order the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>in aid of the <em>certiorari. </em>Much less would the mere notice of intention to file a petition for <em>certiorari, </em>within forty-five days or within the time allowed, stay an execution from the Court of Appeals thirty days after its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">In cases, therefore, where a <em>supersedeas </em>is desired application for this writ may be made to this Court or to a member thereof within thirty days after the judgment of the Court of Appeals. The application for <em>su-persedeas </em>should be made after reasonable notice to the adverse party and may be made along with the petition for <em>certiorari </em>within thirty days, or separately, if more time is desired in which to file the petition for <em>certiorari. </em>If the application for <em>si&amp;persedeas </em>is separate, there should be a showing of intention to file a petition for <em>certiorari </em>within the time allowed. Upon such application for <em>supersedeas </em>to this court or one of the judges thereof, the writ will ordinarily issue upon terms or bond prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The time in which this court or a judge thereof may order the writ of <em>supersedeas </em>in aid of <em>certiorari </em>does not appear to be limited by the statute, but as our cases show, a <em>supersedeas </em>does not discharge the lien of an execution levied on land. <em>McCamy </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>40 Tenn. (3 Head), 256; <em>Littleton </em>v. <em>Yost, </em>71 Tenn. (3 Lea), 267. Safe practice, therefore, requires that the application for <em>supersedeas </em>be made before execution can issue from the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
