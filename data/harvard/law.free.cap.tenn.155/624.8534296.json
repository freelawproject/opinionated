The amendment has the effect of eliminating the words \u201cfrom a common carrier, or other carrier, \u2019 \u2019 from Sections 1 and 2 of the Act of 1917 (Ch\u00e1pter 12). Giving effect to this amendment the statutory definition of the offense charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>in tlie presentment is that it shall he unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to possess intoxicating liquors received after the enactment of the statute, the date of which was February 2, 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It is still necessary to a conviction under -the second section of the Act of 1917 that the jury should find that the whisky in the possession of the accused was received by him after February 2, 1917. The lapse of time since said date .has, perhaps, wrought some change in the <em>qumvtum </em>of proof necessary to support such finding, and slight circumstances have been held sufficient by this court to support the jury\u2019s finding, but there is nothing in the statute as amended which would support an instruction to the jury that bare proof of possession is sufficient to convict, on the single charge of possessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The trial judge, therefore, should have instructed the jury that before there could be a conviction the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff in error was in possession of intoxicating liquor received by him since February 2, 1917.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The evidence offered by the State consisted of the testimony of officers describing the result of a search of the dwelling of the plaintiff\u2019 in error, made pursuant to a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">The plaintiff in error objected to this evidence on the ground that the affidavit on which the search warrant was issued was inadequate and fatally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">The affidavit purports to have been made upon information which the affiant believed to be true, set out in the affidavit as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-10\">\u201cThis information was communicated to me by two negroes and one white man, that said defendant is now .in possession of a quantity of intoxicating liquor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>In <em>Elliott </em>v. State, 148 Tenn., 414, with reference to search warrants, the conrt said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-3\">\u201cIt is not necessary that the affiant should have personal knowledge of the existence of g'ronnds calling\u2019 for a search warrant, hut such a warrant may he based on an affidavit made on information, if the information is of the character that indicates probable canse for believing a search warrant to he authorized. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abi\">The statement in the affidavit that three men had told the affiant that the plaintiff in error was in possession of intoxicating liqnor, is hardly a statement of information sufficient to authorize the issuance of a search warrant. If the affidavit had contained any statement that the informants claimed to have seen intoxicating liquor in the possession of the plaintiff in error, or had witnessed the circumstances, described in the affidavit, justifying a belief that intoxicating liquor was unlawfully in the possession of the plaintiff in error, it may be that the affidavit would meet the rule above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">However, there is nothing in the affidavit before us to indicate whether the informants of the affiant were not themselves speaking from hearsay rather than from personal knowledge, or were merely expressing a conclusion from undisclosed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">We think, therefore, that the trial judge should have Sustained the objection of the plaintiff in error to the evidence of the State, based upon the insufficiency of the affidavit upon which the search warrant was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">Eeversed: and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
