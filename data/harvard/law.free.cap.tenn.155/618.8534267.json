The various deals were consummated 'between February 21 and October 17, 1923. During a part of this period plaintiff was in the employ of defendants and was to give them twenty-live per cent of his commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">One of the defenses to the plea of set-off was that defendants were precluded because, at the time of these various transactions, they had not paid the privilege tax required of real estate dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">It appears that defendants paid no tax for the year beginning April 1, 1922, and ending March 31, 1923, and that they paid the tax for the year beginning April 1, 1923, and ending March 31, 1924, on September 16, 1924 which was prior to the date on which their plea of set-off was filed. The trial court held this sufficient, and that presents the question of law in the case. But there are also questions of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The plaintiff insists that even though the legal question be decided against him the court committed error in allowing the two first items of $93.75 and $62.50, because those transactions were had on February 21, 1923, and that defendants at no time paid the tax covering that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The plaintiff further contends that the two last items of $81.20 each involved' transactions on August 27 and October 17, 1923, and that he was not in the employ of the defendants at those dates, and that those sales were on his own account.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>It will tiras be seen that there is not only a controverted question of law involved, but controverted questions of fact, and the case does not, therefore, involve solely a question of law. But if it did jurisdiction lies in the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Section 10 of chapter 100 of the Acts of 1925 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">\u201cBe it further enacted, The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals shall be appellate only, and shall extend to all civil cases except those involving constitutional questions, the right to hold a public office, workmen\u2019s compensation, State revenue, mandamus, proceedings in the nature of <em>quo warranto, </em>ouster, <em>habeas corpus, </em>and excepting cases which have been finally determined in the lower court on demurrer, or other method not involving a review or determination of the facts, or in which all of the facts have been stipulated, \u2019 \u2019 etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">The foregoing provision clearly and explicitly confers jurisdiction on this court only (1) where the facts were stipulated in the trial court or (2) where the case was finally determined in the trial court without any consideration of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">In the case under consideration the facts were not stipulated in the trial court, but in determining the case the trial court considered the facts; hence the case should have been appealed to the Court of Appeals, and an order will be entered transferring it to that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">This construction of the act was announced in <em>Gormany </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>154 Tenn., 432, and <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>154 Tenn., 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Even though upon appeal 'a question of law only is involved jurisdiction will not lie in this court if the trial court considered the facts, unless the facts were stipulated in the later court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-11\">All concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
