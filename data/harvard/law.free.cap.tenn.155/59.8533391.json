The learned Chancellor, in this mandamus proceeding, has held the act applicable to an automobile driven for hire by an owner who uses a fixed stand, and charges fares proportioned to the haul and number of passengers in each case, but not operating \u201cbetween fixed termini, or over a regular route.\u201d In the case of <em>Haley </em>v. <em>Killough, Clerk, </em>Hamilton Equity, decided in Febru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ary, 1926, the Chancellor reached a different conclusion, holding the act inapplicable to taxicabs and autos not operating between fixed <em>termini.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\">While it is conceded that the language of this act is involved and ambiguous, it is insisted that, viewing the act as a whole, and having in mind the evil to be remedied and protection to the public sought to be afforded, all motor driven vehicles for hire coming within the definition of taxicabs, set out in Section 1 of the act, should be held to come within its provisions requiring insurance to be carried for the benefit of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">The caption is broad, covering all \u201cmotor vehicles . . . for hire,\u201d and the word \u201ctaxicab\u201d is given a definition practically as broad, and it may be plausibly contended that the protection sought to be provided might fairly be so extended, but the language of section 2 is definitely limited. \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person ... to operate any motor vehicle . . . for hire, between fixed <em>termini, </em>without executing bond or providing insurance,\u201d etc. This is the controlling language of the act. The broad terms of the caption and the references to taxicabs contained in the body of the act, -fairly suggest a possible original purpose to enact legislation which would apply to <em>all </em>motor vehicles driven for hire, whether strictly taxicabs or not (except when coming under a municipal ordinance having similar requirements), but the manifest ambiguity and confusion in the frame and language of the act as it now appears, indicates restrictive changes inartificially made before final passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">However this may be, we find the language of the act heretofore quoted declaring \u201cwhat shall be unlawful\u201d reasonably clear. While in arriving at the intent, which is always important, the apparent general purpose of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>legislation may be considered, \u201cit is also a settled rule of construction in this <em>State,\u201d as </em>said by Mr. Justice Lansden in <em>Plow Co. </em>v. <em>Hays, </em>125 Tenn., 155, \u201cthat statutes levying taxes or duties upon citizens will not be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used, nor will their operation be enlarged so as to embrace matters not specifically pointed out, although standing upon a close analogy. . . . burdens are not to be imposed beyond what the statute expressly imports.\u201d It results that the judgment must be reversed and a decree will be entered here for the petitioner.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
