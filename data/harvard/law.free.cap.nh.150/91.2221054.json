We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The respondent, Laconia Professional Firefighters, Local 1153, IAFF (Union), has been the exclusive representative of the bargaining unit of firefighters, captains and lieutenants since 1956. In 2000, the City petitioned the PELRB to modify the bargaining unit to exclude lieutenants and captains. The PELRB dismissed the petition and the city appealed to this court. In 2002, we remanded the case to the PELRB to decide: (1) whether lieutenants and captains are supervisors within the meaning of RSA 273-A:8, II (1999); (2) if the lieutenants and captains are supervisors, whether it is permissible to include them in the same bargaining unit as firefighters; and (3) whether the City is barred from challenging the composition of the bargaining unit because of laches or some other reason. <em>Appeal of City of Laconia, </em>147 N.H. 495, 497 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">On remand, the PELRB affirmed the previous dismissal of the City\u2019s petition because, \u201cwhile lieutenants and captains may be \u2018supervisors\u2019 by virtue of their ranks or titles, they are not sufficiently \u2018supervisors\u2019 by function or vested with sufficient \u2018disciplinary authority\u2019 to cause their exclusion from the bargaining unit.\u201d Regarding the issue of laches, the PELRB said that it \u201c[did] not address the issues of laches in detail, with the exception of noting that if the City were allowed to proceed, there would be what it called \u2018resulting prejudice\u2019 [] because the remaining lieutenants and captains would be less than ten in number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">On appeal, the City challenges the PELRB\u2019s conclusion that lieutenants and captains are not supervisors who must be excluded from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>bargaining unit. The City also challenges the PELRB\u2019s dismissal of its modification petition based upon the doctrine of laches. Finally, the City asserts that the Union\u2019s argument that it waived its right to petition for a modification is without merit. We agree with the PELRB that the doctrine of laches bars the City\u2019s modification petition; thus, we need not address the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u201cTo succeed on appeal, the [City] must show that the [PELRB\u2019s] decision is unlawful or clearly unreasonable. We review for errors of law without deference to the [PELRB\u2019s] rulings. The [PELRB\u2019s] findings of fact are presumptively lawful and reasonable, but we require that the record support the [PELRB\u2019s] determinations.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of Stratham, </em>144 N.H. 429, 430 (1999) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u201cLaches is an equitable doctrine that bars litigation when a potential plaintiff has slept on his rights.\u201d <em>Town of Seabrook v. Vachon Management, </em>144 N.H. 660, 668 (2000) (quotation omitted). The doctrine of laches \u201cis not a mere matter of time, but is principally a question of the inequity of permitting the claim to be enforced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668 (quotation omitted). We consider four factors in our analysis: (1) \u201cthe knowledge of the plaintiffs\u201d; (2) \u201cthe conduct of the defendants\u201d; (3) \u201cthe interests to be vindicated\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe resulting prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our analysis of these factors \u201chinges upon the particular facts of each case.\u201d <em>Healey v. Town of New Durham, </em>140 N.H. 232, 241 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The PELRB found the following facts. The City and the Union began collective bargaining in 1956. In 1976, the PELRB formally certified the Union as the exclusive representative for the bargaining unit, which consisted of captains, lieutenants and firefighters. Captains and lieutenants had been conducting oral performance evaluations of the firefighters since 1956. In December 1996, the Union and City agreed that the evaluations would be written \u201cwith the caveat that it was agreed that it was not to be used to demonstrate management functions on behalf of the lieutenants and captains such as to exclude them from the bargaining unit.\u201d The 1998 collective bargaining agreement contained the first contractual reference to written performance evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We now consider the four factors to determine whether the doctrine of laches bars the City\u2019s petition. First, we consider the City\u2019s knowledge. The City knew in 1975 that the legislature enacted RSA 273-A:8, II, which provides that \u201c[p]ersons exercising supervisory authority involving the significant exercise of discretion may not belong to the same bargaining unit as the employees they supervise.\u201d The enactment of RSA 273-A:8, II alone may not have given the City notice to petition the PELRB to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>captains and lieutenants from the bargaining unit. However, our subsequent case law explained the scope of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">In 1988, we held that fire department captains with certain authority, \u201cregardless of whether it is presently exercised,\u201d are supervisors under RSA 273-A:8, II. <em>Appeal of University System of N.H., </em>131 N.H. 368, 376 (1988) (hereinafter <em>Appeal of UNH). </em>In <em>Appeal of UNH, </em>the captains\u2019 duties included \u201cassigning work, ensuring that the shifts are fully staffed, and being in command of fire and other incidents when senior staff [were] not present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376. Also, in <em>Appeal of UNH, </em>the PELRB had found that the \u201ccaptains have some limited supervisory authority over the firefighters, including significant discretion or independent judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376. Given the facts and holding in <em>Appeal of UNH, </em>the City should have known by 1988 that a petition for modification would be in order but failed to file one. In fact, in 1998, the City negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement with the Union that included the captains and lieutenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The City argues that its delay is insufficient to bar its petition. We agree that delay is only one factor; nevertheless, significant delay must be present to trigger a laches analysis. <em>Seabrook, </em>144 N.H. at 668. As we noted in <em>Miner v. A &amp; C Tire Co., </em>146 N.H. 631, 634 (2001), laches did not bar suit where the plaintiffs delay did not prejudice the defendants. Thus, once there is a delay, we must consider the remaining factors. <em>Healey, </em>140 N.H. at 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Second, we consider the conduct of the Union. Richard Molan, the Union\u2019s chief negotiator since 1979, testified that the issue of whether captains and lieutenants were considered supervisors within the meaning of RSA 273-A:8, II was never an issue during negotiations until 1996. After an October 1996 meeting, the City and Union came to an \u201cagreement on this contract language with the caveat that it was agreed that it was not to be used to demonstrate management functions on behalf of the lieutenants and captains such as to exclude them from the bargaining unit.\u201d Nothing in the record indicates that the Union\u2019s conduct contributed to the City\u2019s delay. The City did not rely upon the Union\u2019s conduct in delaying its petition. Rather, the Union\u2019s conduct indicates its intent to limit the supervisory authority of the captains and lieutenants in an effort to preserve the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Third, we consider the interests to be vindicated. In 1975, the legislature enacted RSA chapter 273-A because \u201cit is the policy of the state to foster harmonious and cooperative relations between public employers and their employees and to protect the public by encouraging the orderly and uninterrupted operation of government.\u201d Laws 1975, 490:1. Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>1976, the bargaining unit has included captains and lieutenants. This bargaining unit has negotiated successive collective bargaining agreements to the benefit of the entire unit without exception. According to RSA 273-A:8, an appropriate bargaining unit is determined by \u201cthe principle of community of interest.\u201d Michael Drake, a lieutenant since 1989, confirmed that \u201cthe captains, lieutenants and firefighters all have the same working conditions under the contract, with the exception of pay differentials, and have a \u2018self-felt community of interest.\u2019\u201d Excluding captains and lieutenants from the bargaining unit after twenty-seven years and disrupting this \u201cself-felt community of interest\u201d would be inconsistent with the State\u2019s interest in fostering \u201charmonious and cooperative relations between public employers and their employees.\u201d Laws 1975, 490:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Finally, we consider the resulting prejudice. The PELRB found that \u201cif the City were allowed to proceed, there would be ... \u2018resulting prejudice\u2019 ... because the remaining lieutenants and captains would be less than ten in number\u201d and thus ineligible to form a bargaining unit. RSA 273-A:8, I. While the City has offered to negotiate with the captains and lieutenants, the captains and lieutenants would not be eligible to be certified as a bargaining unit and enjoy the resulting protections provided in RSA chapter 273-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">For instance, the City would not be obligated to meet \u201cat reasonable times and places\u201d or \u201ccooperate in mediation and fact-finding.\u201d RSA 273-A:3. Also, a breach of any agreement reached between the City and the captains and lieutenants would not constitute an unfair labor practice. RSA 273-A:5 (1999). The PELRB would not have jurisdiction to issue a cease and desist order to remedy the breach. RSA 273-A:6 (1999). Thus, the City has failed to meet its burden to show that the PELRB\u2019s conclusion that there would be a \u201cresulting prejudice\u201d was unlawful or clearly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Based upon our review of the facts in light of the City\u2019s knowledge, the Union\u2019s conduct, the interests to be vindicated and the resulting prejudice, we conclude that the PELRB properly dismissed the City\u2019s petition for modification based upon the doctrine of laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b127-9\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
