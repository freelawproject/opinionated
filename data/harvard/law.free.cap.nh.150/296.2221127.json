We grant the petition, vacate the orders of the division and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The three defendants, Chad Evans, Steven Summa and Allan Cullen, were convicted of various felony offenses and sentenced to terms of incarceration in the State prison. When each defendant was sentenced, the sentencing judge did not inform him that under a recently enacted statute, <em>see </em>RSA 651:58, I (Supp. 2002), the State could seek enhancement of his sentence by petitioning the division. In each case, the State subsequently filed a petition for sentence review.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In all three cases, the division issued an order stating that it had \u201creviewed the transcript of the sentencing hearing and determined that the defendant was not informed at sentencing in plain and certain terms that the state could seek an enhancement of his sentence.\u201d As a result, the division concluded that \u201cany relief afforded to the state would violate the defendant\u2019s due process rights\u201d and dismissed the State\u2019s petitions. The division denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration and the State petitioned this court for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u201cCertiorari is an extraordinary remedy and is not granted as a matter of right but rather at the discretion of the court when the substantial ends of justice require such relief.\u201d <em>Petition of Turgeon, </em>140 N.H. 52, 53 (1995) (quotation omitted). \u201cCertiorari review... is limited to whether the agency acted illegally with respect to jurisdiction, authority or observance of the law, whereby it arrived at a conclusion which could not legally or reasonably be made, or abused its discretion or acted arbitrarily, unreasonably, or capriciously.\u201d <em>In re Ryan G., </em>142 N.H. 643, 645 (1998) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">The State argues that under our holding in <em>Turgeon, </em>140 N.H. at 53-54, the division was not empowered to determine whether granting the petition would violate the defendants\u2019 due process rights. In <em>Turgeon, </em>the petitioner argued that because his sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, the division acted illegally when it upheld his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 53. We held that the petitioner was not entitled to a writ of certiorari because, even assuming that his argument had merit, the division did not have jurisdiction to hear his constitutional claim. <em>Id. </em>at 54-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>In <em>Turgeon, </em>we emphasized the limited jurisdiction of the division. <em>Id. </em>at 54. The division is \u201can administrative tribunal\u201d comprised of superior court judges. <em>Id. </em>Its jurisdiction is defined by RSA 651:59, I (1996), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-3\">The review division has jurisdiction: to consider an appeal with or without a hearing; to review the judgment insofar as it relates to the sentence imposed; to review any other sentence imposed when the sentence appealed from was imposed, notwithstanding the partial execution of any such sentence; to amend the judgment by ordering substituted therefor a different appropriate sentence or sentences; or to make any other disposition of the case which could have been made at the time of the imposition of the sentence or sentences under review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Thus, we held that under RSA 651:59,1, the division is \u201cnot empowered to determine the constitutionality of a sentence\u201d and, therefore, did not have jurisdiction to decide whether the petitioner\u2019s sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">If, as in <em>Turgeon, </em>the division lacks jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of a sentence generally, it likewise lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the failure to notify a defendant of the State\u2019s statutory right to appeal his sentence violates the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process protections specifically. Indeed, because the due process claim is a constitutional issue wholly apart from whether the sentence is appropriate and consistent, it is well beyond the division\u2019s statutory jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Moreover, the division\u2019s own rules recognize the narrow limits of its jurisdiction. The division\u2019s rules limit its scope of review to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">(a) The excessiveness or lightness of the sentence having regard to the nature of the offense, the protection of the public interest and safety, and the character of the offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">(b) The manner in which the sentence was imposed, including the sufficiency and accuracy of the information before the sentencing court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">SUPER. Ct. Sentence REV. DlV. R. 22. Nothing in the division\u2019s rules suggests that it has jurisdiction to consider constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">The defendants argue that RSA 651:59,1, authorizes the division \u201cto consider an appeal,\u201d and therefore the division\u2019s authority \u201cis broad and must include not only consideration on the merits but also any threshold matters, such as the legality of an application, that might preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>consideration on the merits.\u201d The quoted language of RSA 651:59, I, however, cannot be read in isolation. The full phrase cited by the defendants grants the division authority \u201cto consider an appeal with or without a hearing.\u201d RSA 651:59, I. Read in its entirety, this phrase does not give the division broad jurisdiction to consider all appeals, but simply permits the division to consider an appeal with or without holding a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">We conclude that the division exceeded its jurisdiction when it ruled that granting the State\u2019s petition would violate the defendants\u2019 due process rights and, therefore, we vacate the division\u2019s order. Thus, the due process issue is not properly before us and we decline to address it on the merits. <em>See Big League Entm\u2019t v. Brox Indus., </em>149 N.H. 480, 485-86 (2003). In their briefs, the defendants raised additional constitutional challenges to RSA 651:58,1 (Supp. 2002), which we decline to address as well. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\n<em>Petition granted; sentence review division orders vacated; and remandad</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-7\">BROCK, C.J., and Dalianis, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
