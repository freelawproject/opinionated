We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-12\">The trial court provided the following background facts in its order. This case involves the planned expansion by DOT of Routes 9,10,12 and 101 in Swanzey and Keene. The project includes the proposed replacement of the \u201cT\u201d. intersection at which these routes intersect with a trumpet interchange to handle greater traffic volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-13\">Constructing the trumpet interchange would require filling approximately 5.45 acres of wetlands. Accordingly, DOT applied to DES for a wetlands permit on June 7, 1999. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:3 (2001) (amended 2001, 2002). DES granted the permit, subject to certain conditions, on March 22, 2000. The plaintiff, Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), requested reconsideration of DES\u2019 decision under RSA 482-A:10, II (2001). DES denied the request and CLF appealed to the Wetlands Council. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>RSA 482-A.10, IV (2001). The Wetlands Council affirmed DES\u2019 decision and denied CLF\u2019s motion for reconsideration. CLF then appealed to the superior court. <em>See </em>RSA 482-A:10, VIII (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The trial court vacated the Wetlands Council\u2019s and DES\u2019 orders. The court stated that, under DES\u2019 Wetlands Rules, an applicant for a wetlands permit \u201cmust demonstrate, among other things, the need for the proposed project\u2019s impact on wetlands, and that the proposed project is the one with the least adverse impact to wetlands.\u201d <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Wt 302.03, 302.04(a) (1), (2). One alternative to the trumpet interchange was a roundabout, which the court described as follows: \u201cA roundabout is designed as a one-way circulatory roadway around a central island usually with flared approaches to allow multiple vehicle entry. Modern roundabouts have two fundamental design features including yield at entry points and deflection of the entering vehicle path.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The court held, however, that even assuming the accuracy of DOT\u2019s traffic predictions for 2015, \u201cits application did not adequately address whether a roundabout was a practicable alternative to the proposed trumpet interchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The court also held that DOT did not adequately address the planned construction\u2019s impact on wildlife because it failed to \u201cdiscover and document... vernal and seasonal pools in the area of the proposed trumpet interchange.\u201d Vernal and seasonal pools are temporary bodies of water that provide many species a predator-free environment in which to reproduce. The court further held that the imposition of conditions in the permit did not cure the unlawfulness and unreasonableness of the permit\u2019s issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">DOT appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in: 1) supplementing the record on appeal; 2) finding the discovery of vernal pools to be significant new information requiring vacating of the wetlands permit; 3) finding DES\u2019 reliance on the conditions imposed in the permit to be unreasonable; and 4) interpreting administrative rules to outweigh statutory authority specifically delegated to a State agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">We first set forth the applicable standards of review. The trial court\u2019s review of decisions of the Wetlands Council is governed by RSA 482-A:10, XI (2001), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-9\">On appeal to the superior court, the burden of proof shall be upon the party seeking to set aside the decision of the council to show that the decision is unlawful or unreasonable. The council\u2019s decision shall not be set aside or vacated, except for errors of law, unless the court is persuaded, by a preponderance of the evidence before it, that said decision is unjust or unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>We will not disturb the trial court\u2019s decision unless it is unsupported by the evidence or legally erroneous. <em>Cf. Mt. Valley Mall Assocs. v. Municipality of Conway, </em>144 N.H. 642, 647 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">DOT first argues that the trial court erred in supplementing the record with the opinion testimony of Dr. Rick Van de Poll, who visited the site on behalf of CLF and discovered the vernal and seasonal pools at issue. As Dr. Van de Poll did not discover the vernal and seasonal pools until after the wetlands permit issued, and CLF\u2019s previous motion to supplement the record before the Wetlands Council with his affidavit was denied, Dr. Van de Poll\u2019s opinion had not been before either DES or the Wetlands Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Under RSA 482-A:10, XIII (2001), the trial court hearing an appeal from the Wetlands Council is directed to order the Council to file with the court a certified copy of the record, which \u201cshall consist of the council\u2019s decision, [DES\u2019] record of decision as submitted to the council and the record of the hearing before the council.\u201d Nevertheless, RSA 482-A:10, XIV (2001) provides that \u201c[t]he court may receive and consider such additional evidence as would be permissible under RSA 677:10.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">The purpose of the statutory provisions for the receipt of additional evidence is not to afford a trial <em>de novo, </em>but rather to assist the court in evaluating the action of the board. If the record of the evidence before the board is either incomplete or nonexistent, a party may present further evidence to the trial court[, which may be considered] even though it was not before the board.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-8\"><em>Lake Sunapee Protective Assoc. v. N.H. Wetlands Bd., </em>133 N.H. 98, 106-07 (1990) (quotations, citations, brackets and ellipses omitted). The decision to admit additional evidence is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and we will not reverse the court\u2019s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See Peter Christian\u2019s v. Town of Hanover, </em>132 N.H. 677, 683-84 (1990); <em>State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">DOT contends that the trial court erred in taking additional evidence because the record was neither nonexistent nor incomplete. Rather, DOT argues that the record below was \u201cvoluminous\u201d and contained \u201cthe culmination of substantial environmental research on behalf of [DOT] and input from\u201d numerous agencies and others. CLF, on the other hand, argues that the record before DES and the Wetlands Council was necessarily incomplete because it contained no reference to the subsequently-discovered vernal and seasonal pools.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>We have recognized that \u201cthe trial judge is in the best position to determine the sufficiency of the record.\u201d <em>Peter Christian\u2019s, </em>132 N.H. at 683-84. Thus, although we ultimately conclude that the evidence of vernal and seasonal pools did not have the significance the trial court accorded it, we cannot say that the court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence was an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>See id.; Lambert, </em>147 N.H. at 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Having admitted the evidence of vernal and seasonal pools, the trial court concluded that DOT\u2019s failure to find and document them constituted a failure to adequately consider the project\u2019s impact on wildlife in accordance with New Hampshire Administrative Rule, Wt 302.04(a)(7). Rule 302.04(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-5\">(a) For all major and minor projects the applicant shall demonstrate by plan and example that the following factors have been considered in their design in assessing the impact of the proposed project to areas and environments under the department\u2019s jurisdiction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">(7) The impact on plants, fish, and wildlife including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-7\">a. Rare, special concern species;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-8\">b. State and federally listed threatened and endangered species;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-9\">c. Species at the extremities of their ranges;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-10\">d. Migratory fish and wildlife; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-11\">e. Exemplary natural communities identified by the New Hampshire Natural Heritage Inventory (NHI) \u2014 Department of Resources and Economic Development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-12\">The trial court held that the Wetlands Council erred in interpreting that provision \u201cas requiring applicants to assess impacts to rare, threatened and endangered and migratory fish and wildlife and NHI communities; no other wildlife concerns are included in the rules.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The court concluded that the Wetlands Council\u2019s interpretation was too narrow and ignored the use of the term \u201cincluding,\u201d which indicated that the list of enumerated factors was not exhaustive. It then stated: \u201cWhile vernal and seasonal pools are not specifically mentioned in the rules, their existence is critical to understanding the exact nature and character of the proposed project\u2019s impact on wildlife habitat, reproduction, and food sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-13\">While we agree with the trial court that the term \u201cincluding\u201d indicates that the factors listed are not exhaustive, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the rule to require documentation of vernal and seasonal pools in all cases is too broad. In <em>Roberts v. General Motors Corp, </em>138 N.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>532, 538 (1994), we noted that the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to,\u201d when used in a statute preceding a list of specified items, \u201climits the applicability of [the statute] to those <em>types </em>of [items] therein particularized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">We hold that the term \u201cincluding\u201d similarly limits the items intended to be covered by the rule to those of the same type as the items specifically listed. Thus, Rule 302.04(a)(7) requires consideration of the proposed project\u2019s impact on certain plants, fish and wildlife that are of particular concern for conservation, wildlife management or regulatory purposes. While vernal and seasonal pools may provide habitat and other benefits to certain species, without evidence that the project\u2019s impact on the pools would adversely affect specific species contemplated by Rule 302.04(a)(7), we cannot say that the rule requires documentation of vernal or seasonal pools.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">The dissent argues that Rule 302.04(a)(7) should be interpreted in light of the purpose expressed in RSA 482-A-.1, which is, among other things, to protect \u201csources of nutrients for finfish, Crustacea, shellfish and wildlife of significant value\u201d and \u201chabitats and reproduction areas for plants, fish and wildlife of importance.\u201d RSA 482-A:l (2001). We see no substantive difference between the stated limitations \u201cof significant value\u201d and \u201cof importance,\u201d and our above interpretation \u201cof particular concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Craig Wood, manager of environmental services for the Louis Berger Group, which prepared a study for DOT of the vernal pools at issue, testified that their investigation uncovered no rare, special concern, threatened or endangered species, species at the extremities of their ranges, or migratory fish or wildlife. He also testified that none of the species identified by Dr. Van de Poll as occurring in these pools fit any of the categories listed in Rule 302.04(a)(7). He also stated that vernal pools themselves are not rare; nor did these pools provide any rare functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Both Dr. Van de Poll and Mr. Wood testified that the vernal and seasonal pools were within the wetlands delineated in DOT\u2019s application and that their existence did not change the principal function of the wetlands as listed by DOT, which was wildlife habitat. Mr. Wood also testified that the discovery of vernal pools at the site would have no effect on the analysis of the least environmentally damaging practicable alternative. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s interpretation of Rule 302.04(a)(7) was legally erroneous and its determination that the existence of vernal pools required vacating the wetlands permit was unsupported by the evidence. <em>Cf. Mt. Valley Mall, 144 </em>N.H. at 647. Because we conclude that the trial court erred in vacating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the decisions of DES and the Wetlands Council on this basis, we need not address whether the court erred in finding that DES\u2019 imposition of conditions in the permit, which, among other things, required an updated assessment of the project\u2019s impact on wetlands, did not cure the unreasonableness and unlawfulness of the permit\u2019s issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We next address the trial court\u2019s ruling that DOT failed to demonstrate: 1) the need for the project\u2019s proposed impact on wetlands; and 2) that the project is the alternative with the least adverse impact to wetlands. <em>See </em>N.H. Admin. Rules, Wt 302.03, 302.04(a) (1), (2). Specifically the court held that DOT \u201cdid not adequately address whether a roundabout was a practicable alternative to the proposed trumpet interchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The court stated that DOT rejected a multi-lane roundabout as an alternative because it did not meet capacity needs for the projected 2015 traffic flow. The court concluded, however, that although DOT conducted three engineering assessments of roundabouts, it \u201cfailed to consider geometric design elements, which greatly increase the vehicles per hour which a roundabout can accommodate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The court relied on studies contained in the record that emphasized the importance of geometry in roundabout design. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">The process of designing roundabouts, more so than other forms of intersections, requires a considerable amount of iteration between geometric layout, operational analysis, and safety evaluation----[M]inor adjustments in geometry can result in significant changes in the safety and/or operational performance. Thus, the designer often needs to revise and refine the initial layout attempt to enhance its capacity and safety. It is rare to produce an optimal geometric design on the first attempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">(Quotation omitted.) The court also noted that a report from the United Kingdom stated that roundabouts could be designed to accommodate 6,000 to 8,000 vehicles per hour, a range that included the 6,455 vehicles per hour predicted by DOT for peak afternoon traffic flow in 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that DOT failed adequately to address whether a roundabout was a practicable alternative because it did not consider geometric design elements is unsupported by the evidence. Gilbert Rogers, DOT\u2019S assistant commissioner and chief engineer, admitted that DOT did not fine-tune a roundabout design, but testified that DOT did consider roundabouts \u201cenough to know whether [the] concept [was] workable or not.\u201d Specifically, he testified that in his professional opinion, a three-lane roundabout would be required at the location of the proposed trumpet interchange in order to accommodate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>project\u2019s demands. He also testified that the document DOT uses for roundabout design only recommends two-lane roundabouts. In addition, in a letter to the chairman of the Keene Advisory Task Force, Carol Murray, assistant commissioner of DOT, and Kathleen Laffey, Division Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, stated that \u201c[sjinee roundabouts are a newer design feature, the public\u2019s likely ability to adapt to using them is an important consideration.\u201d They then noted that \u201cthree lane roundabouts are too complicated for the average American driver to negotiate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">The evidence before the trial court indicated that alteration of the geometric design would not solve the three-lane problem. Thus, while Mr. Rogers agreed that slip lanes or bypass lanes are fine-tuning adjustments that are available but \u201cwere probably not developed\u201d in DOT\u2019s alternatives analysis, he explained that those lanes merely allow right-turning traffic to turn without having to enter the roundabout, and do not affect \u201chow many vehicles can circulate and parallel around the circle at one time,\u201d or, in other words, how many lanes the roundabout must have. He concluded that \u201cyou can do all the fine tuning adjustments you wanted to, but the problem is a three-lane roundabout is not the appropriate answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Mr. Roger\u2019s testimony on this point is corroborated by a graph in plaintiffs exhibit K that charts vehicle entry flow against circulating flow. Certain areas of the graph indicate the use of a single-lane, two-lane, or three-lane roundabout, with overlap areas shown as \u201cshaded bands [which] indicate conditions in which either treatment may be suitable depending on the geometry and acceptable operating conditions.\u201d DOT\u2019s projected traffic volumes chart from the upper bound of the shaded area between two- and three-lane roundabouts (for what appears to be east-bound traffic) to well into the three-lane area (for what appears to be west- and south-bound traffic). Thus, DOT\u2019s analysis showed that no amount of geometric iteration would take a roundabout at this location out of the unacceptable three-lane range. Based on the foregoing, we cannot agree with the trial court that \u201cDOT was obligated to design roundabouts manipulating the various geometric variables to determine whether a roundabout is a practicable alternative to the proposed trumpet interchange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Finally, CLF argues that even if DOT prevailed on any of its issues on appeal, the trial court made numerous other findings of fact and rulings of law, which DOT has not challenged on appeal, that invalidate its permit. We decline to address this argument on appeal. Although the trial court made rulings on proposed findings of fact and rulings of law that may appear inconsistent with DES\u2019 and the Wetland\u2019s Council\u2019s decisions, it did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>not base its decision upon them. Rather, it expressly stated that because it found the Wetlands Council\u2019s decision unlawful and unreasonable for the reasons stated, it \u201cneed not address the CLF\u2019s remaining arguments.\u201d We will not speculate as to the effect these findings and rulings might have had upon the trial court\u2019s decision had it chosen to address them in its order. Thus, we decline to consider CLF\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand to the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded,</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b41-6\">Broderick and Dalianis, JJ., concurred; Duggan, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b41-7\">DUGGAN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AW\">dissenting. Because I disagree with the majority\u2019s narrow interpretation of New Hampshire Administrative Rule, Wt 302.04(a)(7), I respectfully dissent. Moreover, the superior court\u2019s ruling was based on independent grounds which DOT has not challenged on appeal and which require us to affirm the superior court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Pursuant to Rule 302.04(a), an applicant for a permit to dredge or fill wetlands must:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-9\">demonstrate by plan and example that the following factors have been considered in [its] design in assessing the impact of the proposed project to areas and environments under the department\u2019s jurisdiction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-10\">(7) The impact on plants, fish, and wildlife including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-11\">a. Rare, special concern species;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">b. State and federally listed threatened and endangered species;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">c.

Exemplary natural communities identified by the New Hampshire Natural Heritage Inventory (NHI) \u2014 Department of Resources and Economic Development.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-16\">N.H. Admin. Rules, Wt 302.04(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-17\">In this case, the Wetlands Council interpreted Rule 302.04(a)(7) as \u201crequiring applicants to assess impacts to rare, threatened and endangered and migratory fish and wildlife and NHI communities; no other wildlife concerns are included in the rules.\u201d The superior court ruled that the Wetlands Council\u2019s interpretation of the rale was \u201ctoo narrow.\u201d As the superior court explained, \u201cThe use of the word \u2018including\u2019 indicates that the list is not meant to be exhaustive. Moreover, the rules governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the permitting process are to be applied to \u2018meet the purpose expressed by RSA482-A:1.\u201d\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">In interpreting Rule 302.04(a)(7), the majority relies upon <em>Roberts v. General Motors Corp., </em>138 N.H. 532 (1994), a case that interpreted the phrase \u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d as it appears in the Consumer Protection Act. There is no need, however, to examine how we have analyzed similar language in other statutes to interpret the scope of Rule 302.04(a)(7) because the rules of the Wetlands Council expressly dictate how Rule 302.04 is to be interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Specifically, New Hampshire Administrative Rule, Wt 302.02 states that the rules governing the permitting process are to be applied to \u201cmeet the purpose expressed by RSA 482-A:l.\u201d N.H. ADMIN. RULES, Wt 302.02. Thus, in order to comply with the rules, applicants must consider the impact of a project in light of the purpose expressed by RSA 482-A:l.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The purpose expressed by RSA 482-A:l is broad. The statute is designed \u201cto protect ... wetlands ... from despoliation ,.. because such despoliation ... will adversely affect the value of such areas as sources of nutrients for finfish, Crustacea, shellfish and wildlife of significant value, [and] will damage or destroy habitats and reproduction areas for plants, fish and wildlife of importance____\u201d RSA 482-A:l (2001). The purpose of the statute is not limited to protecting the five categories of plants, fish and wildlife listed in Rule 302.04(a)(7). Instead, the scope of protection is only limited by the phrases \u201cof significant value\u201d and \u201cof importance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Rather than requiring DOT to consider the impact on all plants, fish and wildlife that are \u201cof importance\u201d or that are \u201cof significant value,\u201d the Wetlands Council interpreted Rule 302.04(a)(7) to require DOT to assess the impact only \u201cto rare, threatened and endangered and migratory fish and wildlife and NHI communities.\u201d Because the Wetlands Council was bound by its own regulations to construe Rule 302.04(a)(7) broadly in light of the purpose expressed by RSA 482-A:l and it failed to do so, the superior court correctly ruled that the Council\u2019s narrow interpretation was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Even if we accept a narrow interpretation of Rule 302.04(a)(7), the superior court\u2019s order must be affirmed because it was based on independent grounds which DOT has not challenged on appeal. Specifically, the superior court ruled that DOT failed to comply with Rules 302.04(a)(7), 302.04(a)(16) and 302.04(a)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">With regard to DOT\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 302.04(a)(7), the superior court granted the following two findings and made the following rulings based on the record and exhibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>27. The Ashuelot River corridor, which runs through the project area, is a migratory route for raptors, waterfowl, and songbirds and provides feeding areas for bald eagles. According to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">The state threatened and endangered wildlife species we have records for in the Keene and Swanzey areas include the bald eagle, peregrine falcon, northern harrier, Cooper\u2019s hawk, common loon, common nighthawk and the osprey. Most of these records are of migrants observed in the area. Species with potentially undocumented nest locations would include Cooper\u2019s hawk and the common nighthawk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">28. DOT conducted no analysis of the extent to which its proposed project will impact the above bird species.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Based on the information set forth above, the superior court found that DOT conducted no analysis of the impact on these threatened, migratory and endangered species. The trial court thus ruled, based on this independent ground, that DOT failed to comply with Rule 302.04(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Wholly apart from Rule 302.04(a)(7), there is another completely separate and independent ground for the superior court\u2019s decision under Rules 302.04(a)(16) and 302.04(a)(17).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The superior court granted six other findings and made the following rulings based on the record and exhibits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-10\">33.

Rules, Wt 302.04(a)(16), (17).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">Given the clear requirements of subsections (16) and (17) of Rule 302.04(a) and the superior court\u2019s findings, this constitutes another independent basis to affirm the superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">On appeal, DOT does not dispute the substance of these findings and rulings. Rather, DOT argues that the superior court did not base its decision on these findings and rulings. DOT points out that towards the end of its twelve-page decision, the court stated: \u201cBecause the Court finds that the Wetlands Council\u2019s decision to uphold the DES\u2019s issuance of the permit was unreasonable and unlawful for the above reasons, the Court need not address the CLF\u2019s remaining arguments.\u201d The court\u2019s order then states, in a separate paragraph entitled \u201cConclusion,\u201d that: \u201cFor all of the above reasons, the DES\u2019s approval of the DOT\u2019S permit application and the Wetlands Council\u2019s subsequent affirmance are VACATED.\u201d Immediately following this paragraph, the court specifically ruled on the requests for findings of fact and rulings of law submitted by CLF and by DOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">DOT argues that because the superior court stated that its ruling was based on the \u201cabove reasons\u201d and the findings and rulings come after that, we should not consider the findings and rulings because they are \u201cirrelevant.\u201d This argument ignores the practice of superior court judges and is inconsistent with a fair reading of the court\u2019s order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>This court reviews hundreds of decisions by superior court judges. It is common practice for those judges to place their rulings on requested findings of fact and rulings of law at the end of their opinions. In this case, the opinion follows this common format. We thus should attach no legal significance to the fact that the findings and rulings follow the conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">More fundamentally, the rulings here were hardly an afterthought. The court obviously went through the requests carefully and individually. The court specifically identified those which were granted, denied or neither granted nor denied. Indeed, the superior court judge took the time to redraft two of the requests. Given the superior court\u2019s extensive attention to the rulings, it is wholly artificial to conclude that, because the court stated that its decision was based on the \u201cabove reasons,\u201d the court\u2019s rulings on the requests were a meaningless exercise and that we are free to ignore them. The court\u2019s rulings constitute a separate, independent basis to affirm the superior court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Finally, the majority only implicitly addresses and rejects the fourth issue raised by DOT on this appeal. DOT argues that: \u201cAdministrative rules adopted under a general enabling statute may not lawfully be interpreted to outweigh specifically delegated statutory authority of a state agency.\u201d DOT argues that because DOT is empowered to \u201cexercise control over all matters related to the location and design of New Hampshire\u2019s Highways,\u201d it follows that \u201c[a]bsent evidence of an abuse of discretion, NHDES accords deference to NHDOT\u2019s design criteria. This respectful deference is in accord with proper statutory construction.\u201d DOT argues that the superior court erred by not recognizing this deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">DOT seems to be arguing that when DES reviews permit applications from DOT, DES must defer to DOT\u2019s statutory authority and expertise and review DOT\u2019s application only for an \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d Presumably, under DOT\u2019s analysis, all other applicants would be subject to a different and more rigorous standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">DOT\u2019s argument is simply inconsistent with the plain language of RSA chapter 482-A. The statute applies to any \u201cperson\u201d who submits an application to dredge or fill wetlands. \u201cPerson\u201d is defined to include \u201cgovernmental departments and agencies.\u201d RSA 482-A:2, VI (Supp. 2002). Nothing in the statute even remotely suggests that DOT is to receive different or more favorable treatment than any other applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
