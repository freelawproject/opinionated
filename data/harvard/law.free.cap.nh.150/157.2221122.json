O\u2019Meara, be publicly censured for violation of certain rules of professional conduct. We referred the petition to a Judicial Referee <em>(Bean, </em>J.) for a hearing. The referee found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent violated New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct 3.1, 3.3(a)(1), 8.4(a) and 8.4(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>and recommended public censure. We agree with the referee\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The following facts were agreed upon by the parties. This professional conduct case arose from divorce and custody proceedings (the underlying action) between the respondent and his former wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The ethics violations relate to two pleadings filed by the respondent while representing himself in the underlying action. The first was an objection to a motion to quash subpoena and motion to compel deposition testimony, arising from the following situation: The respondent indicated in a letter to his wife\u2019s attorney, Campbell Harvey, dated September 28, 2000, that he would like to depose a certain witness on October 17, 2000. He stated that if he did not hear from Attorney Harvey by October 10, 2000, he would issue a subpoena. Notwithstanding that statement, the respondent sent the Cheshire County Sheriff a letter dated October 3, 2000, enclosing a subpoena duces tecum dated October 4,2000, to serve on the witness. The subpoena was served on October 6,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">By letter dated October 4, 2000, and faxed to the respondent that day, Attorney Harvey informed him that she was unavailable for a deposition on October 17, 2000. She filed a motion to quash the subpoena on October 11,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">The respondent objected on October 16, 2000, stating that, as he had not received a response from Attorney Harvey by October 10, 2000, he sent a subpoena on that date, when in fact he had issued the subpoena prior to that date. The committee found that the respondent incorrectly represented the date of the subpoena and that, even if it had been a mistake, he failed to correct it with the court once he learned of it. The committee alleged that this conduct violated Rules 3.3(a)(1), 8.4(a) and 8.4(c). The respondent admits the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">The second pleading was a motion to modify custody of the respondent\u2019s two minor children (custody motion). The motion contained allegations about the respondent\u2019s wife that \u201cthe Committee found to be gross embellishments on the truth lacking sound factual predicates.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) The committee found that these allegations were primarily based upon conversations the respondent had with his children and that he conceded that he \u201chad no independent information or evidence indicating a basis for any of these allegations.\u201d (Quotation and brackets omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">The committee alleged that the respondent\u2019s statements in the custody motion violated Rules 3.1, 3.3(a)(1), 3.3(a)(3), 8.4(a) and 8.4(c). The respondent admits the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The referee concluded that the respondent violated: Rule 3.1 \u201cby asserting issues without a basis for doing so that was not frivolous\u201d; Rule 3.3(a)(1) \u201cby making false statements of material fact to a tribunal\u201d; Rule 8.4(a) \u201cby violating the Rules of Professional Conduct\u201d; and Rule 8.4(c) \u201cby engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit and misrepresentation.\u201d The referee recommended adopting the committee\u2019s proposed sanction of public censure.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">As the respondent does not contest the referee\u2019s findings of violations, the only issue before us is the appropriate sanction to be applied. <em>See Jones\u2019 Case, </em>137 N.H. 351, 357 (1993). Both the respondent and the committee argue that we should adopt the referee\u2019s recommended sanction. Nevertheless, \u201c[w]e retain the ultimate authority to determine the appropriate sanction for a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct.\u201d <em>Morgan\u2019s Case, </em>143 N.H. 475, 476-77 (1999). In doing so, \u201cwe are mindful that discipline is not intended as a mode of inflicting punishment for an offense\u201d; rather, its purpose \u201cis to protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and prevent similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477. Accordingly, the sanction imposed must be sufficient to achieve these goals. <em>Id. </em>Each case, however, \u201cis judged on its own facts and circumstances,\u201d and the sanction we impose must take into account both the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating circumstances appearing in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">As an initial matter, we note that \u201cno single transgression reflects more negatively on the legal profession than a lie.\u201d <em>Kalil\u2019s Case, </em>146 N.H. 466, 467 (2001) (quotation omitted). Thus, we have ordered disbarment for attorney misconduct involving dishonesty. <em>See Welt\u2019s Case, </em>136 N.H. 588, 592 (1993) (citing cases). We have observed, however, that \u201cthose cases involved additional and repeated misconduct, including the respondents\u2019 failure to cooperate with the professional conduct committee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This case, on the other hand, involves two isolated incidents of misconduct, and the referee found that the respondent \u201chas had a cooperative attitude toward, and has made full disclosure in, the proceeding before the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Cf. id. </em>In addition, the referee found other mitigating factors including the lack of a prior disciplinary record, personal and emotional problems experienced by the respondent due to the issues being decided in the underlying action, and the respondent\u2019s display of remorse by expression of regret and admission of his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">While acknowledging that \u201cthe responsibility to the court is certainly not diminished when a lawyer appears <em>pro se,\u201d </em>the committee found it significant that the respondent\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>false statements were made in the context of a personal, highly-charged and emotional proceeding in which he served as his own counsel, a circumstance that is not likely to repeat itself and one which pressures a lawyer\u2019s good judgment in a way that would not occur when involved only as an advocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Although the circumstances surrounding the respondent\u2019s misconduct may \u201cplac[e] his malfeasance in a more sympathetic context,\u201d <em>Bruzga\u2019s Case, </em>145 N.H. 62, 71 (2000), we stress that an attorney representing himself is held to the same standards as an attorney representing a client, particularly the standard of candor toward the tribunal. \u201cThe confidence of judges to rely with certainty upon the word of attorneys forms the very bedrock of our judicial system.\u201d <em>Kalil\u2019s Case, </em>146 N.H. at 467 (quotation omitted). That confidence must be justified whether an attorney is appearing on behalf of a client or <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Nevertheless, there are important differences between this ease and those in which suspension was ordered for violations of the same rules the respondent violated. <em>See Feld\u2019s Case, </em>149 N.H. 19, 30 (2002) (one year suspension); <em>Bruzga\u2019s Case, </em>145 N.H. at 63 (one year suspension); <em>Kalil\u2019s Case, </em>146 N.H. at 466 (three month suspension). Specifically, the respondent did not: 1) counsel another person to lie <em>(Feld); </em>2) assert the attorney client privilege in a bad faith attempt to avoid having his client answer a deposition question <em>(Feld); </em>3) refuse to admit his misconduct before the referee or this court <em>(Feld, Bruzga); </em>4) play word games before the referee to attempt to justify his misconduct <em>(Bruzga); </em>5) lie twice about threatening a <em>pro se </em>litigant in direct response to a judge\u2019s questions about the event <em>(Kalil); </em>6) select a judicial forum in order to embarrass, harass or intimidate a third party <em>(Bruzga); </em>or 7) engage in a concerted course of unethical conduct that involved multiple incidents occurring over an extended period of time <em>(Feld).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">Given the absence of factors that justified imposition of suspension in <em>Feld\u2019s Case, Bruzga\u2019s Case </em>and <em>Kalil\u2019s Case, </em>and the presence of the mitigating factors found by the referee, we conclude that public censure is the appropriate sanction. In this case, \u201cpublic censure will satisfy the stated purposes of protecting the public, maintaining the public confidence in the bar, preserving the integrity of the legal profession, and deterring future misconduct.\u201d <em>Welt\u2019s Case, </em>136 N.H. at 593. Accordingly, we order public censure on all of the violations found by the referee and order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>respondent to reimburse the committee for the costs of investigating and prosecuting this matter, <em>see </em>SUP. Ct. R. 37(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-5\">DALIANIS, J., concurred; MORRILL, Barry and Sullivan, JJ., superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
