We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The jury could have found the following facts. This case arose from a three-car accident, involving two rear-end collisions at a traffic signal on High Street in Somersworth. The accident occurred at or about the time when the traffic signal turned from red to green. An Isuzu Rodeo driven by Dena-Jo Caron was one of the vehicles stopped at the red light. The plaintiffs\u2019 car, driven by Mr. Babb, was behind the Caron vehicle. The defendant\u2019s vehicle, a fifteen-passenger van, was behind the plaintiffs\u2019 car. At or about the time when the light changed to green, the plaintiffs\u2019 car rear-ended the Caron vehicle and the defendant\u2019s van rear-ended the plaintiffs\u2019 car. The plaintiffs sued the defendant for Mr. Babb\u2019s personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">At trial, the defendant conceded that he rear-ended the plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle. He asserted that he was not negligent because there was not enough time for him to stop his van. The occupants of the Caron vehicle testified that the plaintiffs\u2019 car hit their vehicle twice. As one of the occupants testified, \u201cthe person behind us ... ping-ponged, came back and hit us twice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">The jury returned a general verdict in the defendant\u2019s favor, which the plaintiffs moved to set aside. <em>See </em>Super. Ct. R. 73. The trial court upheld the verdict, finding that the jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that the plaintiffs\u2019 car hit the Caron vehicle first, before the defendant\u2019s van rear-ended it, propelling it again into the Caron vehicle. The court ruled that the jury could have reasonably concluded, in the absence of evidence that Mr. Babb\u2019s injuries were caused by the collision with the defendant\u2019s van, and not by the initial collision with the Caron vehicle, that the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proving the defendant\u2019s negligence. Thus, the court held: \u201c[I]t is not that the defendant was free from fault; far from it. That is not the focus of the court\u2019s inquiry here. It is that the plaintiffs did not attempt to, and did not, distinguish between the two separate impacts in terms of what caused [Mr. Babb\u2019s] injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u201cWe will set aside a jury verdict if it is conclusively against the weight of the evidence or if it is the result of mistake, partiality, or corruption.\u201d <em>Quinn Bros. v. Whitehouse, </em>144 N.H. 186, 190 (1999) (quotations omitted). The plaintiffs argue only that the verdict is conclusively against the weight of the evidence. \u201cConclusively against the weight of the evidence should be interpreted to mean that the verdict was one no reasonable jury could return.\u201d <em>Mullin v. Joy, </em>145 N.H. 96, 96-97 (2000) (quotation omitted). We will uphold the trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to set aside the verdict unless the decision was made without evidence or the court committed an unsustainable exercise of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 97; <em>see also State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">The defendant contends that the plaintiffs have waived any claim that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence because they failed to file a motion for directed verdict at trial. A motion for directed verdict is required before a motion to set aside the verdict on sufficiency grounds, but is not required before a motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that it is against the weight of the evidence. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Carr, </em>119 N.H. 851, 854 (1979); <em>Underhill v. Baker, </em>115 N.H. 469, 472 (1975); <em>Bennett v. Larose, </em>82 N.H. 443, 445-48 (1926); 5 R. WIEBUSCH, NEW Hampshire Practice, Civil Practice and Procedure \u00a7 48.01, at 326, \u00a7 56.03, at 426-27. We do not address whether this distinction between a motion to set aside a verdict because of insufficient evidence and a motion to set aside a verdict because it is against the weight of the evidence is still viable following our decision in <em>Panas v. Harakis &amp; K-Mart Corp. </em>129 N.H. 591 (1987), because the parties have not raised that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The trial court ruled that the jury\u2019s verdict was reasonable, in part, because it was consistent with \u201cone plausible interpretation of the evidence.\u201d Under this interpretation, the plaintiffs\u2019 car collided with the Caron vehicle before the defendant\u2019s van hit the plaintiffs\u2019 car. There is evidence in the record to support this theory. Mr. Babb testified that, when the light turned green, \u201cthe cars in front of me started to go forward, and I did too. And then, I didn\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember putting the brake on, but the traffic slacked up just a little bit, and \u2018bang,\u2019 I got hit from behind.\u201d The Carons, however, testified that, when the light turned green, their vehicle was at a complete stop and had not yet moved before the plaintiffs\u2019 car hit it from behind. The jury could have chosen to believe the Carons\u2019 version over Mr. Babb\u2019s and, from this testimony, inferred that the plaintiffs\u2019 car hit the Caron vehicle before the defendant\u2019s van hit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 car. Thus, with respect to this portion of the verdict, the trial court\u2019s ruling is a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The trial court further ruled that, having determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 car first collided with the Caron vehicle, the jury could then have reasonably concluded that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the collision with the defendant\u2019s van, rather than the collision with the Caron vehicle, caused Mr. Babb\u2019s injuries and, thus, failed to meet their burden of proof. This too is a sustainable exercise of discretion. The record shows that the plaintiffs offered no evidence that Mr. Babb\u2019s injuries were caused by the collision with the defendant\u2019s van. Absent evidence linking the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence to the plaintiffs\u2019 damages, the plaintiffs failed to prove their negligence claim. <em>Kravitz v. Beech Hill Hosp., </em>148 N.H. 383, 391 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The plaintiffs urge us to apply our decision in <em>Trull v. Volkswagen of America, </em>145 N.H. 259 (2000), to this case. In <em>Trull, </em>we ruled that the defendants in a crashworthiness case bear the burden of apportionment once the plaintiffs prove causation. <em>Id. </em>at 260. We decline their invitation. <em>Cf. Cusson v. Beauregard, </em>143 N.H. 410, 412-13 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In addition, although the trial court intimated to the contrary, the jury could have reasonably concluded, based upon the Carons\u2019 testimony, that the accident occurred without any fault on the part of the defendant. We do not interpret the trial court\u2019s comment that the defendant was not \u201cfree from fault\u201d as a formal finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b133-8\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
