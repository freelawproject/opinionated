Connor </em>on the brief), for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b290-6\"><em>Glenn Pfeuffer, pro se, </em>submitted no brief.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-7\">Brock, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Af2\">The petitioner, Joanne Pfeuffer, appeals the order of the Superior Court <em>(Smukler, </em>J.) denying her motion to modify the custody schedule she shares with the respondent, Glenn Pfeuffer, to permit her relocation to South Carolina with their minor son. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">The relevant facts follow. Since their 1997 divorce, the parties have shared legal and physical custody of their son. The parties agreed that the respondent would have physical custody of their son on every other weekend, every Wednesday afternoon, and every other week during summer school vacations. The parties agreed that at all other times, the petitioner would have physical custody of their son, except for certain holidays, birthdays and school vacations. The court modified this custodial schedule in 2001 by extending the respondent\u2019s custodial time on the weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">In August 2001, the petitioner moved to modify the custodial schedule to permit her to relocate to South Carolina, where she had recently found work, and to take the parties\u2019 son with her. The petitioner has a horse farm in Laconia. She sought work elsewhere because she could no longer operate the horse farm profitably. After exploring alternatives, the petitioner located a full-time horse trainer job in South Carolina. The respondent objected to modifying the custodial schedule to permit the petitioner to take their son to South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">The court appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) who submitted a detailed report in which she opined that relocation would not be in the best interests of the parties\u2019 son. To determine whether relocation would serve the son\u2019s best interests, the GAL analyzed each of the factors we set forth in <em>Tomasko v. DuBuc, </em>145 N.H. 169 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">The GAL concluded that relocation would impair the ability of both parties to maintain their active involvement in their son\u2019s life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-12\">[T]he current custodial schedule allows each parent to be actively involved in [their sonj\u2019s school and recreational life____[The son] enjoys, loves, and needs both parents in order to have the balanced, full life that he enjoys____At the age of eight, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>apparently needs to see both parents frequently. He does not like to be away from either parent for a significant length of time____ Being away from either his father or his mother for an extended period of time would be difficult for [him].... The current ready availability and consistency of each parent in [his] life offer [him] his best opportunity to continue his healthy growth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The GAL also observed that due to the distance between New Hampshire and South Carolina, the cost of transportation, especially for the respondent, \u201cwould be prohibitive.\u201d She noted as well that the proposed visitation schedule \u201cwould not allow [the respondent] to maintain the existing quality of the relationship he has with [his son].\u201d While the GAL acknowledged that the petitioner\u2019s financial situation would require the parties\u2019 son to change schools even if he remained in New Hampshire, the GAL continued to be unconvinced that his educational opportunities would be greater in South Carolina than in New Hampshire. \u201cTo move him to South Carolina ... would only further increase his current learning difficulties,\u201d she found. Accordingly, the GAL opined that the son\u2019s best interests \u201clie in his remaining in New Hampshire where both parents can maintain their ongoing relationships with him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Following a hearing at which the parties agreed to be governed by the <em>Tomasko </em>factors, the court incorporated and agreed with the GAL\u2019s report and \u201cthorough analysis\u201d of each <em>Tomasko </em>factor. Noting that some of the <em>Tomasko </em>factors favored the petitioner\u2019s relocation, while others did not, the court ruled that \u201c[w]hen the factors are examined together ... in the context of answering the question of what would be in [the son]\u2019s best interest, they strongly weigh against the proposed relocation.\u201d Although the GAL discussed each of the <em>Tomasko </em>factors in detail, the court discussed only one factor \u2014 the effect of the move on the respondent\u2019s relationship with his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The sole issue for our review is whether the trial court appropriately balanced the <em>Tomasko </em>factors. We review the trial court\u2019s analysis under our unsustainable exercise of discretion standard. <em>See Tomasko, </em>145 N.H. at 172; <em>cf. State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001) (explaining unsustainable exercise of discretion standard). \u201cThis means that we review only whether the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made.\u201d <em>In the Matter of Lockaby &amp; Smith, </em>148 N.H. 462, 465 (2002) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">In <em>Tomasko, </em>we used the analytical framework set forth in <em>Ireland v. Ireland, </em>717 A.2d 676 (Conn. 1998). Under this framework, the custodial parent seeking to relocate has the initial burden of demonstrating, by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>preponderance of the evidence, that the relocation is for a legitimate purpose and is reasonable in light of that purpose. <em>Tomasko, </em>145 N.H. at 171. Once the custodial parent has met this <em>pnma facie </em>burden, the burden shifts to the noncustodial parent to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that relocating is not in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Id. </em>at 172; <em>see also </em>RSA 458:23-a, IV, V (Supp. 2002) (effective July 7,2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Whether the petitioner met her <em>prima facie </em>burden is not at issue. This appeal concerns only whether the trial court properly concluded that the respondent met his burden of showing the relocation was not in the child\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Under <em>Tomasko, </em>to determine the child\u2019s best interests, the court examines: (1) each parent\u2019s reasons for seeking or opposing the move; (2) the quality of the relationships between the child and the parents; (3) the impact of the move on the quantity and quality of the child\u2019s future contact with the noncustodial parent; (4) the degree to which the custodial parent\u2019s and child\u2019s life may be enhanced economically, emotionally and educationally by the move; (5) the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the noncustodial parent and child through suitable visitation arrangements; (6) any negative impact from continued or exacerbated hostility between the parents; and (7) the effect that the move may have on extended family relations. <em>Tomasko, </em>145 N.H. at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">No one of the above factors may be presumed to be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 173. Nor are these the exclusive factors bearing upon a determination of a child\u2019s best interests. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Tomasko, </em>we encouraged courts to consider additional suitable factors and to give all factors appropriate weight. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The petitioner first argues that the trial court committed legal error by giving one <em>Tomasko </em>factor undue emphasis. That factor concerned the impact the relocation would have upon the son\u2019s future contact with the respondent. This argument oversimplifies the court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">While the court discussed only one <em>Tomasko </em>factor, we do not interpret this as the court relying upon that factor to the exclusion of all others. The court specifically incorporated the GAL\u2019s report and analysis, which thoroughly discussed all of the <em>Tomasko </em>factors. Its order makes clear that its guiding principle was the child\u2019s best interests, not the respondent\u2019s. This was entirely appropriate. <em>See In the Matter of Nelson &amp; Horsley, </em>149 N.H. 545, 547 (2003). \u201cWhile the respective rights of the custodial and noncustodial parents are unquestionably significant factors that must be considered, it is the rights and needs of the children that must be accorded the greatest weight, since they are innocent victims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>their parents\u2019 decision to divorce and are the least equipped to handle the stresses of the changing family situation.\u201d <em>Tropea v. Tropea, </em>665 N.E.2d 145, 150 (N.Y. 1996) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The petitioner next argues that the record does not support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that relocation would substantially interfere with the respondent\u2019s relationship with his son. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The GAL found that there was \u201cno question that a move to South Carolina would drastically change the relationship that [the child] has with his father.\u201d As she explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">[The son] is used to seeing his father every week, frequently at school, each Wednesday, and every other weekend for at least three nights. During the summer, [he] sees both parents equally every other week____Although the move to South Carolina might significantly improve [the petitioner\u2019s economic ability to provide for [the child], it would destroy the close and fun loving relationship that [he] enjoys with [the respondent].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">As in <em>Tomasko, </em>there was evidence that the respondent was very involved in his son\u2019s life. <em>Tomasko, </em>145 N.H. at 173. The GAL reported, for instance, that in addition to scheduled visitation, the respondent participated in almost every school field trip and frequently came to his son\u2019s school during the day to share recess with him. The GAL noted also that the respondent organized a soccer team for the school, and volunteered to be the soccer coach and the supervisor of a skiing program for the students.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">Based upon this record, we hold that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that relocation would substantially interfere with the respondent\u2019s relationship with his son was a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">We are unpersuaded by the petitioner\u2019s attempts to liken this case to <em>In the Matter of Lockaby &amp; Smith. </em>In that case, there were no specific findings to explain why the proposed new visitation schedule would not be as conducive to the children\u2019s relationship with their father as the old visitation schedule. <em>Lockaby &amp; Smith, </em>148 N.H. at 468. By contrast, the GAL in this case specifically found that the proposed relocation and changed visitation schedule \u201cwould destroy the close and fun loving relationship\u201d between the respondent and his son. <em>See Tomasko, </em>145 N.H. at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">The petitioner asserts that the court erroneously failed to require the respondent to show \u201cthat the reduction or change in visitation due to the relocation is of such a degree that the parent-child relationship cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>maintained.\u201d This was not the respondent\u2019s burden. His burden was to show that relocation would not be in the son\u2019s best interests. <em>See id. </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The petitioner next argues that the trial court erroneously weighed the <em>Tomasko </em>factors together. She contends that the trial court should have considered each factor in isolation and determined the extent to which it favored relocation. We find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to weigh the factors as a whole to determine whether they show that relocation was in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>Tomasko </em>does not mandate that a court consider each factor individually and separately. <em>See Azia v. Dilascia, </em>780 A.2d 992, 1000 (Conn. App. Ct. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The petitioner argues that each <em>Tomasko </em>factor is either neutral or supports her decision to relocate and, on balance, all of them support relocation. We disagree. We will affirm the trial court if, as in this case, the record establishes an objective basis sufficient to sustain the discretionary judgment made. <em>See Lockaby &amp; Smith, </em>148 N.H. at 465. Given the GAL\u2019s report upon which the trial court relied, we hold that the court\u2019s conclusion that relocation was not in the son\u2019s best interests was a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-8\">Broderick, Nadeau, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
