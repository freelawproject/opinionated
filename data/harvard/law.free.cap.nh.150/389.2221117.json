McCarthy, was convicted by a jury of first-degree assault on Michael Pawlick, <em>see </em>RSA 631:1 (1996), and ordered to pay restitution to Pawlick and his mother, Jill Pawlick, <em>see </em>RSA 651:62 (Supp. 2002). The defendant appeals, arguing that the Superior Court <em>(Brennan, </em>J.) erred in awarding restitution for lost wages to Ms. Pawlick. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-15\">On June 22, 2001, the defendant stabbed Pawlick, an unemancipated minor, several times causing severe injuries to his neck, chest and abdomen. At his sentencing hearing, the defendant was ordered to pay restitution, including $3,250 to Ms. Pawlick for wages lost during four weeks in which she cared for her injured son and one week when she attended court.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The defendant argues that the trial court erred by ordering restitution for Ms. Pawlick because the context of RSA 651:62, 111(b) indicates that she is not a \u201cvictim\u201d entitled to restitution for lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In cases of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of the legislature\u2019s intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. <em>In the Matter of Plaisted &amp; Plaisted, </em>149 N.H. 522, 523 (2003). We ascribe to statutory words and phrases their usual and common meaning, unless the statute itself suggests otherwise. <em>State v. Barnett, </em>147 N.H. 334, 339 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">RSA 651:62 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">As used in this subdivision, unless the context otherwise indicates:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">I. \u201cClaimant\u201d means a victim, dependent, or any person legally authorized to act on behalf of the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">II. \u201cDependent\u201d means any person who was wholly or partially dependent upon the victim for care and support when the crime was committed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">III. \u201cEconomic loss\u201d means out-of-pocket losses or other expenses incurred as a direct result of a criminal offense, including:...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-11\">(b) Loss of income by the victim or the victim\u2019s dependents____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-12\">V. \u201cRestitution\u201d means money ... provided by the offender to compensate a victim for economic loss, or to compensate any collateral source subrogated to the rights of the victim____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-14\">VI. \u201cVictim\u201d means a person or claimant who suffers economic loss as a result of an offender\u2019s criminal conduct____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">In order for Ms. Pawlick to receive restitution, she must fall within the class of \u201cvictims,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 651:62, VI, because only a \u201cvictim,\u201d or a \u201ccollateral source subrogated to the rights of the victim,\u201d is entitled to restitution. RSA 651:62, V. In order to qualify as a \u201cvictim,\u201d she must be a \u201cperson or claimant who suffers economic loss.\u201d RSA 651:62, VI. One difficulty with interpreting this statute is that the class of \u201cvictims\u201d is both narrower, <em>see </em>RSA 651:62, I, and broader, <em>see </em>RSA 651:62, VI, than the class of \u201cclaimants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">If the analysis begins with the definition of \u201cclaimant,\u201d the class of \u201cvictims\u201d appears narrower than the class of \u201cclaimants\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cclaimant\u201d is defined to include not only \u201cvictims,\u201d but also \u201cdependents\u201d and \u201cpersons legally authorized to act on behalf of the victim.\u201d <em>See </em>RSA 651:62, I. However, if the analysis begins with the definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d the class of \u201cvictims\u201d appears broader than the class of \u201cclaimants\u201d because \u201cvictim\u201d is defined to include not only claimants who suffer economic loss, but also other persons, who are not claimants, who suffer such loss. Thus, the statute is analytically circular with regard to the definitions of \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cclaimant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Another difficulty with the definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 651:62, VI, is the interaction between the class of \u201cclaimants\u201d and the class of \u201cpersons.\u201d The class of \u201cvictims\u201d includes any \u201cclaimant or person\u201d who suffers economic loss. Since every member of the class of \u201cclaimants\u201d, <em>see </em>RSA 651:62, I, is a \u201cperson,\u201d <em>see </em>RSA 625:11, II (1996), it would seem that the inclusion of \u201cclaimant\u201d in the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d is superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We find that the circular definitions of \u201cclaimant\u201d and \u201cvictim,\u201d and the seemingly superfluous use of \u201cclaimant\u201d within the definition of \u201cvictim,\u201d create an ambiguity in the language of the statute that is impossible to reconcile; however, a decision to revisit and modify the statute is solely for the legislature. When the language of a statute is ambiguous, we construe it in light of the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting it, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. <em>Appeal of N.H. Dep\u2019t of Transportation, </em>143 N.H. 358, 360 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Therefore, in order to resolve the irreconcilable interplay between the classes of \u201cclaimants\u201d and \u201cvictims,\u201d we turn to the intent of the legislature. The legislature clearly intended to allow restitution for loss of income. <em>See </em>RSA 651:62, 111(b). The difficulty lies in determining who is within that class of persons entitled to restitution for loss of income. In defining the scope of the loss of income provision, the legislature allows loss of income for \u201cthe victim or the victim\u2019s dependents.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The State encourages us to interpret the class of \u201cvictims\u201d broadly so as to include Ms. Pawlick and allow her to receive restitution for her loss of income. The defendant, on the other hand, argues that we must look to the phrase \u201cthe victim or the victim\u2019s dependents\u201d and interpret the class of \u201cvictims\u201d narrowly so as not to include Ms. Pawlick because, while she has suffered loss of income, she is not a victim herself or a dependent of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">In support of its position, the State cites the language in RSA 65!:61-a, II, \u201cthat the court increase, to the maximum extent feasible, the number of instances in which victims receive restitution.\u201d RSA 651:61-a, II (Supp. 2002). Thus, the State argues that we should broadly interpret an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ambiguity in the statute to allow Ms. Pawlick to recover restitution as a \u201cvictim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">We disagree. The language used by the legislature evidences an intent that we increase the number of <em>instances </em>in which a victim recovers and <em>not </em>the number of victims who can recover. While one reasonable interpretation of RSA 651:62, VI supports a finding that Ms. Pawlick <em>could </em>qualify as a \u201cvictim,\u201d we believe that the more reasonable interpretation concludes that Ms. Pawlick is not a \u201cvictim\u201d because \u201cthe context [of the statute] indicates,\u201d RSA 651:62, that she is not \u201cthe victim or the victim\u2019s dependen\u00ae,\u201d RSA 651:62,111(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">When the legislature included the term \u201cvictim\u2019s dependents\u201d within the loss of income provision, it declared that restitution for loss of income would be paid to those who suffer because of criminal conduct even if they do not fall within our common understanding of the meaning of the word \u201cvictim.\u201d Similarly, in RSA 651:62, 111(a), the legislature allowed for recovery by the \u201cvictim\u2019s spouse and immediate family\u201d for mental health services in \u201ccase of the death of the victim.\u201d Both provisions demonstrate the legislature\u2019s ability to expand restitution beyond conventional notions of \u201cvictimhood.\u201d By contrasting both provisions, we observe that the legislature specifically mentions, in the loss of income provision, the term \u201cvictim\u2019s dependents\u201d without mention of the victim\u2019s \u201cimmediate family.\u201d Had the legislature intended to allow persons such as Ms. Pawlick to recover, it would have included \u201cimmediate family,\u201d or some other category that would include her, in the loss of income provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">Therefore, as we do not interpret RSA 651:62,111(b) as providing an avenue of recovery for a minor victim\u2019s mother who has suffered loss of income, the trial court erred in awarding restitution to Ms. Pawlick.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-9\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, Nadeau and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
