Madore, Jr., was convicted of aggravated felonious sexual assault following a jury trial in Superior Court <em>(Perkins, </em>J.). <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:2, I(i) (1996). On appeal, he argues that the superior court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial, as well as his motion for discovery of the victim\u2019s counseling records. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The jury could have found the following relevant facts. On October 18, 2001, the victim and her sister, Jennifer, went to a local Laconia bar after work. Later that night, arrangements were made for the victim to be driven home by the defendant. After leaving the bar, the victim and the defendant drove to a friend\u2019s house where they smoked marijuana. They subsequently returned to the victim\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">While at the apartment, the victim, feeling intoxicated and sleepy, sat on one end of her couch, waiting for her sister to come to the apartment and meet the defendant. The defendant sat on the other end of the couch, drinking a beer and watching a movie. When Jennifer arrived, she helped her sister upstairs into her bedroom, laid her on the bed and covered her with blankets. The victim was intoxicated and fell asleep quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">After helping her sister to bed, Jennifer returned downstairs where the defendant remained on the couch, watching television. Approximately twenty minutes later, Jennifer left the apartment for the night, expecting that the defendant would sleep on the victim\u2019s couch. He subsequently entered the victim\u2019s bedroom and sexually assaulted her.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">At trial, the victim testified concerning the details of the assault. During direct examination, she stated that after having gone to sleep, she was awakened. \u201cI was at the bottom of my bed on my back with a big shadow over my body touching my private area.\u201d She testified that her legs were dangling over the bottom of her bed, her pajama bottoms had been removed, and she eventually crawled backwards toward the headboard to escape her assailant. She then rolled onto her stomach to flee and began holding onto the headboard. She testified that, at that point, the defendant \u201ccouldn\u2019t get his area into mine,\u201d and instead ejaculated onto her back. The defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry .... I hope you don\u2019t hate me for this.\u201d She screamed, and he then grabbed his things and ran out of the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">During cross-examination, defense counsel questioned the victim concerning discrepancies between her testimony on direct examination and statements she had made to police officers the morning of the assault. Specifically, defense counsel asked, &lt;cYou didn\u2019t mention to [the police] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>being on your back with your legs dangling over; did you?\u201d She replied, \u201cThat was a memory that came after counseling.\u201d Both parties were then given the opportunity to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>examination of the victim outside the presence of the jury to determine whether her testimony was the result of a repressed memory.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Following <em>voir dire, </em>the defendant moved for a mistrial. Defense counsel also requested discovery of the victim\u2019s counseling records, stating, \u201cI think given that that evidence has come out, we\u2019re entitled to try and get counseling records. I think we\u2019re entitled to a hearing if those records determine something.\u201d The State objected, arguing that the defendant had suffered no prejudice, and, therefore, no mistrial should be granted. Moreover, the State argued that the mere fact that the victim underwent counseling was insufficient to permit discovery of those records. The court agreed, and denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">We begin with the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial. The defendant argues that the victim\u2019s answer on cross-examination- \u2014 \u201cThat was a memory that came after counseling\u201d\u2014 constituted testimony based upon repressed memory which, pursuant to <em>State v. Hungerford, </em>142 N.H. 110, 119 (1997), was admissible only following a pretrial reliability hearing. The defendant contends that the court\u2019s failure to afford him a <em>Hungerford </em>hearing caused him irreparable injury, entitling him to a mistrial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The basis for granting a mistrial is the existence of circumstances which indicate that justice may not be done if the trial continues to verdict. <em>State v. Dupont, </em>149 N.H. 70, 80 (2003). To justify a mistrial, prejudicial testimony must be more than inadmissible, it must constitute an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions. <em>Id. </em>The trial court is granted broad discretion to decide whether a mistrial or other remedial action is necessary because it is in the best position to measure prejudicial impact. <em>Id. </em>Absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion, we will not overturn the trial court\u2019s decision not to grant a mistrial. <em>Id. </em>Based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that the trial court engaged in an unsustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">At the outset, we note that the defendant\u2019s underlying assumption that the victim\u2019s testimony was inadmissible misconstrues the requirements set forth in <em>Hungerford. </em>In <em>Hungerford, </em>concerned about the influence of therapy on the recovery of memory, we concluded that \u201ctestimony that relies on memories which previously have been partially or fully repressed must satisfy a pretrial reliability determination.\u201d <em>Hungerford, </em>142 N.H. at 119, 123. That pretrial hearing examines the reliability of such testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>as well as the reliability of the techniques used to facilitate the recovery of repressed memories. <em>See id. </em>at 125-26. The existence of repressed memory, however, is a necessary precursor to that hearing; only when repressed memory exists is a hearing held to determine its reliability. <em>See id. </em>at 118-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">In the present case, following <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court found that the victim\u2019s memory was not repressed. Although the defendant accords little weight to this finding, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless unsupported by the record or clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Brunette, </em>145 N.H. 656, 658 (2000). Moreover, \u201c[w]e accord the trial court\u2019s rulings on evidentiary matters considerable deference,\u201d <em>Hungerford, </em>142 N.H. at 117. \u201cA trial court is accorded broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we review the trial court\u2019s ruling under the unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>State v. Lamprey, </em>149 N.H. 364, 370 (2003) (citation omitted). Based upon the record before us, we defer to the trial court\u2019s finding and evidentiary ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">During <em>voir dire, </em>the victim explained that she had \u201cmemories that [she] was not able to write on a piece of paper 15 minutes after leaving the hospital because [she] was so upset, but there were no brand new memories.\u201d When specifically asked whether she had the memory of her feet dangling over the bed when she was taken to the police station following the assault, she stated that, \u201cI had the memory of him hovering over my body at the end of the bed, yes.\u201d The victim further explained the omissions in her statements to police, stating that she did not recount all of the details of the incident, because she \u201cdidn\u2019t have the time or the patience or the energy after six hours of being reraped again at a ... hospital.\u201d Based on this testimony, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding that no issue of repressed memory existed was amply supported by the record. This finding, then, preempted any need for a reliability hearing pursuant to <em>Hungerford. </em>Because the court\u2019s failure to conduct a pretrial hearing did not render the victim\u2019s testimony inadmissible, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">We now address the defendant\u2019s contention that the superior court should have permitted discovery of the victim\u2019s counseling records. He argues that at a minimum, the court should have ordered <em>in camera </em>review of those records to determine whether they contained any evidence of repressed or recovered memories prior to denying his previous motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s decisions on the management of discovery ... under an unsustainable exercise of discretion standard.\u201d <em>State v. Amirault, </em>149 N.H. 541, 543 (2003). Satisfying this standard requires the defendant to \u201cdemonstrate that the trial court\u2019s rulings were clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although \u201c[t]he threshold showing necessary to trigger an <em>in camera </em>review is not unduly high[,] [t]he defendant must meaningfully articulate how the information sought is relevant and material to his defense.\u201d <em>State v. Graham, </em>142 N.H. 357, 363 (1997); <em>see also State v. Gagne, </em>136 N.H. 101, 105 (1992). \u201c[A] plausible theory of relevance and materiality sufficient to justify review of the protected documents\u201d must be offered. <em>Graham, </em>142 N.H. at 363. \u201cAt a minimum, a defendant must present some specific concern, based on more than bare conjecture, that, in reasonable probability, will be explained by the information sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s decision in this case was a sustainable exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">At trial, defense counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">At this point, I mean, it appears as to \u2014 from her answers and from what she says during the cross and the direct that she tells the Court today that she had all of the memories regarding what happened that day prior to going into counseling. I still at this point think I\u2019m entitled to a mistrial. I think the defendant is entitled to a mistrial. I think her statement was \u2014 and I know she tried to explain it, but I think the statement was clear before when I asked her the question about \u2014 um\u2014why she didn\u2019t tell them this, and she said she didn\u2019t remember it until she went to counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>I think given that that evidence has come out, we\u2019re entitled to try and gel counseling records. I think we\u2019re entitled to a hearing if those records determine something.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">(Emphasis added.) Assuming without deciding that defense counsel\u2019s argument satisfied the requirements of <em>Graham </em>and <em>Gagne </em>by setting forth \u201csome factual basis beyond the mere existence of counseling records,\u201d <em>State v. Hoag, </em>145 N.H. 47, 50 (2000), we nevertheless uphold the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant <em>in camera </em>review. The specific concern offered by the defendant \u2014 that <em>in camera </em>review was needed to determine whether the victim\u2019s memory was repressed \u2014 was rendered moot by the trial court\u2019s ruling that the victim\u2019s memory was not repressed. Having already made that determination, the trial court was left with little reason to afford <em>in camera </em>review other than the defendant\u2019s general assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that he was entitled to counseling records. <em>See id. </em>(to trigger <em>in camera </em>review, defendant must assert factual basis beyond the mere existence of counseling records); <em>see also State v. Taylor, </em>139 N.H. 96, 98 (1994). Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-5\">Broderick, Nadeau, Balianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
