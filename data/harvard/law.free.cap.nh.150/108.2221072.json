Bownes, attorney for David Eastman, appeals a decision of the Superior Court (Smukler, J.) denying a motion to exceed maximum counsel fees under Supreme Court Rule 47 (Rule 47). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>The record supports the following facts. On March 22,2002, the superior court appointed Bownes as counsel to Eastman, who had been represented at various times by at least three other attorneys. Eastman was charged with felony counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault and one misdemeanor count of sexual assault. Bownes represented Eastman through the completion of trial, which terminated July 12,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">On August 2, 2002, Bownes filed a motion to exceed maximum fees pursuant to Rule 47. Bownes completed an attorney\u2019s statement of fees, which totaled $9,376.55 for 133.7 hours of work by counsel and 34.3 hours of work by his paralegal. The superior court issued an order denying the motion without any explanation. Bownes filed a motion to reconsider in which he requested a hearing and reconsideration of the matter, or, alternatively, articulation of the court\u2019s reasoning. The superior court denied Bownes\u2019 motion without articulating its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On appeal, Bownes argues that the superior court\u2019s failure to exercise its discretion under Rule 47 is unsustainable, in part, because the trial judge summarily denied Bownes\u2019 motion without any express findings or a hearing and failed to explain his reasoning. In the alternative, Bownes contends that if the court did, in fact, exercise its discretion under Rule 47, that exercise of discretion is not sustainable because good cause and exceptional circumstances warrant the payment of fees exceeding the maximum amount allowed under this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The version of Rule 47 in effect at the time Bownes filed his motion to exceed maximum fees provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">(2) <em>Fees. </em>Maximum compensation is limited as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">(a) Time properly chargeable to case: $60 per hour. The paralegal hourly rate shall not exceed $35.00 and shall be included with fees of counsel for the purposes of determining the maximum fee on any case. Travel time is not a compensable event unless expressly authorized by the court in advance for exceptional circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">(b) Maximum fee per day (for all cases): $400.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-11\">(c) Maximum fee for misdemeanors: $1,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-12\">(d) Maximum fee for felonies: $3,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-13\">Only upon an express, written finding of good cause and exceptional circumstances by the court will the maximum fees be exceeded or will additional fees be authorized. All petitions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>to exceed the maximum fee guidelines must be approved prior to the guidelines being exceeded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">SUP. Ct. R. 47(2) (amended 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">In contrast, the current version of Rule 47 permits the trial court to \u201cwaive the requirement for prior approval when justice so requires.\u201d SUP. Ct. R. 47(2) (effective Oct. 11, 2002). Inasmuch as the old version of Rule 47 controls the outcome of this case, the trial judge was justified in refusing to consider Bownes\u2019 motion because it was untimely. <em>See </em>SUP. CT. R. 47; <em>cf. In the Matter of Nyhan and Nyhan, </em>147 N.H. 768, 770 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Because trial judges may have occasion in the future to exercise their discretion to approve additional fees upon an express written finding of good cause and exceptional circumstances, we will address that issue. In determining the reasonableness of the fee charged, judges should consider, among other criteria, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">1) responsibilities involved measured by the magnitude and importance of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">2) manner in which duties were performed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">3) knowledge, skill, efficiency, professionalism, and judgment required of and used by counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-11\">4) nature of counsel\u2019s practice and injury thereto;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-12\">5) any extraordinary pressure of time or other factors under which services were rendered; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-13\">6) any other circumstances relevant and material to a determination of a fair and reasonable fee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-14\"><em>United States v. Johnson, </em>214 F. Supp. 2d 488, 491 (E.D. Pa. 2002) (quotation omitted). In <em>Johnson, </em>the court adopted these criteria after an analysis of the Criminal Justice Act, which sets forth standards for payment of appointed counsel. <em>See id.; </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d)(3) (2000). The policy behind this act is to furnish competent counsel to those who could not afford one and to ensure that those attorneys who accept appointments do not suffer economic hardship. <em>See United States v. Carnevale, </em>624 F. Supp. 381, 383-84 (D.R.I. 1985). To balance these interests, the Criminal Justice Act provides that maximum fee compensation may be exceeded in cases of \u201cextended or complex representation\u201d when the trial judge or magistrate certifies that excess payment is necessary to provide fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>compensation and the payment is approved by the chief judge of the circuit. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(d)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The determination of fair compensation is a fact-specific inquiry based upon the circumstances of the attorney and defendant involved, and the situation surrounding both the appointment and the retention of counsel. <em>United States v. James, </em>301 F. Supp. 107, 117 (W.D. Tex. 1969). Judicial experience must guide this determination. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>802 F. Supp. 304, 308 (C.D. Cal. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">A fee for the defense of an indigent defendant need not be equal to that which an attorney would expect to receive from a private client, but should strike a balance between conflicting interests, which include the ethical obligation of a lawyer to make legal representation available and the increasing burden on the legal profession to provide counsel to indigents. <em>State v. Robinson, </em>123 N.H. 665, 668 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">We set forth these criteria today to guide trial judges in their determination of fair compensation once good cause and exceptional circumstances have been found to exist. Here, however, because the old version of Rule 47 controls the outcome of this case, the trial judge was justified in denying Bownes\u2019 motion as untimely without further explanation. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-8\">Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
