CT. R. 34:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-15\">What \u201ctrigger-of-coverage\u201d standard should be applied under New Hampshire law to determine the point at which an \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d causing \u201cproperty damage\u201d took place, within the meaning of the accident- and occurrence-based insurance policy provisions at issue, where an insured alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>that: hazardous contaminants leaked and spilled onto the site over time, before 1952, and migrated through soil and groundwater, causing continuous injury to the pertinent property, from the time the leaks and spills occurred through the periods of coverage under the policies (1958-1983), which property damage was ordered by governmental agencies to be cleaned up in approximately 1996[?]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">We adopt the district court\u2019s recitation of the facts. The plaintiff, EnergyNorth Natural Gas, Inc. (EnergyNorth), is the successor to companies that operated manufactured gas plants (MGPs) at sites in Laconia and Nashua. The plants began operating before 1900 and ceased MGP operations in 1952. In 1996, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services notified EnergyNorth of the existence of pollution damage at the MGP sites and required it to undertake investigative and remedial action, which resulted in EnergyNorth incurring substantial costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, Utica Mutual Insurance Company (Utica), St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (St. Paul) and Century Indemnity Company (Century Indemnity) issued the various comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance policies in question. The policies became effective in 1958, and provided coverage until 1983. These policies insured against liabilities associated with property damage resulting from \u201coccurrence(s)\u201d or \u201caccident(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">EnergyNorth brought a declaratory judgment action against the defendants in federal district court seeking indemnification for costs associated with investigating the pollution damage at the MGP sites and restoring the property. In its pleadings, EnergyNorth asserted that the pollution damage was predominantly caused by inadvertent leaks and spills during the years of MGP operations, particularly from underground gas holders and associated piping, and from unlined tar pits. EnergyNorth further asserted that the toxic wastes discharged into the environment continuously migrated through soil and groundwater at the sites, causing continuous discrete property damage as they moved. EnergyNorth argues that the continued migration of toxic wastes resulted in property damage due to \u201caccident(s)\u201d or \u201coccurrence(s)\u201d as those terms are used in the policies; therefore the defendants\u2019 CGL policies were triggered and provide coverage for the clean-up costs. The defendants argue that their respective CGL policies were not triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">The term \u201ctrigger\u201d does not appear in the policy language, but rather describes \u201cthat which, under the specific terms of an insurance policy must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>happen in the policy period in order for the potential of coverage to arise. The issue is largely one of timing \u2014 what must take place within the policy\u2019s effective dates for the potential of coverage to be \u2018triggered\u2019?\u201d <em>Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Admiral Ins. Co., </em>913 P.2d 878, 880-81 n.2 (Cal. 1995) (emphasis omitted). Determining the type of event that will trigger coverage under the particular language of a policy is the first step in assessing whether the policy provides coverage for the claim made against it. <em>See </em>Fischer, <em>Insurance Coverage for Mass Exposure Tort Claims: The Debate over the Appropriate Trigger Rule, </em>45 DRAKE L. Rev. 625, 631-32 (1997). This determination depends upon the language used in the policy and the relevant state law. <em>See CPC Intern, v. Northbrook Excess &amp; Surplus Ins., </em>46 F.3d 1211, 1222 (1st Cir. 1995); Andrea, <em>Exposure, Manifestation of Loss, Injury-in-Fact, Continuous Trigger: The Insurance Coverage Quagmire, </em>21 Pepp. L. REV. 813, 830 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Other jurisdictions have generally recognized four approaches to determine how coverage under an insurance policy is triggered: (1) manifestation; (2) injury-in-fact or actual damage; (3) exposure; and (4) continuous trigger. 23 E. Holmes, APPLEMAN ON INSURANCE 2d \u00a7 145.3(B)(1), at 13-14 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Under a manifestation theory, \u201cthe date of loss is assigned to the policy period when property damage or actual damage is discovered, becomes known to the insured or a third party, or should have reasonably been discovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 145.3(B)(2)(a), at 14. The injury-in-fact theory \u201cimplicates all of the policy periods during which the insured proves some injury or damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 145.3(B)(2)(b), at 15. Under the exposure theory, \u201call insurance contracts in effect when property was exposed to hazardous waste would be triggered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 145.3(B)(2)(c), at 16. Finally, pursuant to the continuous trigger theory, \u201cany policy on the risk at any time during the continuing loss is triggered!.]\u201d <em>Id. \u00a7 </em>145.3(B)(2)(d), at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">In some situations, there is little practical difference between the particular theories utilized. For instance, \u201cthere is little practical difference between \u2018exposure\u2019 and \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019 in instances where contamination occurs almost immediately upon release.\u201d <em>Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>868 F. Supp. 1278, 1304 (D. Utah 1994), <em>aff'd, </em>52 F.3d 1522 (10th Cir. 1995). Likewise, \u201c[w]here the release or discharge of hazardous waste into the environment is identifiable, or even obvious, \u2018manifestation\u2019 occurs simultaneously with \u2018exposure\u2019 and \u2018injury.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under the continuous trigger theory, however, it is assumed \u201cwithout substantiation, that once property damage begins it always continues and that property damage results when property is first exposed to hazardous materials.\u201d Holmes, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 145.3(B)(2)(d), at 17. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>Thus, the continuous trigger theory \u201ctypically maximizes insurance coverage since all policies on the risk from the date of initial exposure through manifestation are triggered\u201d regardless of proof of actual property damage during the policy period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">Because the interpretation of the insurance policies in this case involves an unresolved issue of New Hampshire law, namely, what \u201ctrigger of coverage\u201d theory applies, the district court certified the question to this court. In resolving this issue, we must look to the language of the policies in question. <em>See Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc., </em>868 F. Supp. at 1303 (adopting a trigger-of-coverage theory that was \u201cconsistent with the pertinent policy language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for this court to decide. <em>Godbout v. Lloyd\u2019s Ins. Syndicates, </em>150 N.H. 103, 105 (2003). We construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based upon a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole. <em>Id. </em>Policy terms are construed objectively, and where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>Id. </em>We need not examine the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations of coverage when a policy is clear and unambiguous; absent ambiguity, our search for the parties\u2019 intent is limited to the words of the policy. <em>Id. </em>Where, however, the language of the policy reasonably may be interpreted more than one way and one interpretation favors coverage, an ambiguity exists in the policy that will be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer. <em>High Country Assocs. v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>139 N.H. 39, 41 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether the policies are ambiguous. The fact that the parties may disagree on the interpretation of a term or clause in an insurance policy does not create an ambiguity. <em>Oliva v. Vermont Mut. Ins. Co., </em>150 N.H. 563, 566 (2004). In addition, policy provisions are not ambiguous merely because it is difficult to apply the factual situation to the specific policy language. <em>Id. </em>We will not create an ambiguity simply to construe the policy against the insurer. <em>Int\u2019l. Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Mfgs. &amp; Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., </em>140 N.H. 15, 20 (1995). We review each of the policies in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\n<em>I. St. Paul and Utica Occurrence-Based Policies.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">First, we review three occurrence-based policies. The two policies issued by St. Paul were effective between 1978 and 1982. The policy issued by Utica was effective between 1974 and 1978. The pertinent policy language in one of the St. Paul policies and the Utica policy is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The Company will pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">Coverage A. bodily injury or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Att\">Coverage B. property damage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201coccurrence\u201d means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-7\">\u201cproperty damage\u201d means (1) physical injury to or destruction of tangible property which occurs during the policy period, including the loss of use thereof at any time resulting therefrom or (2) loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed provided such loss of use is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The third policy, also issued by St. Paul, provides excess coverage and has slightly different wording. The pertinent policy language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-9\">The Company will indemnify the Insured for all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages ... on account of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-10\">1. Personal Injuries,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-11\">2. Property Damage,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-12\">3. Advertising Offense,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-13\">to which this Policy applies, caused by an occurrence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-14\">The term \u201cOccurrence\u201d means . . . with respect to property damage, an event, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results during this policy period in such personal injury, or property damage neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the Insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d is not defined in the St. Paul excess policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">Several courts have reviewed policy language identical to that used by St. Paul and Utica. <em>See, e.g., Cessna Aircraft Co. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>900 F. Supp. 1489, 1500-04 (D. Kan. 1995); <em>Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc., </em>868 F. Supp. at 1294. In <em>Cessna Aircraft, </em>Cessna sought indemnity from various insurance companies for property damage and associated clean-up costs resulting from groundwater contamination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>allegedly caused by improper disposal of hazardous materials. <em>Cessna Aircraft Co., </em>900 F. Supp. at 1493-95. In reviewing the pertinent policy language, the court held that the policies were unambiguous: \u201c[pjroperty damage clearly must occur during the policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1501. Accordingly, \u201ccoverage under these policies is \u2018triggered\u2019 by a showing that property damage occurred during the policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1503. In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected the application of a manifestation theory, finding that \u201capplication of the \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019 trigger is more consistent with the language of the ... policies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">Similarly, in <em>Quaker State, </em>the court adopted the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d trigger because it was \u201cconsistent with the pertinent policy language.\u201d <em>Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc., </em>868 F. Supp. at 1303. The court noted, however, that when contamination is continuous, \u201cthe \u2018injury-in-fact\u2019 theory may also operate to trigger coverage on a continuous basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1302 n.38. Thus, the court concluded that, using an injury-in-fact trigger, an occurrence took place each time property damage was inflicted and that, where alleged contamination and property damage are continuing, \u201c\u2018injuries-in-fact\u2019 triggering coverage are also continuing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The holdings in <em>Cessna Aircraft </em>and <em>Quaker State </em>are supported by the drafting history of the standardized CGL policy language. <em>See Montrose Chem. Corp., </em>913 P.2d at 890. We review this history because \u201cthe presence of standardized .industry provisions and the availability of interpretative literature are of considerable assistance in determining coverage issues. Such interpretative materials have been widely cited and relied on in the relevant ease law and authorities construing standardized insurance policy language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">Most significant in the drafting history of the standardized insurance policy language is the change in language that was implemented in 1966. <em>Id. </em>Prior to 1966, third-party CGL policies covered damages caused by \u201caccidents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In 1966, however, the standardized form CGL policy was changed from being \u201caccident-based\u201d to \u201coccurrence-based.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In making this change, \u201cone of the drafters explained that in some exposure type cases involving cumulative injuries it is possible that more than one policy will afford coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). In addition, the then-secretary of the National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters noted that the new \u201coccurrence-based\u201d policy retained the term \u201caccident\u201d in the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in order to \u201cclarify the intent with respect to time of coverage and application of policy limits, particularly in situations involving a related series of events attributable to the same factor. Under such circumstances only one accident or occurrence is intended as far as the application of policy limits is concerned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 892 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>The drafting history leaves \u201clittle doubt that the definition of \u2018occurrence\u2019 in the newly drafted standard form CGL policy was intended to provide coverage when damage or injury resulting from an accident or \u2018injurious exposure to conditions\u2019 occurs during the policy period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The drafting history also reveals that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-4\">The term \u201caccident\u201d was left in the definition of occurrence for the purpose of circumscribing the policy limits applicable to each occurrence. The drafters did not intend to require that an \u201caccident\u201d in the literal sense, e.g., a sudden precipitating event, occur during the policy period in order to trigger potential coverage for ensuing damage or injury. The reference to injurious exposure to conditions resulting in bodily injury or property damage eliminates any requirement that the injury result from a sudden event.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quotation, brackets and ellipses omitted). Moreover, the drafting history demonstrates that \u201cthe drafters of the standard occurrence-based CGL policy... contemplated that the policy would afford liability coverage for all property damage or injury occurring during the policy period resulting from an accident, or from injurious exposure to conditions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">We are persuaded by the drafting history of the standardized insurance policy language and interpretation of the policy language in <em>Cessna Aircraft </em>and <em>Quaker State. </em>We similarly find no ambiguity in the language in these three policies. They clearly provide that the occurrence of property damage during the policy period is the operative event that triggers coverage. \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined in the St. Paul and Utica policies as \u201can accident, <em>including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions </em>which results in ... property damage.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The St. Paul and Utica policies define \u201cproperty damage\u201d as \u201cphysical injury ... which occurs during the policy period.\u201d Similarly, the St. Paul excess occurrence policy applies to \u201cproperty damage . . . caused by an occurrence.\u201d The excess policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can event, <em>including injurious exposure to conditions, </em>which results during this policy period in... property damage.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">The language of these three policies unambiguously distinguishes between the causative event \u2014 an accident or continuous or repeated exposure to conditions \u2014 and the resulting property damage. It is the property damage that must occur during the policy period, and \u201cwhich results\u201d from the accident or \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to conditions.\u201d Thus, the language of the three policies embodies an \u201cinjury-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>in-fact\u201d trigger, and where the alleged contamination and property damage are continuing, \u201cinjuries-in-fact\u201d triggering coverage are also continuing. <em>Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc., </em>868 F. Supp. at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Our adoption of the \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d trigger for the policies at issue is consistent with our holdings in <em>U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., Inc. v. Johnson Shoes, Inc., </em>123 N.H. 148 (1983), and <em>Peerless Insurance Co. v. Clough, </em>105 N.H. 76 (1963). While neither <em>Johnson Shoes </em>nor <em>Peerless </em>expressly adopted a trigger-of-coverage theory, they both involved questions of insurance coverage in occurrence-based policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">In <em>Johnson Shoes, </em>the insurer denied coverage in an environmental contamination case on the ground that the policy only covered \u201coccurrences\u201d taking place during the policy period. <em>Johnson Shoes, Inc. </em>123 N.H. at 153. Oil had apparently leaked from an underground storage tank and, after the policy period ended, spilled over onto neighboring property. <em>Id. </em>at 151. We noted that Johnson Shoes proved that the tank was leaking while the insurance policy was in effect. <em>Id. </em>We affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling finding coverage without adopting a specific trigger-of-coverage legal theory. <em>Id. </em>at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">In <em>Peerless, </em>the insurer denied coverage for fires resulting from the insured\u2019s negligent construction of fireplaces on the ground that the negligent act, and not the fires, had to occur within the policy period for coverage to be triggered. <em>Peerless Insurance Co., </em>105 N.H. at 78. We disagreed and held that \u201cthe time of the occurrence resulting in the loss or damage, and not the time of the negligence, determines whether there is coverage under the policy.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">At most, <em>Johnson Shoes </em>and <em>Peerless </em>stand for the proposition that coverage can be triggered by the occurrence of property damage while the policy is in effect. Neither <em>Johnson Shoes </em>nor <em>Peerless </em>held that for coverage to be triggered under an occurrence-based policy, the wrongful act must occur within the policy period; nor did they hold that the injury must be discovered or manifest itself within the policy period. We thus conclude that under New Hampshire law, for these three policies, the trigger of coverage theory is injury-in-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">\n<em>II. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s and Century Indemnity Accident-Based Policies.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">We now turn to the two accident-based policies, one issued by Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s and one issued by Century Indemnity. The Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s accident-based policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>WE THE UNDERWRITERS hereby agree, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereinafter mentioned, to indemnify the Assured in respect of accidents occurring during the policy period commencing [policy commencement date] and ending [policy end date] for any and all sums which the Assured shall by law become liable to pay... as damages ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\">(b) for damage to or destruction of property of others (excluding property under the Assured\u2019s care, custody or control) caused by accident, hereinafter referred to as \u201cProperty Damage\u201d,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-6\">arising out of the hazards covered by and as defined in the underlying policy/ies specified in the Schedule herein and issued by the [Primary Insurers\u2019 Names], hereinafter called the \u201cPrimary Insurers,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-7\">1. ACCIDENT. The word \u201caccident\u201d shall be understood to mean an accident or series of accidents arising out of one event or occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The Century Indemnity accident-based policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">Coverage B- Property Damage Liability To pay on behalf of the <em>insured </em>all sums which the <em>insured </em>shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss or use thereof, caused by accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">This policy applies only to accidents which occur during the policy period....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">Again, we find no ambiguity in either policy. The Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s policy unambiguously states that it covers \u201caccidents occurring during the policy period.\u201d Similarly, the Century Indemnity policy \u201capplies only to accidents which occur during the policy period.\u201d Thus, the accident must occur within the policy period; the resulting damage, however, does not necessarily have to occur during the policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">Although we conclude that coverage is triggered under these policies when an \u201caccident\u201d occurs during the policy period, we disagree with Century Indemnity\u2019s assertion that the \u201caccident\u201d triggering coverage is limited to a \u201cdiscrete causative event.\u201d Notably, neither policy specifies when an \u201caccident\u201d is deemed to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>We have previously interpreted \u201caccident\u201d to mean an undesigned contingency, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated and not naturally to be expected. <em>Vermont Mut. Ins. Co. v. Malcom, </em>128 N.H. 521, 523 (1986). Because this definition does not incorporate a temporal component, the term \u201caccident\u201d is not as limited as Century Indemnity asserts. <em>See, e.g., Chemical Leaman Tank Lines v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur., </em>817 F. Supp. 1136, 1147-48 (D.N.J. 1993) (holding that the term \u201caccident\u201d does not necessarily have a temporal component), <em>aff'd. in part and remanded on other grounds, </em>89 F.3d 976 (3d Cir. 1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 994 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Moreover, in <em>Hudson v. Farm, Family Mutual Insurance Co., </em>142 N.H. 144, 145-48 (1997), we held that injury caused by gradual and continuous exposure to electrical voltage triggered coverage under a policy covering \u201csudden and accidental damage\u201d because \u201cthe term \u2018sudden and accidental\u2019 is . . . reasonably susceptible to an interpretation consistent with \u2018unexpected and unintended.\u2019\u201d Accordingly, the accident-based policies at issue here are triggered by \u201caccidents\u201d occurring within the policy period, which is not limited to a single, discrete event. We therefore conclude that, under New Hampshire law, the language of the two accident policies clearly embodies an exposure trigger, and where the alleged migration of toxic wastes is continuing, multiple exposures triggering coverage are also continuing. <em>Cf. Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc., </em>868 F. Supp. at 1304 (recognizing multiple \u201cinjuries-in-fact\u201d triggering coverage where there is continuous contamination).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">\n<em>III. Underwriters at Lloyd's Occurrence-Based Policy.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Finally, we turn to the \u201coccurrence\u201d policy issued by Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s. The pertinent policy language is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b870-7\">The Underwriters agree to indemnify the insured named herein and/or any associated, affiliated or subsidiary companies or corporations or interests for any and all sums which the Insured shall by law become liable to pay and shall pay or by final judgment be adjudged to pay, or which by agreement between the Insureds and the Underwriters or their representatives shall be paid to any person, firm, corporation, association, government, governmental division or governmental instrumentality ... as <em>damages.. .to property </em>(excluding damage to property owned by the Insured) <em>by reason of an occurrence </em>resulting from or because of the Insured\u2019s business, ownership, maintenance, operation, use of or liability for properties of all kinds and nature, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>or any act or omission of the Insured\u2019s agents or employees or contractors or sub-contractors it being understood and agreed that <em>the term \u201coccurrence\u201d shall mean one happening or series of happenings arising out of or due to one event</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-5\">This policy commences at 12.01 a.m. Standard Time [commencement date] and ends at 12.01 a.m. Standard Time [termination date] and shall apply to occurrences happening during the currency hereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">EnergyNorth argues that it is the \u201coccurrence\u201d within the policy period that triggers coverage and, because \u201coccurrence\u201d is ambiguous, it could reasonably be interpreted to mean property damage or injury. Thus, EnergyNorth argues, it is the continuous property damage occurring within the policy period that triggers coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s argues that coverage is not triggered under this policy by damage to the property during the policy period, but rather when a discrete causative event takes place during the policy period. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s relies on paragraph four of the CGL insurance contract in arguing that it is the causative event that must occur within the policy period. Paragraph four provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b871-9\">This policy covers the Liability of the Insured under agreements with any person, firm, corporation, association, government, governmental division, or governmental instrumentality . . . provided always, however, that no liability shall attach to the Underwriters <em>by virtue of this paragraph, </em>in respect of any event which occurred prior to the attaching date of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">(Emphasis added.) Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s alternatively argues that, if its policy is deemed to be triggered by property damage during the policy period, then only the injury-in-fact trigger of coverage theory should be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">We disagree with Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s that paragraph four limits coverage to discrete events that occur within the policy period. Even though paragraph four states that \u201cno liability shall attach ... in respect of any event which occurred prior to the attaching date of this policy,\u201d this paragraph is limited by its own terms to liability \u201cby virtue of this paragraph.\u201d Because paragraph four solely concerns the scope of coverage regarding contractual liability assumed by the insured, it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>implicate the trigger of coverage under other relevant provisions of the policy providing coverage for liability imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s points to other courts that have interpreted policy language to require the event to occur within the policy period. <em>See, e.g., Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. v. Arkwright-Boston Mfg. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>53 F.3d 762 (6th Cir. 1995). <em>Babcock </em>and the other cases relied upon by Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, however, have different language than the policy at issue here. For instance, the policy at issue in <em>Babcock </em>defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201cany happening or series of happenings, arising out of or due to one event taking place during the term of this contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 766. The court found that \u201cthe policy clearly required that the \u2018event\u2019 must take place during the policy term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Given the difference in policy language, the reliance of Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s on the line of cases interpreting policies similar to the one at issue in <em>Babcock </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Turning to the language of the relevant provisions here, we note that the policy provides that coverage is triggered by \u201coccurrences happening during the currency hereof.\u201d Thus, it is clear that the \u201coccurrence\u201d giving rise to the property damage must have taken place during the policy period; the policy, however, does not require that the resulting property damage take place during the policy period. <em>See Norfolk Southern Corp. v. Calif. Union Ins., </em>859 So. 2d 167, 189 (La. Ct. App.) (interpreting similar policy language), <em>writ denied, </em>861 So. 2d 579 (La. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">In holding that the \u201coccurrence\u201d must take place during the policy period, we must now interpret the term \u201coccurrence.\u201d The policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201cone happening or series of happenings arising out of or due to one event.\u201d EnergyNorth argues that the term \u201chappening\u201d is ambiguous and could reasonably be interpreted to mean property damage. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">We must interpret the term \u201chappening\u201d consistent with its natural and ordinary meaning. <em>See Godbout, </em>150 N.H. at 105. The natural and ordinary meaning of \u201chappening\u201d is something that occurs unexpectedly and without design. <em>See </em>WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1031,1561 (unabridged ed. 2002) (defining \u201chappening\u201d as an occurrence; and \u201coccurrence\u201d as something that happens unexpectedly and without design). This definition is akin to our interpretation of the term \u201caccident\u201d and similarly does not incorporate a temporal component. Accordingly, the occurrence-based policy at issue is triggered by a \u201chappening or series of happenings\u201d within the policy period, which is not limited to a single, discrete event. We therefore conclude that, under New Hampshire law, the language of the policy clearly embodies an exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>trigger, and where the alleged migration of toxic wastes is continuing, multiple exposures triggering coverage are also continuing. <em>Cf. Quaker State Minit-Lube, Inc., </em>868 F. Supp. at 1304 (recognizing multiple \u201cinjuries-in-fact\u201d triggering coverage where there is continuous contamination).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\">The defendants also raise issues regarding collateral estoppel and allocation of damages. These issues are not encompassed in the certified question and, therefore, we will not address them. Accordingly, EnergyNorth\u2019s motion to strike Utica\u2019s brief, which addresses collateral estoppel, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b873-6\">NADEAU and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
