Oliva, was injured while working with Raskiewiez. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">The trial court found the following facts. In June 2000, Raskiewiez began staying at Alt\u2019s home in Hollis. He remained there until sometime in the fall of 2000. Raskiewiez was twenty years old at the time. He was not related to Alt, but was a friend of her daughter, Cherry. Several other young adults also stayed at Alt\u2019s home during this time period.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>Alt and Raskiewicz did not have a formal discussion regarding this living arrangement. Nonetheless, Raskiewicz identified Alt\u2019s address as his own on his non-driver identification card and received his mail at Alt\u2019s home. Raskiewicz did not work, pay rent or contribute to Alt\u2019s household expenses. He did, however, eat at Alt\u2019s home on a daily basis and was free to use the household amenities without restriction. Alt either cooked meals for everyone in the house, or Raskiewicz and the others ate the leftovers and groceries she supplied. Alt occasionally gave Raskiewicz \u201cpocket change\u201d and money for cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Raskiewicz had his own room in Alt\u2019s home. The room did not have a door, but wTas separated from the rest of the home by a curtain that hung in the doonvay. Because there w~as no bed in the room, Raskiewicz slept on a mattress on the floor. He kept his clothing in a bag, but used Alt\u2019s washing machine to do his laundry.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Alt did not supervise Raskiewicz or the other young adults who were staying at her home. She did, however, develop a few rules that she expected Raskiewicz and the others to follow. Alt asked that someone be home to meet her six-year-old son when he got off the school bus. She required Raskiewicz and the others to be in the house and quiet by a certain time each night; otherwise, Alt locked the doors and they were responsible for finding a place to spend the night. If Alt went away for the weekend, she asked Raskiewicz and the others to vacate the premises for fear that they would have a party in her absence. In addition, Raskiewicz and the others were responsible for doing the dishes and completing various household chores.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Cherry\u2019s boyfriend, Christopher Meeks, was also staying at Alt\u2019s home that summer. Alt asked Meeks to perform some needed renovations on her home. Alt paid Meeks, but Meeks was responsible for paying anyone he hired to assist him. Alt suggested that Meeks ask Raskiewicz to help with the renovations.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Oliva was a friend of Cherry\u2019s who visited Alt\u2019s home frequently. On September 5, 2000, Oliva was assisting Meeks and Raskiewicz with the renovations when he severely injured his hand while cutting a piece of wood with a power saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Oliva brought suit against Alt and Raskiewicz, alleging that his injury resulted from Raskiewicz\u2019s failure to secure the wood Oliva was cutting with the power saw. At the time of Oliva\u2019s injury, Alt had a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by Vermont Mutual. Oliva filed a petition for declaratory judgment, alleging that Raskiewicz was an \u201cinsured\u201d under Alt\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy. After a trial on the merits, the court ruled that Raskiewicz was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Vermont Mutual policy because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>was \u201cin the care of\u2019 Alt at the time of Oliva\u2019s injury. The correctness of this ruling is the sole issue raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\">\u201cThe interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for this court to decide.\u201d <em>Godbout v. Lloyd\u2019s Ins. Syndicates Messrs., </em>150 N.H. 103, 105 (2003) (quotation omitted). \u201cWe construe the language of an insurance policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on a more than casual reading of the policy as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). \u201cPolicy terms are construed objectively, and where the terms of a policy are clear and unambiguous, we accord the language its natural and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted). \u201cWe need not examine the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations of coverage when a policy is clear and unambiguous; absent ambiguity, our search for the parties\u2019 intent is limited to the words of the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The policy defines an \u201cinsured\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">[Y]ou and residents of your household who are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">a. Your relatives; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">b. Other persons under the age of 21 and in the care of any person named above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">The parties do not dispute that Raskiewicz was twenty years old at the time of Oliva\u2019s injury. The only dispute is whether Raskiewicz was \u201cin the care of\u2019 Alt.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\"> As a threshold matter, we must determine whether the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 is ambiguous. The \u201cfact that the parties may disagree on the interpretation of a term or clause in an insurance policy does not create an ambiguity.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Warren, </em>87 F. Supp. 2d 904, 909 (E.D. Mo. 1999). In addition, \u201c[p]olicy provisions are not ambiguous merely because it is difficult to apply the factual situation to the specific policy language.\u201d 2 L. RUSS &amp; T. SEGALLA, COUCH ON INSURANCE 3D \u00a7 21.14, at 21-26 (1997). \u201cOn the other hand, where a provision is subject to more than one interpretation, illogically located and labeled within the policy, and inconsistent with other provisions, it will be found to be ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">We are unconvinced that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 is ambiguous simply because the parties disagree about whether Raskiewicz was \u201cin the care of\u2019 Alt. <em>See Warren, </em>87 F. Supp. 2d at 909. Moreover, \u201cin the care of\u2019 is not illogically located or labeled in the Vermont Mutual policy, nor is it inconsistent with other provisions. <em>See </em>RUSS &amp; SEGALLA, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 21.14, at 21-26. Rather, \u201cin the care of\u2019 is \u201ca colloquial or idiomatic phrase that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>peculiar to itself and readily understood as a phrase by speakers and readers of our language.\u201d <em>Henderson v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co., </em>596 N.W.2d 190, 194 (Mich. 1999). Consistent with other jurisdictions, we conclude that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 is commonly used, readily understood and, therefore, unambiguous. <em>See, e.g., State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Breazell, </em>478 S.E.2d 831, 833 (S.C. 1996); <em>Cierzan ex rel. Weis v. Kriegel, </em>655 N.W.2d 217, 221 (Wis. Ct. App. 2002), <em>review denied, </em>661 N.W.2d 102 (Wis. 2003). Thus, \u201cour search for the parties\u2019 intent is limited to the words of the policy.\u201d <em>Godbout, </em>150 N.H. at 105 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Because the interpretation of insurance policy language is a question of law for this court to decide, we now define \u201cin the care of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We adopt the list of eight non-exclusive common sense factors set forth by the Michigan Supreme Court in <em>Henderson. See Henderson </em>596 N.W.2d at 195-96. Accordingly, in determining whether an individual is \u201cin the care of\u2019 another, the fact finder should consider, without limitation, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">(1) is there a legal responsibility to care for the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">(2) is there some form of dependency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">(3) is there a supervisory or disciplinary responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-9\">(4) is the person providing the care providing substantial essential financial support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-10\">(5) is the living arrangement temporary or permanent, including how long it has been in existence and is expected to continue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-11\">(6) what is the age of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another (generally, the younger a person the more likely they are to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-12\">(7) what is the physical or mental health status of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another (a person with health problems is more likely to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-13\">(8) is the person allegedly \u201cin the care of\u2019 another gainfully employed (a person so employed is less likely to be truly dependent on another)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">Other courts that have been asked to determine whether an individual is \u201cin the care of\u2019 another have required a significant degree of supervisory and custodial control. <em>Compare Warren, </em>87 F. Supp. 2d at 910-11 (concluding that children of the insured\u2019s girlfriend were \u201cin the care of\u2019 the insured because the insured looked after the children and provided them with permanent housing and health insurance), <em>and Breazell, </em>478 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>S.E.2d at 832 (holding that two-year-old foster child was in the \u201cexclusive care\u201d of the insureds), <em>with Horace Mann Ins. v. Stark, </em>987 F. Supp. 562 (W.D. Mich. 1997) (finding that child living with her mother at child\u2019s grandparents\u2019 house was not \u201cin the care of\u2019 grandparents because child\u2019s mother retained supervisory and custodial control of child), <em>and Cierzan, </em>655 N.W.2d at 222-23 (holding that sixteen-year-old grandchild was not \u201cin the care of\u2019 her blind grandmother when she visited her grandmother\u2019s home to assist with various household tasks). In accord with these holdings, we conclude that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 connotes a level of support, guidance and responsibility that is most often present in situations where an insured cares for a minor child, an elderly person or an incapacitated individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Finally, we turn to the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts of this case. We will disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if they are contrary to the weight of the evidence or erroneous as a matter of law. <em>Trombley v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>148 N.H. 748, 751 (2002). On the other hand, we review the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts <em>de novo. Coyle v. Battles, </em>147 N.H. 98, 100 (2001). Although we agree with the trial court\u2019s adoption of the <em>Henderson </em>factors and its factual findings, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s application of the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">We recognize that the trial court found that Raskiewicz was dependent on Alt for food and shelter, and that she had rules that Raskiewicz was expected to follow. We further recognize that the trial court determined that Alt provided \u201csubstantial essential financial support\u201d to Raskiewicz by paying the household bills and providing him with \u201cpocket change.\u201d Nonetheless, we conclude that Alt\u2019s assistance, although generous, did not rise to the level of support, guidance and responsibility that is necessary to conclude that Raskiewicz was in her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Rather, we hold that Alt\u2019s minimal supervision and support of Raskiewicz were outweighed by the other <em>Henderson </em>factors. Notably, Alt had no legal responsibility to care for Raskiewicz. Moreover, the living arrangement was temporary. Raskiewicz began staying at Alt\u2019s home in June 2000 and moved out in the fall of 2000. In addition, Raskiewicz was twenty years old, a legal adult, in the summer of 2000. He had no physical or mental health impairments that would require additional care or preclude him from functioning independently. Finally, if Raskiewicz was not in Alt\u2019s home at the designated time each night, he was responsible for finding a place to spend the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Thus, after careful consideration of the <em>Henderson </em>factors, we conclude that Raskiewicz was not \u201cin the care of\u2019 Alt at the time Oliva was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b601-5\">Broderick, C.J., and Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
