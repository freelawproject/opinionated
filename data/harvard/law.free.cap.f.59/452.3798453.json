We think when (he two provisions are read together the latter is to be interpreted as imposing- duty upon all manufactures of which silk is the component material of chief value, except those similar to women\u2019s or children\u2019s dress goods. It seems hardly debatable that if one provision of a tariff act should prescribe a duty on wearing apparel, and another on all manufacture's of which silk is the material of chief value, the former would supply the proper classification for an article of wearing apparel made of silk. The descriptive phrase, \u201cgoods of similar description and character to women\u2019s and children\u2019s dress goods,\u201d is a yet narrower term of enumeration. It describes a material of which women\u2019s and children\u2019s wearing apparel is made. The case falls within the general rule that, where a tariff act imposes a duty on an article by a specific name or description, general terms in the act, though embracing it broadly, are not applicable to it. The general must give way to the particular. The case of Hartranft v. Meyer, 135 U. S. 237, 10 Sup. Ct. 751. upon which the appellants greatly rely, does not assist them, but is an illustration of the rule stated. The case there wais whether certain cloth, composed partly of wool and partly of silk, in which silk was the component of chief value, should have been classified under a provision subjecting to duty all manufactures of wool made wholly or in part of wool not specially enumerated in the act, or under another provision in the same act subiecting to duty all goods not specially provided for in the act, \u201cmade of silk, of which silk is the component material of chief value.\u201d The court held that the descriptive language in the latter provision was narrower and more limited, and constituted, therefore, the special enumeration, rather than the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The decision of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
