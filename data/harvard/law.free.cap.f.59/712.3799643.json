The vessel was a British ship, and her owner resided in Mexico. The' vessel was wrecke'd in March, 1889, while on Hie voyage covered by the1 insurance', and became a total loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">The exceptiems takem upon the trial, and the assignments of error, presemt the; epue'stions whe'ther the; plaintiffs had any .lien upon the vessel few the disbursennemts and advances, or any insurable interest in the vessel. If these questions ought to be ruled adversely to the plaintiffs, the trial judge erred in directing a verdict for them, and in not dire'eting a vewelict for the de'femelant, as reepie'sted upon the; trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">The language e&gt;f the; speedal clause' demotes very plainly that it. was the purpose of the policy to Indemnify the; plaintiffs against, the contingency that, by disaster to the; vessel, the;ir security for advances might he lost or impaired. The phrase \u201cproperty pledged to cover the advane:es\u201d is broad emeiugh to cover any interest arising from an hypothecation of any eharacter, whether by way of mortgage, maritime lien, or equitable lien; but it has no significance unless it is iutenele'd to evince that the insured interest is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>one in the nature of a security upon the vessel. It is to be presumed that the parties intended to make a valid insurance, and the contract made would be a mere wager policy if it were intended td insure a debt owing to the plaintiffs, in respect to which they would suffer no pecuniary loss as a consequence of the loss of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">We cannot discover that the plaintiffs had any interest in the vessel in the nature of a security for their advances, or that they occupied any relation towards the subject-matter of the insurance other than that of a general creditor of the owner. A ship\u2019s husband does not have a maritime lien upon the vessel for the advances made in the course of his agency for the owners, in the absence of an express contract with them to that effect, or of peculiar circumstances from which such a contract should be implied. Presumptively, he relies upon the credit of the owners. The Larch, 2 Curt. 427; The Sarah J. Weed, 2 Low. 555; White v. The Americus, 19 Fed. 848; The Raleigh, 32 Fed. 633; The Esteban de Antunano, 31 Fed. 920.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">. The power of attorney did not effect an hypothecation, or give the plaintiffs an equitable lien upon the vessel. It was not coupled with an interest, or given as security to the plaintiffs, but was merely a naked power, revocable by the principal at any time. Hunt v. Rousmanier, 8 Wheat. 174; Hartley\u2019s Appeal, 53 Pa. St. 212; Walker v. Denison, 86 Ill. 142; Barr v. Schroder, 32 Cal. 609; Attrill v. Patterson, 58 Md. 226. It did not confer upon them the right to sell the vessel for their own benefit, and any authority exercised under it would have been, in law, the act of the owner, and exercised solely for his benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Hpon the facts proved at the trial, the defendant was entitled to a verdict, and, for the error in refusing the request for an instruction to the jury to that effect, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
