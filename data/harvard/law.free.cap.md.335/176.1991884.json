The answer to the question presented turns on the construction of Art. 48A, \u00a7 65, defining \u201cannuities\u201d and an \u201cannuity contract.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The Board, created in 1985, is charged with \u201c[t]he general administration and responsibility for the proper operation of\u2019 certain supplemental compensation plans for state employees and teachers, including a deferred compensation plan for state employees. Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.VoL, 1993 Cum.Supp.), Art. 73C, \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 5(a). A deferred compensation plan initially had been established under an executive order in 1974, and that plan is continued by the Board. Art. 73C, \u00a7 5(b). The document that the parties have utilized in the instant litigation to evidence the terms of the plan is The Maryland State Employees Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated in 1988 (the Plan). The Plan is designed to comply with \u00a7 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Internal Revenue Code income tax is deferred on the amounts consensually withheld from employees and paid into the Plan, and access by a participant to the funds in that person\u2019s Plan account is restricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>One function of the Board is to invest the deferrals of Plan participants. Participants select the type or types of investments for their respective deferrals from a menu of investment options offered by the Board from time to time. One option has been a fixed income investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">GICs are .fixed income investments. The Board purchased two GICs from ELIC on separate occasions in 1987. The earlier purchase is Group Annuity Contract No. GAGICO1209 and the later is Group Annuity Contract No. GACG012443A. The premium for the earlier policy is the deferrals for the period from January 1 through April 15, 1987, up to a maximum of $6 million in deferrals of Plan participants who selected the fixed income investment option. ELIC agreed to pay interest at the rate of 8.25%, credited and compounded daily, until the maturity of that contract on December 31, 1991, when ELIC would pay the Board \u201cthe fund value.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The GIC purchased later from ELIC was issued October 2, 1987, with a guaranteed interest rate of 10.05%, a premium deposit period from October 1 to December 31, 1987, a premium deposit limit of $9 million, and a maturity date of September 30, 1992. In other respects the provisions of the two GICs are substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">ELIC is a California-domiciled life insurance company that was authorized to transact annuity business in Maryland. \u201cSince the latter part of 1989, [ELIC] began to report significant reductions in the market value of [its] investment portfolios and increased defaults of high yield securities.\u201d 1993 Best\u2019s Insurance Reports-Life/Health 884. On April 11, 1991, the California Insurance Commissioner placed ELIC in conservatorship, and on December 6, 1991, ELIC was declared insolvent. A plan of rehabilitation has been approved under which it appears that the Board will suffer a loss on its ELIC GICs.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The Guaranty Act was first enacted in 1971. As amended, its purpose \u201cis to protect residents who are policyowners, insureds, beneficiaries, annuitants, payees, and assignees of life insurance policies, health insurance policies, [and] annuity contracts ... against failure in the performance of contractual obligations due to the impairment of the insurer issuing these policies or contracts.\u201d \u00a7 521. Section 522(1) makes the Guaranty Act applicable to \u201cdirect life insurance policies, health insurance policies, annuity contracts, and contracts supplemental to ... annuity contracts issued by persons authorized to transact insurance in this State,\u201d with certain exceptions not relevant here. A policy described in \u00a7 522 is a \u201c \u2018[c]overed policy\u2019 \u201d under the Guaranty Act. \u00a7 524(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">Section 525(1) creates the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Corporation (the Corporation) to administer the Guaranty Act. If a foreign insurer is under an order of liquidation, the Corporation shall \u201cguarantee ... the covered policies of residents\u201d and \u201c[a]ssure payment of the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer to residents.\u201d \u00a7 527(4)(a). In order to raise the funds necessary to carry out its duties, the Corporation is empowered to levy assessments on insurers writing covered policies in Maryland. \u00a7 528. For purposes of administration and assessment the Corporation maintains three accounts: health, life, and annuity. \u00a7 525(1). Assessments arising from the failure of an impaired foreign insurer are made \u201cagainst member insurers for each account ... in the proportion that the premium received on business in this State by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account bears to such premiums received on business in this State by all assessed member insurers.\u201d \u00a7 528(3)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Following the order for ELIC\u2019s liquidation, the Board brought the instant action against the Corporation. The Board\u2019s complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the ELIC GICs \u201care annuity contracts entitled to the benefits of\u2019 the Guaranty Act and also sought certain injunctive and monetary relief. Each party moved for a summary judgment declaring, respectively, that the ELIC GICs were or were not covered policies under the Guaranty Act. In a memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>opinion and order the circuit court\u2019s principal conclusion was \u201cthat the ELIC GICs do not satisfy the statutory requirements for an \u2018annuity contract.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">The Board appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and petitioned this Court to grant a writ of certiorari prior to review by the intermediate appellate court. We granted the writ. Before this Court the Board\u2019s position is supported by an amicus curiae brief filed by the Group Annuity Participant Protection Association (GAPPA), an unincorporated association of employment plan sponsors who have claims in the ELIC insolvency. The Corporation\u2019s position is supported by an amicus curiae brief filed by The National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The Board contends that the GICs are covered policies because they are group annuity contracts, one of the types of policies to which the Guaranty Act applies. \u00a7 522(1). \u201cAnnuity contract\u201d is not a term that is defined in the Guaranty Act. The term does appear, however, in \u00a7 65 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">\u201c\u2018Annuities\u2019 means all agreements to make periodical payments where the making or continuance of all or some of a series of such payments, or the amount of any such payment, is dependent upon the continuance of human life____ The business of annuities shall be deemed to include additional benefits operating to safeguard the contract from lapse, or to provide a special surrender value, or special benefit, or annuity, in the event of total or permanent disability of the holder. An \u2018annuity contract\u2019 is a contract providing for an \u2018annuity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as defined in this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">The Corporation submits that the ELIC GICs contain no agreement to make periodic payments, and contain no agreement to make payments dependent upon the continuation of human life. The Board, on the other hand, submits that these GICs satisfy the \u00a7 65 definition because they are sold by an insurer to fund a pension plan (in the broad sense), contain an annuity option, and are generally recognized as group annui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ties in the insurance industry and by the Maryland Insurance Commissioner (the Commissioner).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">The first step in resolving this difference of opinion is to examine the terms of the ELIC GICs and their relationship to the Plan. For this purpose the parties have treated the two GICs as substantially the same, and utilized the text of the earlier contract. We shall do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Bookkeeping and recordkeeping of participants\u2019 accounts in the Plan, service to participants, and other details of Plan administration are performed by a Plan Administrator under contract to the Board. The Plan Administrator is an affiliate of Nationwide Life Insurance Corporation (Nationwide). Pri- or to January 1,1987, deferrals of Plan participants choosing a fixed income investment option were invested in a contract with Nationwide. Thereafter the Board sought to diversify investments of that type and to increase its return. We infer that under the diversification program the Board purchased a separate GIC in which to invest fixed income deferrals contributed during each three month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The Plan provides for \u201c[b]enefits through payment of a PARTICIPANT\u2019S account balance ... upon the PARTICIPANT\u2019S death, retirement, separation from service, the occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency causing financial hardship, or the attainment by the PARTICIPANT of age <em>70%, </em>whichever shall first occur.\u201d \u201c \u2018Financial Hardship\u2019 under the Plan\u201d means \u201csevere financial hardship to the PARTICIPANT resulting from a sudden and unexpected illness or accident of the PARTICIPANT or one or more of his dependents,\u201d and it also means \u201cfinancial hardship to the PARTICIPANT caused by loss of the PARTICIPANT\u2019S property due to casualty. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">With respect to the methods of payment of benefits, the Plan provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">\u201cThe methods of payment of benefits available for election by a PARTICIPANT shall be either: (A) a single sum payment of the entire value of the PARTICIPANT\u2019S account; (B) an installment schedule of monthly, quarterly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>yearly payments of a period of one or more years; (C) a series of payments on an annuity basis as if an annuity contract was purchased for such person, with payments under this option occurring either (I) over the life of the PARTICIPANT; (II) over the life of the PARTICIPANT and his spouse; (III) over the life of the PARTICIPANT and an individual other than his spouse; (IV) over the life of the PARTICIPANT and a period certain, whichever is greater. For any PARTICIPANT who has elected any life insurance option available under the Plan, payment of benefits may be made through either distribution of cash benefits available under such policy, or, at the election of a PARTICIPANT, through distribution of a policy to such individual.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Plan participants may also change their investment options at such times as the Board is able to change its investments under the constraints of the existing investments and of the Plan Administrator\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Under the subject GICs the Board, as contract owner, is in privity with ELIC. GICs in which \u201cthe insurance company has no direct contractual obligation to the [Plan] participant\u201d are called \u201cunallocated contracts.\u201d Forcier, <em>A GIC Primer: Terminology, Contract Provisions, How GICs Are Used By Plan Sponsors And Competing Products, </em>in Investing in GICs: Navigating The Insurance Crisis 18 (P.L.I. Edgar ed. 1991) (Forcier). The ELIC GICs accommodate the exercise, before maturity of a GIC, of the participants\u2019 transfer and withdrawal rights under their Plan accounts. Withdrawal by the Board from a GIC is permitted \u201cto comply with participant re-allocations among other investment funds available under the plan.\u201d More important here, -withdrawals by the Board from a GIC in order for the Plan to pay a participant\u2019s benefits may also be made pursuant to the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9O\">\u201cThe [Board] may direct the Company to purchase an individual annuity contract for a participant before the retirement date. The Company will withdraw the cost of annuity benefits for the participant on the date it receives the [Board\u2019s] written request. <em>The [Board] may also with</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number><em>draw all or part of that portion of the fund value allocable to a participant, in accordance with withdrawal provisions of the Plan in effect on the Date of Issue.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">The ELIC GICs also provide that the Board</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajx\">\u201cmay withdraw the annuity value required to purchase an annuity for a participant who retires. The LBoard] will then apply for an individual retirement annuity contract, on a form provided by the Company. The contract will be owned by the participant, and will specify the dates and amounts of payments, and all other terms and conditions of the participant\u2019s annuity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Under such a single premium annuity issued directly by ELIC to the participant, the benefits include, as a minimum and at the participant\u2019s option, a participant\u2019s lifetime annuity, an annuity for the greater of a period certain and the participant\u2019s life, and a joint and survivor annuity. These optional individual annuities are further described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u201cBenefit payment amounts will be determined at the time benefits are purchased, and will be based on guaranteed tables. These tables are based on the 1971 Group Annuity Mortality Table, with 7% interest for ten years and 6% thereafter, plus an expense charge equal to the gross rate plus any premium tax payable by the Company. The Company will provide sample annuity purchase rate tables upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">There is also a provision that requires all withdrawals to be made on a pro rata basis. This pro rata provision prevents the Board from attempting to obtain from an ELIC GIC the total withdrawal value of a participant\u2019s account, particularly if the ELIC GIC\u2019s interest rate were below that of other unmatured GICs in which the Board had invested.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Thus, if a Plan participant dies, retires, or suffers severe financial hardship due to illness, ELIC could be called upon under its unmatured GICs to pay to the Board, in cash, ELIC\u2019s pro rata share of that participant\u2019s account in the Plan. Further, if the participant retires, becomes seriously ill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>or dies, and the participant or the participant\u2019s beneficiary elects an annuity, the Board could direct ELIC to issue that annuity upon payment of the appropriate premium and ELIC would be contractually obligated to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The record does not reflect the actual withdrawals for Plan participants under the ELIC GICs. Nevertheless, the inference is compelling that, between contract inception and the conservatorship, withdrawals were made from ELIC GICs of each GIC\u2019s pro rata share of the Plan accounts of dead, retired, or financially stricken participants. The record, however, is clear that no individual annuity policy was ever issued by ELIC directly to, or for the account of, any Plan participant. All of the individual annuities purchased by the Board under the Plan had been obtained from Nationwide. It was not until 1987 that the Board, in contemplation of a competitive bidding process for individual annuities, provided in its contract with the Plan Administrator that the Board could purchase individual annuities from insurers other than Nationwide. The competitive bidding process was not administratively in place until approximately the middle of 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The Corporation contends that \u201c[t]he limited withdrawal provisions in the ELIC GICs\u201d are not \u201clife-contingent.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 15. We disagree. ELIC could be called upon, whenever a participant died, to pay its pro rata share of that participant\u2019s account in the Plan. This amount would be the initial value of the share together with interest at the guaranteed rate, compounded daily. The actual return which ELIC might have realized on its investment of the premium deposits (ie., deferrals), as of the times of demands for payments generated by death or illness of participants, could have been below the amount which ELIC had promised to pay to the Board. Thus, ELIC\u2019s assumption of the economic risk was life-contingent. Indeed, ELIC\u2019s contractual assumption also included the risk, however remote, that a catastrophe or epidemic would result in the deaths of large numbers of participants in a relatively brief span of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>Thus, the principal issue in this case reduces itself to whether the periodic payment element of the \u00a7 65 definition of an annuity, which is incorporated into the definition of \u201cannuity contract,\u201d can be satisfied by the provisions in the GICs for the issuance of individual annuity policies at the option of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Under the literal language of \u00a7 65, the GICs are contracts \u201cproviding for\u201d an annuity, because the GICs provide for options to obtain individual policies specifying life-contingent periodic payments. For example, a lease of space in an office building or in a shopping center that grants the tenant an option to expand into additional areas may be described as a lease \u201cproviding for\u201d expansion. Similarly, a lease of a chattel with an option to purchase, either during or at the end of the term, may be considered as \u201cproviding for\u201d purchase. Indeed, the chairperson of the Corporation acknowledged on deposition that an individual, deferred annuity policy which provides either for the lump sum withdrawal of the cash value at maturity or for the payment of a stream of periodic payments is no less an annuity if the insured should elect payment of the cash value at maturity.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The compatibility of the ELIC GICs with one connotation of the words used in the \u201cannuity contract\u201d definition simply clears the textual hurdle, but it is hardly conclusive where, as here, the concepts are so general. When, however, we examine Maryland\u2019s legislative and administrative responses to the evolution of life insurance products in the funding of pensions, it becomes clear that the ELIC GICs are annuity contracts within the intent of \u00a7 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Section 65 was enacted by Chapter 18 of the Acts of 1956 and codified as Md.Code (1951, 1956 Cum.Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 149A(b). That same enactment provided definitions for \u201cLife Insurance,\u201d \u201cAccident and Sickness Insurance,\u201d and for various aspects of the term \u201cpremium.\u201d When the insurance industry began offering variable annuity contracts, the Attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>ney General of Maryland, reversing an opinion reported at 44 Op.Att\u2019y Gen. 203 (1959), ruled in 1960 that \u201cthe definition [of \u2018annuities\u2019] in our Maryland law is sufficiently broad and expanding to accommodate this newly created commodity.\u201d 45 OpAtt\u2019y Gen. 120, 123 (1960). The 1960 opinion pointed out that the definition of \u201cannuities\u201d in the Insurance Code \u201cdoes not require that the payments be made of a certain or fixed amount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 122. The 1956 definitions of \u201cannuity\u201d and \u201cannuity contract\u201d were utilized in the general revision of the insurance laws by Chapter 553 of the Acts of 1963, where they appear under the subtitle, \u201cKinds of insurance; limits of risk; reinsurance.\u201d That 1956 definition is presently \u00a7 65. Thus, under the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the current definition is not frozen in time to the types of contracts known in the industry when the statute was enacted in 1956.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The evolution of forms of insurance for retirement purposes is traced by K. Walker in <em>Guaranteed Investment Contracts: Risk Analysis and Portfolio Strategies </em>(K. Walker 2d ed. 1992) (Walker).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Walker states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">\u201cAs pension coverage grew, the inefficiencies and disadvantages associated with [level premium or single premium deferred annuity] individual policies required the development of a more cost-efficient investment contract. An <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>improvement occurred when the group annuity contract entered the market place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">During the mid-1950s the deposit administration contract (DAC) was developed. It \u201crevolutionized the pension industry\u201d and provided \u201cmajor improvements over the individual annuity policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. Under a DAC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4-V\">\u201c[a]ll funds were pooled on an unallocated basis within the general account of the insurer until such time as the participant retired. At retirement, funds were withdrawn to purchase an individual annuity policy for the participant, withdrawing the fully funded pension liability from the plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">A question involving the premium tax arose from the writing of DACs in Maryland by the Equitable Life Assurance Society and generated an opinion by the Attorney General. 50 OpAtt\u2019y Gen. 235 (1965). The Attorney General described Equitable\u2019s DAC as \u201ca form of group annuity contract\u201d and \u201ctypical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. Under Equitable\u2019s system the considerations were accumulated, unallocated, and applied to the purchase of individual retirement annuities if the employee\u2019s contributions had not been refunded. Contributions could be refunded because the employee had \u201cbecome ineligible to continue in the program or elect[ed] to withdraw before his retirement date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Attorney General ruled that the group policy was an annuity contract, one of the types of policies included under the premium tax definition of \u201cpolicy.\u201d Consequently, the premium tax was to be paid when the DAC was executed, contrary to Equitable\u2019s contention that there was no tax due until an individual annuity policy was issued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">One may infer that Equitable\u2019s group annuity-DAC did not state the amount of the periodic payments to be made to the participant, but that that specification was to be set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>the individual annuity, when issued. In any event, inasmuch as \u201cannuities\u201d and \u201cannuity contract\u201d were then, as they are now, terms defined only in \u00a7 65, the Attorney General\u2019s 1965 opinion necessarily considered DACs to be within the \u00a7 65 definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">Walker dates in the 1960s the next phase of the life insurance industry\u2019s quest for market share in the pension marketplace. Walker, <em>supra, </em>at 9. To meet the challenge from banks, the DAC \u201cwas vastly improved with the introduction of the immediate participation guarantee (IPG).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn essence, the IPG provided what its name implied: an immediate participation in the earnings, expenses, and mortality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10. \u201cMost IPG investment contracts issued by insurance companies contained options that permitted amounts to be withdrawn ... for the purchase of annuities, for the direct payment of benefits, or for employee-directed investment changes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Then, according to Walker\u2019s review of the metamorphosis, in the mid-1970s \u201caggressive competition from banks and mutual funds[,] ... the stellar performance of the equity markets[,] ... [t]he explosive growth of defined contribution plans, and the beginnings of volatile interest rates\u201d caused the insurance industry to respond with \u201cthe guaranteed investment contract (GIC).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Forcier gives the following description of the product:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJK\">\u201cThe GIC was the first insurance industry product for the large plan market that actually promised to pay a market rate determined at the time of issuance. In that context, the use of the term \u2018guaranteed\u2019 is defensible: For the first time a large plan product was actually \u2018guaranteeing\u2019 interest at a market rate; that is, the insurance company was \u2018promising\u2019 (or \u2018guaranteeing\u2019) to pay market rates. A number of early GICs were actually called \u2018Guaranteed Interest Contracts.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">\u201cOver time, the term \u2018Guaranteed Investment Contracts\u2019 became the more commonly used term. But even this development is understandable because professional manag<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>ers tend to view accrued interest as becoming part of the principal. The insurance company was \u2018promising\u2019 <em>(i.e., </em>\u2018guaranteeing\u2019) to pay both market rate interest and principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">Forcier, <em>supra, </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Walker advises that \u201c[a]s the product matured and as more insurers entered the market place, the GIC became a generic term. Today there are many different types of GICs----\u201d Walker, <em>supra, </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Before any DACs, IPGs, or GICs could be delivered in Maryland, the approval of the Commissioner was required. <em>See </em>\u00a7 375(a) (\u201cNo life ... or annuity contract form ... shall be delivered, or issued for delivery in this State, unless the form has been filed with and approved by the Commissioner.\u201d). The GICs involved here are ELIC\u2019s form No. 643-11/85, which was approved by the Commissioner on March 17, 1986. The record in this case does not reflect whether, and if so, when, a GIC similar to the ELIC GIC might earlier have been approved in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Policy approval, of course, is not conclusive of statutory conformity. It is clear that previously approved policies offered by admitted companies for delivery in Maryland may fail to comply with the Insurance Code or other applicable statutes. <em>See, e.g., Van Horn v. Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co., </em>334 Md. 669, 686, 641 A.2d 195, 203 (1994) (\u201cAttempts by insurance companies, purporting to exercise contract rights, to avoid the public policy of compulsory motor vehicle insurance with mandated coverages, have repeatedly been rejected by this Court.\u201d). Nevertheless, on the issue of whether a given policy complies with the Insurance Code, the determination of the Commissioner initially to approve the policy form, coupled with the absence of any exercise by the Commissioner of the \u00a7 375(b) power to withdraw approval, is entitled to weight in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>construing the statute that the policy form allegedly violates.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Hammon v.

To permit insurers greater flexibility in designing new forms of policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">To achieve greater flexibility, the bill permitted the Commissioner to promulgate new mortality tables by regulation, revised methods of valuation to accommodate changes in interest rates, and, \u201cwhen new types of insurance contracts are introduced,\u201d authorized the Commissioner to \u201cadopt rules for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>serves and nonforfeiture values based on model NAIC regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The bill was enacted by Chapter 569 of the Acts of 1981 which, with immaterial subsequent amendments, is now \u00a7 83. New \u00a7 83 expressly recognized, by providing for their valuation, that GICs were being written by life insurance companies doing business in Maryland. The statute, in \u00a7 83(3)(a\u20143)(2)(i) through (v), sets forth formulae to be used for valuing types of life and annuity policies and designates the particular formula to be used \u201c[f]or ... guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis ... with guaranteed durations in excess of ten years ... and guaranteed interest contracts with guaranteed duration of 10 years or less,\u201d (iii), \u201cfor guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options,\u201d (iv), and \u201c[f]or ... guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis,\u201d (v). The formulae are the methods of calculating \u201cthe calendar year statutory valuation interest rates.\u201d \u00a7 83(3)(a-3)(2). Those formulae involve two variables, the reference interest rate and the weighting factor. The weighting factors for various types of \u201cguaranteed interest contracts\u201d are set forth in \u00a7 83(3)(a\u20143)(3)(iii) 1, 2, 3 and 4. The reference interest rate for various \u201cguaranteed interest contracts\u201d are set forth in \u00a7 83(3)(a-3)(4)(ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">As we have seen, GICs were originally called Guaranteed Interest Contracts. <em>See </em>Forcier, <em>supra, </em>at 16-17. <em>See also </em>Walker, <em>supra, </em>at 21 (\u201cThe term <em>GIG </em>... sometimes is also referred to as a ... Guaranteed Interest Contract ... \u201d). In a November 1985 article on GICs in an insurance industry magazine, the authors parenthetically define \u201cGICs\u201d as \u201cguaranteed interest contracts.\u201d D. Close &amp; H. Kayton, <em>GICs: The Final Hurdle, </em>86 Best\u2019s Rev.-Life/Health Ins. Ed. 16, 16 (Nov. 1985) <em>(The Final </em>Hurdle).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In June 1986 the Commissioner proposed, and in February 1987 the Commissioner adopted, a regulation defining group annuity contracts. <em>See </em>13:13 Md.R. 1511-12 (June 20, 1986); 14.4 Md.R. 417 (Feb. 13, 1987); Md.Regs.Code (COMAR) tit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>09, \u00a7\u00a7 30.71.01 through .07. The ELIC GICs are group annuity contracts under the regulation because they are contracts <em>\u201c[purporting </em>to provide annuity benefits to more than one individual,\u201d .04A (emphasis added), issued to \u201c[a]n employer,\u201d .04B(1), \u201cfor the purpose of providing annuity benefits to ... employees ... who agree to contribute to the cost of the annuity,\u201d ,04C(2). Green drafted the regulation. His affidavit in the instant action reveals that the Insurance Division\u2019s interpretation of the Insurance Code, as reflected in the regulation, underlay the earlier approval of the ELIC GIC policy form.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The Commissioner\u2019s interpretative rule, formally adopted after opportunity for public comment, should also be given weight in the construction of \u00a7 65, particularly because this COMAR regulation has been extant since February 1987, and because the subject matter of GICs as group annuities has been brought to the attention of the General Assembly following promulgation of the regulation. <em>See Maryland Classified Employees Ass\u2019n v. Schaefer, </em>325 Md. 19, 30-34, 599 A.2d 91, 98 (1991) (\u201c[Ljegislative acquiescence in a long-standing administrative construction gives rise to a strong presumption that the interpretation is correct.\u201d (Interior quotation marks omitted)). The General Assembly\u2019s attention was directed to the subject of GICs in the following manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The NAIC had become involved again with GICs while considering amendment of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association Model Act (the Model Act). At the request of the NAIC, the Illinois Department of Insurance had conducted a survey of 1984 written premiums that showed $46 billion of premiums, nationwide, available for assessment in the annuity accounts of guaranty associations. Half of those written premiums represented unallocated annuities. <em>The Final Hurdle, supra, </em>at 18. A Guaranty Fund Task Force, created by the NAIC, debated whether the lack of a direct contractual relationship under a GIC between the insurer and the participant was significant, or whether the retirement benefit expectations of GIC participants were no differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>ent from the benefit expectations under any other annuity contracts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The matter was resolved by expressly recognizing \u201cunallocated annuity contracts issued by member insurers\u201d as covered in the Model Act promulgated in 1985, but that act also limited to $100,000 the guarantee on the present value of annuity benefits with respect to any one life. 1985 Model Act \u00a7\u00a7 3(b)(1) and (c)(2)(A)(iii). The 1987 Model Act continued to provide coverage \u201cfor unallocated annuity contracts issued by member insurers.\u201d 1987 Model Act \u00a7 3(b)(1). In addition, it specifically provided that \u201c[a]nnuity contracts ... include ... guaranteed investment contracts____\u201d <em>Id. </em>That model also continued the $100,000 per life limit on the guarantee of the present value of annuity benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The concerns reflected in the NAIC debate were expressed to the Maryland General Assembly in the form of proposed changes to the Guaranty Act. Senate Bill 126 of the 1987 legislative session would have substantially amended the Guaranty Act. One feature of the bill listed specific coverages to which the Guaranty Act would not apply, including \u201cunallocated annuity contract benefits\u201d and \u201cguaranteed investment accounts.\u201d The bill failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">In the 1988 session, Senate Bill 180 likewise proposed substantial changes to the Guaranty Act. Those changes included a list of types of policies excluded from the Guaranty Act\u2019s coverage, among which were \u201cunallocated annuity contract benefits,\u201d \u201cdeposit administration contracts,\u201d and \u201cguaranteed investment of [sic] contract accounts.\u201d Senate Bill 180 also failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">Proposals to limit the exposure of the Corporation reappeared before the General Assembly in the 1990s. House Bill 70 of the 1991 session would have excluded \u201cguaranteed investment contract accounts\u201d from guaranty fund coverage, and would have imposed a $100,000 limit on annuity benefits that were covered. House Bill 70 failed. House Bill 287 of the 1992 session contained the same features as those in the prior year\u2019s bill, previously described. House Bill 287 failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>We have said that \u201c \u2018the fact that a bill on a specific subject fails of passage in the General Assembly is a rather weak reed upon which to lean in ascertaining legislative intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>T.H.E. Ins. Co. v. P.T.P. Inc., </em>331 Md. 406, 422, 628 A.2d 223, 231 (1993) (quoting <em>Automobile Trade Ass\u2019n v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>292 Md. 15, 24, 437 A.2d 199, 203 (1981)). Here, however, the failed amendments do not stand in a vacuum. The fact that GICs were being written by life companies doing business in Maryland had been recognized by the General Assembly in the Standard Valuation Act of 1982. The Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u201cannuity contract\u201d in \u00a7 65 had been formally promulgated as a regulation in 1987. The bills that failed in 1987, 1988, 1991, and 1992 further evidence the General Assembly\u2019s awareness that the Commissioner\u2019s administrative practice and later, formal interpretation included GICs in \u201cannuity contracts\u201d under \u00a7 65. That combination of factors makes the administrative interpretation persuasive in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Nothing in the scant body of national case law, dealing specifically with GICs and guaranty funds, alters the conclusion that we have reached under principles of Maryland law. A somewhat analogous question was presented in <em>Minnesota Life &amp; Health Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Department of Commerce, </em>400 N.W.2d 769 (Minn.Ct.App.1987). Following the failure of an insurer from which Minnesota residents had purchased over 2,700 single premium deferred annuities, the guaranty association levied an assessment that excluded unallocated annuity contracts, including GICs and DACs. The guaranty association based this distinction on its interpretation of the Minnesota guaranty act which defined \u201cannuity contracts\u201d to mean \u201c \u2018contracts ... wherein the policyowner agrees to make payments to the insurer at the beginning of the contract period and the insurer agrees to make payments thereafter to the insured for a specified period of time or until the insured\u2019s death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 771. Insurers that had been assessed, but which did not write GICs and DACs, appealed to the Commissioner of Commerce who ordered the assessment enlarged to include premiums on GICs and DACs. In an administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>appeal, the court affirmed. It held that the testimony of witnesses at the agency hearing to the effect that GICs and DACs would be considered annuity contracts under the definition supported the agency decision. Among various rules of statutory construction relied on by the court was that which gives \u201cgreat weight to a construction placed upon [the statute] by the department charged -with its administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 774 (interior quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">More relevant to the instant matter is that the Minnesota guaranty act also covered contracts \u201csupplemental to\u201d annuity contracts, that the Commissioner of Commerce alternatively held that GICs and DACs were contracts \u201csupplemental to\u201d annuity contracts, and that the Minnesota court rejected that alternative holding. The court said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJx\">\u201cGICs and DACs are not \u2018supplemental to\u2019 anything. Evidence at the hearing shows the annuity option contained in such contracts is one possibility of the GIC or DAC. For example, if the pension fund trustee decided to exercise an annuity option contained in a DAC or GIC, the trustee would then enter into a supplemental contract. However, since there is sufficient evidence to uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision based on direct coverage of DACs and GICs as annuity contracts, we will, not address this question in detail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, the GIC itself, containing the option for an individual annuity, was an annuity contract, without exercise of the option to obtain the individual annuity contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">At oral argument in this Court, the Corporation took the position that the ELIC GICs properly are classified under the Maryland Insurance Code as funding agreements under \u00a7 416B. Section 416B(a)(3) defines a \u201c \u2018[fjunding agreement\u2019 \u201d to mean \u201cany agreement described by this section.\u201d The definition is, therefore, functional. It would unduly lengthen this opinion to reproduce the nearly two pages of the statute. Sufficient for present purposes is that a funding agreement is not an annuity contract under the Insurance Code. Section 416B(a)(2) provides that \u201c[t]he issuance or delivery of a fund<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ing agreement is not a business authorized under \u00a7\u00a7 62 through 74 of [the Insurance Code], but does constitute an insurance business.\u201d Further, \u201c[a] funding agreement may not provide for payment to, or by, the insurer based on mortality or morbidity contingency.\u201d \u00a7 416B(c)(2). The payment referred to is not limited to periodic payments. Thus, the lump sum payment option on death, or on hardship due to illness, under the ELIC GICs precludes those contracts from being funding agreements, even before it is necessary to consider the effect under \u00a7 416B (c)(2) of the option for periodic life-contingent payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Moreover, the funding agreement statute was not enacted until 1987, by Chapter 565 of the Acts of that year. If the Corporation is correct in arguing that the ELIC GICs are funding agreements, and not \u00a7 65 annuity contracts, then the life insurance industry erred prior to 1987 by offering GICs in Maryland, the Commissioner erred by approving GIC policy forms, and the Insurance Division examiners erred by valuing policies that should never have been issued. But it was not the legislative intent in enacting \u00a7 416B to alter the existing rules, either prospectively or retrospectively. Rather, the purpose was to enlarge the class of authorized insurance products. A staff memorandum to the Committee on Economic Matters on House Bill 1347, which became \u00a7 416B, noted that \u201c[t]he bill specifically excludes payments made based on mortality or morbidity, <em>which are already authorized under current law.'\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The Legislature did not intend to repeal by implication the authorization of mortality-contingent payments that had previously been recognized as annuities under the Insurance Code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Finally, if the Corporation is correct in arguing that an annuity contract must itself contain a promise, made directly to the payee, to make the life-contingent periodic payments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>then the concept of group annuities might be jeopardized. It may well be that the restricted application of the terms of \u00a7 65, for which the Corporation contends, can be, satisfied only by an individual policy. That result should be avoided in view of the express legislative recognition of group annuities in \u00a7\u00a7 83, 375, and in the Standard Nonforfeiture Act, \u00a7 408, as well as in the Commissioner\u2019s interpretative regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">In granting summary judgment in favor of the Corporation, the circuit court wove an additional consideration into its construction of \u00a7 65 as excluding the ELIC GICs. That court said that \u201c[t]he summary judgment record establishes as a matter of law that the sketchy annuity provisions of the ELIC GICs are appendages having no real or substantial relation to the core undertakings, enforceable or not, of the contracting parties.\u201d Returning to the same theme, the circuit court further wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">\u201cThe record here establishes as a matter of law that there was no genuine purpose on the part of the Board or ELIC to provide annuity benefits to participants through the ELIC GICs. The Board\u2019s essential and fundamental purpose was to maximize its fixed investment income; no doubt, ELIC likewise intended merely to increase its profits and its profitability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">That analysis, jurisprudentially, is inconsistent with the objective theory of contracts. Our conclusion may be demonstrated by a hypothetical. We begin with ELIC\u2019s promise in writing to issue individual annuities to Plan participants at retirement \u201cwith 7% interest for ten years and 6% interest thereafter----\u201d Next, assume that the Board had shaken the shackles of its arrangement with Nationwide, and that economic conditions made ELIC\u2019s promise advantageous at some time prior to the maturity of an ELIC GIC, so that all Plan retirees selected an annuity option. Further, assume that the Board tendered all of the retirees\u2019 accumulated savings in their respective Plan accounts to ELIC and demanded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the annuities respectively elected be issued to the retirees. Clearly, it would be no defense for ELIC to prove that neither it, nor the Board, anticipated when the GIC was issued that the annuity option would ever be exercised. The annuity option is a provision of the GIC. Whether the option is exercised, or anticipated to be exercised, is immaterial to the validity of the GIC and to its compliance with \u00a7 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Further, from the standpoint of administration by the Commissioner of \u00a7 375, relating to the approval of individual and group life, health and annuity policies, the rationale of the circuit court is so impractical that the Legislature could not have intended it to be the test for an annuity contract under \u00a7 65. At the time of policy review, the Commissioner\u2019s concern is with the form. At that time there is no requirement for specifically identified insureds, or policyowners, or group participants. Whether the annuity option in a given GIC form will or will not be exercised in fact by any pension plan policyowner on behalf of any plan participants, after issuance as a policy, cannot be determined when the form is submitted to the Commissioner for approval. A determination of a GIC\u2019s annuity contract status, under \u00a7 65, cannot be based on meeting some judicially set degree of probability that the option will be exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">For the reasons set forth in Parts I and II, we hold that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the Corporation, and that judgment will be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">The Corporation also argues that \u201c[a]t best, the Board\u2019s option to withdraw funds to purchase an individual retirement annuity is nothing more than an unenforceable \u2018agreement to agree\u2019 at some point in the future about the terms of such an annuity.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 31. It is said that the ELIC GICs leave to future negotiations the specific terms of a specific annuity. The circuit court did not decide whether this argument had any merit and did not rest its grant of summary judgment on this ground. Where, as here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>the basis for granting summary judgment is erroneous, \u201c \u2018the appellate court will not ordinarily undertake to sustain the judgment by ruling on another ground, not ruled upon by the trial court, if the alternative ground is one as to which the trial court had a discretion to deny summary judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Three Garden Village Ltd. Partnership v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>318 Md. 98, 107-08, 567 A.2d 85, 89 (1989) (quoting <em>Geisz v. Greater Baltimore Medical Center, </em>313 Md. 301, 314 n. 5, 545 A.2d 658, 664 n. 5 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">It is inappropriate for this Court, on this record, to treat the Corporation\u2019s contention as a matter of law and to rule thereon. The record does not reflect whether ELIC had obtained approval in Maryland for one or more individual annuity contracts that would comply with the description in the ELIC GICs. The availability of one or more approved individual policies may well completely undercut the Corporation\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">The principle invoked by the Corporation was stated in <em>Robinson v. Gardiner, </em>196 Md. 213, 217, 76 A.2d 354, 356 (1950), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">\u201c[N]o action will lie upon a contract, whether written or verbal, where such a contract is vague or uncertain in its essential terms. The parties must express themselves in such terms that it can be ascertained to a reasonable degree of certainty what they mean. If the agreement be so vague and indefinite that it is not possible to collect from it the intention of the parties, it is void because neither the court nor jury could make a contract for the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">It was recently applied in <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 418-22, 620 A.2d 305, 318-20 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We are not prepared to say that a court, with appropriate assistance by expert testimony, could not determine the <em>essential </em>terms of an individual annuity for a specifically identified Plan retiree, utilizing the GICs, their incorporated mortality table, the stated interest rates, and general industry practice.

For the reasons stated in this Part III, we also decline, without prejudice, to mandate summary judgment in favor of the Board on its claim for a declaration that the ELIC GICs are covered policies under the Guaranty Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The premise of all of the arguments that we have considered to this point has been that the inclusion of \u201cannuity contracts\u201d in \u00a7 522(1) of the Guaranty Act, where the quoted term is not specially defined, meant that the term was to be construed in \u00a7 522(1) as it is construed in \u00a7 65 and elsewhere in the Insurance Code. We now consider an argument advanced by the Corporation that denies that premise. The Corporation urges us, on policy grounds, to exclude unallocated annuities from the Guaranty Act alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The Corporation points out that approximately fifteen states deny any guaranty fund coverage to unallocated annuity contracts,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that, although approximately twenty states extend protection to unallocated annuity contracts,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> those states impose specific monetary limitations on the liability of the guaranty association. The Corporation submits that the proper role of the Guaranty Act is the protection of unsophisticated, individual policyholders, whereas unallocated annuities typically are purchased by pension plans that are managed by sophisticated trustees who are assisted by professional financial consultants. The Corporation predicts that, if this Court concludes that unallocated annuities are covered policies, Maryland will become the state of choice for the formation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>recklessly managed pension plans.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These arguments are appropriately directed to the General Assembly. Indeed, they may well have been so directed when limiting amendments to the coverage of the Guaranty Act were offered in past sessions, as reviewed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">This public policy argument by the Corporation was not a ground on which summary judgment was granted by the circuit court. The argument, however, presents a pure question of law that does not involve any trial court discretion. Basically the Corporation asks us to construe \u201cannuity contract\u201d more restrictively in the Guaranty Act than \u201cannuity contract\u201d is construed elsewhere in the Insurance Code. A restrictive construction limited to the Guaranty Act would violate the mandate of \u00a7 523 of the Guaranty Act under which that \u201csubtitle shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose under \u00a7 521.... \u201d That purpose \u201cis to protect residents who are policyowners, insureds, beneficiaries, annuitants, [and] payees ... of life insurance policies, health insurance policies [and] annuity contracts----\u201d For that reason we reject the Corporation\u2019s public policy argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY VACATED.

The Attorney General\u2019s opinion reported at 45 Op. Att'y Gen. 120 was not enthusiastically embraced by the then Insurance Commissioner of Maryland. By Chapter 652 of the Acts of 1961, a moratorium until May 31, 1962 on writing variable annuities in Maryland was effected by inserting in the definition after the words, \"agreements to make periodical payments,\u201d the words, \"of fixed stuns.\u201d That moratorium was extended to May 31, 1963 by Chapter 75 of the Acts of 1963 which for one year prohibited issuance in Maryland of contracts on a variable basis. The general revision of the Insurance Code by Chapter 553 of the Acts of 1963 allowed the prohibition against contracts on a variable basis to expire, but reserved section number 362 in Art. 48A for a future statute dealing directly with variable annuities. Section 362 was enacted by Chapter 427 of the Acts of 1970. It gives the Insurance Commissioner special regulatory powers over \"individual and group variable life insurance and annuity contracts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-8\">.

In addition to minimizing the effect of federal control on pension plans and minimizing state control over, and examination of, insurers writing GICs, this argument assumes how the term \"resident,\u201d as used in the Guaranty Act, is to be construed. We intimate no opinion on that question of construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
