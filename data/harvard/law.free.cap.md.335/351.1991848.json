The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County entered summary judgment in favor of the defendant manufacturer on the ground that \u00a7 5-108(a) barred the plaintiffs suit: This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">We issued a writ of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the case by the Court of Special Appeals, 332 Md. 701, 632 A.2d 1207. The principal issue raised in this appeal is whether \u00a7 5-108(a) applies to a cause of action brought against the manufacturer of a residential, in-ground' swimming pool for injuries caused by an \u00e1lleged defect in the pool\u2019s design. We answer that question in the affirmative. We hold, however, that summary judgment was improperly granted as there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the plaintiffs injury occurred more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first became available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>for its intended use. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In 1971, Rudi and Hannelore Schanne decided to install an in-ground swimming pool at their home in Glen Burnie, Maryland. The Schannes purchased the pool from Appellee Fox Pool Corporation [Fox], a designer, manufacturer and supplier of residential swimming pools. The pool consisted of a vinyl liner supported by metal bracing, measured 20 feet in width by 40 feet in length, and was designed such that it had both an area of shallow water for wading and an area of deeper water, ostensibly for diving. In the deeper end, the pool\u2019s interior walls sloped at a 45 degree angle towards a small \u201ctarget area\u201d for diving in the center. Although the depth of the water in the \u201ctarget area\u201d was 7 feet 6 inches, the water in other areas of the deeper end was as shallow as 3 feet deep because of the pool\u2019s sloping walls.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In early 1971, Fox shipped the unassembled pool to the Schannes, who subsequently hired B &amp; H Construction Company [B &amp; H] to install the pool at their home. In deposition testimony, Mr. Schanne recalled that the pool was installed \u201cearly in the spring\u201d of 1971, \u201csomewhere around March.\u201d Also in deposition testimony, Mrs. Schanne recalled that installation of the pool was completed by May 1971 and that she began swimming in the pool by the end of that same month. Mrs. Schanne also testified that B &amp; H gave her a warranty card for the pool on the day that construction was completed. When she was given the card, Mrs. Schanne filled in the necessary information and returned the card to B &amp; H, which in turn sent the card back to Fox. The date on the completed warranty card, obtained from Fox during pre-trial discovery, is July 12, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">On July 4,1991, Appellant John B. Rose attended a party at the Schannes\u2019 home. Rose was a neighbor of the Schannes and had enjoyed the use of their pool numerous times over the years. When Rose dove from the side of the pool on this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>occasion, however, he struck his head on either the bottom or the side of the pool and was rendered quadriplegic. He subsequently filed suit against Fox in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, asserting causes of action in negligence, strict liability, and breach of warranty. The gravamen of Rose\u2019s complaint against Fox was that the pool was defectively designed and generally unsafe for diving and that Fox had failed to adequately warn its customers of the pool\u2019s dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">On November 16, 1992, Fox filed a motion for summary judgment based upon \u00a7 5-108(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Section 5-108 provides, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">(a) <em>Injury occurring more than 20 years </em>later.\u2014Except as provided by this section, no cause of action for damages accrues and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property occurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">(b) <em>Action against architect, professional engineer, or con</em>tractor.\u2014Except as provided by this section, a cause of action for damages does not accrue and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity from any architect, professional engineer, or contractor for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property, resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property, occurs more than 10 years after the date the entire improvement first became available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">(c) <em>Three-year limitation after accrual of cause of </em>action.\u2014 Upon accrual of a cause of action referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an action shall be filed within 3 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-9\">(d) <em>Supplier defined.\u2014(l) </em>In this subsection, \u201csupplier\u201d means any individual or entity whose principal business is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>the supply, distribution, installation, sale, or resale of any product that causes asbestos-related disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">(2) This section does not apply if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-6\">(i) The defendant was in actual possession and control of the property as owner, tenant, or otherwise when the injury occurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">(ii) In a cause of action against a manufacturer or supplier for damages for personal injury or death caused by asbestos or a product that contains asbestos, the injury or death results from exposure to asbestos dust or fibers which are shed or emitted prior to or in the course of the affixation, application, or installation of the asbestos or the product that contains asbestos to an improvement to real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-8\">(iii) In other causes of action for damages for personal injury or death caused by asbestos or a product that contains asbestos, the defendant is a manufacturer of a product that contains asbestos; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">(iv) In a cause of action for damages for injury to real property that results from a defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-10\">1. The defendant is a manufacturer of a product that contains asbestos;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-11\">2. The damages to an improvement to real property are caused by asbestos or a product that contains asbestos;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-12\">3.

Is owned by a governmental entity and used for a public purpose; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-15\">B. Is a public or private institution of elementary, secondary, or higher education; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-16\">5. The complaint is filed by July 1, 1993.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-17\">(e) <em>When action </em>accrues.\u2014A cause of action for an injury described in this section accrues when the injury or damage occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>In support of its contention that \u00a7 5-108(a) bars Rose\u2019s claims, Fox asserted (1) that the Schannes\u2019 swimming pool is an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d; (2) that Rose\u2019s injuries resulted from the alleged \u201cdefective and unsafe condition\u201d of the pool; and (3) that at the time Rose was injured, more than 20 years had passed since the' pool \u201cfirst bec[ame] available for its intended use.\u201d Following an oral hearing on the motion, Judge H. Chester Goudy granted summary judgment in favor of Fox on the ground that Rose\u2019s claims were barred by \u00a7 5-108(a). Rose appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Rose\u2019s principal contention before this Court is that \u00a7 5-108(a) should not and was never intended to apply to manufacturers of consumer goods. Rose also submits two alternative arguments in support of his assertion that summary judgment' was improperly granted. First, Rose asserts that his injuries did not \u201cresult from\u201d a defective and unsafe condition of an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-108(a). Rose contends that an in-ground swimming pool is a consumer good within the meaning of Maryland Code (1975, 1992 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-105 and \u00a7 9-109(1) of the Commercial Law Article and suggests that the pool should therefore not be considered an \u201cimprovement to real property.\u201d Second, relying upon Mrs. Schanne\u2019s testimony that she was given the pool\u2019s warranty card on the day that construction of the pool was completed and the fact that the warranty card was dated July 12, 1971, Rose asserts that there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether, at the time of his injury on July 4, 1991, the requisite 20 years had passed since the entire improvement first became available for its intended use. We shall address each of Rose\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The issues raised in this appeal require us to discern the meaning of \u00a7 5-108(a). The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to effectuate and carry out legislative intent. <em>See, e.g., Comptroller v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 732, 633 A.2d 93, 97 (1993); <em>Geico v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 131, 630 A.2d 713, 717 (1993). Every statute is enacted to further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>some underlying goal or purpose\u2014\u201cto advance some interest, to attain some end\u201d\u2014and must be construed in accordance with its general purposes and policies. <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987); <em>see also State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275, 278 (1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942, 96 S.Ct. 1680, 48 L.Ed.2d 185 (1976). When called upon to construe a particular statute, we begin our analysis with the statutory language itself since the words of the statute, construed according to their ordinary and natural import, are the primary source and most persuasive evidence of legislative intent. <em>Jameson, 332 </em>Md. at 732, 633 A.2d at 97-98; <em>Comptroller v. Fairchild Industries, </em>303 Md. 280, 284, 493 A.2d 341, 343 (1985). The statute must be construed as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993); <em>Md. Port Adm. v. Brawner Contracting Co., </em>303 Md. 44, 60, 492 A.2d 281, 289 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">When the language of a statute is plain and clear and expresses a meaning consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, no further analysis of legislative intent is ordinarily required. <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 633. As we explained, however, in <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">[O]ur endeavor is always to seek out the legislative purpose, the general aim or policy, the ends to be accomplished, the evils to be redressed by a particular enactment. In the conduct of that enterprise, we are not limited to study of the statutory language. The plain meaning rule \u201c \u2018is not a complete, all-sufficient rule for ascertaining a legislative intention....\u2019\u201d The \u201cmeaning of the plainest language\u201d is controlled by the context in which it appears. Thus, we are always free to look at the context within which the statutory language appears. Even when the words of a statute carry a definite meaning, we are not \u201cprecluded from consulting legislative history as part of the process of determining the legislative purpose or goal\u201d of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>319 Md. at 603-04, 573 A.2d at 1349 (citations and footnote omitted); <em>see also Baltimore Cty. C.A.U.T. v. Baltimore Cty., </em>321 Md. 184, 203-04, 582 A.2d 510, 519-20 (1990); <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 513, 525 A.2d at 632. The legislative history of a statute, including amendments that were considered and/or enacted as the statute passed through the Legislature, and the statute\u2019s relationship to earlier and subsequent legislation are \u201cexternal manifestations\u201d or \u201cpersuasive evidence\u201d of legislative purpose that may be taken into consideration. <em>Maryland Nat\u2019l Bank v. Pearce, </em>329 Md. 602, 619, 620 A.2d 941, 949 (1993) <em>(quoting Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 515, 525 A.2d at 632).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The specific statutory language of \u00a7 5-108(a) precludes all actions which meet two requirements: (1) the plaintiffs injuries must have resulted from the alleged defective and unsafe condition of \u201can improvement to real property\u201d; and (2) 20 years must have passed since the \u201centire improvement first bec[ame] available for its intended use.\u201d The \u201cno cause of action\u201d language of \u00a7 5-108(a) is clear: it creates a blanket prohibition against all suits that meet the statutory criteria. Thus, as the statute was drafted, the defendant\u2019s identity is irrelevant in determining whether \u00a7 5-108(a) bars a particular cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Unlike subsection (b), which specifically names architects, professional engineers, and contractors as persons entitled to greater protection from liability than that afforded by subsection (a), and unlike subsections (d)(2)\u00ae (defendant in possession and control) and (d)(2)(h), (hi), and (iv) (all relating to the exclusion of manufacturers and supphers of asbestos), subsection (a) does not identify the class of persons to which it applies. It is well settled that where a statute specifically hsts certain classes of persons as excluded from coverage, the express exclusion of certain persons raises the inference that all other persons not excepted are within the statute\u2019s coverage. <em>See Office &amp; Prof. Employees Int\u2019l v. MTA, </em>295 Md. 88, 96, 453 A.2d 1191, 1195 (1982); <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>292 Md. 155, 162, 438 A.2d 490, 493 (1981); <em>see also </em>C. Sands, 2A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Sutherland Stat. Const. \u00a7 47.23 (5th ed. 1992) (\u201cThe enumeration of exclusions from the operation of a statute indicates that the statute should apply to all cases not specifically excluded.\u201d). Here, the express exclusion of certain persons in the various provisions of subsection (d), and the singling out of other persons for special protection in subsection (b), gives rise to the inference that subsection (a) provides immunity from liability to all other persons, including, necessarily, product manufacturers.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Rose, however, protests the application of \u00a7 5-108(a) to suits against product manufacturers. Relying upon select passages from the legislative history of \u00a7 5-108 which discuss the application of the statute to architects, engineers, builders and contractors, Rose contends that the General Assembly never intended that manufacturers fall within the scope of the statute. Although the plain language of \u00a7 5-108(a) makes clear that all actions are barred by the statute, we shall review the legislative history of the entire statute to ensure that the \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule does not lead us to a construction at odds with the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting this statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The earliest version of \u00a7 5-108 was enacted by the General Assembly in 1970. 1970 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 666. Codified at Article 57, \u00a7 20, the statute provided in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">Actions for damages resulting from defective or unsafe real property improvements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">No action to recover damages for injury to property real or personal, or for bodily injury or wrongful death, arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property, nor any action for contribution or indemnity for damages incurred as a result of said injury or death, shall be brought more than twenty years after the said improvement was substantially completed. This limitation shall not apply to any action brought against the person who, at the time the injury was sustained, was in actual possession and control as owner, tenant, or otherwise of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>said improvement. For purposes of this section, \u201csubstantially completed\u201d shall mean when the entire improvement is first available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">As we discussed in <em>Whiting-Turner Contract. Co. v. Coupard, </em>304 Md. 340, 499 A.2d 178 (1985), two developments in the law\u2014the elimination of the \u201cprivity of contract\u201d doctrine as a defense and the application of the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2014 provided the impetus behind the enactment of Article 57, \u00a7 20 and the enactment of statutes of repose in other states across the nation. 304 Md. at 349, 499 A.2d at 183; <em>see also Hilliard &amp; Bartko v. Fedco Systems, </em>309 Md. 147, 160, 522 A.2d 961, 968 (1987). In the context of actions for injuries arising out of an improvement to real property, those two changes in the law resulted in a dramatic expansion of liability, both with respect to the persons who might be held liable and with respect to the duration of that liability. <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>304 Md. at 349, 499 A.2d at 183. Architects and engineers, particularly concerned by these developments, turned to state legislatures for protection from this expanded liability. As a consequence, statutes of repose, aimed at addressing the problem of expanded liability resulting from defective and unsafe conditions in improvements to real property, were enacted by some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>thirty states between 1964 and 1970. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>Limitation of Action Statutes for Architects and Builders\u2014Blueprints for Non-action, </em>18 Cath.U.L.Rev. 361, 361 (1969)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. Article 57, \u00a7 20 was the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s \u201cresponse to the problems arising from the expansion of liability based on the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.\u201d <em>Whiting-Turner, </em>304 Md. at 349, 499 A.2d at 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Most jurisdictions which enacted statutes of repose adopted some variation of the model statute endorsed by the American Institute of Architects, the National Society of Professional Engineers, and the Associated General Contractors. The model statute provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>No action, whether in contract (oral or written, sealed or unsealed), in tort or otherwise, to recover damages</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">(i) for a deficiency in the design, planning, supervision or observation of construction or construction of an improvement to real property,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">(ii) for injury to property, real or personal, arising out of any such deficiency, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-7\">(iii) for injury to the person or for wrongful death arising out of any such deficiency, shall be brought against <em>any person performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision or observation of construction, or construction of such an improvement </em>more than four years after substantial completion of such an improvement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-8\"><em>Limitation of Action Statutes, supra, </em>at 365 n. 31 (emphasis added); <em>J.H. Westerman Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>499 A.2d 116, 121 (D.C.1985). Those states adopting some version of the model statute enacted statutes with language limiting the application of the statute to a specified group of defendants, usually those engaged in the design and construction of improvements. Some states went further than the model statute in identifying the class of persons to be protected by a particular statute of repose and expressly limited the statute of repose to actions against specific, named classes of persons. <em>See, e.g., </em>Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 52-584a (1989) (architects and professional engineers); Me.Rev.Stat.Ann. tit. 14, \u00a7 752-A (West 1980) (duly licensed or registered architects and engineers); Mich.Comp.Laws \u00a7 600.5839 (1987) (state licensed architects and professional engineers); R.I.Gen.Laws \u00a7 9-1-29 (1985) (architects, professional engineers, contractors, subcontractors, and materialmen); Tex.Civ.Prac. &amp; Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.008 to .009 (West 1986) (licensed or registered architects and engineers).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Bills were introduced in the Maryland General Assembly during the 1967,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1968<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 1969<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> legislative sessions which would have created a statute of repose applicable only to \u201cpersons performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction or construction\u201d of an improvement. The General Assembly, however, did not enact a bill with such limiting language. The statute that was finally enacted in 1970 was Article 57, \u00a7 20,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which simply provided that, under the specified circumstances, no cause of action could be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Article 57, \u00a7 20 was modified as part of the code revision project when the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was enacted effective January 1,1974. Codified at \u00a7 5-108 of that Article, the statute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">(a) <em>Injury resulting from improvement to </em>realty.\u2014Except as provided by this section, no cause of action for damages accrues and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>property occurs more than 20 years after the date the entire improvement first becomes available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">(b) Exception.\u2014This section does not apply if the defendant was in actual possession and control of the property as owner, tenant, or otherwise when the injury occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">(c) <em>When action </em>accrues.\u2014A cause of action for an injury described in this section accrues when the injury or damage occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">During the late 1970\u2019s, architects and engineers began to complain that the 20-year limitation provided by \u00a7 5-108(a) did not afford them sufficient protection from liability. Citing statistics which indicated that most claims brought against architects and engineers are brought within 8 years of the completion of a project and pointing out that other states had enacted much shorter time limits with respect to suits against architects and engineers, the General Assembly was urged to shorten the statutory time period in which suits could be brought. <em>See, e.g., </em>Statement by the Consulting Engineers Council of Maryland, Inc. before the House Judiciary Committee on Senate Bill 18, April 6, 1977 (available at the Department of Legislative Reference, Bill File for Senate Bill 18 (1977)); <em>see also Limitation of Action Statutes, supra, </em>at 365-69 (comparison of statutes of repose).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">In apparent response, by Chapter 698 of the Acts of 1979, the Legislature created a new subsection (b) that applied only to claims against architects and professional engineers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">(b) <em>Action against architect or professional engineer.\u2014A </em>cause of action for damages does not accrue and a person may not seek contribution or indemnity from any architect or professional engineer for damages incurred when wrongful death, personal injury, or injury to real or personal property, resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property, occurs more than 10 years after the date the entire improvement first became available for its intended use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>1979 Laws of Maryland, Ch. 698.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Significantly, the retention of subsection (a) and the creation of a new subsection applying only to architects and professional engineers made it clear that subsection (a) applied to persons other than architects and professional engineers. In 1980, by Chapter 605, the General Assembly added contractors to the list of persons afforded the special protections of subsection (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">During 1988 and 1989, the question of whether \u00a7 5-108(a) applies in actions against product manufacturers became a critical issue in a number of suits seeking damages for personal injury and property damage from manufacturers of construction materials containing asbestos. In every one of those cases, \u00a7 5-108(a) was held to bar claims for damages filed against the manufacturers of asbestos whose products had been incorporated into buildings which had been completed over 20 years prior to the discovery of the plaintiffs' injuries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Department of Legislative Reference Update, Vol. 90-1, <em>Asbestos Liability\u2014The Statute of Repose, </em>January 11, 1990 [Leg.Ref.Update] at 5-7 (discussing applicability of \u00a7 5-108(a) in asbestos cases); <em>Bill Analysis\u2014Senate Bill 500, </em>1990 Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. Those court decisions prompted calls for immediate legislative action regarding the application of the statute of repose to manufacturers generally and, more specifically, to manufacturers of asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Those lower court decisions also generated much debate and controversy regarding the original intent of the 1970 General Assembly as to whether manufacturers were ever intended to be protected by \u00a7 5-108(a). <em>See, e.g., </em>Leg.Ref.Update at 8. In 1990, two bills were introduced in the General Assembly\u2014 Senate Bill 500 and House Bill 1025\u2014that, as originally drafted, excluded actions against \u201ca manufacturer or supplier of any materials, equipment, machinery, or other articles that are part of an improvement to real property\u201d from the scope of \u00a7 5-108(a). During consideration of both bills, proponents of the express exclusion of all manufacturers claimed that the statute of repose was never intended to apply to manufacturers. In response, opponents argued that manufacturers were intended to be included or that, at best, the 1970 Legislature had never considered whether the statute would apply to manufacturers.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">After considerable debate within the Legislature, Senate Bill 500 and House Bill 1025 were both amended and the broad language excluding all manufacturers from \u00a7 5-108(a) was replaced by language excluding only manufacturers of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>asbestos products.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the enrolled version of Senate Bill 500 specifically identified only manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos products, many opponents of the bill asserted that the bill was ambiguous and that, as written, Senate Bill 500 could be construed to exclude other manufacturers from \u00a7 5-108(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Senate Bill 500 passed both Houses but was vetoed by Governor William Donald Schaefer on May 29, 1990. In his letter to the President of the Senate, the Governor wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdR\">Many of those in favor of this legislation argue that the bill is only a clarification of the original 1970 enactment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>which they farther believe has been incorrectly interpreted by many trial courts. To the extent that it is really possible to know what a Legislature \u201cintended\u201d 20 years ago, our own analysis leads to the conclusion that this bill is not a clarification of the law, but is in fact a major, substantive revision of the Statute of Repose. That fact must not be lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 2 (available at the Department of Legislative Reference, Bill File for Senate Bill 500). In concluding his veto letter, the Governor pledged \u201cto work with the sponsors and advocates of this issue next Session on compromise legislation.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In 1991, two administration bills\u2014Senate Bill 335 and House Bill 496\u2014were introduced which expressly excluded only manufacturers of asbestos or products containing asbestos. In testimony before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, David Iannucci, the Chief Legislative Officer of the Office of the Governor, explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">The legislation [Senate Bill 335 and House Bill 496] would waive the protection of the Statute of Repose only for asbestos. <em>While other materials could later be found to be dangerous, later General Assemblies would be in a position to make the policy determinations relevant to those materials.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 4 (emphasis added). Senate Bill 335, approved by both Houses, was enacted as Chapter 271, 1991 Laws of Maryland, and the exclusion of asbestos manufacturers and suppliers appeared in \u00a7 5-108 as subsections (d)(2)(h), (iii) and (iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">As it existed at the time of Rose\u2019s suit and as it exists today, \u00a7 5-108(a) provides a 20-year limitation for all actions resulting from the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property. Section 5-108(a) thus creates a broad grant of immunity for all persons who might otherwise be held liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>for a defect in an improvement to real property, subject only to the express exclusions of \u00a7 5-108(d). While the defendant\u2019s identity is crucial in determining the applicability of subsections (b) and (d), it plays no role in determining whether subsection (a) applies. Under subsection (a), a defendant\u2019s immunity from suit after 20 years have expired does not turn on the defendant\u2019s occupation or on the type of service or product the defendant provides. Rather, the defendant\u2019s immunity from liability emanates from the fact that the plaintiffs injury \u201cresulted from a defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property\u201d that was substantially completed over 20 years prior to the time of the plaintiffs injury. <em>See First United Methodist Church v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>882 F.2d 862, 865 (4th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1070, 110 S.Ct. 1113, 107 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1990); <em>J.H. Westerman Co., </em>499 A.2d at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We are aware that some courts in other jurisdictions have excluded product manufacturers and suppliers from the coverage of a particular statute of repose.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Luzadder v. Despatch Oven Co., </em>834 F.2d 355, 359 (3d Cir.1987) (Pa. law), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 1035, 108 S.Ct. 1595, 99 L.Ed.2d 909 (1988); <em>Baker v.

Co., </em>399 Mass. 687, 506 N.E.2d 509, 515, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 953, 108 S.Ct. 345, 98 L.Ed.2d 371 (1987); <em>Condit v. Lewis Refrigeration Co., </em>101 Wash.2d 106, 676 P.2d 466, 468-69 (1984). We note, however, that in each of those cases the particular statutes of repose at issue were variants of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>model statute which provided that only \u201cpersons performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision or observation of construction, or construction of such an improvement\u201d were protected from liability after the specified period of time. In concluding that manufacturers were not covered by similarly worded statutes of repose, those court decisions rested primarily on the fact that the manufacturer defendants were not performing one of the <em>activities </em>specified in those statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We further note that judicial exclusion of manufacturers from statutes of repose has not been universal and some courts having considered even a variant of the narrower \u201cperson performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision or observation of construction, or construction\u201d language of the model statute have concluded that product manufacturers may indeed fall within the class of persons protected. <em>See, e.g., Adair v. Koppers Co., </em>741 F.2d 111, 116 (6th Cir. 1984) (Ohio law); <em>In re Beverly Hills Fire Litigation, </em>695 F.2d 207, 224-25 (6th Cir.1982) (Ky. law), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 929, 103 S.Ct. 2090, 77 L.Ed.2d 300 (1983); <em>KSLA-TV Inc. v.

In <em>First United Methodist Church v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>882 F.2d 862 (4th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1070, 110 S.Ct. 1113, 107 L.Ed.2d 1020 (1990), the United States Court <em>of </em>Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, until today the only appellate court addressing the question of whether Maryland\u2019s statute of repose applies to claims against product manufacturers, held that \u00a7 5-108(a) does apply to such claims. There, a church brought suit in 1988 against the manufacturer of asbestos-containing acoustical plaster which had been applied to the church\u2019s ceiling in 1961. <em>Id. </em>at 864. The suit was brought prior to the revision of the statute and, thus, manufacturers of asbestos products were not specifically excluded from \u00a7 5-108(a). Summary judgment was granted in favor of the manufacturer on the ground that the claims were barred by \u00a7 5-108(a). On appeal, the church\u2019s \u201cprimary contention [was] that manufacturers are not in the class of persons protected by the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Fourth Circuit soundly rejected that argument: \u201c[Section 5-108] is completely silent as to any limitation on the class of persons it protects. To remove manufacturers from the ambit of \u00a7 5-108(a) ... would be flatly inconsistent with this language\u2019s plain mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">A similar conclusion was reached by the District of Columbia\u2019s highest court in construing that jurisdiction\u2019s similarly worded statute of repose. In <em>J.H. Westerman Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>499 A.2d 116 (D.C.1985), the question before the D.C.Court of Appeals was whether a manufacturer of a component of a heating system could claim the protection of D.C.\u2019s statute of repose, D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 12-310. <em>Id. </em>at 117. At that time, the D.C. statute provided that actions \u201cto recover damages ... resulting from the defective or unsafe condition of an improvement to real property ... shall be barred\u201d unless the plaintiffs injury occurred within 10 years of the date the improvement was substantially completed. <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>at 118 n. 1.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The D.C. Court of Appeals held that the statute plainly applied to suits against all persons, other than those expressly excluded, and thereby barred a claim brought against a product manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>at 121.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We agree with both the reasoning and holdings of <em>First United Methodist Church </em>and <em>J.H. Westerman Co. </em>In our review of the legislative history of \u00a7 5-108, we have uncovered nothing which supports Rose\u2019s assertion that the General Assembly intended that product manufacturers would not be entitled to the protections of the statute of repose. The General Assembly expressly identified certain defendants to which subsection (a) does not apply. If the Legislature intended to exclude all manufacturers of consumer products, it certainly could have so provided. We therefore conclude that manufacturers of products other than those containing asbestos are among the persons entitled to the protections of \u00a7 5-108(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">We must next determine whether Rose\u2019s injuries resulted \u201cfrom the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property.\u201d Although a swimming pool, at the time that it is sold, might fall within the broad definition of \u201cconsumer goods\u201d as it appears in Maryland Code (1975, 1992 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 2-105(1) and \u00a7 9-109(1) of the Commercial Law Article,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>see Anthony Pools v. Sheehan, </em>295 Md. 285, 289-94, 455 A.2d 434, 436-39 (1983) (pool diving board is consumer good); <em>cf. Chlan v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>53 Md.App. 236, 240-41, 452 A.2d 1259, 1261-62 (1982), we do not find the classification of a product as a consumer good either helpful or dispositive with respect to the question of whether the product may also be considered an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 54.08(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">Section 5-108 itself does not define \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d and there is no clear indication in the legislative history of the statute as to what the term was meant to encompass. In <em>Allentown Plaza v. Suburban Propane, </em>43 Md.App. 337, 405 A.2d 326 (1979), the Court of Special Appeals noted that two general approaches have been espoused by courts around the country in determining what constitutes an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d for the purposes of statutes of repose. <em>Id. </em>at 344, 405 A.2d at 331. A small minority of courts rely upon common law fixture analysis and the relevant considerations of the degree of annexation and the physical size of the object to determine whether a particular object qualifies as an \u201cimprovement to real property. <em>Id. </em>at 345, 405 A.2d at 331. The overwhelming majority of courts, however, have eschewed fixture analysis and avoid its vagaries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>by employing a \u201ccommon sense\u201d or \u201ccommon usage\u201d test. <em>Id. </em>Under the common sense approach, the relevant inquiry is whether the object is an improvement within the common, dictionary meaning of that term. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">As a basic tenet of statutory construction, the term \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d should be construed according to its common-sense, ordinary meaning in the absence of evidence that the Legislature intended for another meaning to apply. <em>See, e.g., Jameson, </em>332 Md. at 732-33, 633 A.2d at 97-98. In the legislative history of \u00a7 5-108, there is no reference to the term \u201cfixture\u201d nor any indication that the Legislature meant for fixture law to be determinative of what constitutes an \u201cimprovement.\u201d In <em>Allentown Plaza, </em>the Court of Special Appeals suggested that the term \u201cimprovement\u201d may be commonly understood as including \u201ceverything that permanently enhances the value of premises for general uses.\u201d 43 Md.App. at 345, 405 A.2d at 331 <em>(quoting </em>41 Am.Jur.2d <em>Improvements </em>\u00a7 1, at 479 (1968)). We find persuasive the narrower definition of \u201cimprovement\u201d found in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>which several courts have relied upon in construing the term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">[a] valuable addition made to property (usually real estate) or an amelioration in its condition, amounting to more than mere repairs or replacement, costing labor or capital, and intended to enhance its value, beauty or utility or to adapt it for new or further purposes. Generally has reference to buildings, but may also include any permanent structure or other development, such as a street, sidewalks, sewers, utilities, etc. An expenditure to extend the useful life of an asset or to improve its performance over that of the original asset. Such expenditures are capitalized as part of the asset\u2019s cost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-7\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(6th ed. 1990), at 757; <em>see Fleck v. KDI Sylvan Pools, Inc., </em>981 F.2d 107, 114 (3d Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 113 S.Ct. 1645, 123 L.Ed.2d 267 (1993); <em>McCormick v. Columbus Conveyer Co., </em>564 A.2d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">We agree, however, with the <em>Allentown Plaza </em>court that the nature of the addition or betterment, its permanence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>and relationship to the land and its occupants, and its effect on the value and use of the property are factors which common sense dictates should be considered in making the case by case determination of whether it is an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-108. <em>Allentown Plaza, </em>43 Md.App. at 346, 405 A.2d at 332. The Schannes\u2019 pool is a permanent addition, excavated and built into the real property, which enhances the value of the entire premises. Considering those factors, we conclude that the Schannes\u2019 swimming pool is an \u201cimprovement to real property\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 5-108. <em>See also Fleck v. Sylvan Pools, </em>981 F.2d at 115; <em>Kline v. Doughboy Rec. Mfg. Co., </em>495 N.W.2d 435, 438 (Minn.Ct.App.1993); <em>Nevada Lakeshore Co. v. Diamond Elec., Inc., </em>89 Nev. 293, 511 P.2d 113 (1973); <em>Morse v. City of Toppenish, </em>46 Wash.App. 60, 729 P.2d 638, 640 (1986), <em>review denied, </em>108 Wash.2d 1007 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In his brief, Rose also asserts that his injuries did not result from the defective nature of the pool but rather resulted from Fox\u2019s failure to adequately warn its customers of the pool\u2019s defective and unsafe design, and that, therefore, \u00a7 5-108(a) is not applicable to his claims. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">Rose\u2019s injuries were suffered as a result of a diving accident in the Schannes\u2019 pool. In his complaint, the defective nature of the pool is identified as the <em>cause </em>of his injuries.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Indeed, as an essential element of each of his causes of action, Rose would have had to prove that his injuries were <em>caused </em>by the defective and unsafe condition of the pool. <em>See, e.g., Eaton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Corp. v. Wright, </em>281 Md. 80, 375 A.2d 1122 (1977); <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976); <em>Moran v. Faberge, </em>273 Md. 538, 332 A.2d 11 (1975); <em>Jensen v. American Motors Corp., </em>50 Md.App. 226, 437 A.2d 242 (1981). We therefore reject Rose\u2019s argument that his injuries did not result from or originate from the defective and unsafe condition of the swimming pool as the direct cause of his injuries was the alleged defective and unsafe condition of the pool. <em>Cf. Cannon v. McKen, </em>296 Md. 27, 34, 459 A.2d 196, 200 (1983) (all claims originating from rendering of health care are claims \u201carising or resulting from\u201d rendering of health care within meaning of Health Care Malpractice Claims Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Finally, we address the question of whether, at the time of Rose\u2019s injury on July 4, 1991, 20 years had passed since the \u201centire improvement first bec[ame] available for its intended use.\u201d Under \u00a7 5-108(a), construction or installation of the entire improvement need not be totally completed for the entire improvement to be considered \u201cfirst ... available for its intended use.\u201d Rather, the phrase \u201cfirst ... available for its intended use\u201d means the entire improvement must only be substantially completed or completed to such a degree that it is capable of being used in its intended manner. <em>See </em>Article 57, \u00a7 20, <em>supra </em>(improvement is \u201csubstantially completed\u201d when it is \u201cfirst available for its intended use.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In granting summary judgment in favor of Fox, the trial court found that there was no genuine dispute that the \u201centire improvement first bec[ame] available for its intended use\u201d prior to July 4, 1971\u201420 years prior to Rose\u2019s injury on July 4, 1991\u2014and that Fox consequently was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The evidence which was before the trial judge when he was making that determination consisted of the warranty card and the deposition testimony of both Rudi and Hannelore Schanne.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">In Rudi Schanne\u2019s deposition, the following statements were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>[Question]: Prior to the date of this incident, you had a pool installed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">[Mr. Schanne]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">[Question]: When had you got that pool installed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">[Mr. Schanne]: The pool got installed in 1971.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">[Question]: When in 1971?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">[Mr. Schanne]: It was early in the spring. I don\u2019t even know to tell you the date, but I would say somewhere around March of \u201971.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Hannelore Schanne provided the following testimony in her deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-11\">[Question]: Were they finished [with construction of the pool] by the end of April? Were they finished with it, or did it go into May?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-12\">[Mrs. Schanne]: I think it was the beginning of May really. It took them a long time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-13\">[Question]: So by the end of May they were finished with everything they had to do on the pool?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-14\">[Mrs. Schanne]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-15\">[Question]: When did you start swimming in the pool? May or June?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">[Mrs. Schanne]: Let\u2019s see. Because my sister-in-law said I\u2019m crazy, it was then end of May. The water was very cold.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">Mrs. Schanne also testified in her deposition that she was given the warranty card for the pool on the day that construction was completed. The warranty card was dated July 12, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-18\">The trial judge relied primarily upon Mrs. Schanne\u2019s statement that she was swimming in the pool in May 1971 in concluding that the entire improvement first became available for its intended use by May 1971. We find, however, that the testimony that a warranty card was presented to Mrs. Schanne on the day that construction was completed and the fact that the warranty card was dated July 12, 1971 raises the inference that installation of the pool may not have actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>been \u201csubstantially completed\u201d until after July 4, 1971. Since all inferences from the evidence must be drawn in favor of Rose, the party opposing summary judgment, we find that the evidence presented to the trial court raised an genuine issue as to when the entire improvement was \u201cfirst ... available for its intended use.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Fox. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-501; <em>Foy v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>316 Md. 418, 422, 559 A.2d 371, 373 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We conclude that the trial court was correct in determining that \u00a7 5-108(a) of the statute of repose applies to the instant cause of action. We find, however, that the trial court erred in its determination that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the 20-year period required by \u00a7 5-108(a) had passed prior to the time of Rose\u2019s injury. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO ABIDE THE FINAL RESULT.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">ELDRIDGE and BELL, JJ., concur in the result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-11\">.

In the context of actions for injuries arising out of an improvement to real property, the effect of the privity of contract doctrine was to deny recovery- to any person who did not have a contractual relationship with the party that designed or constructed the improvement. Beginning in the 1950\u2019s, courts around the country slowly began to make exceptions to the privity requirement and, in cases specifically dealing with claims against architects, contractors, and others in the construction process, courts rejected the \"privity of contract\u201d doctrine as a defense. <em>See generally Krieger v. J.E. Greiner Co., </em>282 Md. 50, 382 A.2d 1069 (1978). At about the same time, courts began to apply the \"discovery rule\u201d in cases involving improvements to real property. <em>See, e.g., Steelworkers Holding v. Menefee, </em>255 Md. 440, 258 A.2d 177 (1969) (malpractice action against architect); <em>Mattingly v. Hopkins, </em>254 Md. 88, 253 A.2d 904 (1969) (malpractice action against professional engineer). The discovery rule provides that the action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run not when the wrong actually occurs but rather when the plaintiff has in fact discovered that an injury has been suffered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury. <em>See generally Poffenberger v. Risser, </em>290 Md. 631, 431 A.2d 677 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\">.
