Furthermore, we hold that, in the context of reciprocally honoring another jurisdiction\u2019s suspension, due process requirements are satisfied when the trainer is promptly given written notice of the facts deemed to warrant the reciprocal ruling and is informed of the opportunity to be heard on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">This opinion involves two separate cases, and we set forth below the facts of each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">A. <em>No. HO, Maryland Racing Commission v. Castrenze</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Charles H. Castrenze, Jr., is licensed in Maryland and Delaware, as well as in other states, as a trainer of thoroughbred race horses. On June 30, 1990, Castrenze failed to arrange for the timely administration of Furosemide (Lasix) to a horse which he had entered in a Delaware race, resulting in a late scratch. Consequently, on July 2, 1990, the Delaware Stewards fined Castrenze one hundred dollars. When Castrenze failed to pay the fine or take an appeal after 20 days had elapsed, the Delaware Stewards suspended his trainer\u2019s license. A copy of the suspension notice was mailed to Castrenze from Delaware on July 23, 1990. On July 28, 1990, Castrenze paid the Delaware fine and was restored to good standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>On July 24, 1990, a horse trained by Castrenze was entered in the fourth race at the Laurel Race Course in Maryland. The horse, ELLOREE, won the race. Notice of Castrenze\u2019s Delaware suspension was published one day later in the <em>Daily Racing Form </em>of July 25, 1990. A competing trainer saw the publication and filed a protest with the Maryland Stewards on July 26, 1990, claiming that Castrenze had been ineligible to race ELLOREE in Maryland while under suspension in Delaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Thereafter, the Stewards gave Castrenze notice, and they conducted a hearing in the matter on August 4, 1990. After hearing testimony and reviewing the evidence, the Stewards determined that since \u201ctrainer Charles [H.] Castrenze was ineligible to participate in racing at Laurel Race Course on Tuesday, July 24, 1990,\u201d the horse ELLOREE was \u201cdisqualified from first position and placed last in the fourth race on Tuesday, July 24, 1990.\u201d Two Racing Commission regulations, when read together, provided the basis for the Stewards\u2019 determination. COMAR 09.10.01.48A provides for the Commission\u2019s recognition of a suspension issued by an authorized racing association in any other jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> COMAR 09.10.01.17(CC) provides that a horse managed by a disqualified person may not be entered in a race.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying these provisions, the Stewards disqualified ELLOREE from first position, placed ELLOREE last in the race, and ordered that the purse be redistributed according to the new order of finish.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Castrenze appealed the Stewards\u2019 decision to the Maryland Racing Commission, claiming that he had not been notified of his Delaware suspension, either by the Delaware racing authority or the Maryland Racing Commission, prior to the running of the race in Maryland. The Racing Commission held a de novo hearing on the matter on December 12, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Initially at the hearing, the testimony of the Commission\u2019s chief investigator established that Castrenze had been under a Delaware suspension when he raced ELLOREE in Maryland on July 24, 1990. The remainder of the testimony at the hearing centered on whether Castrenze received notice by the Delaware Stewards of their suspension in time to affect his decision to race in Maryland. One administrative Steward testified that, regardless of when the Delaware notification may have been sent, \u201c[t]he point [of Maryland\u2019s reciprocity ruling] was that a man is ruled off when the ruling is issued by the governing body.\u201d At the end of the hearing, the Racing Commission unanimously voted to uphold the Stewards\u2019 decision, informing Castrenze that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-j\">\u201c[t]he rule says a horse may not be qualified to be entered or to start in any race if owned in whole or in part or is under the management directly or indirectly of a disqualified person. There\u2019s no requirement as far as notice is concerned, and [Mr. Castrenze] we\u2019re sympathetic toward you ... but the rule states and it really binds the Commission---- [W]hen that horse ran you were disqualified whether or not you had notice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In its written Memorandum and Order issued on January 18, 1991, the Commission alternatively held that \u201c[t]rainer Charles H. Castrenze, Jr. was properly notified that he had been fined $100 by the Delaware Stewards on June 30, 1990, and that such fine must be paid within 48 hours of its imposition absent a timely appeal.\u201d The Commission further found that \u201c[t]rainer Castrenze raced the horse \u2018ELLOREE\u2019 in the fourth race at Laurel Race Course on July 24, 1990, while under suspension by the Delaware Racing Commission for failure to pay the fine.\u201d Taking into account only the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>of the Delaware suspension and the timing of the Maryland race, the Commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-4\">\u201cBy virtue of his suspension in Delaware and being denied the privileges of the grounds in Delaware, trainer Castrenze was, likewise, under a suspension and denied the privileges of the grounds of race tracks in Maryland. CO-MAR 09.10.01.48(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201c... On July 24, 1990, the horse \u2018ELLOREE\u2019 was under the management of trainer Castrenze, then a disqualified person, and, as a result, the horse was not qualified to start the fourth race at Laurel Race Course on that date. CO-MAR 09.10.01.17[ (CC) ].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Castrenze filed this action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The circuit court, framing the issue as \u201cwhether the Maryland Racing Commission may suspend the license of a horse trainer pursuant to its reciprocity regulations without first providing notice of such suspension and an opportunity to be heard,\u201d held that the action of the Racing Commission violated \u00a7 10-405 of the APA. In overruling the Racing Commission\u2019s decision, the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-7\">\u201cThe Racing Commission\u2019s application of its reciprocity regulation runs counter to the clear language of the statute requiring both notice and an opportunity for a hearing <em>prior </em>to the suspension of a license. Here Appellant was not provided with both notice and an opportunity to be heard until after July 24, 1990, the relevant date of suspension in Maryland. After first providing both notice and a hearing, the Racing Commission could have suspended Appellant as of the time of the initial hearing on August 4, 1990, but it could not suspend retroactively back to July 24, 1990.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJF\">The Racing Commission then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and, before consideration of the case by that court, we issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">B. <em>No. 11, Angelos v. Maryland Racing Commission</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABX\">Peter G. Angelos is the owner of WIN A GAME, a thoroughbred race horse. WIN A GAME won the seventh race at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>the Pimlico Race Course in Maryland on May 25, 1991. Subsequent to the running of the race, the Maryland Stewards discovered that the horse\u2019s trainer, John Battista Pizzurro, had been suspended effective May 25, 1991, at the Philadelphia Park racetrack in Pennsylvania,.for failure to pay a forty dollar jockey fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The Stewards notified Pizzurro to appear before them for a hearing. As in the <em>Castrense </em>ease, the Stewards applied the COMAR 09.10.01.48(A) reciprocity rule in conjunction with the eligibility rule in COMAR 09.10.01.17(CC), and determined that WIN A GAME had been ineligible to race in the seventh race on May 25, 1991, because at that time the horse\u2019s trainer was under suspension in Pennsylvania. They ordered WIN A GAME disqualified from the race and the purse redistributed among the qualified horses.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Angelos appealed to the Racing Commission from the Stewards\u2019 decision and was granted a hearing. The uncontradicted evidence at the hearing established that trainer Pizzurro had been under a suspension by another jurisdiction when he raced the winning horse in Maryland on May 25,1991. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Racing Commission unanimously affirmed, finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">\u201creciprocity is simply a matter of the full faith and the credit of another state ... it is not an issue we can revisit and examine when another state has suspended a licensee, ... reciprocity exists and we accept it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">The Commission reiterated this point in its written Memorandum and Order of August 16, 1991, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">\u201cFull faith and credit is to be given by the Maryland Racing Commission to a suspension issued by a foreign jurisdiction, and every person suspended or ruled off the course of a recognized racing association, such as Philadelphia Park, is also deemed to be ruled off in Maryland. COMAR 09.10.01.48(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-10\">\u201c... WIN A GAME\u2019 was under the management of trainer Pizzurro when he participated in the seventh race at Pimlico Race Course on May 25, 1991. In light of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>suspension issued by the Pennsylvania Stewards, trainer Pizzurro was a \u2018disqualified\u2019 person on May 25,1991, and, as such, \u2018WIN A GAME\u2019 was not qualified to start in the seventh race at Pimlico Race Course on May 25, 1991. COMAR 09.10.01.17(CC).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">\u201c... Neither the Maryland Stewards nor the Maryland Racing Commission is obligated or compelled to extend efforts to verify the propriety of proceedings conducted in a foreign jurisdiction that lead to a suspension, or to address collateral attacks made on the validity of the procedures utilized in the foreign jurisdiction that lead to a suspension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Angelos filed an action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The court affirmed the decision of the Racing Commission, stating: \u201cI can find no legal defect in their decision and as unfair as it is to the appellant in this case, the decision will have to stand.\u201d Angelos noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and, prior to any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. We granted the petition and ordered that this case be argued on the same day as the <em>Castrenze </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Pending the determination of these cases, the prize money from each contested race is being held in an interest-bearing escrow account pursuant to COMAR 09.10.01.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether the Racing Commission has standing to appeal the circuit court\u2019s reversal of its order in the <em>Castrenze </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Castrenze argues that \u201cthe [Racing] Commission has no right to appeal since it performed a purely quasi-judicial function.\u201d This argument is derived from <em>Zoning Appeals Board v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 199 A. 540 (1938), in which the Court took the position that, absent specific statutory authority, an administrative agency exercising a quasi-judicial function usually is not entitled to appeal from a circuit court judgment reversing the agency\u2019s decision. In recent years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>however, we have made it clear that the <em>McKinney </em>doctrine does not apply to all agencies or to all adjudicative administrative proceedings. <em>See Board v. Haberlin, </em>320 Md. 399, 404, 578 A.2d 215, 217 (1990); <em>Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Johnson, </em>320 Md. 91, 97, 576 A.2d 760, 763 (1990); <em>Department v. Bo Peep, </em>317 Md. 573, 584-585, 565 A.2d 1015, 1020 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1067, 110 S.Ct. 1784, 108 L.Ed.2d 786 (1990); <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lindsay, </em>309 Md. 557, 561, 525 A.2d 1051, 1053 (1987); <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., </em>304 Md. 731, 742-746, 501 A.2d 48, 54 (1985); <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Carroll Co. v. Gross, </em>301 Md. 473, 477-481, 483 A.2d 755, 757-759 (1984). We have taken the position that, under the general statutory authorizations for appeal, agencies are entitled to appeal from adverse circuit court judgments where the functions of the agencies \u201c \u2018are so identified with the execution of some definite public policy as the representative of the State, that their participation in litigation affecting their decisions is regarded by the Legislature as essential to the adequate protection of the State\u2019s interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., supra, </em>304 Md. at 743, 501 A.2d at 54, quoting <em>McKinney, supra, </em>174 Md. at 561, 199 A. at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The Racing Commission is not simply an adjudicatory agency. Rather, the Commission performs an active role of policy formation in order to ensure the integrity of horse racing in this State. \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s purpose in granting to the Racing Commission the authority to promulgate rules was to assure that horse races in Maryland are \u2018conducted fairly, decently and clean[ly].\u2019 <em>\u201d Heft v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>323 Md. 257, 263-264, 592 A.2d 1110, 1113 (1991), quoting <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 84, 48 A.2d 600, 602 (1946). The sport of horse racing exists \u201conly beea\u00fcse it is financed by the receipts from controlled legalized gambling which must be kept as far above suspicion as possible.\u201d <em>Jacobson v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>261 Md. 180, 183, 274 A.2d 102, 103 (1971). <em>See also Maryland Racing Comm. v. McGee, </em>212 Md. 69, 76, 128 A.2d 419, 423 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The Racing Commission is given broad statutory authority to adopt regulations governing horse racing and betting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>racing in Maryland. Code (1992), \u00a7 ll-210(a)(l) of the Business Regulation Article. It may investigate any office, track, or place of business of a licensee to ensure that the regulations of the Racing Commission are strictly complied with. \u00a7 11-211(a)(1). The Racing Commission has the power to require that an employee or official of a licensee be removed from the job. \u00a7 11\u2014211(b). It may maintain a testing laboratory. \u00a7 ll-212(a). Each of these provisions \u201cis addressed to protecting the integrity and honesty of betting for the public.\u201d <em>Silbert v. Ramsey, </em>301 Md. 96, 106, 482 A.2d 147, 152 (1984). Like the racing commissions in sister racing jurisdictions, the Maryland Racing Commission \u201cis charged with the duty of protecting substantial public interest and is therefore a representative of this interest in all proceedings.\u201d <em>Kentucky State Racing Commission v. Fuller, </em>481 S.W.2d 298, 301 (Ky.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">In <em>Consumer Protection v. Consumer Pub., supra, </em>304 Md. at 746, 501 A.2d at 56, we stated that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aja\">\u201cConsumer Protection Division exercises a broad range of functions including rulemaking, investigating and prosecuting alleged violators of the statute.... The functions of the Division are closely \u2018identified with the execution of ... public policy as the representative of the state.\u2019 <em>McKinney, supra, </em>174 Md. at 561, 199 A. 540. With its many different functions, its mandate to protect consumers and its role as a representative of the interests of the State, the Division is not the type of agency to which the rationale of <em>McKinney </em>applies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The same statement is equally applicable to the Maryland Racing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">For the above reasons, we hold that the Racing Commission has standing to maintain this appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Both Castrenze and Angelos argue that, in applying COMAR 09.10.10.48A, the Maryland Racing Commission retroactively suspended the trainers\u2019 licenses, with the effectiveness of the suspensions being prior to the time of notice and the opportunity to be heard. They contend that such agency action violates the procedural safeguards provided for in Code (1984, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-405(a) of the State Government Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In its arguments to this Court, the Racing Commission seems to take somewhat inconsistent positions. The Commission first appears to dispute the characterization of COMAR 09.10.01.48A as effecting retroactive license suspensions, reasoning instead in the <em>Castrenze </em>case that \u201c[t]he Commission (and its Stewards) merely honored a suspension imposed in <em>Delaware </em>by invoking Maryland reciprocity provisions,\u201d and similarly, in the <em>Angelos </em>case, that \u201cthe Stewards and the Commission merely honored, through a reciprocity regulation, the sanction imposed on Pizzurro in Pennsylvania, the effect of which was the disqualification of the horse trained by Pizzurro.\u201d At the same time, however, the Commission maintains that there was complete compliance with \u00a7 10-405(a), which is applicable only when a Maryland administrative unit takes action \u201cto revoke or suspend a license.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">We agree with Castrenze and Angelos that, by enacting \u00a7 10-405(a), the General Assembly intended that an adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>trative agency could not suspend a license without first giving the licensee written notice of the facts that warrant suspension and an opportunity to be heard in the matter. Under the plain language of \u00a7 10-405(a), the notice and opportunity for a hearing must occur \u201cfirst,\u201d prior to the effective date of any suspension. Clearly then, \u00a7 10-405(a)\u2019s procedural requirements would apply if, in honoring a license suspension issued by another racing jurisdiction, the Maryland Racing Commission\u2019s action is deemed to constitute a \u201csuspension\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-405(a). Under that view, the Racing Commission would be prohibited from retroactively dating its own suspension to the time of the race, which was prior to the date when the trainer was notified and informed of the opportunity to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Nevertheless, as we view \u00a7 10-405 and COMAR 09.10.01.-48A, application of the reciprocity regulation does not constitute a \u201csuspension\u201d by the Maryland Racing Commission within the meaning of \u00a7 10-405. Rather, it was by operation of law, and not by any agency action under \u00a7 10-405, that both trainers were ruled off of Maryland\u2019s race courses. The only suspensions rendered were by the Delaware and Pennsylvania authorities. COMAR 09.10.01.48A automatically required that the Delaware and Pennsylvania suspensions be given effect in Maryland.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">In requiring that an administrative agency grant written notice of the facts warranting a suspension and an opportunity to be heard on the matter, \u00a7 10-405(a) contemplates a procedure under which a licensee may have the charges fully tried. <em>See </em>2 F. Cooper, <em>State Administrative Law </em>495 (1965). Such a scheme necessarily contemplates factual findings by the agency concerning the licensee\u2019s underlying conduct. As CO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>MAR 09.10.01.48A is worded and applied by the Maryland racing authorities, however, the regulation leaves no room for factual findings regarding the nature of the licensee\u2019s conduct and whether that conduct warrants a suspension. The provision flatly states that where a person is suspended or ruled off by any recognized racing association, that person is likewise ruled off in Maryland. The regulation does not state that a foreign suspension is merely to be taken into account in determining whether to effect a suspension in Maryland. <em>Compare </em>COMAR 09.10.01.48A <em>with </em>COMAR 09.10.01.48B (\u201cDenial of a license by the racing commission of any other jurisdiction may be considered as grounds for denial of a license by the Commission\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Furthermore, it is clear from the administrative record that the scope of the pertinent inquiry at the Commission\u2019s hearings encompassed only those events triggering application of the COMAR 09.10.01.48A reciprocity provision, and did not include inquiries into the underlying facts or conduct or consideration of mitigating circumstances.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> COMAR 09.10.01.48A is fully self-executing, allowing for complete reciprocity in enforcement among racing states. By applying the reciprocity regulation, the Maryland Racing Commission did not suspend the trainers. Rather, the trainers were suspended by Delaware and Pennsylvania authorities, and those suspensions were effective in Maryland by operation of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Consequently, these cases do not involve suspensions of licenses, by a Maryland administrative agency, which are subject to \u00a7 10-405(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">Our holding that the Racing Commission\u2019s application of COMAR 09.10.01.48A does not implicate \u00a7 10-405(a) of the State Government Article does not mean that the trainers had absolutely no right to notice and the opportunity to be heard. Indeed, the trainers were entitled under due process principles to the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 1191, 14 L.Ed.2d 62, 66 (1965). We cannot agree with the contention by Castrenze and Angelos, however, that due process required notice and a hearing in Maryland prior to the effective period of the reciprocal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Neither the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment nor Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights requires in every instance notice and a hearing before the rules of an administrative agency may be enforced against a licensee. As has often been stated, \u201c[d]ue process does not require adherence to any particular procedure.

Balanced against that interest, however, is the State\u2019s own interest in ensuring the integrity of racing. <em>See Barry v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Barchi </em>443 U.S. 55, 65, 99 S.Ct. 2642, 2649, 61 L.Ed.2d 365, 375 (1979) (balancing a horse trainer\u2019s property interest against the state\u2019s interest in \u201cpreserving the integrity of the sport and in protecting the public from harm\u201d and holding that due process does not require an evidentiary hearing prior to the effectuation of the trainer\u2019s suspension); <em>Silbert v. Ramsey, supra, </em>301 Md. at 109, 482 A.2d at 154, quoting <em>Jacobson v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>261 Md. at 183, 274 A.2d at 103 (\u201chorse racing is an endeavor and undertaking that necessarily must be the subject of intensive, extensive and minute regulation\u201d); <em>Maryland Racing Commission v.

Under the terms of the reciprocity regulation, the Maryland hearing would seem to be limited to determining whether the trainer was the same person who was subject to the action in the other state, whether the other state in fact suspended the trainer, and the period of the suspension. Presumably an issue could be raised concerning the fundamental jurisdiction of the out-of-state suspending agency. In the instant cases, there were no disputes about any of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">By granting a hearing promptly after the reciprocal actions went into effect, and considering the limited scope of the issues at the hearing, the Maryland Racing Commission gave both trainers the process that was due. <em>See Barry v.

Neither Castrenze nor Angelos contends that the COMAR 09.10.01.-48A reciprocity regulation is invalid.

[Clourts must affirm a legislative rule as long as it represents a valid exercise of agency authority\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b399-6\">BELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Af3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Once the Maryland Racing Commission\u2019s right to appeal has been determined, with the resolution of which, in this case, I am in full agreement, the issue in this case becomes one involving determining how the Commission\u2019s actions in applying COMAR 09.10.01.48A should be characterized\u2014deciding its substantive effect\u2014and that, in turn, implicates the relationship between that regulation and Maryland Code (1984, 1993 RepLVol.) \u00a7 10-405(a) of the State Government Article. This case is not about whether it is good policy to have full reciprocity among racing states or how best to achieve a system that optimally advances the purpose of effectively and properly regulating racing. If these were the issues, then, in all probability, the result would be different. If the act of applying the regulation constitutes, or is tantamount to, a suspension of the trainer in Maryland, it was incumbent upon the Commission to comply with \u00a7 10-405(a), before forfeiting the purse earned by the horse trained by a suspended trainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">There is no doubt but that the intent and the effect of the regulation is to disqualify a trainer who has been suspended in another state from participating in racing in this state. To \u201cdisqualify\u201d is \u201c[t]o divest or deprive of qualification: to incapacitate; to render ineligible or unfit.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 924 (5th ed. 1979). The Maryland Racing Commission does not adjudicate the underlying suspension on the merits; it is required only to apply\u2014give effect to\u2014the statute. In fact, without some action taken in Maryland by a Maryland agency, effect could not be given to the extra\u2014Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>suspension\u2014there could be no disqualification of the trainer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, as these cases graphically demonstrate, when the Maryland Racing Commission does not discover in advance of the race won by a horse that the suspended trainer trained, because the relationship between trainer and horse renders the horse disqualified, <em>see </em>COMAR 09.10.01.17(cc), the further consequence of applying the regulation is that any purse that the horse wins must be forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The majority holds that \u201capplication of the reciprocity regulation does not constitute a \u2018suspension\u2019 by the Maryland Racing Commission within the meaning of \u00a7 10.405.\u201d 335 Md. at 296-297, 643 A.2d at 418. It reasons that the regulation requires that suspensions ordered by other states be given effect in Maryland. That effect is accomplished by operation of law, not by agency action, <em>id. </em>at 297, 643 A.2d at 418, and certainly not by application of \u00a7 10-405(a). Because, the majority says, \u00a7 10-405(a) \u201ccontemplates a procedure under which a licensee may have the charges fully tried,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 643 A.2d at 418, citing <em>Cooper, </em>State Administrative Law 94 (1965), and the regulation, as worded and applied by the Commission, precludes factual findings relating to the underlying conduct, and, instead, in this case, \u201cencompassed only those events triggering application of COMAR 09.10.01.48(a) reciprocity provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 643 A.2d at 418. The majority also finds significance in the fact that the regulation does not identify a foreign suspension as a factor to be taken into account in determining the effect of a suspension in Maryland. It concludes by reiterating that the trainers were suspended in other states and their suspensions were simply made effective in Maryland by operation of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">I cannot agree. The essential nature of the act of applying the regulation cannot be changed simply by refusing to call that act what it actually is. The effect of applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>reciprocity provision is to suspend the trainer in Maryland just as effectively as the agency action does in the other state. Characterizing it as being different does not make it so. The consequence, in other words, of applying the regulation is the exact same in this State, as it is in the State in which the suspension is recognized as a suspension. As Shakespeare put it: \u201cThat which we call a rose[, b]y any other name would smell as sweet.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">To be sure, a state may, without offending due process, give effect, in that state, to a suspension ordered in another state. It could do so, I suppose, by administrative regulation promulgated by the agency charged with regulating the activity at issue, as was done in the case <em>sub judice. </em>When, however, that state\u2019s legislature has provided, by statute, the procedural condition precedent to suspension, resort to that option has been foreclosed; while, in the absence of a procedural statute, reciprocity may be given effect as a matter of law, enactment of a procedural statute evidences a legislative intent to the contrary. That is precisely what has occurred in this case. Section 10-405(a) requires notice and a hearing prior to ordering a suspension. Giving effect in Maryland to a suspension ordered in another State, as I have indicated and shown, is to order a suspension in Maryland. Because \u00a7 10-405(a) is clear and unambiguous as to the procedural prerequisites for suspension, it must follow that, unless the regulation trumps the statute, the trainer\u2019s suspension was not effective in Maryland until those prerequisites were met. That being the case, forfeiture of the purses was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">There is nothing in \u00a7 10-405(a) which suggests, not to mention says, that, to be effective, factual findings by the subject agency must concern the underlying conduct. That section merely requires \u201cwritten notice of the <em>facts </em>that warrant suspension or revocation.\u201d (emphasis added) The evidence from which the facts are to be determined is defined by COMAR 09.10.01.48A. Thus, as the majority recognizes when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>addressing the due process requirement, a trainer receives all of the process that he or she is due when he or she is notified, in writing, of the fact of the suspension in the other State and is given the opportunity to be heard in this State. As I see it, the only requirement that needs to be added in order for there to be complete compliance with \u00a7 10-405(a) is that the notification occur prior to the trainer being declared disqualified in Maryland. If it is deemed that this statutory overlay somehow undermines the efficient and proper working of the Maryland Racing Commission, then it is to the Legislature that complaint should be addressed. In the context of a reciprocal suspension, then, the \u201cfacts\u201d that warrant suspension are those which pertain to the <em>fact </em>of suspension in the other State. There need be no further amplification.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">To summarize, the regulation authorizes the Commission to declare any trainer or other person suspended in another state off-track in Maryland. Despite its unqualified language, the regulation must be read in conjunction with the statute. The statute requires that, in order for a suspension to be effective, the affected person must first be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. This scheme is clear and unambiguous and easy to administer. Ordinarily, it also will avoid the situation <em>sub judice. </em>When the Commission discovers that a trainer with a horse slated to race in Maryland is off-track in another state, it will notify that trainer prior to the race and, if necessary, conduct a hearing. On the other hand, if the Commission fails to discover the suspension pre-race and, therefore, does not declare the suspended trainer off-track in Maryland prior to the race, it may not forfeit the purse if that horse wins. The onus is on the Commission to discover whether, and when, trainers are suspended and to act in advance of the race. This is implicit in the statute\u2019s requirement of a hearing, after notice. The Commission\u2019s failure to so act should not, as the majority opinion contemplates and permits, inure to the detriment of an affected trainer. Certainly the Maryland Racing Commission may not be relieved, by regulation, of its obligation to police, in advance, those who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>participate in Maryland racing, when the Maryland Legislature has, by statute, prescribed otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">. I agree with the majority that, for reciprocity purposes, \u201cdue process requirements are satisfied when the trainer is promptly given written notice of the facts deemed to warrant the reciprocal ruling and is informed of the opportunity to be heard on the matter.\" Majority opinion, 335 Md. at 288, 643 A.2d at 414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">.
