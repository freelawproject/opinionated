Anthony and Frank H. Clark, requires us to determine whether an orphans\u2019 court order which dismissed Clark\u2019s petition to caveat a will, which, after judicial probate proceedings, had been accepted by the orphans\u2019 court as the last will and testament of the decedent, was a final judgment within the meaning of Maryland Code (1974,1989 RepLVol.) \u00a7 12\u2014101(f) of the Courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We shall hold, contrary to the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals, that it was and, therefore, consistent with \u00a7 12-502(b),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> an appeal of that order should have been taken within thirty days of its entry. Accordingly, we shall reverse. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding was that, because the orphans\u2019 court granted a motion to reconsider the dismissal order and, in fact, did reconsider it, the subsequent order reaffirming dismissal of the petition to caveat was the final judgment from which an appeal lay, notwithstanding that the orphans\u2019 court did not change the prior order in any manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The relevant facts are straightforward and largely not in dispute. The decedent died leaving two survivors, Frank H. Clark, the respondent, and Barbara F. Anthony (\u201cAnthony\u201d). Approximately four months after the decedent\u2019s death, the respondent filed for probate with the Register of Wills for Frederick County, Maryland, a will executed by the decedent on November 18, 1974, which left everything to him. By administrative probate order, that will was admitted to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>bate and the respondent was appointed personal representative of the estate. Subsequently, Anthony filed a Petition For Judicial Probate And To Caveat A Will. With that petition, she filed a will, dated November 27, 1981, and a codicil, dated January 14, 1984, which she requested to be judicially probated. The later will divided the estate equally between the survivors and named Anthony as personal representative. The respondent answered the petition, denying all allegations except the fact of the decedent\u2019s death and the lack of other pending proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">Anthony filed an Amended Petition For Judicial Probate, in which she withdrew her request to caveat the earlier will. The respondent\u2019s answer to the amended petition denied all pertinent allegations related to judicial probate, thus contesting the petition. Following a judicial probate hearing on August 28, 1991, the orphans\u2019 court, on September 11, 1991, ordered that the 1981 will and codicil be accepted as \u201cthe valid last Will and Testament of the decedent\u201d and that Anthony be \u201cappointed as personal representative for the above estate, and the appointment of Frank Howard Clark as personal representative is hereby revoked.\u201d The respondent did not appeal that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">On October 4, 1991, the respondent filed a Petition to Caveat, in which he raised as to the 1981 will and codicil thereto, issues of undue influence, testamentary capacity, and the genuineness of the decedent\u2019s signature. Anthony, as personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate and an interested party, moved, on October 22, 1991, to dismiss the petition to caveat. As grounds, she proffered that the issues raised had been heard and decided in the judicial probate proceedings and consequently, were barred by res judicata and/or collateral estoppel. The orphans\u2019 court agreed; by order dated November 4, 1991, the court granted Anthony\u2019s motion to dismiss. The docket entries for that day read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">November 4 Motion to dismiss petition to caveat and order</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">November 4 Certificate of Service by Register of Wills</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The respondent filed his answer to Anthony\u2019s motion to dismiss on November 5, 1991. In addition to maintaining that issues he raised were not decided by the judicial probate, he argued that the judicial probate order was not final. He relied on Maryland Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Yol.) \u00a7\u00a7 5-406 and 5-207 of the Estates and Trusts Article.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Two days later, having received the November 4 order, he filed a Motion For Appropriate Relief, in which he asked the orphans\u2019 court to dismiss it. Noting that the order had been signed within the 20 day period which Maryland Rule 6-122<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> allows for \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>interested person ... to file a response to ... a Motion [To Dismiss],\u201d he asked the court to hold a hearing on the issues raised in his caveat petition. By order dated November 27, 1991, treating the respondent\u2019s answer as a \u201cmotion to reconsider\u201d and citing its \u201cadditional consideration of the Answer to Motion to Dismiss, and of the testimony elicited at the hearing,\u201d the orphans\u2019 court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">re-affirm[ed] its dismissal of the Petition to Caveat, finding that testimony was given at the time of judicial probate to satisfy the Court as to decedent\u2019s testamentary capacity and absence of undue influence. To relitigate these issues would only serve to rehear issues this Court has already heard and decided, and would not be an economical use of the Court\u2019s time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The respondent\u2019s appeal, which was filed on December 17, 1991, was dismissed, on Anthony\u2019s motion, by the Circuit Court for Frederick County. Anthony had argued that the November 4, 1991 order was a final order from which an appeal should have been noted within 30 days of its entry. The respondent appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in an unreported opinion, reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>soned that because the orphans court reconsidered and reaffirmed its decision to dismiss, \u201cthe re-affirmance constituted a final appealable decision dismissing appellant\u2019s caveat petition and was properly recorded on the docket by the Register of Wills.\u201d Slip op. at 6. It was not, the court reasoned, a mere denial of a motion for reconsideration. At Anthony\u2019s behest, we granted certiorari to consider this important issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">For an appellate court to acquire subject matter jurisdiction, an appeal ordinarily must be from a final judgment or an appealable interlocutory order. <em>See Estep v. Georgetown Leather, </em>320 Md. 277, 282, 577 A.2d 78, 80 (1990). This is also true of appeals from orders of orphans\u2019 courts. <em>See \u00a7\u00a7 </em>12-501 and 12-502. Section 12-101(f) defines \u201cfinal judgment.\u201d It does not specify, however, the elements of finality, leaving that ultimate determination to this Court. <em>Baltimore City Department of Social Services v. Stein, </em>328 Md. 1, 9, 612 A.2d 880, 884 (1992); <em>Public Service Commission v. Patuxent Valley, </em>300 Md. 200, 206, 477 A.2d 759, 762 (1984); <em>Sigma Repro. Health Center v. State, </em>297 Md. 660, 664-66, 467 A.2d 483, 484-486 (1983). We have determined that a judgment is final that is \u201cso far final as to determine and conclude the rights involved in the action, <em>or </em>to deny to the party seeking redress by the appeal the means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u201d <em>In Re Buckler Trusts, </em>144 Md. 424, 427, 125 A. 177, 178 (1924) (emphasis added). <em>See also Stein, </em>328 Md. at 10, 612 A.2d at 884; <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767, 773-74 (1989); <em>Sigma Repro. Health Center, </em>297 Md. at 665, 467 A.2d at 48. The rationale underlying the use of the disjunctive in that determination was explained in <em>Horsey v. Horsey, </em>329 Md. 392, 401-02, 620 A.2d 305, 310 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">[A] trial court\u2019s order sometimes may constitute a final appealable judgment even though the order fails to settle the underlying dispute between the parties. Where a trial court\u2019s order has \u201cthe effect of putting the parties out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>court, [it] is a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>305 Md. 407, 412, 504 A.2d 1145, 1148 (1986), and cases there cited. <em>See, e.g., Wilde v. Swanson, </em>314 Md. 80, 85, 548 A.2d 837, 839 (1988) (\u201can order of a circuit court ... [may be] a final judgment without any adjudication by the circuit court on the merits\u201d); <em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 275, 533 A.2d 1300, 1301-02 (1987) (trial court\u2019s order \u201cterminating the litigation in that court\u201d was a final judgment); <em>Walbert v. Walbert, </em>310 Md. 657, 661, 531 A.2d 291, 293 (1987) (circuit court\u2019s unqualified order was a final judgment because it \u201cput Denise Walbert out of court, denying her the means of further prosecuting the case at the trial level\u201d); <em>Houghton v. County Comm\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 221, 513 A.2d 291, 293 (1986); <em>Concannon v. State Roads Commission, </em>230 Md. 118, 125, 186 A.2d 220, 224-225 (1962), and cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\"><em>See also Schlossberg v. Schlossberg, </em>275 Md. 600, 612, 343 A.2d 234, 242 (1975), rejecting, as applicable to an orphans\u2019 court\u2019s judgment or order the requirement that it \u201cfinally settles some disputed right or interest of the parties\u201d or be \u201cso far final as to determine and conclude the rights involved in the action\u201d (quoting <em>Brooks v. Sprague, </em>157 Md. 160, 164, 145 A. 375, 377 (1929) and <em>In Re Buckler Trusts, </em>144 Md. at 427, 125 A. at 178). Moreover, the judgment must be intended as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy. <em>Sisk &amp; Son v. Friendship Packers, </em>326 Md. 152, 159, 604 A.2d 69, 72 (1992); <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d at 773-74. Finally, the judgment must be entered on the docket. <em>Estep, </em>320 Md. at 280-81, 577 A.2d at 79; <em>Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. at 41, 566 A.2d at 773; <em>Doehring v. Wagner, </em>311 Md. 272, 274-75, 533 A.2d 1300, 1301 (1987). <em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 6-171(b) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\"><em>(b) Entry by </em>Register.\u2014The register shall enter an order or judgment by making a record of it in writing on the file jacket, or on a docket within the file, or in a docket book, according to the practice of each court, and shall record the actual date of the entry. That date shall be the date of the order or judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number><em>See also </em>Maryland Rule 2-601, applicable to circuit courts, to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">It is well settled, and this Court has consistently held, that orders dismissing, or granting motions to dismiss a plaintiffs entire initial pleading are final and appealable. <em>See Houghton, </em>307 Md. at 221-223, 513 A.2d at 293-94, and cases there cited. Of course, the order must otherwise meet the criteria of final judgments, that is to say, it must also be entered on the court\u2019s docket. <em>See </em>Rule 6~171(b). <em>See also Bradley v. Bradley, </em>119 Md. 645, 650-52, 87 A. 390, 392-93 (1913) (appeal allowed from orphans\u2019 court judgment dismissing caveat). It is not necessary that the docket entry, to be effective, use the term \u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201cfinal judgment\u201d. <em>See Stein, </em>328 Md. at 13, 612 A.2d at 886; <em>Houghton, </em>305 Md. at 412-13, 504 A.2d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">The November 4th order certainly has the appearance of finality. By disposing completely of the respondent\u2019s petition to caveat, it puts the respondent out of court, denying to him the means further to pursue that proceeding in the orphans\u2019 court. Furthermore, the terms of the order do not undermine its finality; from its terms, it would appear that the dismissal was intended to be the final disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The respondent argues that the final prerequisite for a final judgment has not been met, <em>i.e., </em>a proper record was not made of it in accordance with Maryland Rule 6-171. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">The docket entries for November 4, as we have seen, noted \u201cMotion To Dismiss Petition To Caveat and Order.\u201d The circuit court certainly found that notation to be a sufficient record of the judgment. The Court of Special Appeals, too, was of the view that the \u201cnotation ... was sufficient to indicate that [an] order had been issued in connection with the motion to dismiss the petition to caveat\u201d slip op. at 10; it \u201cindicates that the order was made in conjunction with the motion to dismiss and therefore sufficiently designates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>order.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10-11. To reach this conclusion, the intermediate appellate court, noting that the respondent not having claimed to be without notice of the order, construed the respondent\u2019s argument to be \u201cthat the error in docketing both the motion and the order on the date the court signed the order precludes the order from being a final judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The respondent argues in this Court, as, in truth, he argued below, that a docket entry that does not reveal the court\u2019s disposition of a motion to dismiss, or that is ambiguous as to whether any order has issued, fails to reflect the court\u2019s order and, therefore, cannot be final. For support, he directs our attention to <em>Estep, supra, </em>320 Md. at 287, 577 A.2d at 82, in which this Court, construing Maryland Rule 2\u2014601(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the circuit court equivalent of Maryland Rule 6-171, noted the requirement of \u201ca simple docket entry which would make clear to everyone the disposition of each and every claim in the case,\u201d and <em>Rohrbeck, supra, </em>318 Md. at 46, 566 A.2d at 776, in which we said that an order which confirms that decisions were made as to the listed matters, but ... gives no clue as to what those decisions were\u201d does not comply with Md. Rule 2-601(b). According to the respondent, to be sufficient, the docket entry has to state precisely what the court\u2019s ruling was, not simply reflect that a ruling was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Neither <em>Estep </em>nor <em>Rohrbeck </em>involves the situation presented <em>sub judice; </em>in neither was the judgment the dismissal of a plaintiffs initial pleading, and, hence, cause of action. In <em>Estep, </em>the issue was whether, in determining finality, the court could consider the viability of a claim that had not formally been disposed of. We answered \u201cno,\u201d in the process, pointing out, what we said in <em>Doehring, </em>311 Md. at 274-75, 533 A.2d at 1301:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>[W]hen a trial court makes a ruling which \u201cin substance does finally terminate that case in that court,\u201d an appeal could still not be taken until \u201cthat ruling becomes embodied in whatever <em>formal </em>action is necessary to constitute a final judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\"><em>Estep, </em>320 Md. at 284, 577 A.2d at 81. Although we noted that \u201c[t]he value of a simple docket entry which would make clear to everyone the disposition of each and every claim in a case cannot be overemphasized,\u201d we pointedly did not attempt to define what that docket entry should say.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In <em>Rohrbeck, </em>the trial judge announced her decision in open court, directing the clerk \u201cto enter judgment when I get to these because this is going to be the final judgment in the case with the one exception, and that is the extent there are quadros [QDRO\u2019S],\u201d 318 Md. at 37, 566 A.2d at 772, as to which she wanted the parties to submit an order on which they had agreed. The docket entry actually made was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAA\">JUDGMENT ENTERED AS TO CUSTODY, HEALTH, INSURANCE, MARITAL AND PERSONAL PROPER-. TY, SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, ALIMONY, CHILD SUPPORT, MONETARY AWARD, PENSION PLANS AND ATTORNEYS FEES. ORDER TO BE SUBMITTED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 39, 566 A.2d at 772-73. The order was not submitted within 30 days. When proposed orders were submitted, the trial judge signed an order declining, on jurisdictional grounds, to consider any of them. We held that, because not intended as the final determination and conclusion of the rights involved, the rulings reflected in the docket entry were not final, As pertinent to the issue <em>sub judice, </em>however, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">The docket entry of July 13, 1988, does not reflect the recording of a judgment \u201cas directed by the court.\u201d It confirms that decisions were made as to the listed matters, but it gives no clue as to what those decisions were. Nor, as we have said, was there any other document in the court file that would have supplied that critical information. Although Judge Bell evidently assumed that the clerk would, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>in some way, summarize and record the substance of the rulings she was announcing, that is not what, in fact, happened. For that reason as well, then, the July 13 rulings did not constitute a judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 46, 566 A.2d at 776 (footnote omitted). In the omitted footnote, we observed, \u201cThe extemporaneous recitation of multiple or complex rulings from the bench may be f\u00edne for letting the parties and their attorneys know what the court\u2019s decision is in the case, but because it is the actual judgment that will govern the conduct, fortunes, and affairs of the parties, the court must be especially careful that the judgment itself is clear, complete, and precise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46 n. 7, 566 A.2d at 776 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Although a docket entry is required, <em>see </em>Rule 6-171(b), it is not necessary in an orphans\u2019 court for that entry to summarize the written order; in an orphans\u2019 court, it is sufficient if the docket entry reflects that an order was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Prior to January 1, 1991, there were no rules of this Court applicable to orphans\u2019 courts, and there was no statewide requirement for the entry of \u201can order or judgment by making a record of it in writing on the file jacket, or on a docket within the file, or in a docket book, according to the practice of each court----\u201d Rule 6-171 (b). Such rules, including Rule 6-171, were proposed in the One Hundredth Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, submitted to the Court on March 9,1988. They were adopted by the Court on June 28, 1990, to be effective January 1, 1991.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The general objectives of the Rules were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">1. To create a uniform practice and procedure before the Orphans\u2019 Courts and registers of wills of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">2. To construct a set of rules that can be easily administered by the orphans\u2019 courts and registers of wills and understood by lay persons as well as by lawyers....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>3. To provide standard forms, incorporated in the appropriate Rule, to be used in the administration of all estates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">4. To give as much notice as possible to interested persons, consistent with the nature of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">One Hundredth Report at 1-2. The supplement contains the recommendation that the Title 2 Rules not apply, as a blanket matter, in orphans\u2019 courts, it being deemed advisable, in the interest of simplicity and efficiency, to limit their applicability to specific instances in which advance notice of their intended use has been given to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Rule 6-171 was patterned after Rule 2-601. The rules are not identical, however, and there is reason to believe that they were not intended to be interpreted identically. As originally proposed, Rule 6-171 consisted of only what was to become subsection (b). To achieve \u201csome greater clarity\u201d, proposed Rule 6-171 was combined with proposed Rule 6-462, the latter becoming subsection (a). <em>See </em>Supplement to the One Hundredth Report. Thus, Rule 6-171, as finally adopted, consisted of but two subsections; Rule 2-601, on the other hand, consists of three. Rule 6-171(b) is broader than Rule 2-601(b); unlike Rule 2-601, Rule 6-171 applies to all orphans\u2019 court orders, including judgments. Further, there is no orphans\u2019 court counterpart to Rule 2-601(c) which requires that, after its entry on the docket, a circuit court civil judgment, \u201cexcept a judgment denying all relief without costs,\u201d also be recorded and indexed \u201cin the judgment records of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Were Rule 2-601 applicable to this case, it would be necessary to determine with what specificity the clerk is required to make the docket entry of a dismissal of a claim. Because, however, Rule 6-171 is involved that is not required. Rule 6\u2014171(b), we hold, simply requires that it be noted on the docket in an orphans\u2019 court that an order has been filed relative to some previously filed paper; the register need not describe on the docket the orphans\u2019 court action reflected in the order. Rule 6-171(b) was not intended to require the clerical staffs of the registers of wills to digest and then to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>reproduce on the docket the terms of all orders generated by the orphans\u2019 courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">With but a handful of exceptions, orphans\u2019 court judges are lay persons who serve part time in their judicial capacities. They cannot be expected to supervise the clerical staffs of the registers of wills in digesting or describing orders. Furthermore, the registers of wills\u2019 clerical personnel do not have the same opportunity or necessity for acquiring that skill. There ordinarily are no oral orders in orphans\u2019 court-orphans\u2019 court rulings usually are not dictated to a court reporter. There are no jury verdicts announced in open court, which must be interpreted and then noted on the docket. Instead, in orphans\u2019 courts, an order is a paper writing that is filed in the estate file. Rule 6-171 contemplates that interested persons will read that writing. The purpose of the docket is simply to alert the interested person that an order has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Whether the November 4 order is a final judgment also turns, in part, on the effect of the November 27 order, whether it constituted a grant or a denial of a motion to reconsider the November 4 order. If the former, then it may be possible that the November 4 order could lose its finality; if the latter, it could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">In the absence of an order staying its effect, <em>see Hanley v. Stulman, </em>216 Md. 461, 467, 141 A.2d 167, 170 (1958), or a rule, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 8-202(c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> neither a judgment\u2019s finality, nor the running of the time for appeal is affected by the filing, or the denial, of a motion addressed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the reviewing power of the court, <em>e.g., </em>motion to set aside, modify or reconsider a judgment. <em>See Unnamed Atty. v. Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 484, 494 A.2d 940, 946 (1985). These principles are fully applicable to orphans\u2019 court proceedings. <em>Thomason v. Bucher, </em>266 Md. 1, 5-6, 291 A.2d 437, 439 (1972). In that case, we offered the rationale for the rule. After noting the desirability of prompt settlement and distribution of estates, 266 Md. at 4-5, 291 A.2d at 439, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">There is foundation neither in law nor policy for appellant\u2019s contention that the filing of a motion for reconsideration extended the appeal period so that a new thirty-day period commenced on June 11, 1971 and that yet another thirty-day period began to run on July 28, 1971, when the Orphans\u2019 Court granted appellee\u2019s motion ne recipiatur to the revised first account. The fact that each move by the appellant challenging an adverse decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court was made within thirty days of the court\u2019s decision is immaterial, except to illustrate the evil which the statute seeks to avoid. To allow the period for the running of the appeal to be extended <em>ad infinitum </em>by the filing of one motion or petition after another\u2014all in essence attacking the same decision\u2014would be the antithesis of prompt and orderly settlement of estates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Although the filing or denial of a motion for reconsideration does not extend the time for appeal, the \u201cgrant\u201d of the motion may. That will occur if the court also revises, or somehow changes, the judgment. <em>See Gluckstern v. Sutton, </em>319 Md. 634, 651, 574 A.2d 898, 906 (1990); <em>Yarema v. Exxon Corp., </em>305 Md. 219, 240-241, 503 A.2d 239, 250 (1986); <em>Unnamed Atty. v. Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 484, 494 A.2d 940, 946 (1985); <em>Brown v. Baer, </em>291 Md. 377, 387, 435 A.2d 96, 101 (1981). The rule was stated in <em>Yarema:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQB\">\u201cwhen a motion ... to revise a final judgment is filed within thirty days and the circuit court in fact revises the judgment, and there has been no intervening order of appeal, the revised judgment becomes the effective final judgment in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[305 Md.] at 240-41, 503 A.2d at 250.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>To be sure, those cases were decided under Maryland Rule 2-535(a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or its predecessor, Rule 625a,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which ordinarily has no applicability to orphans\u2019 court proceedings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But, as the Court said in <em>Thomason,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">The mere fact that formal rules have not been adopted by the Orphans\u2019 Court does not dictate that it must function in a procedural vacuum, particularly in view of the rules long made clear by the decisions of this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">266 Md. at 5, 291 A.2d at 439, citing and relying on <em>Hayman, Adm\u2019r v. Messick, </em>252 Md. 384, 392, 249 A.2d 695, 699 (1969), the cases cited therein, and some of the cases hereinbefore cited. If the consequences identified in <em>Thomason </em>are to be avoided, a rule requiring more than simply the grant of the motion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In concluding that the November 27 order was the final judgment, the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that, rather than being \u201cmerely, as contended by appellee, a denial of the motion for appropriate relief,\u201d \u201cthe orphans\u2019 court reconsidered and reaffirmed its decision to dismiss appellant\u2019s caveat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>The reaffirmance constituted a final appealable decision dismissing appellant\u2019s caveat petition and was properly recorded on the docket by the Register of Wills.\u201d Slip op. at 6. In its November 27 order, the orphans\u2019 court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">A Petition to Caveat was filed by Frank Clark on October 4, 1991, challenging the validated Will on the grounds of testamentary capacity and undue influence, and, in response, a Motion to Dismiss Petition to Caveat was filed by Barbara Anthony on November 4,1991.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] Because it is the opinion of this Court that the issues raised in the Petition to Caveat, specifically testamentary capacity of the decedent and subjection to undue influence at the time of execution of her Will, were raised and addressed during testimony given at the hearing of August 28, 1991, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss Petition to Caveat on November 4, 1991.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">An answer to Motion to Dismiss Petition to Caveat was filed on November 5, 1991, following the dismissal of Petition to Caveat. This Court is treating the Answer to Motion to Dismiss Petition to Caveat as a motion to reconsider the Petition to Caveat and motion to dismiss, prompting the Order herein. After additional consideration of the Answer to Motion to Dismiss, and of the testimony elicited at the hearing, this Court re-affirms its dismissal of the Petition to Caveat, finding that testimony was given at the time of judicial probate to satisfy the Court as to decedent\u2019s testamentary capacity and absence of undue influence. To relitigate these issues would only serve to rehear issues this Court has already heard and decided, and would not be an economical use of the Court\u2019s time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Implicitly, the orphans\u2019 court purported to \u201cgrant\u201d the respondent\u2019s motion for reconsideration and to have, in fact, \u201creconsidered its prior order dismissing the caveat petition. That the orphans\u2019 court may have so characterized its actions is not binding on the Court. We look to the substance, rather than the form, of the subject action. As we have seen, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>order for the \u201cgrant\u201d of a motion for reconsideration to have any effect on the order reconsidered, it must be followed by the passage of a revised order.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 characterization of the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s action was more explicit, but no more effective. Notwithstanding that court\u2019s characterization, the November 27 order was simply a denial of the motion for reconsideration. It certainly did not in any way change or revise the November 4 order. That it explained why it denied the motion does not change its essential nature. In any event, the November 27 order constituted the court\u2019s \u201crefusal to reopen [its] previous [November 4] decision.\u201d <em>Hayman, </em>252 Md. at 392, 249 A.2d at 699, quoting <em>Lefever v. Lefever, </em>6 Md. 472, 478 (1854). Accordingly, it neither undermined the finality of the November 4 order nor constituted a final judgment from which an appeal would lie.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">\n<em>COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b681-6\">.

McAULIFFE, Judge Specially Assigned,</author>\n<p id=\"AFb\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">I agree that the order of November 4, 1991, dismissing Clark\u2019s petition to caveat, was a final order. I would hold, however, that the order of November 27, 1991, by which the orphans\u2019 court granted Clark\u2019s motion for reconsideration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>recited the court\u2019s complete reconsideration of the motion, including new matter not previously considered, and again ordered the dismissal of the caveat, was a new final order from which a timely appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The majority holds that the orphans\u2019 court \u201cpurported\u201d to grant the motion for reconsideration, and said it had reconsidered the matter, but that it really did not do so\u2014it in fact denied the motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>335 Md. 579, 597, 644 A.2d 1070, 1079 (1994). That is simply not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The orphans\u2019 court acted precipitously, and in violation of Maryland Rule 6-122, when it granted the personal representative\u2019s motion to dismiss Clark\u2019s caveat without allowing Clark 20 days to answer the motion. Clark brought this to the court\u2019s attention by his timely filed answer, which reached the court one day after the entry of the order of November 4, and by his motion for appropriate relief, filed two days thereafter. In his answer, Clark argued that issues generated by his caveat had not been addressed by the orphans\u2019 court when judicial probate was granted. He also pointed out to the court that \u00a7 5-207(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, Maryland Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol.), provides that when a petition to caveat is filed after judicial probate \u201cthe matter shall be reopened and a new proceeding held as if only administrative probate had previously been determined.\u201d By his motion for appropriate relief, Clark informed the court that it had erred by not affording him 20 days in which to answer the motion to dismiss, as required by Rule 6-122.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The orphans\u2019 court obviously recognized its error. It treated Clark\u2019s answer as a motion to reconsider, and it granted the motion and reconsidered the issue. The orphans\u2019 court specifically noted that it was now taking into consideration the new matters contained in Clark\u2019s answer. This is not a denial of a motion for reconsideration. It is most assuredly, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>definition, by statement of the orphans\u2019 court, and by admission of the personal representative,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The legal effect of the action of the orphans\u2019 court was to grant the motion for reconsideration; to reconsider the motion to dismiss, including in its consideration new matter not previously considered; and to enter a new opinion and order, again granting the motion to dismiss. The two orders are different, even though the ultimate action is the same. The difference may be demonstrated by examining what might have been considered in an appeal taken from each order. An appeal taken from the order of November 4 could have addressed the court\u2019s error in ruling on the , motion without allowing Clark an opportunity to respond.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> An appeal from the second order granting the motion could not have addressed that issue because the Orphans\u2019 Court cured its earlier oversight by reconsidering the matter after Clark had filed his answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Moreover, if Clark had appealed only from the November 4 order he may have encountered difficulty arguing on appeal issues generated by his answer, because he had not presented them to the lower court before that court initially decided the motion. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 8-131 (a) (providing that \u201c[o]rdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any ... issue [other than jurisdiction] unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court ...\u201d). An appeal from the new order clearly encompasses the issues raised by Clark in his answer, because they were considered, albeit after November 4, by the orphans\u2019 court.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The intent of the lower court should be given effect even if the language used by that court is imprecise. <em>Hanley v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number><em>Stulman, </em>216 Md. 461, 467-68, 141 A.2d 167 (1958); <em>Hancock v. Stull, </em>199 Md. 434, 436-37, 86 A.2d 734 (1952). In legal effect, the orphans\u2019 court vacated its November 4 order to cure its error, and entered a new order after a de novo consideration of the issues. If it did not do so, and the majority is correct in its assertion that the court denied Clark\u2019s motion for reconsideration, Clark\u2019s appeal from that order should be upheld on the ground that the orphans\u2019 court abused its discretion in refusing to reopen and reconsider a dismissal entered in violation of Rule 6-122 and without affording Clark an opportunity to respond. Of course, that is not what happened\u2014the orphans\u2019 court did reconsider and did enter a new order, based on new considerations, and an appeal should lie from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The Court of Special Appeals was correct in holding that the appeal was timely. I would permit the appeal and reach the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">CHASANOW J., joins in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">. In her brief at page 12, the personal representative states: \u2018\u2018The court did just what Mr. Clark asked.
