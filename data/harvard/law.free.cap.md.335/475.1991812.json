The principal question is whether federal law prevents an alien\u2019s intent to be domiciled in Maryland from having legal effect. This issue arises on an appeal from a circuit court\u2019s refusal to direct the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF) to pay a judgment entered against an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The appellant, Dilber E. Garcia (Garcia), was injured on December 13, 1991 in Langley Park, Maryland while riding as a passenger in a pickup truck owned by Victorino A. Angulo (Victorino) and operated by his son, Saul Angulo (Saul). The truck, temporarily registered in Pennsylvania, seems to have been uninsured. Saul failed to stop at a stop sign, and the truck collided with a bus. Garcia sued Victorino, and by amendment joined Saul, in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Saul was served, failed to plead, and an order of default was entered against him. Victorino appeared, but ultimately was voluntarily dismissed. By an agreement between Garcia and MAIF, judgment by default in the amount of $12,000 was entered against Saul. Garcia, pursuant to Maryland Rule BW 6.a, then petitioned the court in the same action for an order directing MAIF to pay the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">MAIF opposed on the ground that Garcia was not a \u201cqualified person\u201d under Maryland Code (1957, 1994 RepLVol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 243H(a)(l). It provides, under the circumstances therein set forth, for claims against, and payment by, MAIF for \u201cpersonal injury to a qualified person.\u201d Article 48A, \u00a7 243L(e) defines \u201cqualified person\u201d to mean, in relevant part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeT\">\u201ca resident of this State or the owner of a motor vehicle registered in this State or a resident of another state, territory, or federal district of the United States or province of the Dominion of Canada, or foreign country, in which recourse is afforded to residents of this State, of substantially similar character to that provided for by this subtitle....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The term \u201cqualified person\u201d in Art. 48A, \u00a7 243L(e) is derived from Md.Code (1957), Art. <em>&amp;&amp;k, </em>\u00a7 150(g), defining \u201cqualified person\u201d for purposes of eligibility to claim against the former Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund. Cases decided under the predecessor statute have established that \u201cresident of this State\u201d in the definition of \u201cqualified person\u201d means a domiciliary of Maryland. <em>See Hawks v. Gottschall, 241 </em>Md. 147, 215 A.2d 745 (1966); <em>Walsh v. Crouse, 232 </em>Md. 386, 194 A.2d 107 (1963); <em>Maddy v. Jones, </em>230 Md. 172, 186 A.2d 482 (1962); <em>Holly v. Maryland Auto. Ins. Fund, </em>29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>Md.App. 498, 349 A.2d 670 (1975); <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Craddock, </em>26 Md.App. 296, 338 A.2d 363 (1975). No party to the present action argues that these holdings have been altered by the transfer of the uninsured motorist program to MAIF. Indeed, these holdings underlie the arguments of the parties here and in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The circuit court conducted a hearing on Garcia\u2019s petition against MAIF, at which Garcia testified, exhibits were introduced, and the following facts were developed. At age nineteen, in 1990, Garcia left his native El Salvador to travel to the United States. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201cI left my country to look for a better life, and I was very frightened of the war because at that time they were killing a lot of young men. And my mother was scared that they were going to kill me, so I decided to leave my country and I came.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">He also stated that he wanted \u201c[t]o be able to study, work, and do something better.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Garcia entered Mexico illegally and made his way on foot and by bus to the Rio Grande. He crossed into the United States in the vicinity of Brownsville, Texas, without visa, and without presenting himself to the immigration authorities. Garcia traveled to Maryland where he has lived continuously since March 1990, principally in the Takoma Park-Silver Spring area.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Prior to the accident of December 13,1991, Garcia obtained a social security number, a Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration identification card, and a replacement passport from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the Republic of El Salvador.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He worked as a carpenter and as a painter. He did not file 1990 income tax returns by the April 15,1991 filing deadline, and there is no evidence that the time for filing was officially extended. After the accident, on or about January 27, 1992, Garcia filed federal and Maryland 1990 income tax returns reporting taxable income of $1,336 from his sole proprietorship as a contractor. Thus, there was no withholding of taxes by the person for whom Garcia rendered services. The explanation for the delay in filing, presented by Garcia to the circuit court, was that he had not been furnished with the tax form reflecting 1990 payments to him until January 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Garcia also obtained from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on October 28, 1991 what he referred to as a \u201cwork permit.\u201d A copy of this card was introduced into evidence. Its legal significance will be described, <em>infra. </em>Garcia has no intention of returning to El Salvador. Although he understands that he is in the United States only until temporary protection expires, he thinks that INS \u201cwill turn these permissions into a green card,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>permanent resident alien status. <em>See </em>W. Wilburn, <em>Strangers in Paradise: An Overview of Maryland State Law Dealing With Noncitizens, </em>21 U.Balt.L.Rev. 87, 90 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The circuit court concluded that Garcia was not a qualified person because he was not a domiciliary of Maryland on December 13, 1991. Garcia appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, but this Court issued the writ of certiorari on its own motion prior to consideration of the matter by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In this Court the parties disagree as to the rationale that the circuit court applied in reaching its conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> MAIF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>seeks to make the case an entirely factual one, emphasizing that the circuit court could have found a lack of intent to establish a Maryland domicile. Garcia, on the other hand, submits that the issue is one of law. He interprets the record to reflect that the circuit court applied an erroneous legal standard, by limiting the possibility of an alien\u2019s obtaining Maryland domicile only to persons recognized by the INS as permanent resident aliens.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">We agree with Garcia that the domicile issue here turns on the status of Salvadorans who have illegally entered the United States. The factual component of the domicile issue focuses on Garcia\u2019s intent as of the date of the accident. <em>See Hawks v. Gottschall, </em>241 Md. at 158, 215 A.2d at 749 (trial court fact-finding of domicile reversed for insufficient evidence where this Court could \u201cfind nothing that [the claimant] had done prior to the 1961 accident which would distinguish him from any other soldier who, during the course of his military career, happens to become stationed in Maryland but who still retained his domicile in another state\u201d). With respect to the legal status component of the domicile issue, however, appellate courts decide cases according to the law in effect at the time of decision, absent some impairment of constitutional rights by a subsequent enactment. <em>See Pickett v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>291 Md. 648, 662, 436 A.2d 449, 457 (1981). Here, for reasons which we shall explain, there is no material contradiction of Garcia\u2019s testimony that he intended to make Maryland his home. In addition, this Court can decide the purely legal issue without first determining the rationale applied by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">An overview of the various classes of aliens under United States law was furnished in <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 79-80 n. 13, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 1891 n. 13, 48 L.Ed.2d 478, 489-90 n. 13 (1976), where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201cThe classifications among aliens established by the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et seq. </em>(1970 ed. and Supp. IV), illustrate the diversity of aliens and their ties to this country. Aliens may be immigrants or nonimmigrants. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15). Immigrants, in turn, are divided into those who are subject to numerical limitations upon admissions and those who are not. The former are subdivided into preference classifications which include: grown unmarried children of citizens; spouses and grown unmarried children of aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence; professionals and those with exceptional ability in the sciences or arts; grown married children of citizens; brothers and sisters of citizens; persons who perform specified permanent skilled or unskilled labor for which a labor shortage exists; and certain victims of persecution and catastrophic natural calamities who were granted conditional entry and remained in the United States at least two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(l)-(7). Immigrants not subject to certain numerical limitations include: children and spouses of citizens and parents of citizens at least 21 years old; natives of independent countries of the Western Hemisphere; aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence returning from temporary visits abroad; certain former citizens who may reapply for acquisition of citizenship; certain ministers of religion; and certain employees or former employees of the United States Government abroad. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(27), 1151(a), (b). Nonimmigrants include: officials and employees of foreign governments and certain international organizations; aliens visiting temporarily for business or pleasure; aliens in transit through this country; alien crewmen serving on a vessel or aircraft; aliens entering pursuant to a treaty of commerce and navigation to carry on trade, or an enterprise in which they have invested; aliens entering to study in this country; certain aliens coming temporarily to perform services or labor or to serve as trainees; alien representatives of the foreign press or other information media; certain aliens coming temporarily to participate in a program in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>their field of study or specialization; aliens engaged to be married to citizens; and certain alien employees entering temporarily to continue to render services to the same employers. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15). In addition to lawfully admitted aliens, there are, of course, aliens who have entered illegally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Garcia\u2019s precise status is none of the above. Although he entered the United States illegally, Congress specifically addressed Salvadorans in Garcia\u2019s class.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Relevant to the problem before us are two sections amending the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101 through 1557 (1988 &amp; Supp. V 1993). Both sections were enacted as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub.L. 101-649, 104 Stat. 4978, 5030-38. One section, \u00a7 302 of the 1990 Act (hereinafter \u00a7 302), is codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a. The other section, \u00a7 303 of the 1990 Act (hereinafter \u00a7 303), is uncodified. Section 303 is set forth in the Historical and Statutory Notes following 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1254a (West Supp. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">A synopsis comparing the two sections is set forth below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">\u201c[S]ection 302 [is] entitled Temporary Protected Status. Temporary Protected Status (TPS) codifies a new category of relief from deportation for illegal aliens in the. United States. Under TPS, the Attorney General, given certain circumstances, may grant aliens of specific nationalities a temporary stay from deportation for up to eighteen months. If this designation is made, designated aliens are authorized to work in the United States as long as the temporary stay is in effect. Congress also provided a specific application of this general provision for TPS in section 303 of the 1990 Act. ' Section 303 designates TPS to nationals of El Salvador who were physically present in the United States on September 19, 1990.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">P. Diamond, <em>Temporary Protected Status Under The Immigration Act of 1990, </em>28 Willamette L.Rev, 857, 857-58 (1992) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Sections 302 and 303 are the product of a compromise in a conference committee on differing versions of S. 358 of the 101st Congress. <em>See </em>136 Cong.Rec. H. 13235 <em>et seq. </em>(daily ed. Oct. 26, 1990). The Senate Bill was concerned exclusively with Chinese students in the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 13238. The House amendment created the new TPS category and specified that \u201ccertain nationals of El Salvador, Lebanon, Liberia, and Kuwait be granted [TPS] for three years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The conference committee explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201c[t]he Conference substitute provides for the establishment of the House\u2019s temporary protected status program, but requires the Attorney General to provide such status only to Salvadorans and only for a period of 18 months---The Conferees underscore that the mandatory conferral of such status on Salvadorans for 18 months shall not be interpreted as preventing the Attorney General, in his sole discretion, [from] providing additional periods of protection should circumstances in the future so warrant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Section 303, the direct congressional conferral of the new TPS on certain Salvadorans, took effect November 29, 1990 and provided that it would \u201cremain in effect until the end of the 18-month period beginning January 1, 1991,\u201d that is, until June 30, 1992. \u00a7 303(a)(2). Thus, when Garcia was injured in the accident caused by an uninsured motorist, his protected status would have continued for about six and one-half months under the then federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Garcia met the conditions for \u00a7 303 TPS. He had \u201cbeen continuously physically present in the United States since September 19, 1990.\u201d \u00a7 303(b)(1)(A). There is no suggestion that he was disqualified under \u00a7 303(b)(1)(B), dealing with ineligibility that is largely based on specified criminal conduct. Garcia registered for TPS between January 1 and October 31, 1990, as required by \u00a7 303(b)(1)(C). Upon registration Garcia became entitled to the \u201cwork permit\u201d issued October 28, 1991 and effective for a period of six months. \u00a7 303(c)(3); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.45 (1994). INS regulations refer to the card as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201cemployment authorization document\u201d (EAD). 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.l2(a)(12) (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Of particular significance for the issue before us is \u00a7 303(d)(1) which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">\u201cAt the registration occurring under this section closest to the date of termination of the designation of El Salvador under subsection (a) [ie., June 30, 1992], the [INS] shall serve on the alien granted temporary protected status an order to show cause that establishes a date for deportation proceedings which is after the date of such termination of designation. If El Salvador is subsequently designated under [\u00a7 302] the Service shall cancel such orders.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">To date, the Attorney General has not exercised the power under \u00a7 302 to designate El Salvador as a nation whose nationals are entitled to TPS. Further, Congress allowed \u00a7 303 to expire by its terms on June 30, 1992. Neither action was required, however, effectively to extend TPS for Salvadorans who had entered the United States illegally. This is because of the presidential actions described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">President George Bush in a May 4, 1992 letter to Salvadoran President Alfredo Christiani \u201csaid that the Attorney General will grant Salvadorans \u2018deferred enforced departure\u2019 [DED] for one year beyond June 30, 1992 when the TPS program is scheduled to end.\u201d 69 Interpreter Releases 600 (May 18, 1992). A \u201csenior INS official\u201d was reported to have said \u201cthat there is no practical difference between DED and TPS for Salvadorans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601. Apparently based on President Bush\u2019s letter, INS by a cable sent on May 15, 1992, instructed its field offices immediately to implement DED. 69 Interpreter Releases 680 (June 1, 1992). INS field offices were to continue to issue orders to show cause, per \u00a7 303(d)(1), but to \u201cindicate that the date of hearing is \u2018to be set.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>By a Federal Register notice issued June 19,1992, the Commissioner, INS, advised that the presidential directive \u201cthat the deportation of Salvadoran nationals who were granted TPS not be enforced before June 30, 1993,\u201d had been issued \u201cbecause El Salvador cannot currently accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>the repatriation of approximately 150,000 people granted TPS.\u201d 57 Fed.Reg. 28701 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">As the June 30, 1993 expiration of DED approached, the Acting Commissioner, INS, published a notice of extension of DED for nationals of El Salvador, dated June 2, 1993. 58 Fed.Reg. 32157 (1993). It noted that approximately 83,000 persons had applied for DED and, \u201c[bjecause immediate repatriation of more than 83,000 persons would have a serious negative impact on the evolving situation in El Salvador, President Clinton has directed that DED be extended for an additional eighteen months, until December 31, 1994.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The notice also advised that the INS was \u201cgranting an automatic extension until October 31, 1993, of the validity\u201d of any previously issued EAD. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Garcia argues that his situation is analogous to that of the nonimmigrant aliens who successfully challenged increased tuition charged to them by the University of Maryland as compared to the tuition charged to United States citizens who were domiciliaries of Maryland.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs held \u201cG-4\u201d visas as members of the immediate families of officers or employees of international treaty organizations whom 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(15)(G)(iv) authorizes to reside in the United States. In <em>Elkins v. Moreno, </em>435 U.S. 647, 98 S.Ct. 1338, 55 L.Ed.2d 614 (1978), the Court addressed whether, under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, G-4 aliens had the legal capacity, as a matter of federal law, to change their domicile from a foreign nation to the United States, and specifically, to Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The Court noted that \u201c[ajlthough nonimmigrant aliens can generally be viewed as temporary visitors to the United States, the nonimmigrant classification is by no means homo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>geneous with respect to the terms on which a nonimmigrant enters the United States.\u201d 435 U.S. at 665, 98 S.Ct. at 1349. For example, alien visitors who declare a business or pleasure purpose for entering this country have no intent, by definition, to abandon their existing domiciles and, absent additional factors, would be subject to deportation if their true intent were to establish domicile here. There were, however, no comparable statutory restrictions on the intent of aliens who qualified for G-4. status. The Court said that \u201cCongress\u2019 silence is therefore pregnant, and we read it to mean that Congress, while anticipating that permanent immigration would normally occur through immigrant channels, was willing to allow nonrestricted nonimmigrant aliens to adopt the United States as their domicile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 98 S.Ct. at 1349.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The Court then considered the consequences on domicile if a G-4 alien were to terminate employment with an international treaty organization, thereby causing the entire family to lose the G-4 status. Under those circumstances, prior to 1952, the nonimmigrant alien would have to leave the United States and apply for an immigrant visa at a consulate abroad. Under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, a nonimmigrant alien could utilize a mechanism under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 termed \u201cadjustment of status\u201d to apply for permanent resident status. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 98 S.Ct. at 1350. Citing a decision in which the Board of Immigration Appeals said that adjustment of status would ordinarily be granted, in the exercise of discretion and absent adverse factors, the Court concluded that G-4 aliens could adjust their status \u201cto that of a permanent resident without difficulty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 668, 98 S.Ct. at 1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The Court, having found no federal obstacle to G-4 aliens becoming domiciliaries of Maryland, then certified to this Court the question of whether G-4 aliens were \u201c \u2018incapable as a matter of state law of becoming domiciliaries of Maryland.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669, 98 S.Ct. at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The certified question was answered in <em>Toll v. Moreno, </em>284 Md. 425, 397 A.2d 1009 (1979). We reviewed the basic principles for determining domicile. <em>Id. </em>at 438-42, 397 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>1015-17. We quoted from <em>Dorf v. Skolnik, </em>280 Md. 101, 116, 371 A.2d 1094, 1102 (1977), the definition of domicile as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiH\">\u201c \u2018the place with which an individual has a settled connection for legal purposes and the place where a person has his true, fixed, permanent home, habitation and principal establishment, without any present intention of removing therefrom, and to which place he has, whenever he is absent, the intention of returning.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><em>Toll, </em>284 Md. at 438, 397 A.2d at 1015.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The University argued that G-4 visa holders could not become domiciled in Maryland because they paid no income taxes to Maryland, could not vote in Maryland, and were not permitted to remain here indefinitely. Noting that the latter objection was \u201ceffectively undercut\u201d by the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, <em>id. </em>at 442, 397 A.2d at 1017, this Court stated the following principle of Maryland domicile law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">\u201cIf under federal law a particular individual must leave this country at a certain date, or cannot remain here indefinitely, then he could not become domiciled in Maryland. Any purported intent to live here indefinitely would be inconsistent with law. It would at most be an unrealistic subjective intent, which is insufficient under Maryland law to establish domicile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 442-43, 397 A.2d at 1017-18. Thus, we held that \u201cif in a particular case [a G-4 visa holder] intends for Maryland to be his fixed place of abode and intends to remain here indefinitely, he will have satisfied the Maryland standard for establishing domicile in this State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443, 397 A.2d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Applying the analysis that we employed in <em>Toll </em>to the facts of the instant matter reflects that Garcia\u2019s intent to reside indefinitely in Maryland is not \u201can unrealistic subjective intent\u201d that is \u201cinconsistent with law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At the time of the accident Garcia enjoyed TPS, which, although due to expire in June 1992, was effectively extended as DED by President Bush. That extension, although due to expire on June 30, 1993, was further extended by President Clinton. As we write, that extension is not due to expire until December 31, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>1994. Although there is a date certain when Garcia\u2019s current DED will expire, there is no certainty as to when, if ever, he will receive a notice of deportation. Therefore, Garcia\u2019s intent to remain in Maryland is not inconsistent with present federal law. Were one to attempt to predict what the status will be as of January 1, 1995 of Salvadorans who have entered this country without inspection, the pattern of the past federal actions might well lead one to conclude that there will be a further postponement, in some fashion, of a vigorous deportation campaign. It is not appropriate, however, for this Court to engage in that speculation. \u201cMatters relating \u2018to the conduct of foreign relations ... are so exclusively entrusted to the political branches of [the federal] government as to be largely immune from.judicial inquiry or interference.\u2019\u201d <em>Regan v. Wald, </em>468 U.S. 222, 242, 104 S.Ct. 3026, 3038, 82 L.Ed.2d 171, 186 (1984) (quoting <em>Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, </em>342 U.S. 580, 589, 72 S.Ct. 512, 519, 96 L.Ed. 586, 598 (1952)). We cannot predict the outcome of political judgments that are yet to be made. We can only be guided by federal law as it stands on the date of our decision. Under that law and Maryland domicile law, Garcia\u2019s intent is not an unrealistic subjective intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">MAIF\u2019s principal factual argument seems to have been inspired by that part of the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Elkins v. Moreno </em>that relied on adjustment of status by G-4 nonimmigrant aliens. Garcia never has applied for adjustment of status. MAIF contends that this inaction evidences a lack of intent to reside indefinitely in Maryland and thereby supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion. The defect in MAIF\u2019s argument is that Garcia\u2019s inaction could not evidence disinterest on Garcia\u2019s part in permanent residence status. The Office of General Counsel, INS, in an opinion of March 4, 1991, concluded that \u201c[a]n alien who entered the United States without inspection is ineligible for adjustment of status.\u201d 68 Interpreter Releases 483, 483 (Apr. 22, 1991). The advisory opinion assumes a Salvadoran who entered the United States illegally, received TPS, and then was approved for an immigrant visa.

My reasons for writing separately are twofold. First, the majority acknowledges that the issue is whether Garcia was a domiciliary of Maryland on the date of the accident, December 13, 1991,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but then in concluding he was a domiciliary on that date, the majority apparently relies on subsequent presidential directives which occurred long after Garcia\u2019s accident and which could not h\u00e1ve been anticipated by Garcia in 1991.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, the majority fails to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>recognize the importance of uniformity in determining when a citizen of another country can become a domiciliary in this country. No attempt is made to explore how other jurisdictions have decided this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Garcia entered this country illegally approximately 21 months before his accident. Several months before the accident, he applied for, and received, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and a temporary work permit. Garcia\u2019s TPS was due to be terminated and in fact was terminated on June. 30, 1992, 6 months after the accident. Provision was made in the TPS statute for extensions of TPS from 6 to 18 months in the discretion of the Attorney General, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1254a(b)(2) &amp; (3) (1987, 1994 Cum.Supp.), but the Attorney General never extended TPS. Garcia was apparently not eligible for either political asylum, <em>see </em>335 Md. at 478 n. 1, 644 A.2d at 500 n. 1, or for permanent resident status,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>see </em>335 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Md. at 488, 644 A.2d at 504. Thus, Garcia\u2019s TPS immigration status expired, as per the act conferring that status, approximately 6 months after the accident. The only reason Garcia did not revert to his status as an illegal alien subject to immediate deportation was because of presidential directives which could not have been anticipated by Garcia and which changed his status from TPS to Deferred Enforced Departure (DED). These subsequent unanticipated presidential directives should not <em>nunc pro tunc </em>modify Garcia\u2019s status or intent as of December 13,1991. Although I do not believe the Court should determine Garcia\u2019s domicile on December 13, 1991 by using subsequent unanticipated events, there are other valid reasons for concluding that Garcia was a domiciliary of Maryland on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">There could be severe consequences when we require aliens to maintain a foreign domicile in countries to which they never wish to return and deny them domicile in states where they reside and fervently hope to make their permanent homes. The comments to the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>(1988 Revisions) point out the importance of domicile:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_I\">\u201cThe functions served by domicil in Conflict of Laws fall into three broad categories. These are judicial jurisdiction; choice of law, particularly in matters where continuity of application of the same law is important, as family law and decedents\u2019 estates; and governmental benefits and burdens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-6\">A state may exercise judicial jurisdiction to render through its courts a personal judgment against its domiciliaries whether or not they happen to be within its territory \u25a0 at the time of service of process (see \u00a7 29). The state where at least one of the spouses is domiciled at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>suit may terminate their marriage by divorce (see \u00a7 71); such a state may likewise issue a decree of judicial separation (see \u00a7 75) or of annulment (see \u00a7 76). In the area of choice of law, the law of a person\u2019s domicil may determine such matters relating to his personal status as the validity of his marriage (see \u00a7 283) and his legitimacy (see \u00a7 287). The same law governs the transfer of his movable property upon death; it determines the validity of his will with respect to such property (see \u00a7 263) or its distribution in the event of intestacy (see \u00a7 260). * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">\u00a7 11 cmt. c at 1-2 (commenting on subsection 1). <em>See, e.g., </em>Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Article, \u00a7 7-101 (nonresidents may be denied access to the courts for divorces).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">There is an obvious benefit to uniformity in the determination of whether aliens who reside in and intend to remain in this country may become domiciliaries in this country. For this reason I believe it is important to examine and be guided by what federal and other state courts have decided in analogous cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">In <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>457 U.S. 202, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982), the Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause was applicable to illegal aliens. In doing so, the Court noted the plight of illegal aliens as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-7\">\u201cSheer incapability or lax enforcement of the laws barring entry into this country, coupled with the failure to establish an effective bar to the employment of undocumented aliens, has resulted in the creation of a substantial \u2018shadow population\u2019 of illegal migrants\u2014numbering in the millions\u2014within our borders. This situation raises the specter of a permanent caste of undocumented resident aliens, encouraged by some to remain here as a source of cheap labor, but nevertheless denied the benefits that our society makes available to citizens and lawful residents. The existence of such an underclass presents most difficult problems for a Nation that prides itself on adherence to principles of equality under law.\u201d (Footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 218-19, 102 S.Ct. at 2395-96, 72 L.Ed.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">In addition to holding that illegal aliens are entitled to equal protection under the law, the Supreme Court made some observations which indicate illegal aliens should be able to establish domicile even though potentially subject to immediate deportation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201cTo be sure, like all persons who have entered the United States unlawfully, these children are subject to deportation. But there is no assurance that a child subject to deportation will ever be deported. An illegal entrant might be granted federal permission to continue to reside in this country, or even to become a citizen. In light of the discretionary federal power to grant relief from deportation, a State cannot realistically determine that any particular [illegal alien] will in fact be deported until after deportation proceedings have been completed.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\"><em>Plyler, </em>457 U.S. at 226, 102 S.Ct. at 2399, 72 L.Ed.2d at 805. In interpreting the impact of the <em>Plyler </em>case, a recent article stated that \u201cin <em>Plyler v. Doe, </em>the Court recognized that the alien\u2019s lack of initial immigration approval did not undercut her ability to participate in and become integrated into the society.... Indeed, the Court\u2019s analysis exemplified the premise that modern jurisprudence holds for further extending the positive rights of participation due the alien.\u201d <em>Developments in the Law\u2014Immigration Policy and the Rights of Aliens, </em>96 Harvard L.Rev. 1286, 1311 (1983) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Certainly a person with TPS is in a better position to acquire domicile than an illegal alien who is subject to deportation immediately upon discovery. Although we need not, and should not, decide whether all classes of illegal aliens may establish domicile in this country, several courts have declared that an illegal alien can establish domicile within this country. For example, in <em>United States v. Otherson, </em>480 F.Supp. 1369 (S.D.Cal.1979), the federal district court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>\u201cThe law is well-established that a person acquires a legal \u2018domicile\u2019 when he is physically present in a location with the intent to remain for the indefinite future. <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of </em>Laws, \u00a7 15 (1971). The aliens seemingly had the requisite intent. As for the requirement of physical presence, it has been held that the presence of illegal aliens is sufficient to enable them to establish a legal \u2018domicile.\u2019 <em>Rzeszotarski v. Rzeszotarski, </em>296 A.2d 431 (D.C.App.1972); <em>Seren v. Douglas, </em>30 Colo.App. 110, 489 P.2d 601 (1971). A fugitive from justice can establish a legal \u2018domicile\u2019 where he is in hiding. <em>Young v. Pollak, </em>85 Ala. 439, 5 So. 279 (1888). Additionally, many cases hold that the individual need only be present for a moment. <em>E.g., Winans v. Winans, </em>205 Mass. 388, 91 N.E. 394 (1910); <em>White v. Tennant, </em>31 W.Va. 790, 8 S.E. 596 (1888); <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws, </em>\u00a7 16 (1971).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">480 F.Supp. at 1371 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">In <em>St. Joseph\u2019s Hosp. v. Maricopa County, </em>142 Ariz. 94, 688 P.2d 986 (1984), the Supreme Court of Arizona held that even an illegal alien who was subject to deportation when caught could establish domicile in Arizona. The Arizona court quoted the following from the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Plyler v. Doe:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">\u201c \u2018In light of the discretionary federal power to grant relief from deportation, a State cannot realistically determine that any particular undocumented [person] will in fact be deported until after deportation proceedings have been completed.\u2019 <em>Plyler v.

There is no federal impediment to an undocumented alien becoming a resident of an Arizona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>county.

In <em>In re Marriage of Dick, </em>15 Cal.App.4th 144, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 743 (Cal.Ct.App.1993), a California court recently held that a nonimmigrant alien in this country on a tourist visa, who was required by his visa to leave the country within six months, although permitted to re-enter, could nevertheless establish domicile in the State. The court noted the following as to the state of the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\u201c[T]he cases cited to us, and those which we have found, from other jurisdictions hold that immigration status is, at most, evidence of domiciliary intent, but not dispositive of the residency issue as a matter of law. These cases hold that a party\u2019s nonimmigrant alien status does not bar that party from establishing domicile for purposes of a dissolution statute. <em>(Alves v.

Bustamante, </em>645 P.2d 40 (Utah 1982), is a case quite similar to the instant case. The plaintiff was a Salvadoran citizen who came to this country on a visitor\u2019s visa which was due to expire on June 21,1980, but was extended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>December 31, 1980. The issue in the case was whether the plaintiff was a domiciliary of Utah on July 14, 1980, when she filed a divorce action. She testified she intended to live in this country for the rest of her life, and after filing for divorce, stated that she sought to change her status to that of political asylum. The Utah Supreme Court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdRy\">\u201cemphasize[d] that a visa application or renewal form indicating a date certain for return to one\u2019s home country is not necessarily inconsistent with an actual conditional intent to establish permanent residency in the United States, if possible, by means of renewals and extensions of one\u2019s nonimmigrant status or attainment of immigrant status.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">* * * * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">Even if the plaintiffs professed intention to establish an actual and bona fide residency is inconsistent with the terms of her right of entry into the United States, she is not thereby disqualified from becoming a domiciliary for divorce purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\"><em>Bustamante, </em>645 P.2d at 42.

When the plaintiff came to the United States, she was required to swear that she was a resident of Lebanon and intended to return there when her visa expired. She was issued a \u201cB-l Business Visa\u201d with an authorized stay of six months. <em>Abdennur, </em>41 Conn.Sup. 258, 566 A.2d at 460. One six-month extension is allowed for a B-l Business Visa, and the plaintiff had received this extension when her divorce proceeding was filed. The court held that the plaintiff was a domiciliary because she intended to reside in Connecticut permanently, even if her immigration status might not permit carrying out this intent. The court recognized the existence of a \u201c \u2018dual intent,\u2019 namely intent to remain if that could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>accomplished, or intent to leave if required by law----\u201d <em>Abdennur, </em>41 Conn.Sup. 258, 566 A.2d at 461.

His visa required him to maintain a permanent residence abroad \u201cwhich he [had] no intention of abandoning.\u201d <em>Sinha, </em>491 A.2d at 900.

After his visa expired, the plaintiff filed a divorce proceeding in the District of Columbia where he claimed to be a domiciliary. The court held that, although the plaintiff was subject to immediate deportation, and his intent to remain in this country was a \u201cfloating intent or even contingent upon being allowed to stay in the United States,\u201d <em>Rzeszotarski, </em>296 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>at 436 (footnote omitted), he was not precluded from being a District of Columbia domiciliary.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">In <em>Perez v. Perez, </em>164 So.2d 561 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1964), the Florida Supreme Court held that a refugee from communist Cuba who came to this country, and intended to remain here until Cuba is no longer communistic, may become a domiciliary of the State. The Perez court quoted two treatises as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">\u201c \u2018Domicil, of course, cannot be changed by [a] forced exile, or by a change made necessary in order to secure safety in time of war, as in the case of the emigration of the nobles from France at the time of the French Revolution. But where one leaves his country because of his dislike for its political condition, hoping to return when he can do so as a free citizen, but without immediate expectation of such an event, these facts are compatible with the acquisition of a domicil in the country to which he goes.\u2019 \u201d (Citations omitted) (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">164 So.2d at 563-64 (quoting 1 Joseph H. Beale, <em>Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 21.1 at 154 (1935)); and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">\u201c \u2018A person who resides in the country from which he is liable to be deported may lack the <em>animus manendi </em>because his residence is precarious. But if in fact he forms the necessary intention, he acquires a domicile of choice. This applies both where he is given permission to reside for a limited period but is liable to deportation and also where he is given permission to reside for a limited period which can be extended at the discretion of the authorities of the country in question. Once such a person has acquired such a domicile choice he does not lose it merely because a deportation order has been made against him; he only loses it when he is actually deported. * * * \u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">164 So.2d at 564 (quoting A.V. Dicey, <em>Conflict of Laws, </em>Rule 9.2 (7th ed.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">Based on the persuasive authority of these cases as they relate to Garcia\u2019s TPS immigration status, I concur in the holding that Garcia was a domiciliary of Maryland on Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>ber 13, 1991. The subsequent, unanticipated presidential directives conferring DED immigration status on Garcia seem to have little relevance to Garcia\u2019s intent or how realistic that intent was on December 13, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Judge BELL has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed in this concurring opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-10\">. Maryland cases clearly establish that, when determining whether a claimant is a \"qualified person\u201d under Maryland Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Article 48A, \u00a7 243(H)(a)(l), we must determine the claimant\u2019s domicile as of the date of the accident. <em>See, e.g., Hawks v.

The majority seems to justify using post-1991 events to determine Garcia\u2019s status in 1991 by stating: \u201cWith respect to the legal status component of the domicile issue, however, appellate courts decide cases according to the law in effect at the time of decision____\u201d 335 Md. 475, 480, 644 A.2d 498, 501. I do not profess to understand what the \"legal status component\u201d of domicile is or why that component of domicile in 1991 is dependent on Garcia\u2019s status in 1994. The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>goes on to state: \"We cannot predict the outcome of political judgments that are yet to be made. We can only be guided by federal law as it stands on the date of our decision. Under that law and Maryland domicile law, Garcia\u2019s intent is not an unrealistic subjective intent.\u201d 335 Md. at 488, 644 A.2d at 504. This seems to imply that, in determining whether Garcia was a domiciliary in 1991, we look at his subjective intent in 1991, but also await future events\u2014at least up through final appellate review\u2014to assure that his intent was and still remains \"realistic.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-7\">. The Office of General Counsel, INS, in an opinion on March 4, 1991, opined that \"[a]n alien who entered the United States without inspection is ineligible for adjustment of status.\u201d 68 Interpreter Releases 483, 483 (Apr. 22, 1991). Relying on INA \u00a7 245A, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a (1987), General Counsel reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-8\">\"Section 245(a) provides that, in order to be eligible to adjust, the alien must have been 'inspected and admitted or paroled into the United States.\u2019 Since an alien who entered without inspection, by definition, cannot satisfy this requirement, the alien is ineligible for adjustment. In providing temporary protected status to El Salvadorans, Congress made specific requirements that the statutory protection would be limited to 18 months and specific rules were incorporated in the statute to ensure the removal of these aliens following termination of the designated period.
