Supp.), \u00a7 8-704 of the Natural Resources Article,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> grants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the Department the authority to adopt a prohibition against the operation of a particular type of vessel by persons under a certain age; (2) if the regulation is authorized by the statute, whether the delegation by the General Assembly to the Department of such broad authority violates the separation of powers requirement of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">The relevant facts underlying this action are not in dispute. The COMAR 08.18.02.05A age restriction was promulgated by the Department in August 1990, after the Department concluded that public concern over the use of personal watercraft on Maryland\u2019s crowded waterways had greatly increased.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Prior to the implementation of the regulation, Charles R. Christ, Jr., had been free to operate his personal watercraft on Maryland waters. When the regulation went into effect, however, Mr. Christ, who was then under 14 years of age, was precluded from using his personal watercraft in the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Charles R. Christ, Jr., by his father, brought this action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking both a declaratory judgment that COMAR 08.18.02.05A was invalid and a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the regulation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Christ argued in the circuit court that the regulation was not authorized by statute. He also argued that, if authorized, such delegation to the Department by the General Assembly violated the constitutional requirement of separation of powers between the legislative and executive branches of government. According to Christ, an age restriction for operating a particular type of vessel involves a \u201cfundamental policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>making decision\u201d that \u201chas to be retained, and can only be done by the General Assembly.\u201d The Department filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that the regulation was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">After a hearing, the circuit court issued an opinion rejecting both of the plaintiffs arguments, stating that \u201cthe Department has not acted in an unconstitutional manner or exceeded its statutory authority,\u201d and concluding that the action should be \u201cdismissed.\u201d Specifically, the circuit court held that the language of \u00a7 8-704(b-l)(l) of the State Boat Act, directing the Department to \u201cadopt regulations governing\u201d the \u201coperations of any vessels,\u201d clearly included regulations concerning who may operate vessels. The circuit court additionally rejected Christ\u2019s separation of powers argument, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akh4\">\u201c[t]he contention that the regulation is unconstitutional because the State legislature delegated authority to the Department for action on an issue which can only be controlled by the legislature is without merit. Age regulation for the operation of vessels on the waterways of the State is not so fundamental as to require action by the legislature itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHs\">A judgment was entered on the circuit court\u2019s docket ordering \u201cthat this case is dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Christ timely noted an appeal from the circuit court\u2019s dismissal, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals, 329 Md. 168, 617 A.2d 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Before turning to the merits of the dispute in this case, it is necessary to address a procedural matter. As mentioned above, the circuit court, disagreeing with the plaintiffs contention that the regulation was invalid, dismissed the declaratory judgment action. This was clearly in error. Although, for the reasons set forth later in the opinion, we find ourselves in agreement with the circuit court\u2019s conclusions concerning the validity of the regulation, the judgment dismissing the case must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>This Court has emphasized, time after time, that dismissal \u201cis rarely appropriate in a declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>Popham v. State Farm, </em>333 Md. 136, 140 n. 2, 634 A.2d 28, 30 n. 2 (1993), quoting <em>Broadwater v. State, </em>303 Md. 461, 465, 494 A.2d 934, 936 (1985). <em>See, e.g., Turnpike Farm v. Curran, </em>316 Md. 47, 49, 557 A.2d 225, 226 (1989); <em>Boyds Civic Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County, </em>309 Md. 683, 687 n. 2, 526 A.2d 598, 600 n. 2 (1987); <em>Jennings v. Government Employees Ins., </em>302 Md. 352, 355, 356, 488 A.2d 166, 167-168 (1985); <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, </em>301 Md. 9, 17, 481 A.2d 785, 789 (1984); <em>Koontz v. Ass\u2019n of Classified Emp., </em>297 Md. 521, 529, 467 A.2d 753, 758 (1983); <em>Carroll Co. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., </em>294 Md. 144, 155-156, 448 A.2d 345, 351 (1982); <em>East v. Gilchrist, </em>293 Md. 453, 461 n. 3, 445 A.2d 343, 347 n. 3 (1982); <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, </em>285 Md. 84, 90-92, 400 A.2d 1091, 1095 (1979), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">It is proper to dismiss a declaratory judgment action only where there is a lack of jurisdiction or where a declaratory judgment is not an available or appropriate type of remedy. <em>See, e.g., Popham v. State Farm, supra, 333 </em>Md. at 140-141 n. 2, 634 A.2d at 30 n. 2 (declaratory judgment ordinarily is not available when the issue has become moot); <em>Turnpike Farm v. Curran, supra, </em>316 Md. at 49, 557 A.2d at 226 (declaratory judgment action is not available, and should be dismissed, where there is a pending action between the parties presenting the same issue); <em>Boyds Civic Ass\u2019n v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>309 Md. at 688-700, 526 A.2d at 600-607 (declaratory judgment action, to be entertained by the court, must present a justiciable controversy); <em>State v. Burning Tree Club, supra, </em>301 Md. at 18, 481 A.2d at 789 (declaratory judgment action should be dismissed where the plaintiff lacks standing); <em>Koontz v. Ass\u2019n of Classified Emp., supra, </em>297 Md. at 529-530, 467 A.2d at 758 (declaratory judgment action was properly dismissed where the dispute had become moot).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Where a controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, however, the trial court must render a declaratory judgment. The court\u2019s rejection of the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>position on the merits furnishes no ground for dismissal. In <em>East v. Gilchrist, supra, </em>293 Md. at 461 n. 3, 445 A.2d at 347 n. 3, this Court, in language directly applicable to the present case, pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cwhere a plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that a particular legal provision is valid (or invalid), and the court\u2019s conclusion regarding the validity of the provision is exactly opposite from the plaintiffs contention, nevertheless the court must, under the plaintiffs prayer for relief, issue a declaratory judgment setting forth the court\u2019s conclusion as to validity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Judge Prescott for the Court in <em>Shapiro v. County Comm., </em>219 Md. 298, 302-303, 149 A.2d 396, 399 (1959), stated that, under Maryland\u2019s declaratory judgment statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">\u201cit is immaterial that the ultimate ruling may be unfavorable to the plaintiff. The test of the sufficiency of the [complaint] is not whether it shows that the plaintiff is entitled to the declaration of rights or interest in accordance with his theory, but whether he is entitled to a declaration at all; so, even though the plaintiff may be on the losing side of the dispute, if he states the existence of a controversy which should be settled, he states a cause of suit for a declaratory decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\"><em>See, e.g., Broadwater v. State, supra, </em>303 Md. at 467, 494 A.2d at 937 (\u201c[T]he trial judge should have declared the rights of the parties even if such declaration might be contrary to the desires of the plaintiff\u201d); <em>Woodland Beach Ass\u2019n v. Worley, </em>253 Md. 442, 448, 252 A.2d 827, 830 (1969) (\u201ca declaration should be given even if it is not the declaration sought by the plaintiff and, indeed, is entirely ... contrary to the theory of the plaintiff on which declaratory relief is sought\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Under our cases, where a circuit court erroneously dismisses a declaratory judgment action, the dismissal must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>be vacated, and an appropriate declaratory judgment must be entered. <em>Broadwater v. State, supra, </em>303 Md. at 469-470, 494 A.2d at 938; <em>Carroll Co. Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>294 Md. at 155-156, 448 A.2d at 351; <em>Mauzy v. Hornbeck, supra, </em>285 Md. at 92, 400 A.2d at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The plaintiffs position that COMAR 08.18.02.05A was not authorized by the General Assembly is based on two theories. First, the plaintiff argues that the language of the State Boat Act, Code (1974, 1990 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-704(b-l)(l) of the Natural Resources Article, directing the Department to adopt regulations governing the \u201coperations of any vessels,\u201d does not encompass age restrictions for operating certain types of vessels. Second, the plaintiff maintains that the age restriction conflicts with the overall spirit of the State Boat Act, in which, according to the plaintiff, the Legislature indicated its preference for educating young boaters rather than prohibiting their operation of certain vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\"> Regulations promulgated by an administrative agency must, of course, be \u201cconsistent with the letter and spirit of the law under which the agency acts.\u201d <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, </em>311 Md. 64, 74, 532 A.2d 1056, 1061 (1987). <em>See, e.g., Maryland State Police v. Warwick, </em>330 Md. 474, 481, 624 A.2d 1238, 1241 (1993); <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Bankers, </em>326 Md. 617, 623, 606 A.2d 1072, 1075 (1992). We agree with the circuit court that COMAR 08.18.02.05A, prohibiting those under 14 years of age from operating personal watercraft, was authorized by the State Boat Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">In the State Boat Act, \u00a7 8-704(b-l)(l) of the Natural Resources Article, the General Assembly broadly granted to the Department the authority to adopt regulations governing the \u201coperations of any vessels\u201d which are subject to the Act. In numerous situations where the General Assembly has delegated similar broad power to an administrative agency to adopt legislative rules or regulations in a particular area, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>has upheld the agency\u2019s rules or regulations as long as they did not contradict the language or purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">For example, in <em>Jacobson v. Md. Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>261 Md. 180, 186, 274 A.2d 102, 104-105 (1971), where the pertinent statute gave the Racing Commission the \u201cfull power to prescribe rules, regulations and conditions under which all horse races shall be conducted,\u201d the contention that the legislative delegation of power did not reach a rule regulating the transfer of race horses was characterized by this Court as an argument which \u201capproaches the frivolous.\u201d Other cases in which the Court has upheld agency regulations under broad, general grants of authority to adopt rules or regulations include, <em>e.g., Falik v. Prince George\u2019s Hosp., </em>322 Md. 409, 588 A.2d 324 (1991) (broad grant of authority to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission to regulate fees for medical services); <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>311 Md. at 67-69, 532 A.2d at 1057-1058 (statutory provisions directed administrative officials to adopt rules and regulations \u201cfor the establishment of [a motor vehicle] emissions inspection program,\u201d rules and regulations \u201c \u2018as required for purposes of implementation, administration, regulation, and enforcement of the provisions of the subtitle,\u2019 \u201d and rules and regulations \u201c \u2018establishing emission standards to be used for the inspection of motor vehicles\u2019 \u201d); <em>Sullivan v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, </em>293 Md. 113, 123, 442 A.2d 558, 563 (1982) (\u201cwe think the broad authority vested in boards of license commissioners under ... the Act to adopt reasonable rules and regulations as may be necessary to effectively administer the law and to foster and promote temperance in the public interest is ... necessary\u201d); <em>Automobile Trade Ass\u2019n v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>292 Md. 15, 22-23, 437 A.2d 199, 202 (1981) (Insurance Commissioner was authorized to adopt rules and regulations \u201cappropriate and necessary\u201d to implement the provisions of the Credit Life and Credit Health Insurance subtitle of the Insurance Code); <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 552, 121 A.2d 816, 820 (1956) (legislative body \u201cmay delegate to [administrative] officials the power to carry ordinances into effect, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>even though such delegation requires the exercise of a certain amount of discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The crux of the plaintiffs argument concerning absence of statutory authority is that \u201cthere is no specific delegation of authority by the General Assembly to the Department permitting the Department to promulgate regulations which <em>prohibit </em>the use of vessels by an entire class of citizens of the State.\u201d (Plaintiffs brief at 10). As the above-cited cases demonstrate, however, such specificity is not required. The broad authority to promulgate \u201cregulations governing the ... operations of any vessels\u201d plainly encompasses a regulation prohibiting the operation of certain motor vessels by persons under 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In any particular area of legislative concern, whether there should be a broad general delegation of regulatory authority to administrators, or a more specific delegation, is a choice for the General Assembly. As Chief Judge Murphy recently stated for the Court in <em>Falik v. Prince George\u2019s Hosp., supra, </em>322 Md. at 417, 588 A.2d at 328,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">\u201c[i]n a long line of cases, we have upheld broad delegations of legislative power to administrative agencies, particularly where it is impracticable for the legislature to set specific guidelines to govern the day-to-day exercise of the rule-making power.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\"><em>See also Sullivan v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, supra, </em>293 Md. at 122-123, 442 A.2d at 563 (\u201cit is manifestly impractical for the legislature to set specific guidelines to govern the day-today exercise of the rule-making power\u201d); <em>Governor v. Exxon Corp., </em>279 Md. 410, 441, 370 A.2d 1102, 1119 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>437 U.S. 117, 98 S.Ct. 2207, 57 L.Ed.2d 91 (1978) (\u201cIt would obviously be impractical for the Legislature to set specific guidelines to govern all situations where exceptions to the [time schedule for complying with the statute] would be reasonable\u201d); <em>Comptroller v. Rockhill, Inc., </em>205 Md. 226, 232, 107 A.2d 93, 97 (1954) (\u201cit would be impossible for the Legislature to deal directly with the multitude of details in the complex conditions upon which it legislates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>The plaintiff invokes a provision of the State Boat Act directing the Department to \u201c[p]romote safety of life and property through an educational program directed to boat owners, boat operators, and others concerning the inherent hazards of vessels ...\u201d (\u00a7 8-703(a)(2)). The plaintiff also relies on another section of the statute which states in relevant part as follows (\u00a7 8-712.2(a)(l)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u201cExcept as otherwise provided ... on or after July 1,1988 a person born on or after July 1, 1972 may not operate on the waters of the State a vessel for pleasure that is required to be numbered in accordance with this subtitle or a vessel for pleasure as required to be numbered in accordance with the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 without first-obtaining a certificate of Boating Safety Education.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">In the plaintiff\u2019s view, these provisions reflect a legislative intent that the Department achieve the goal of boating safety \u201cthrough education\u201d rather than by a regulation prohibiting those under a particular age from operating certain types of vessels.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We agree that the above-quoted provisions show a legislative intent that boating safety be promoted through education. There is no inconsistency, however, between educational programs to promote boating safety and regulations imposing restrictions upon who can operate certain vessels. The chief provision relied on by the plaintiff, namely \u00a7 8-703(a)(2) directing the Department to promote safety through an educational program, is immediately followed in the statute by \u00a7 8-703(a)(3) directing the Department to \u201c[p]lan a regulatory program.\u201d Nothing in the statute mandates a choice of educational requirements and programs over regulations concerning those persons who may operate particular types of boats. Both educational programs and regulations like COMAR 08.-18.02.05A may operate in tandem to promote boating safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We hold, therefore, that COMAR 08.18.02.05A is authorized by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The plaintiff alternatively argues that, if COMAR 08.18.02.05A is authorized under the State Boat Act, then the statute unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to an agency in the executive branch of government, in violation of the separation of powers requirement set forth in Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">This Court has \u201crepeatedly pointed out that Art. 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights does not impose \u2018a complete separation between the branches of government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Judy v. Schaefer, </em>331 Md. 239, 261, 627 A.2d 1039, 1050 (1993), quoting <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>311 Md. at 81, 532 A.2d at 1064. <em>See also, e.g., Dep\u2019t of Nat. Res. v. Linchester, </em>274 Md. 211, 220, 334 A.2d 514, 521 (1975) (\u201cthe separation of powers concept may constitutionally encompass a sensible degree of elasticity\u201d); 1 F. Cooper, <em>State Administrative Law, </em>at 15 (1965) (\u201cthe doctrine of separation of powers does not forbid the exercise by one department of powers that could appropriately be exercised by another department ... there may be a \u2018blending\u2019 of disparate powers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Under our cases, delegations of legislative power to executive branch agencies or officials ordinarily do not violate the constitutional separation of powers requirement as long as guidelines or safeguards, sufficient under the circumstances, are contained in the pertinent statute or statutes. <em>See, e.g., Judy v. Schaefer, supra, </em>331 Md. at 263, 627 A.2d at 1051; <em>Maryland State Police v. Warwick, supra, </em>330 Md. at 480-481, 624 A.2d at 1241; <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>311 Md. at 72, 532 A.2d at 1060, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">Moreover, the requirement of guidelines is not an absolute one; it has been relaxed in many circumstances in light of the complexity of modern conditions with which government must deal. As stated by Judge Delaplaine for the Court almost 40 years ago in <em>Pressman v. Barnes, supra, </em>209 Md. at 555, 121 A.2d at 822,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u201cwhere the discretion to be exercised relates to ... regulations for the protection of public morals, health, safety, or general welfare, and it is impracticable to fix standards without destroying the flexibility necessary to enable the administrative officials to carry out the legislative will, legislation delegating such discretion without such restrictions may be valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><em>See Judy v. Schaefer, supra, </em>331 Md. at 263-264, 627 A.2d at 1051-1052; <em>Falik v. Prince George\u2019s Hosp., supra, </em>322 Md. at 418, 588 A.2d at 328 (referring, to \u201cthe general rule (now greatly relaxed) that a statute vesting discretion in administrative officials without fixing any standards for their guidance may, in some circumstances, constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power\u201d); <em>Department of Transportation v. Armacost, supra, </em>311 Md. at 73-74, 532 A.2d at 1060 (\u201cWe have also relaxed the general rule that a statute vesting discretion in administrative officials without fixing any standards for their guidance is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power\u201d); <em>Sullivan v.

These persons constitute an advisory committee for regulations concerning vessel equipment and vessel operation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">A regulation prohibiting children under 14 from operating a particularly dangerous type of motor vessel on public waters is obviously a reasonable regulation to promote the statutory purpose of boating safety. Some age restriction with regard to the operation of these vessels would seem to be absolutely necessary. The advisory committee on regulations provided for in \u00a7 8-704(e) insures that there will be input from those representing interests directly affected by such regulations. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Other safeguards are the requirements for notice, public comments, and public hearings set forth in Code (1984, 1998 RepLVol.), \u00a7\u00a7 10-109 through 10-117 of the State Government Article. The Department held two public hearings on the proposed age restriction prior to the adoption of COMAR 08.18.02.05A. Under our cases previously discussed, the General Assembly\u2019s delegation of authority to the Department to promulgate, regulations governing the \u201coperations of any vessels subject to the subtitle\u201d is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Relying on language in opinions of the Supreme Court of California, the plaintiff argues that a \u201cfundamental policy making decision\u201d cannot constitutionally be delegated by the Legislature to an executive branch department or agency, and that a regulation prohibiting persons under a certain age from operating a particular type of vessel is such a \u201cfundamental policy making decision.\u201d (Plaintiffs brief at 16).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Of course, the General Assembly cannot constitutionally delegate to another body its \u201cfundamental decision making authority\u201d in the sense that it cannot delegate a function which the Constitution expressly and unqualifiedly vests in the General Assembly itself. Thus the General Assembly could not delegate to an administrative agency its power to impeach, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>to propose constitutional amendments, or to enact statutes. <em>See, e.g., Sullivan v. Bd. of License Comm\u2019rs, supra, </em>293 Md. at 124, 442 A.2d at 564 (\u201cManifestly, the power delegated to an administrative agency to make rules is not the power to make laws\u201d); <em>Comm\u2019n On Med. Discipline v. Stillman, </em>291 Md. 390, 413, 435 A.2d 747, 759 (1981) (\u201cthe legislature ... cannot validly redelegate its lawmaking authority to others\u201d). Nevertheless, when the General Assembly enacts a statute, embodying its policy decision or decisions, the Legislature often must delegate significant authority to the executive branch which is vested with the constitutional responsibility of administering the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As previously discussed, this authority delegated to executive branch agencies may include a broad power to promulgate legislative-type rules or regulations in order to implement the statute. Such rules or regulations will often, of necessity, embody significant discretionary policy determinations. Nonetheless, this Court has repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of administrative regulations reflecting policy determinations which have been just as \u201cfundamental\u201d as the age restriction embodied in COMAR 08.18.02.05A.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Consequently, we agree with the circuit court that the delegation of legislative authority, pursuant to which COMAR 08.18.02.05A was promulgated, did not violate Article 8 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY VACATED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR THE ENTRY OF A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION.

Apparently, personal watercraft have become increasingly popular on Maryland\u2019s waters. In the Department\u2019s view, the greater numbers of these vessels, as well as their unique characteristics, have led to dangerous boating conditions. In recommending the promulgation of the regulation, the Department's Director of Boating Administration stated that personal watercraft are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-15\">\"small, agile, extremely responsive to forward throttle, virtually unsinkable, and have extremely shallow drafts____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-17\">\"[They] are intended for fast, quick maneuvering where the operator often has spray in his/her face and the operator and passenger have the probability of falling off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-18\">In the court below, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney conceded that \"[t]here was quite obviously a need that there be some regulation of the operation of these jet skis on the Maryland waterways.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A67\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>After receiving numerous complaints, running tests, and holding public hearings, the Department determined that users under the age of fourteen lacked the maturity, experience and physical ability to control personal watercraft in a manner safe for the entire boating community.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">. The plaintiff's action is generally authorized by the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 3-401 through 3^405 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and more specifically by the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1993 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-125 of the State Government Article.

The California cases relied on by the plaintiff are <em>People v. Wright, </em>30 Cal.3d 705, 180 Cal.Rptr. 196, 639 P.2d 267, (1982), and <em>Krugler v.

To what extent, if any, the California cases require something more than sufficient guidelines for a permissible delegation of legislative power is not clear. Thus, in the <em>Clean Air Constituency </em>case, 11 Cal.3d at 816-817, 114 Cal.Rptr. at 586-587, 523 P.2d at 626-627, the Supreme Court of California stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201cAn unconstitutional delegation of power occurs when the Legislature confers upon an administrative agency the unrestricted authority to make fundamental policy determinations. <em>(Kugler v.
