Parrison was properly convicted of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, where the weapon used during the commission of the crime was an altered shotgun having one barrel measuring approximately fifteen and three-eighths inches in length and an overall length of approximately twenty-six and three-eighths inches. The specific question we face is whether Parrison\u2019s weapon falls within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d as provided by Maryland Code (1957, 1992 RepLVol.) Article 27, \u00a7 36F(e). We hold that Parrison\u2019s altered shotgun does fall within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun.\u201d Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, 333 Md. 173, 634 A.2d 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Christopher E. Parrison was convicted of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence after a trial by jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County (Smith, J., presiding). The use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence is proscribed by Article 27, \u00a7 366(d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>(d) <em>Unlawful use of handgun or antique firearm in commission of crime; </em>penalties.\u2014Any person who shall use a handgun or an antique firearm capable of being concealed on the person in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The definition of the term \u201chandgun\u201d is provided by \u00a7 36F(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">(b) Handgun.\u2014\u201cHandgun\u201d means any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person, including a short-barreled shotgun and a short-barreled rifle as these terms are defined below, except it does not include a shotgun, rifle, or antique firearm....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">A \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d is defined by \u00a7 36F(e):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">(e) <em>Short-barreled </em>shotgun.\u2014\u201cShort-barreled shotgun\u201d means a shotgun having one or more barrels less than eighteen [18] inches in length and any weapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification, or otherwise) if such weapon, as modified, has an overall length of less than twenty-six [26] inches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">A \u201cshotgun\u201d is defined by \u00a7 36F(g):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">(g) Shotgun.\u2014\u201cShotgun\u201d means a weapon designed or redesigned, made or remade, and intended to be fired from the shoulder and designed or redesigned and made or remade to use the energy of the explosive in a fixed shotgun shell to fire through a smooth bore either a number of ball shot or a single projectile for each single pull of the trigger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">At Parrison\u2019s trial, it was established that the weapon used in the commission of the crime had a single barrel which measured approximately fifteen and three-eighths inches in length and had an overall length of approximately twenty-six and three-eighths inches. It was further established that the weapon had not been manufactured to those specifications. Rather, the barrel of the shotgun had been shortened or \u201csawed-off,\u201d which reduced the overall length of the weapon from its original length of approximately thirty-six to forty inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>At the close of the State\u2019s evidence, Parrison moved for a judgment of acquittal on the \u00a7 36B(d) charge, asserting that the weapon used in the commission of the crime was not a \u201chandgun\u201d because it did not fall within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d provided by \u00a7 36F(e). Parrison contended that a shotgun which has been altered is, by reason of the alteration, a \u201cweapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification, or otherwise).\u201d Consequently, Parrison asserted that an altered shotgun falls within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d only if the overall length of the altered shotgun is less than twenty-six inches. Because the weapon used in the commission of the crime was an altered shotgun with an overall length in excess of twenty-six inches, Parrison argued that the weapon was not a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d and therefore not a \u201chandgun\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 36F(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">In denying Parrison\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, the trial judge held that Parrison\u2019s altered shotgun was a \u201cshotgun having one barrel less than eighteen inches in length\u201d and, therefore, was within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun.\u201d Parrison was subsequently found guilty of both attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals rejected Parrison\u2019s contention that an altered shotgun falls within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d only if the overall length of the weapon is less than twenty-six inches:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW_l\">Appellant focuses on only one aspect of \u00a7 36F(e) and ignores that portion of the statute which defines a shortbarrelled shotgun as \u201ca shotgun having one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length.\u201d The gun in this case had a barrel measuring fifteen and three-eighths inches in length. Accordingly, the weapon fell within the ambit of the handgun statute, and appellant was properly convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">We granted Parrison\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari to determine whether an altered shotgun having one barrel less <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>than eighteen inches in length and an overall length greater than twenty-six inches is within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d provided by \u00a7 36F(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The issue of statutory interpretation raised in this appeal requires us to determine whether the Legislature intended that an altered shotgun with a barrel measuring less than eighteen inches and an overall length in excess of twenty-six inches would fall within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun.\u201d It is well settled that the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 757 (1993). In our quest to discern legislative intent, we construe the statute as a whole and interpret the words of the statute according to their natural and commonly understood meaning. <em>Comptroller v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 732-33, 633 A.2d 93, 97-98 (1993); <em>Dickerson v. State, </em>324 Md. 163, 171, 596 A.2d 648, 652 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">Section 36B(d) was enacted as part of the Handgun Control Act of 1972, a comprehensive scheme which regulated the carrying, transport, and use of handguns and which is now codified at Article 27, \u00a7\u00a7 36B through 36F. Pursuant to \u00a7 36B(d), a defendant who uses a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence is guilty of a separate misdemeanor, independent of the underlying felony or crime of violence, and is subject to a separate minimum mandatory sentence. <em>See Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 148, 416 A.2d 265, 270 (1980); <em>Dillon v. State, </em>277 Md. 571, 584, 357 A.2d 360, 368 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In the preamble to the Handgun Control Act, the Legislature expressly pronounced the purpose of the Act\u2019s various provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-9\">(a) <em>Declaration of </em>Policy.\u2014The General Assembly of Maryland hereby finds and declares that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>(i) There has, in recent years, been an alarming increase in the number of violent crimes perpetrated in Maryland, and a high percentage of those crimes involve the use of handguns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-5\">(ii) The result has been a substantial increase in the number of persons killed or injured which is traceable, in large part, to the carrying of handguns on the streets and public ways by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2q\">(in) The laws currently in force have not been effective in curbing the more frequent use of handguns in perpetrating crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-6\">(iv) Further regulations on the wearing, carrying, and transporting of handguns are necessary to preserve the peace and tranquility of the State and to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">As we stated in <em>Wynn v. State, </em>313 Md. 533, 546 A.2d 465 (1988), \u201cthe four subsections of this preamble reflect the legislature\u2019s concerns surrounding the proliferation of death and serious injury when handguns are employed in crimes of violence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 546 A.2d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Examination of the various provisions of this statute reveals that the Legislature was acutely concerned with the use of concealable weapons when it enacted the Handgun Control Act. In \u00a7 36B(d) and in the definition of \u201chandgun\u201d provided by \u00a7 36F(b), the Legislature expressly referred to firearms that are \u201ccapable of being concealed on the person,\u201d and, in \u00a7 36F(b), identified a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d as among those firearms that an individual may easily conceal. Two categories of concealable weapons are included within the definition of \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d provided by \u00a7 36F(e): (1) \u201cshotgun[s]\u201d which have at least one barrel less than eighteen inches in length; and (2) \u201cany weapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification, or otherwise)\u201d which has an overall length of less than twenty-six inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Parrison contends that the Legislature\u2019s use of two different terms\u2014\u201cshotgun\u201d and \u201cweapon made from a shotgun\u201d\u2014in the two clauses of \u00a7 36F(e) indicates that the Legislature intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>that two mutually exclusive and distinct categories of weapons would fall within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun.\u201d Asserting that any shotgun which has been altered is a \u201cweapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification, or otherwise)\u201d within the second clause of \u00a7 36F(e), Parrison argues, by implication, that the term \u201cshotgun\u201d in the first clause of \u00a7 36F(e) must refer only to unaltered shotguns. Thus, under Parrison\u2019s construction of \u00a7 36F(e), to fall within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun,\u201d a weapon must either be (1) a shotgun which has not been altered and which, as originally manufactured, has at least one barrel less than eighteen inches in length, or (2) a shotgun which has been altered in some manner after leaving the control of the manufacturer and which, as altered, has an overall length of less than twenty-six inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">We disagree with Parrison\u2019s suggestion that the two clauses of \u00a7 36F(e) refer to mutually exclusive categories of weapons. Fundamentally, we find Parrison\u2019s contention that an altered shotgun can never be a \u201cshotgun\u201d within the meaning of the first clause of \u00a7 36F(e) to be flatly inconsistent with the plain language of the statute. Section 36F(g) explicitly defines a \u201cshotgun\u201d as a weapon that, as \u201cdesigned or redesigned, made or remade,\u201d uses fixed shotgun shells and is intended to be fired from the shoulder. In common parlance, \u201credesigned\u201d and \u201cremade\u201d are terms synonymous with \u201caltered.\u201d A facial reading of the language of \u00a7 36F(g) thus establishes beyond peradventure that a shotgun may be redesigned, remade, or altered from its original specifications and nonetheless remain a \u201cshotgun\u201d for the purposes of the first clause of \u00a7 36F(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">A shotgun may be rendered more easily concealable by shortening the barrel length or by shortening the length of the weapon\u2019s stock. As we see it, the Legislature was concerned with both types of alterations when it enacted \u00a7 36F(e) and it defined the term \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d such that both types of alterations would be addressed. A shotgun altered only in terms of its barrel length retains its character as a \u201cshotgun\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 36F(g) so long as the weapon, as altered, uses fixed shotgun shells and is capable of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>being fired from the shoulder. If the barrel length of such an altered \u201cshotgun\u201d is less than eighteen inches, the altered \u201cshotgun\u201d is a \u201cshotgun having one or more barrels less than eighteen inches in length\u201d and therefore within the first clause of \u00a7 36F(e). Such an altered \u201cshotgun\u201d thus falls within the definition of a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun,\u201d and, ergo, the definition of a \u201chandgun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In contrast, a shotgun altered at its stock may lose its status as a \u201cshotgun\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 36F(g) if the stock is shortened to such an extent that the weapon is incapable of being fired from the shoulder. We believe that the Legislature was cognizant of the possibility that alteration of the stock of a shotgun might take the weapon out of the statutory definition of \u201cshotgun\u201d provided by \u00a7 36F(g), and it was for this reason that the Legislature used the phrase \u201cany weapon made from a shotgun (whether by alteration, modification, or otherwise)\u201d in the second clause of \u00a7 36F(e). As we read the second clause of \u00a7 36F(e), the phrase \u201cany weapon made from a shotgun\u201d includes <em>both </em>altered \u201cshotguns\u201d\u2014meaning weapons that, as altered, are capable of being fired from the <em>shoulder\u2014and </em>weapons that were originally manufactured as shotguns but, by reason of an alteration, are no longer \u201cshotguns\u201d as defined by \u00a7 36F(g)\u2014meaning weapons that, as altered, are not capable of being fired from the shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In sum, we find that the two clauses of \u00a7 36F(e) refer to overlapping categories of weapons: an altered shotgun may be rendered a \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d either by shortening the barrel length to less than eighteen inches or by altering the weapon such that the overall length is less than twenty-six inches. We note that our construction of \u00a7 36F(e) and our conclusion that an altered shotgun may be a \u201cshotgun\u201d within the meaning of the first clause of \u00a7 36F(e) is supported by case law from other jurisdictions involving statutes either identical or substantially similar to the language of \u00a7 36F(e). <em>See United States v. Hall, </em>972 F.2d 67, 70 (4th Cir.1992); <em>State v. Klosowski, </em>310 A.2d 656, 657 (Del.Super.Ct.1973); <em>Gillman v. State, </em>346 So.2d 586, 588 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1977); <em>Brook v. State, </em>448 N.E.2d 1249, 1251 (Ind.Ct.App.1983); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number><em>People v. Walker, </em>166 Mich.App. 299, 420 N.W.2d 194, 195, <em>appeal denied, </em>430 Mich. 897 (1988); <em>People v. Santiago, </em>133 Misc.2d 161, 506 N.Y.S.2d 136, 141 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The weapon used by Parrison in the commission of the crime was an altered shotgun with a barrel length of fifteen and three-eighths inches. Such a shotgun clearly falls within the definition of \u201cshort-barreled shotgun\u201d provided by the first clause of \u00a7 36F(e). Accordingly, Parrison\u2019s conviction of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 36B(d) is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED, COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-11\">.
