On July 17, 1992, upon Giddens\u2019s demand for a jury trial, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Kent County. The one-day trial took place on November 19, 1992. As summarized by the Court of Special Appeals, the State put forth the following evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6f\">\u201cJames Coleman, the victim, testified that, on the evening of May 7, 1992, he was using a public telephone to converse with ... Rhonda Thorpe ... when [Giddens] drove up across the street, parked his car, and approached him. While still in the middle of the street, [Giddens] pulled out a black pistol and asked when Coleman was going to get off the phone. Coleman said that, although he knew it was a gun that [Giddens] had, he asked \u2018is that a gun you are pointing at me?\u2019 to which [Giddens], who was about three feet away, replied \u2018yes, it is. Do you have an f-ing problem with it?\u2019 At that point, Coleman ended his conversation and walked to [Ms. Thorpe\u2019s] house, leaving [Giddens] at the phone booth. Coleman said that he did not know [Giddens] at the time but learned his identity later. He stated that some time after the incident, he passed [Giddens] on the street, that [Giddens] told him that he did not have to say anything against [Giddens] in court, and that he should not have been on the corner in any event \u2018because it is a drug infested corner.\u2019 Coleman identified [Giddens] in court as the person who accosted him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">\u201cMs. Thorpe provided some corroboration for Mr. Coleman\u2019s story. The heart of her testimony was the statement: T was talking to [Coleman], and all I heard was \u201cHave you got a problem with that?\u201d [Coleman] says, \u201cIs that a gun you are holding?\u201d.... \u2019 That was the State\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Giddens denied the entire incident, claiming that Coleman had identified the wrong person. Consequently, as the intermediate appellate court said, the issue before the jury was purely one of credibility: should it believe Coleman or Giddens?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">After the State presented its case, Giddens stated his intention to testify. At that point, the prosecutor indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>that she planned to impeach Giddens\u2019s testimony with a 1989 conviction for distribution of cocaine. Giddens objected, arguing that drug distribution was not an \u201cinfamous\u201d crime nor was it a crime that had any bearing on credibility; thus, he contended that the conviction was inadmissible. The State\u2019s reply was that the crime was a felony and involved \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d; thus, it averred that the conviction was admissible to impeach Giddens\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">After noting that Rule 1-502 controls the admissibility of prior convictions for impeachment purposes, the court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cThe question is whether it would be a crime of moral turpitude. It is a felony. Therefore, he has been convicted of a felony, which requires felonious intent to commit the offense\u2014in this case, distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. The Court finds that that is ... conduct which is base or vile and contrary to the accepted and customary conduct between men. Therefore, I find that it is a crime of moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">\u201cNext, I need to determine ... whether or not its probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">\u201cIn this case, the offense for which he is being tried is a battery, which has no relationship to distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. I find that I will give a cautionary instruction and instruct them as to how they can utilize it. But I believe that the probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice in view of the charges in this case. If this were a charge of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance, I would have a different finding. But in view of the charges and the difference, I will permit [the introduction of the conviction] over objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Following this ruling, Giddens testified and admitted on direct examination that in 1989 he had been convicted of distribution of cocaine and that he had gone to prison. At the close of all the evidence, the court instructed the jury that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>could consider Giddens\u2019s prior conviction in deciding whether he was telling the truth, but not for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The jury found Giddens guilty of assault; he was sentenced to 15 years incarceration, with all but eight years suspended, and five years supervised probation upon release. Giddens appealed to the Court of Special Appeals; that court, by a divided 2-1 vote, reversed the judgment, of the circuit court. <em>See Giddens v. State, </em>97 Md.App. 582, 631 A.2d 499 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his opinion, Chief Judge Wilner first described the operation of Rule 1-502, explaining that \u201cadmissibility is <em>not </em>determined by whether the crime in question is a felony or by whether it involves moral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 631 A.2d 499 (emphasis in original). He continued: \u201calthough moral turpitude was once a relevant consideration in determining what crimes were usable as impeachment material, the Court of Appeals expressly departed from that standard in <em>Prout v. State, </em>311 Md. 348, 535 A.2d 445 (1988) [ (plurality opinion) ].\u201d 97 Md.App. at 589, 631 A.2d 499. Rather, Judge Wilner observed that a prior conviction is only admissible for impeachment purposes if it is an \u201cinfamous crime\u201d or an \u201cother crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588, 631 A.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">It was then explained that the primary issue before the court was whether the offense of distribution of cocaine fell within the category of an \u201cother crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 631 A.2d 499. After noting that simple possession of controlled dangerous substances is not a crime relevant to credibility, Judge Wilner held that distribution of cocaine is similarly not relevant to credibility. He pointed out that distribution could entail a person selling a ton of cocaine throughout the community or it could encompass a friend giving another friend a marijuana cigarette. From this, he concluded that the name of the offense says very little about the conduct for which the person was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>590-91, 631 A.2d 499. Therefore, he believed that the crime was so \u201cill-defined\u201d that a jury would have difficulty determining the precise nature of the offense and would likely assume the worst. <em>Id. </em>at 591-92, 631 A.2d 499. He also found it noteworthy that drug distribution \u201cdoes not necessarily involve surreptitious conduct or moral depravity sufficient to suggest a lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 591, 631 A.2d 499. Consequently, Judge Wilner held for the majority that \u201cdistribution of a controlled dangerous substance is not a crime relevant to credibility and may not ... be used under Rule 1-502 for impeachment purposes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 592, 631 A.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Judge Motz \u201creluctantly\u201d concurred in the result. She said that she was \u201ctroubled\u201d by the holding \u201cthat a conviction for distribution of a controlled dangerous substance is <em>never </em>admissible for impeachment purposes under Md.Rule 1-502.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 593, 631 A.2d 499. (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, she concurred with Chief Judge Wilner because she believed that our precedent required that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">In his dissenting opinion, Judge Joseph Murphy stated his belief that \u201c[a] conviction for distribution of cocaine is relevant to a person\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 631 A.2d 499. He also suggested that if a particular prior cocaine distribution conviction had no bearing on a witness\u2019s credibility, the witness could relate the circumstances of the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 631 A.2d 499. Specifically, he stated that if Giddens\u2019s prior \u201cdistribution conviction involved nothing more than handing a mirror with cocaine residue to a fellow attendee of a rock concert, this information should have been given to the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In essence, Judge Murphy appeared to be advocating that a trial judge could, upon a request by a defendant, examine the circumstances of the prior conviction to determine if it had a bearing on credibility. He concluded that, because Giddens did not put forth any evidence that the prior cocaine distribution conviction was a minor violation that had no bearing on credibility, the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the conviction was correct. The State appealed and we granted its petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Before us, the State reasserts its contention that a prior conviction for distribution of cocaine is relevant to credibility. It does not suggest that cocaine distribution is an infamous crime, but rather maintains that the offense is an \u201cother crime relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility\u201d and as such is admissible for impeachment purposes under Rule 1-502. In addition, the State argues that the crime of cocaine distribution has a commonly understood meaning and is not so \u201cill-defined\u201d that the fact finder would be put in a position of speculating what the witness did to be convicted of the crime. It urges us to reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment and reinstate the judgment of the Circuit Court for Kent County.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Giddens maintains that a prior conviction for drug distribution is irrelevant to credibility. He points to the definition of the crime and concludes that there is nothing in the definition that requires any degree of stealth, surreptitiousness, secretiveness, or effort to avoid detection. He also contends that the crime of drug distribution encompasses so broad a spectrum of behavior as to bring within its ambit conduct that is not probative at all of a person\u2019s credibility. For example, Giddens argues, handing a marijuana cigarette to a friend at a party or sharing a small quantity of cocaine falls within the definition of drug distribution but says nothing about an individual\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Giddens further claims that practical problems would arise if a prior conviction for drug distribution could be used to impeach a witness. He notes that, because some types of drug distribution may reflect on a witness\u2019s credibility, while other instances of drug distribution have no bearing on a witness\u2019s veracity, trial judges would need to look beyond the name of the offense to determine if the prior conviction was relevant to credibility. Giddens claims that mini-trials, where trial judges attempt to parse out the underlying facts of the prior conviction, would routinely occur. According to Giddens, such a result would encourage judicial inefficiency and would be inconsistent with our prior decisions which hold that only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the name of the offense and the sentence imposed be introduced for impeachment purposes. Therefore, he asks us to affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and rule, as a matter of law, that drag distribution is not probative of a lack of veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Rule 1-502 essentially creates a three-part test for determining whether prior convictions may be admitted for impeachment purposes. First, subsection (a) sets forth the \u201celigible universe\u201d for what convictions may be used to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility. This universe consists of two categories: (1) \u201cinfamous crimes\u201d and (2) \u201cother crimes relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Infamous crimes include treason, common law felonies, and other offenses classified generally as <em>crimen falsi.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> See Morales v. State, </em>325 Md. 330, 338, 600 A.2d 851 (1992); <em>Prout, supra, </em>311 Md. at 360, 535 A.2d 445. If a crime does not fall within one of the two categories, then it is inadmissible and the analysis ends. This threshold question of whether or not a crime bears upon credibility is a matter of law. <em>See Prout, supra, </em>311 Md. at 365-66, 535 A.2d 445 (Eldridge, J., and Smith, J., concurring); <em>id. </em>at 367, 535 A.2d 445 (McAuliffe, J., and Murphy, C.J., dissenting).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>If the crime falls within one of the two categories in the eligible universe, then the second step is for the proponent to establish that the conviction was not more than 15 years old, that it was not reversed on appeal, and that it was not the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 1-502(b), (c). Finally, in order to admit a prior conviction for impeachment purposes, the trial court must determine that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or objecting party. <em>See </em>Md. Rule l-502(a). <em>See also Beales, supra, </em>329 Md. at 270-73, 619 A.2d 105 (holding that a trial court must perform this balancing test both for infamous crimes and for other crimes relevant to credibility). This third step is clearly a matter of trial court discretion. The crux of this case focuses on the first step\u2014determining if distribution of cocaine falls within the eligible universe of crimes which may be used to impeach a witness. More specifically, we consider whether a prior conviction for distribution of cocaine impacts on the credibility of a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">At common law, one who had been convicted of treason, any felony, a misdemeanor involving dishonesty, or crimes relating to the obstruction of justice, was considered incompetent to testify at any trial. <em>See McCormick on Evidence </em>(John William Strong ed., 4th ed. 1992) \u00a7 42, at 142. Therefore, at common law, an individual convicted of an \u201cinfamous crime\u201d was disqualified from testifying. <em>Prout, supra, </em>311 Md. at 359, 535 A.2d 445. In 1864, the General Assembly abrogated this prohibition. Chapter 109 of the Acts of 1864 permitted a person who had been convicted of an infamous crime to testify, but also allowed that person\u2019s credibility to be impeached by introducing the prior conviction. That statute retained its original substance for over 125 years. <em>See Prout, supra, </em>311 Md. at 358-59, 535 A.2d 445. As of 1988, it was embodied in Maryland Code (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.) \u00a7 10-905 of the Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Prout, supra, </em>311 Md. at 358-59, 535 A.2d 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In <em>Wicks v. State, </em>311 Md. 376, 384 n. 5, 535 A.2d 459 (1988), we indicated that this area of the law required further consideration. Consequently, Rule 1-502 was drafted, redrafted numerous times, and eventually adopted by this Court on November 1, 1991; it became effective January 1, 1992. <em>See </em>18 <em>Maryland Register </em>2622 (November 29, 1991). As previously stated, the precise issue in this case is whether distribution of cocaine is a crime that is probative of a person\u2019s veracity and thus is potentially admissible for impeachment purposes under Rule 1-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We first note that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cIn a purely philosophical sense it can be said, understandably, that all violations of the law, by their very nature, involve some element of dishonesty. Thus, one could argue that jay walking, spitting on a sidewalk, running a red light or a stop sign, and exceeding the speed limit, however slightly, are \u2018dishonest\u2019 because they involve acts for which one can be punished by the State or its subdivisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\"><em>Gregory v. State, </em>616 A.2d 1198, 1204 (Del.1992). Nevertheless, we have determined that certain crimes have little or no bearing on credibility and consequently are not admissible for impeachment purposes. <em>See, e.g., Morales, supra, </em>325 Md. at 339, 600 A.2d 851 (possession of PCP, assault and battery, disorderly conduct, and motor vehicle offenses); <em>Lowery v. State, </em>292 Md. 2, 2, 437 A.2d 193 (1981) (possession of barbiturates); <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 713-14, 436 A.2d 906 (1981) (indecent exposure). <em>See also Wallach v. Board of Education, </em>99 Md.App. 386, 391-92, 637 A.2d 859 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>(holding that a prior conviction for conspiracy to distribute marijuana is not admissible for impeachment purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">It is interesting to note that the question before us today was considered at a public meeting conducted by the Court on October 24, 1991, immediately prior to final adoption of Rule 1-502. Our discussion clearly indicates that we foresaw the issue at that time, but decided to not address it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As that discussion predicted, the day has arrived and the issue is now squarely before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">As already observed, we have held that a prior conviction for simple possession of narcotics has no bearing on credibility. <em>See Morales, supra, </em>325 Md. at 339, 600 A.2d 851 (possession of PCP); <em>Lowery, supra, </em>292 Md. at 2, 437 A.2d 193 (possession of barbiturates). <em>See also Cason v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 757, 774, 505 A.2d 919 (1986) (\u201cA prior conviction for possession of heroin is not admissible for impeachment purposes.\u201d). But we have never expressly considered whether a conviction for drug dealing\u2014whether it be drug manufacturing, drug distribution, or possession of drugs with intent to sell\u2014is probative of a lack of veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">In <em>Carter v. State, </em>80 Md.App. 686, 566 A.2d 131 (1989), the Court of Special Appeals determined that a prior conviction for drug manufacturing could be used to impeach a testifying defendant. There, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201c[Ajppellant\u2019s prior conviction for manufacturing drugs is relevant to the issue of his credibility. This particular crime necessarily requires several steps involving premeditation and conscious violation of the law\u2014acquisition of the raw materials for making drugs, processing the material, and finding a means of distributing the drugs. Furthermore, all of these acts must be carried out surreptitiously to avoid detection and arrest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 693, 566 A.2d 131. It also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cWe believe that drug manufacturing ... is relevant to the issue of appellant\u2019s propensity to tell the truth. A person who has committed crimes that posed grave danger to the fabric of society, that only could have been carried on furtively, and that required him to take great pains to conceal his conduct, would probably not be adverse to concealing the truth if it is to his advantage to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAY\"><em>Id. </em>at 694, 566 A.2d 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Similarly, we believe that an individual convicted of cocaine distribution would be willing to lie under oath. \u201c[A] narcotics trafficker lives a life of secrecy and dissembling in the course of that activity, being prepared to say whatever is required by the demands of the moment, whether the truth or a lie.\u201d <em>United States v. Ortiz, 553 </em>F.2d 782, 784 <em>(2nd </em>Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 897, 98 S.Ct. 277, 54 L.Ed.2d 183 (1977). Therefore, we hold that a prior conviction for distribution of cocaine is relevant to credibility and as such is admissible for impeachment purposes, subject to the other conditions that exist in Eule 1-502.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">We are aware that under article 27, \u00a7 286,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the definition of distributing a controlled dangerous substance may include activity that would have little bearing on a witness\u2019s credibility. That is, \u00a7 <em>217(1) </em>defines \u201cdistribute\u201d as \u201cto deliver\u201d a controlled dangerous substance, and \u201cdeliver\u201d is defined in \u00a7 277(i) to mean \u201cthe actual, constructive, or attempted trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>fer, exchange, or delivering of a controlled dangerous substance from one person to another with or without renumeration.\u201d Consequently, Giddens\u2019s contention that some activity which has little bearing on truthfulness, such as passing a marijuana cigarette to a Mend at a party or concert, is included within the technical definition of drug distribution is not unreasonable. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded by Giddens\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Although, in theory, some activity that falls within the definition of drug distribution would not be probative of an individual\u2019s lack of veracity, the vast majority of convictions for cocaine distribution are relevant to credibility. As to this, we quote with approval from Judge Murphy\u2019s dissenting opinion below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\u201cWe do indeed see many drug cases, but of the cocaine <em>distribution </em>cases which come before the trial and appellate courts of this state, rare are the ones that do not involve surreptitious behavior. That appellant was sentenced \u2018to prison\u2019 indicates that he was guilty of a serious violation of the controlled dangerous substance laws. There is simply no warrant to declare all cocaine distribution convictions ineligible for impeachment because a minuscule number of them may not entail secretive behavior.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\"><em>Giddens, supra, </em>97 Md.App. at 596, 631 A.2d 499. (emphasis in original). We share the belief that a person will rarely be convicted of cocaine distribution if that person merely gives a small quantity of cocaine to a Mend at a party. Rather, those convicted of cocaine distribution are almost always \u201cdrug dealers\u201d in the traditional sense and it is reasonable to conclude that a person is less credible because he or she is a convicted drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The crime of cocaine distribution is not so \u201cill-defined\u201d that a jury would have difficulty determining the precise nature of the offense. The offense is unlike that involved in <em>Ricketts, supra, </em>291 Md. at 713-14, 436 A.2d 906 (holding that, because the crime of \u201cindecent exposure\u201d is so ill-defined that it causes the fact finder to speculate as to what conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>impacting on the witness\u2019s credibility, it should be excluded). Concededly, it may be difficult to determine what a defendant convicted of \u201cindecent exposure\u201d may have done; distribution of cocaine, however, has a well understood meaning within the community and the name of the crime permits the fact finder to assess what, if any, impact such conviction has upon a witness\u2019s veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Other courts have similarly concluded that a prior conviction for drug dealing is relevant to a witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See State v. Pierce, </em>107 Idaho 96, 685 P.2d 837, 844 (1984) (although court said that it would be a strain to characterize delivery of heroin as a crime of dishonesty, it held that that offense \u201chad probative value on the question of credibility\u201d because a person who has committed such a crime shows disrespect for the law and may not take an oath seriously); <em>People v. Washington, </em>85 Ill.App.3d 522, 40 Ill.Dec. 954, 958, 407 N.E.2d 185, 189 (1980) (stating that \u201cIllinois courts have consistently determined that a conviction for the unlawful possession or delivery of controlled substances would be the type of conviction which would be probative of credibility and would afford a basis for impeaching credibility\u201d); <em>State v. Lagares, </em>247 N.J.Super. 392, 589 A.2d 630, 633 (1991), <em>aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, </em>127 N.J. 20, 601 A.2d 698 (1992) (concluding that prior convictions for possession of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute marijuana \u201cclearly have a bearing on [a] defendant\u2019s credibility\u201d); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>277 Or. 45, 559 P.2d 496, 497 (1977) (In Banc) (\u201cDefendant\u2019s previous conviction of criminal activity in drugs was relevant to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility.\u201d). <em>See also Ortiz, supra, </em>553 F.2d at 784 (determining that prior conviction for heroin sales may be admissible to impeach). Many federal courts that admit narcotics offenses for impeachment purposes, however, generally do so only upon a showing by the government that the specific facts of the prior offense involved conduct reflecting dishonesty or false statement. <em>See United States v. Mehrmanesh, </em>689 F.2d 822, 833 n. 13 (9th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Hastings, </em>577 F.2d 38, 41 (8th Cir.1978); <em>McCormick on Evidence, supra, </em>\u00a7 42, at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>On the other hand, some courts have determined that a prior conviction for drug dealing is not probative of an individual\u2019s lack of veracity. <em>See State v. Geyer, </em>194 Conn. 1, 480 A.2d 489, 497 (1984) (concluding that prior convictions for possession and sale of narcotics have \u201cno special or direct materiality to [a] defendant\u2019s credibility\u201d); <em>Gregory, supra, </em>616 A.2d at 1204 (determining that drug-related offenses, such as possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, do not involve dishonesty and thus do not relate to credibility); <em>State v. Zaehringer, </em>325 N.W.2d 754, 755-58 (Iowa 1982) (holding that delivery of marijuana does not involve dishonesty or false statement); <em>State v. Hall, </em>246 Kan. 728, 793 P.2d 737, 751 (1990), <em>aff'd, on appeal after remand, </em>252 Kan. 669, 847 P.2d 1288 (1993) (\u201cIt has long been the rule in this state that drug offenses are not crimes involving dishonesty and, therefore, cannot be admitted for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness.\u201d). <em>See also Mehrmanesh, supra, </em>689 F.2d at 833 (concluding that a prior conviction for smuggling hashish into the United States, although it involves surreptitious activity, does not bear directly on the likelihood that the defendant would testify untruthfully); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>626 F.2d 940, 946 (D.C.Cir.1980) (rejecting the government\u2019s argument that the crime of heroin distribution involves dishonesty or false statement).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">As we have said, however, we agree with the former line of cases holding that such a conviction is relevant to credibility. After determining that the crime of cocaine distribution falls within the eligible universe of offenses that may be used for impeachment purposes, we proceed to the second step which requires us to ensure that the conviction was not more than 15 years old, that it was not reversed on appeal, and that it was not the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal. <em>See </em>Md. Rule l-502(b), (c). In the instant case, the conviction was three years old and was not reversed on appeal or the subject of a pardon or a pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Finally, the third step requires the trial court to determine that the probative value of the prior conviction outweighs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the danger of unfair prejudice to the objecting party. <em>See </em>Md. Rule l-502(a). In the case at bar, the trial court adequately performed this balancing test. It said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\u201c[AJfter finding that it is a crime of moral turpitude, I need to determine whether or not its probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice to the witness or the objecting party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cIn this case, the offense for which he is being tried is a battery, which has no relationship to distribution of a controlled dangerous substance. I find that I will give a cautionary instruction and instruct them as to how they can utilize it. But I believe that the probative value of admitting the evidence outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice in view of the charges in this case. If this were a charge of distribution of controlled dangerous substance, I would have a different finding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Although the trial court improperly used the term \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d it nevertheless properly weighed the probative value against the danger of prejudice. We note that when a trial judge weighs the probative value against the prejudicial effect, an \u201cimportant factor to remember is that a prior conviction which is similar to the crime for which the defendant is on trial may have a tendency to suggest to the jury that if the defendant did it before he probably did it this time.\u201d <em>Prout, supra, </em>311 Md. at 364, 535 A.2d 445. Indeed, the Court of Special Appeals has held that a defendant\u2019s prior conviction for drug distribution is inadmissible in a subsequent drug distribution case because \u201cthe probative value of [the prior drug distribution conviction] was clearly outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>Dyce v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 193, 199, 582 A.2d 582 (1990).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s discussion in the instant case evidences its understanding of the balancing process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>Moreover, we reiterate that only the name of the conviction, the date of the conviction, and the sentence imposed may be introduced to impeach a witness. <em>See Foster v. State, </em>304 Md. 439, 469-70, 499 A.2d 1236 (1985). A trial court should never conduct a mini-trial by examining the circumstances underlying the prior conviction. The Reporter\u2019s Note prepared by the Reporter of the Rules Committee, accompanying an earlier proposal of Rule 1-502, supports this common sensical approach.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201cThe Subcommittee intends that the offenses be viewed categorically and that the court <em>not </em>examine the specific facts underlying the prior conviction. The marginal gain in probative value on the question of credibility in a particular case [is] likely to be substantially outweighed by the expenditure of judicial resources necessary to examine the facts underlying prior convictions in every case.\u201d (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In the instant case, the trial court appropriately declined to examine the underlying facts of Giddens\u2019s prior conviction for cocaine distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">We therefore conclude that the trial court properly admitted Giddens\u2019s prior conviction for distribution of cocaine for the limited purpose of impeaching his credibility. Consequently, his conviction for assault should have been affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
