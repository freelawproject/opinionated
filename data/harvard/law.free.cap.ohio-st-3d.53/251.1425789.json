We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The BTA\u2019s determination of true value is a question of fact and will not be disturbed by this court except upon an affirmative showing that the decision is unreasonable or unlawful. <em>Bd. of Revision of Cuyahoga Cty. </em>v. <em>Fodor </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St. 2d 52, 44 O.O. 2d 30, 239 N.E. 2d 25. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the BTA on factual issues, <em>Buckeye Power, Inc. </em>v. <em>Kosydar </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St. 2d 137, 64 O.O. 2d 82, 298 N.E. 2d 610, and we will not overrule its findings of fact if based upon sufficient probative evidence. <em>Hawthorn Mellody, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St. 2d 47, 19 O.O. 3d 234, 417 N.E. 2d 1257.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Moreover, the BTA is not required to adopt the opinion of any expert but has the authority to determine the facts. <em>Snider </em>v. <em>Limbach </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St. 3d 200, 542 N.E. 2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Although the only testimony presented to the BTA was that of appellant\u2019s appraiser, it was not necessary for the BTA to accept his approach to value or to agree with Ms suggested valuation. Appellant\u2019s expert witness admitted on cross-examination that he had not relied on sales of units by owners other than appellant within Banbury Village and that he had not attempted to independently appraise any of the separate units. Rather, Van Curen developed total value from the application of his capitalization rate to income received and expenses incurred. He then divided this amount by the number of condomimum townhouse units owned by appellant. The result, $13,714, was less than the original sale price of units, which ranged from $18,000 to $22,000. This, according to Van Curen, was an additional indication of the decline in value of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The BTA, on the other hand, received evidence of deeds reflecting sale prices between $19,500 and $26,000 per unit. There is no suggestion that the sale prices shown in the deeds related to anything other than arm\u2019s-length transactions. During the evidentiary hearing before the BTA, appellant objected to the admission of the latest three of the deeds on the basis that they were for sales too remote in time from tax lien date, January 1, 1985. Without deciding whether these three transactions occurred within a reasonable time of tax lien date we find that all six deeds constitute some evidence of the true value of the subject property.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">Appellant\u2019s constitutional arguments based upon uniformity of taxation, due process, and the equal protection of the laws are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">First, as to uMformity of taxation, the BTA\u2019s determination of true value was in compliance with Section 2, Article XII of the OMo Constitution and R.C. 5713.01. <em>State, ex rel. Park Investment Co., </em>v. <em>Bd. of Tax Appeals </em>(1964), 175 Ohio St. 410, 25 O.O. 2d 432. 195 N.E. 2d 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">Next, appellant\u2019s argument that its property was taken without due process on the contention that the BTA\u2019s assessment was \u201carbitrarily made and grossly excessive\u201d as ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>vanced in <em>Great Northern Ry. </em>v. <em>Weeks </em>(1936), 297 U.S. 135, fails because the facts here are easily distinguishable. The BTA\u2019s determination was neither arbitarily made nor grossly excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Finally, there is no factual or decisional support for appellant\u2019s claim of denial of equal protection of the law under the Constitution of the United States. The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Allied Stores of Ohio </em>v. <em>Bowers </em>(1959), 358 U.S. 522, 527, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u201c* * * [The state] is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value. * * * [Citations omitted.] \u2018To hold otherwise would be to subject the essential taxing power of the State to an intolerable supervision, hostile to the basic principles of our Government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to assure.\u2019 <em>Ohio Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Conway </em>* * * [1930], 281 U.S. [146], at 159.\u201d See, also, <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St. 2d 328, 335, 12 O.O. 3d 305, 309, 390 N.E. 2d 796, 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We find no violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights and we find that the decision of the BTA is supported by substantial probative evidence, is reasonable and lawful and it is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-9\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
