Johnson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 384, 533 N.E. 2d 775, syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Apgar, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St. 3d 5, 535 N.E. 2d 1364. Appellant submitted no such evidence here, claiming that such proof is unnecessary since the ten-percent permanent partial disability determination entitles her as of right to compensation for impaired earning capacity, the amount of which is to be computed using the ten-percent figure. However, because this proposition was conclusively rejected in <em>Johnson, </em>appellant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-24\">Appellant also asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>commission had no jurisdiction to consider the employer\u2019s motion for a hearing on impaired earning capacity since no application for reconsideration had been filed. This argument, too, fails. Former R.C. 4123.57(B) provided in part that the commission cannot modify a permanent partial disability percentage absent a timely reconsideration request. Westinghouse, however, did not seek modification of the ten-percent figure; it requested a hearing to determine impaired earning capacity. A determination under former R.C. 4123.57(A) entails two steps \u2014 an initial determination of the percentage of partial disability, followed by a hearing to determine <em>actual </em>impaired earning capacity. <em>State, ex rel. Bittinger, </em>v. <em>NACCO Mining Co. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St. 3d 30, 31, 550 N.E. 2d 172, 173. A motion for reconsideration under former R.C. 4123.57(B) goes to the first step; Westinghouse\u2019s motion for a hearing to determine impairment of earning capacity went to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-7\">Moyer, C.J., Holmes, Wright, H.
