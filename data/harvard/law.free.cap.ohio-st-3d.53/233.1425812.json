Assn. </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St. 2d 13, 73 O.O. 2d 83, 336 N.E. 2d 433, paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 205, 207, 11 OBR 523, 524, 465 N.E. 2d 50, 52, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">\u201cThis court has consistently held that the BTA is not obligated to adopt the valuation by any expert or witness. * * * Moreover, the BTA possesses wide discretion in evaluating the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses which come before it. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u201cA great deal of appellants\u2019 argument is devoted to the rebuttal of appellees\u2019 expert\u2019s testimony. Ultimately they conclude that none of his conclusions is credible enough to be relied on by the BTA. <em>However, such a determination is precisely the kind of factual matter to be decided by the BTA. </em>It is clear from the record that the BTA\u2019s final determination represented a compromise between the conflicting positions of the two experts. * * *\u201d (Citations omitted and emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Appellant contends that the BTA erred in not following the mandate of paragraph one of the syllabus of <em>Beckett Ridge Assn. </em>v. <em>Bd. of Revision </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St. 3d 40, 1 OBR 74, 437 N.E. 2d 601, which requires a consideration of all relevant factors specified in R.C. 5713.03 and Ohio Adm. Code, 5705-3-07 in making its determination of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">After referring to the four principal methods of valuation of real estate, we noted in <em>Beckett Ridge </em>that: \u201cIt is incumbent upon the Board of Tax Appeals to consider all the factors referred to in the statute and administrative code for assigning a proper value to appellant\u2019s * * * [real estate]. The Board of Tax Appeals with its expertise is the appropriate agency to develop a viable standard to be used in applying the parameters defined by statute and rule to the facts in each case * * <em>Id. </em>at 43, 1 OBR at 76-77, 437 N.E. 2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">In <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 16, 523 N.E. 2d 826, we reversed the BTA\u2019s decision with regard to certain property, in part because the BTA did not state specific reasons for reversing its initial valuation upon reconsideration. We held that it was \u201cnot enough for the BTA to simply state that its additional study\u201d compelled its conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 25, 523 N.E. 2d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">We can perform our duty to affirm reasonable, and to reverse unreasonable, determinations only when the BTA sets forth its findings and the basis therefor. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 195, 197, 524 N.E. 2d 887, 889. We do not suggest that the true value determinations of the BTA were inappropriate; rather that, in the absence of clarification, we are unable to decide whether the decision of the BTA was reasonable and lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Since the BTA failed to specify the reasons for its determinations, its decision is reversed and the cause is remanded to the BTA for further consideration in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-15\">Moyek, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Re snick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
