R. 12(B)(2), Mitchell\u2019s moved to dismiss appellant\u2019s complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. The trial court, on that basis, dismissed the complaint and the court of appeals affirmed. Thus, we must first decide whether Mitchell\u2019s conduct falls within Ohio\u2019s \u201clong-arm statute\u201d or applicable civil rule, and if the statute or civil rule confers personal jurisdiction, then we must determine whether granting jurisdiction comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Fallang </em>v. <em>Hickey </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 106, 532 N.E. 2d 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">In this appeal, personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is governed by R.C. 2307.382, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u201c(A) A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who acts directly or by an agent, as to a cause of action arising from the person\u2019s:</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u201c(1) <em>Transacting any business in this </em>state;</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">* *</p>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">\u201c(C) When jurisdiction over a person is based solely upon this section, only a cause of action arising from acts enumerated in this section may be asserted against him.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">Likewise, the applicable civil rule is Civ. R. 4.3(A)(1), which authorizes out-of-state service of process on a defendant who is \u201c* * * [transacting any business in this state[.]\u201d Mitchell\u2019s argues that, pursuant to Section 5(B), Article IV.of the Ohio Constitution,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Civ. R. 4.3(A)(1) supersedes R.C. 2307.382(A)(1). We disagree and find that the statute and civil rule are consistent and in fact complement each other. R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) authorizes a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, whereas Civ. R. 4.3(A)(1) provides for service of process to effectuate that jurisdiction. Both require that the nonresident defendant be \u201ctransacting any business\u201d in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Appellant asserts that the negotiations prior to the signing of the lease, and the subsequent duties and obligations created by the agreement, are sufficient to establish that Mitchell\u2019s is transacting business in Ohio. Mitchell\u2019s, on the other hand, contends that because the physical location of the leased storeroom is in Kentucky, it is Kentucky, not Ohio, where all business is transacted. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-17\">It is clear that R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ. R. 4.3(A)(1) are very broadly worded and permit jurisdiction over nonresident defendants who are <em>transacting any </em>business in Ohio. \u201cTransact,\u201d as defined by Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 1341, \u201c* * * means to <em>prosecute negotiations', </em>to carry on business; <em>to have dealings </em>* * *. The word embraces in <em>its meaning the carrying on or prosecution of business negotiations </em>but it is a <em>broader term than the word \u2018contract\u2019 and may involve business negotiations </em>which have been either wholly or partly brought to a conclusion * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-18\">In the case at bar, Mitchell\u2019s negotiated the lease by telephone contact to Ohio with an Ohio-based limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>partnership. Mitchell\u2019s intentionally and voluntarily entered into a ten-year contract by signing the document in Georgia and mailing it to Ohio. The document creates ongoing duties and obligations for the life of the contract. Undoubtedly, both parties sought the benefit of each other\u2019s bargain in hopes of realizing a pecuniary gain. The fact that Mitchell\u2019s maintained no physical presence in Ohio does not preclude a finding that it transacted business in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Thus, we are convinced that Mitchell\u2019s conduct falls unequivocally within the plain and broad language of R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ. R. 4.3(A)(1). Similarly, our finding is reinforced by the fact other courts have passed on this issue reaching the same result, to-wit: that a lease agreement, in certain circumstances, is \u201ctransacting business\u201d within the forum state\u2019s long-arm statute. See, <em>e.g., Wright Internatl. Express, Inc. </em>v. <em>Roger Dean Chevrolet, Inc. </em>(S.D. Ohio 1988), 689 F. Supp. 788; <em>Vena </em>v. <em>Western General Agency, Inc. </em>(N.D. Ill. 1982), 543 F. Supp. 779; <em>Klippel </em>v. <em>Heintz </em>(1982), 231 Kan. 312, 644 P. 2d 428; <em>Schanno Transp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(Minn. 1981), 312 N.W. 2d 114; <em>SD Leasing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Al Spain &amp; Assoc., Inc. </em>(1982), 277 Ark. 178, 640 S.W. 2d 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Accordingly, we hold that a commercial nonresident lessee, for purposes of personal jurisdiction, is \u201ctransacting any business\u201d within the plain and common meaning of the phrase, where the lessee negotiates, and through the course of dealing becomes obligated, to make payments to its lessor in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Once having decided that the conduct of Mitchell\u2019s falls within the purview of R.C. 2307.382(A)(1) and Civ. R. 4.3(A)(1), the question becomes whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction by an Ohio court over Mitchell\u2019s comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Over forty years ago, in <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1945), 326 U.S. 310, the court announced that a state may assert personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if the nonresident has \u201c* * * certain minimum contacts with it such that maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 316. Since 1945, the court, on numerous occasions, has elected to address the Due Process Clause as it pertains to personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. In particular, for purposes of this appeal, we turn our attention to <em>Burger King Corp. </em>v. <em>Rudzewicz </em>(1985), 471 U.S. 462, which involved a contract dispute substantially similar to the issue presented before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">In <em>Burger King, </em>Rudzewicz, a franchisee residing in Michigan, was sued in Florida by Burger King, a Florida-based corporation, for breach of contract and trademark infringement. The contract was negotiated with both the Florida-based headquarters of Burger King and its Michigan district office. The twenty-year lease provided that the relationship would be governed by Florida law and it required that all monthly fees and relevant notices be sent to the Florida headquarters. The court ruled that the assertion of jurisdiction did not offend due process and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">\u201c* * * Rudzewicz established a substantial and continuing relationship with Burger King\u2019s Miami headquarters, received fair notice from the contract documents and the course of dealing that he might be subject to suit in Florida, and has failed to demonstrate how jurisdiction in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>forum would otherwise be fundamentally unfair * * <em>Id. </em>at 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Justice Brennan, in writing for the majority of the court, reviewed prior cases and concluded that \u201c* * * the constitutional touchstone remains whether the defendant <em>purposefully </em>established \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 in the forum State. <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>at 316.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 474. The nonresident defendant has purposefully established minimum contacts \u201c* * * where the contacts proximately result from actions by the defendant <em>himself </em>that create a \u2018substantial connection\u2019 with the forum State * * * where the defendant \u2018deliberately\u2019 has engaged in significant activities within a State <em>* * * or </em>has created <em>\u2018continuing obligations\u2019between </em>himself and residents of the forum * * * he manifestly has availed himself of the privilege of conducting business there, and because his activities are shielded by \u2018the benefits and protections\u2019 of the forum\u2019s laws it is presumptively not unreasonable to require him to submit to the burdens of litigation in the forum as well.\u201d (Citations omitted and emphasis added in part.) <em>Id. </em>at 475-476. Furthermore, minimum contacts are satisfied when the defendant foreseeably causes injury in the forum state if \u201c \u201c * * the defendant\u2019s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court-there.\u2019 <em>* * *\u201d Id. </em>at 474 (quoting <em>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </em>v. <em>Woodson </em>[1980], 444 U.S. 286, 297).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Justice Brennan also noted that the question of whether personal jurisdiction exists does not end with a finding that the nonresident defendant has purposely established minimum contacts and stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u201cOnce it has been decided that a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the forum State, these contacts may be considered in light of other factors to determine whether the assertion of personal jurisdiction would comport with <em>fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 </em>* * * Thus courts in \u2018appropriate cases [s]\u2019 may evaluate \u2018the burden on the defendant,\u2019 \u2018the forum State\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute,\u2019 \u2018the plaintiff\u2019s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\u2019 \u2018the interstate judicial system\u2019s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies,\u2019 and the \u2018shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\u2019 * * * <em>These considerations sometimes serve to establish the reasonableness of jurisdiction upon a lesser showing of minimum contacts than would otherwise be required. </em>* * * On the other hand, where a defendant who purposefully has directed his activities at forum residents seeks to defeat jurisdiction, he must present a compelling case that the presence of some other considerations would render jurisdiction unreasonable.\u201d (Citations omitted and emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 476-477.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">In light of the guidelines articulated above, and after a thorough review of the record before us, it is apparent that Mitchell\u2019s <em>purposefully directed </em>activities at an Ohiorbased limited partnership, so that it could <em>reasonably anticipate being haled into </em>an Ohio court. Moreover, it is equally evident that the assertion of personal jurisdiction over Mitchell\u2019s comports with <em>fair play and substantial justice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Mitchell\u2019s conducted negotiations of the lease terms by telephone contact to Ohio with appellant, an Ohio-based limited partnership. Mitchell\u2019s intentionally and <em>purposefully </em>directed activities at Ohio when it agreed to the contract terms, signed the document in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Georgia and sent it to Ohio to be signed by appellant. The ten-year lease requires that Mitchell\u2019s submit to appellant on a monthly or annual basis rental payments, maintenance costs, association fees and sales reports. If Mitchell\u2019s refuses to make the contractually required payments in Ohio, as alleged by appellant, such refusal will undoubtedly cause foreseeable injuries. Further, Mitchell\u2019s is not provided with unfettered control of its retail sale and rental operation. The lease calls for appellant\u2019s approval in many areas and also restricts or regulates many activities. Mitchell\u2019s is also aware that all communications need be directed to appellant in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Mitchell\u2019s, as does the court of appeals, urges that because the lease explicitly states that Kentucky law controls the rights of the parties, Mitchell\u2019s is not shielded by the benefits and protections of Ohio law, and, therefore, it could not reasonably have anticipated being haled into an Ohio court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Although the lease contains a choice-of-law provision, this, standing alone, does not automatically defeat a finding that minimum contacts exist. <em>Burger King, supra, </em>at 478. Whether a nonresident defendant purposefully established minimum contacts with the forum depends.upon the dealings between the parties prior to and following the document\u2019s execution, contemplated future consequences, <em>along with the terms </em>of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 479. We are aware that the choice-of-law provision may be a significant factor in the overall picture; however, considering Mitchell\u2019s dealings and the creation of continuing duties and obligations with appellant, we are satisfied that the guidelines set forth in <em>Burger King </em>have been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Having found that Mitchell\u2019s purposefully established minimum contacts with Ohio, it now remains only to inquire whether the assertion of jurisdiction comports with \u201cfair play and substantial justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">Initially, we find that the burden on Mitchell\u2019s is not excessive. Again, in <em>Burger King, supra, </em>the court noted that \u201c* * * because \u2018modern transportation and communications have made it much less burdensome for a party sued to defend himself in a State where he engages in economic activity,\u2019 it usually will not be unfair to subject him to the burdens of litigating in another forum for disputes relating to such activity. <em>McGee </em>v. <em>International Life Insurance Co. </em>[(1957), 355 U.S. 220], * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 474. Mitchell\u2019s, a Georgia corporation, operates one hundred one stores throughout the Southeastern United States and Kentucky. Based on Mitchell\u2019s extensive operations, the fact that it elected to establish a store bordering appellant\u2019s state and considering today\u2019s modern means of transportation, it is not unreasonable for Mitchell\u2019s to defend itself in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Finally, appellant\u2019s and the forum state\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute is strong. The General Assembly, pursuant to R.C. 2307.382(A)(1), intended to provide a forum for Ohio residents. Likewise, \u201c* * * Ohio has an interest in resolving suits brought by one of its residents and has a substantial interest in seeing that its residents get the benefit of their bargains. * * *\u201d <em>Wright Internatl. Express, Inc., supra, </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and find that the trial court had an adequate basis upon which to assert personal jurisdiction over Mitchell\u2019s. The cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Aiy\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-14\"> Section 5(B), Article IV of the Ohio Constitution states in relevant part: \u201c* * * All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
