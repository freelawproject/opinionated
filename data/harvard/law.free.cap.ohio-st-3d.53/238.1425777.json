Burley, </em>v. <em>Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St. 3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E. 2d 936; <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O. 3d 518, 433 N.E. 2d 586. Appellant disputes only the commission\u2019s finding that his condition was not permanent. Upon review, however, we find some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">A disability\u2019s permanency \u201crelates solely to the perceived longevity of the condition at issue.\u201d <em>Vulcan Materials Co. </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St. 3d 31, 33, 25 OBR 26, 27, 494 N.E. 2d 1125, 1127. The term \u201cpermanency\u201d refers to \u201ca condition which will, * * with reasonable probability, continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">In the case before us, Dr. Braunlin stated in his report of September 17, 1986:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">\u201cI feel that he [claimant] has likely reached maximal recovery unless he attends a chronic pain and stress center which I feel might be quite helpful in dealing with the multitude of problems of which he still complains. * * * Unless additional improvement is made in a rehabilitation type program, I feel that he has likely reached maximal recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">Dr. Braunlin\u2019s comments are susceptible to differing interpretations. Given his suggestion that claimant may benefit from attendance at a chronic pain and stress clinic, we find that the commission\u2019s interpretation of that report did not constitute an abuse of discretion. It is thus some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s conclusion that claimant\u2019s disability was not yet permanent. The appellate court\u2019s decision is affirmed in part with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-16\">We note that the commission made further temporary total disability compensation contingent on the submission of medical evidence indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>claimant\u2019s continued inability to return to his former position of employment. That evidence, however, must also support a finding that claimant\u2019s condition remains temporary. We, therefore, reverse and remand the court of appeals\u2019 decision in part and direct that court to issue a limited writ ordering the commission to base continued temporary total disability compensation on satisfaction of <em>all Ramirez </em>criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part, reversed in part and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b300-6\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
