Appellant contends that retrial is prohibited for two reasons, both of which involve the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Following briefing and oral argument in this court regarding appellant\u2019s challenge to retrial, we requested that the parties to this appeal brief the following issue for our consideration:</p>\n<p id=\"b304-13\">\u201c[W]hether <em>denial </em>of a motion to dismiss a charge on the basis of double jeopardy is a final appealable order in accordance with the criteria set forth in R.C. 2505.02.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) State </em>v. <em>Crago </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St. 3d 708, 550 N.E. 2d 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-14\">Upon consideration of this question, we find that the overruling of a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy is <em>not </em>a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-15\">R.C. 2505.03(A) states, in relevant part, that: \u201c[e]very <em>final order </em>* * * may be reviewed on appeal * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">R.C. 2505.02<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defines what types of orders are \u201cfinal.\u201d The denial of a motion to dismiss a charge on the basis of double jeopardy does not meet, for purposes of being a final order, any one of the three prongs of R.C. 2505.02 as set forth therein. Therefore, the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy is not a final order which may immediately be reviewed upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">R.C. 2953.02 provides that, in a criminal case, the court of appeals may review a \u201cjudgment or final order.\u201d However, the denial of a motion to dismiss on the basis of double jeopardy is not a \u201cfinal order\u201d within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ing of R.C. 2953.02 as the definition of \u201cfinal order\u201d contained in R.C. 2505.02 is applicable to criminal proceedings. See, <em>e.g., State </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 107, 108, 53 O.O. 2d 302, 302-303, 265 N.E. 2d 261, 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Accordingly, we find that appellant\u2019s claims of double jeopardy were never properly before the court of appeals and, consequently, we vacate the judgment of the appellate court. In doing so, we recognize that the court of appeals was bound by our prior decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 254, 15 O.O. 3d 262, 400 N.E. 2d 897, paragraph one of the syllabus, wherein it is stated that:</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u201cThe overruling of a motion to dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy <em>is </em>a final appealable order under R.C. 2953.02 and 2505.02 <em>(Owens </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>[(1971),] 27 Ohio St. 2d 264, [56 O.O. 2d 158, 272 N.E. 2d 116], overruled).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">We find, however, that paragraph one of the syllabus in <em>Thomas </em>is incorrect and it is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Given the procedural disposition of this case, it is not now necessary for this court to rule on appellant\u2019s claim that his retrial is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">\n<em>Judgment vacated and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-11\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, H.
