Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments on the Attorney General\u2019s draft ballot title. Accordingly, they may petition this court seeking a different ballot title. ORS 250.085(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Petitioner Collis asserts that the caption, result statements, and summary in the certified ballot title are unsatisfactory. Petitioners O\u2019Connell-Babcock, Troen, and Rowe challenge the result statements and summary. We have considered each of petitioners\u2019 arguments and conclude that none of those arguments establishes that the Attorney General\u2019s certified ballot title fails to comply substantially with the standards for a ballot title set out in ORS 250.035(2)(a) to (d). A detailed discussion of our reasons for that conclusion would not serve the interest of the bar or the public. Accordingly, we certify to the Secretary of State the following ballot title:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-6\">AMENDS LAWS REGULATING LICENSING, CONTROL, IMPOUNDMENT AND KILLING OF DOGS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-7\">RESULT OF \u201cYES\u201d VOTE: \u201cYes\u201d vote repeals current laws regulating dogs; restricts circumstances when dogs may be impounded/killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">RESULT OF \u201cNO\u201d VOTE: \u201cNo\u201d vote retains current laws regulating dogs and establishing when dogs may be impounded/killed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">SUMMARY: Measure repeals current state laws regulating dogs; establishes minimum standards for ordinances, regulations governing when dogs may be impounded for more than ten days or killed. Requires determination that owner/keeper will not properly care for dog or will again allow dog to become a public nuisance before such impoundment or killing of dog permitted. Establishes notification, mediation and appeal procedures for enforcement actions. Allocates portion of penalties paid by dog owners/keepers to programs to reduce animal abandonment/increase animal adoption rates. Other changes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(10).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
