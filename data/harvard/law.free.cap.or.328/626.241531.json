After a trial in which it denied affirmative relief to both plaintiff<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and defendants, the court designated only defendants as the prevailing party. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that neither party was the prevailing party. <em>Wilkes v. Zurlinden, </em>146 Or App 371, 932 P2d 584, <em>vac\u2019d and rent\u2019d </em>325 Or 489, 940 P2d 518 (1997), <em>on remand </em>152 Or App 130, 952 P2d 569 (1998). For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, modify the judgment of the circuit court, and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">In May 1992, plaintiff, a construction contractor, entered into a written contract with defendants to build a house for defendants in Medford. The contract contained an attorney fees provision, under which plaintiff was entitled to fees if he instituted suit or employed an attorney to collect money under the contract. Early in 1993, defendants ordered plaintiff to cease work on the project and to leave the premises. Thereafter, plaintiff filed this action for breach of contract, seeking $19,080.42 in economic damages and attorney fees. Defendants filed an answer denying that they had breached the contract. They also filed a counterclaim against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>plaintiff alleging breach of contract and negligence, and seeking affirmative relief. Defendants sought $103,201 in economic damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">After a trial to the court, the court issued a memorandum decision in which it found \u201cin favor of defendants and against the plaintiff on plaintiffs claim and in favor of plaintiff and against the defendants on their counterclaim.\u201d Consequently, the court did not award damages to either party, and it ordered each party to pay its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Defendants\u2019 proposed form of judgment stated that defendants were the prevailing party. Plaintiff objected. The trial court overruled plaintiffs objection, designated defendants as the prevailing party, and awarded them attorney fees in the amount of $7,500.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Although plaintiff had sought attorney fees at the trial court level, which the trial court denied, on appeal plaintiff assigned error only to the trial court\u2019s designation of defendants as the prevailing party for purposes of an award of attorney fees. Plaintiff argued that, because neither party succeeded on its claim or counterclaim, neither was the prevailing party under ORS 20.096(5). Consequently, he maintained, neither party was entitled to an award of attorney fees under the contract. As noted, the Court of Appeals agreed with plaintiff and reversed the trial court. <em>Wilkes, </em>146 Or App at 377. On petition for review of that decision, this court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Anderson v. Jensen Racing, Inc., </em>324 Or 570, 931 P2d 763 (1997), and <em>Domingo v. Anderson, </em>325 Or 385, 938 P2d 206 (1997). On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its original opinion, reasoning that neither of those cases was relevant to the issue in this case. <em>Wilkes, </em>152 Or App at 133-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Defendants again petitioned for review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On review, they argue that, because they defeated plaintiffs claim against them, the trial court properly designated them as the prevailing party under ORS 20.096(5), and they are entitled to attorney fees under the contract. Plaintiff repeats the same argument here that he made to the Court of Appeals: Because neither party prevailed on its claim or counterclaim, final judgment was not rendered in favor of either party. Consequently, plaintiff contends, neither party is entitled to an award of attorney fees. We conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, both parties are prevailing parties under ORS 20.096(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Generally, a party is not entitled to an award of attorney fees unless such an award is authorized by statute or by a specific contractual provision. <em>Mattiza v. Foster, </em>311 Or 1, 4, 803 P2d 723 (1990). As noted above, the construction contract at issue in this case contains an attorney fees provision. Our analysis of the attorney fees issue begins with that provision. <em>See Anderson, </em>324 Or at 578 (court begins analysis of attorney fees issue with contract provision); <em>Domingo, </em>325 Or at 389 (same). In this case, the attorney fees provision in the parties\u2019 contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">\u201cIn the event that it becomes necessary to institute suit or to employ an attorney to collect any payment or payments due the undersigned for labor or material furnished under this agreement or any modifications thereof, then you shall be liable to the undersigned for corut costs and attorney\u2019s fees. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Although that attorney fees provision purports to entitle only plaintiff to an award of attorney fees, such one-sided attorney fees provisions are made reciprocal by ORS 20.096(1). <em>See Niedermeyer v. Latimer, </em>307 Or 473, 476, 769 P2d 771 (1989) (ORS 20.096(1) makes contractual attorney fees provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>reciprocal but does not itself authorize an award of attorney fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The parties agree that whichever party \u201cprevailed\u201d in this action is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d under ORS 20.096(5) and, therefore, is entitled to attorney fees under the contract. According to that statute, the prevailing party in an action on a contract is \u201cthe party in whose favor final judgment is rendered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Determining the party in whose favor final judgment has been rendered can be complicated when multiple claims and counterclaims are involved. <em>See Anderson, </em>324 Or at 582-83 (Durham, J., concurring) (discussing complexity of determining which party is \u201cprevailing party\u201d when number of claims multiplies and when nonmonetary, as well as monetary, relief is granted). This court has held that, when there are claims and counterclaims on the same contract, and both parties are awarded affirmative relief in the form of damages, the court nets the damage awards in determining the party in whose favor final judgment is rendered. <em>See Carlson v. Blumenstein, </em>293 Or 494, 499-501, 651 P2d 710 (1982) (so holding and demonstrating procedure).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In this case, by contrast, neither party was granted affirmative relief and neither was awarded damages. However, each party succeeded in defeating the other\u2019s claim. This court has held that, if a plaintiff takes nothing on its claim, then the defendant is the prevailing party under ORS 20.096 and is entitled to an award of attorney fees. <em>See American Petrofina v. D &amp; L Oil Supply, </em>283 Or 183, 199-200, 583 P2d 521 (1978) (interpreting <em>former </em>ORS 20.096(3) (1977), <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 20.096(5) (1979)). The question thus narrows to whether ORS 20.096(5) prevents the <em>American Petrofina </em>rationale from applying here, where plaintiff takes nothing on its claim and defendants take nothing on their counterclaim. In analyzing that statute, we follow the statutory construction methodology summarized in <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-11, 859 P2d 1143 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\"> ORS 20.096(5) defines the prevailing party in an action as \u201cthe party in whose favor final judgment or decree is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>rendered.\u201d That subsection refers to \u201cthe\u201d party in the singular, which suggests that, under the statute, there can be only one prevailing party in an action. However, ORS 20.096(1) provides context for the construction of ORS 20.096(5). As noted above, ORS 20.096(1) makes one-sided contractual attorney fees provisions reciprocal. The reciprocity provision in that section applies to <em>\u201cany </em>action or suit\u201d on a contract that contains an attorney fees provision. An action on a contract seeking affirmative relief can be in the form of a claim or a counterclaim. <em>Rogue River Management Co. v. Shaw, </em>243 Or 54, 58-60, 411 P2d 440 (1966). Reference to \u201cthe\u201d prevailing party in ORS 20.096(1) and in ORS 20.096(5) does not exclude the possibility of more than one prevailing party when there is both a claim and a counterclaim on a contract and each party succeeds in defeating the other party\u2019s claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">As noted, in this case, plaintiff took nothing on his claim, and defendants took nothing on their counterclaim. Under the rationale of <em>American Petrofina, </em>both are prevailing parties. The next question is whether that conclusion is inconsistent with this court\u2019s holding in <em>Carlson, </em>293 Or at 499-501.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In our view, it is not. <em>Carlson </em>also involved a construction contract dispute. The plaintiffs sought damages for the defendants\u2019 failure to perform the construction work properly, and the defendants asserted three counterclaims. <em>Id. </em>at 497. However, unlike the parties here, both parties in <em>Carlson </em>prevailed on their claims and were awarded damages. This court held that, in those circumstances, the damage awards should be \u201cnetted\u201d to determine the party in whose favor judgment was rendered. <em>Id. </em>at 501. Because neither party in this case was awarded damages, the \u201cnetting\u201d procedure prescribed by <em>Carlson </em>is not possible, making <em>Carlson </em>inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Because defendants defeated plaintiffs claim, they are the party in whose favor final judgment was rendered on plaintiffs claim. Similarly, because plaintiff defeated defendants\u2019 counterclaim, he is the party in whose favor final judgment was rendered on defendants\u2019 counterclaim. Consequently, both are prevailing parties on the claims on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>they successfully defended. The trial court erred in designating only defendants as the prevailing party under ORS 20.096(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">As to plaintiffs appeal, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The judgment of the circuit court is modified to designate plaintiff the prevailing party on defendants\u2019 counterclaim, and the case is remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-6\"> ORS 20.096 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\u201c(1) In any action or suit on a contract, where such contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs incurred to enforce the provisions of the contract shall be awarded to one of the parties, the prevailing party, whether that party is the party specified in the contract or not, at trial or on appeal, shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to costs and disbursements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201c(5) Except as provided in ORS 20.015, as used in this section and ORS 20.097 \u2018prevailing party\u2019 means the <em>party in whose favor final judgment or decree is rendered.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> Contemporaneously with this action, defendants filed a claim with the Construction Contractors Board (CCB) against Allen Wilkes and Shirley Wilkes. However, Allen Wilkes was plaintiff in the circuit court action, which is the only action at issue on review. We refer to plaintiff in the singular.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\"> In December 1993, the CCB stopped processing defendants\u2019 claim because of the pendency of the circuit court proceeding. After it received a certified copy of that judgment, the CCB entered a final order awarding defendants $7,500 in attorney fees. Plaintiff sought judicial review of the CCB order, which was consolidated with plaintiffs appeal from the circuit court judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b709-8\"><em> </em>After allowing review, we discovered that the judgment appealed from in this case did not comply with ORCP 70 A(l)(a). Rather than dismissing the appeal for lack of a final judgment, this court gave the circuit court leave under ORS 19.270(4) to enter one or more judgments finally disposing of all claims in the action. The circuit court entered an amended judgment that dismissed with prejudice plaintiffs claim against defendants and dismissed with prejudice defendants\u2019 counterclaim against plaintiff. Plaintiff timely filed an amended notice of appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
