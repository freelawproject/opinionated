Willow Street runs approximately north and south; Valley Street, east and west. At the time of the accident two sets of street car tracks ran along the center of Valley Stre\u00e9t.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">Just before the accident occurred Beauchamp was walking north on the easterly sidewalk of Willow Street. It was about 8:30 o\u2019clock in the evening. He testified that as he \u201cgot to the corner of the fence\u201d at Valley Street he looked to his right as far as he could see, a distance of two hundred feet, \u201cand it was absolutely clear\u201d; there \u2018 \u2018 was no vehicle of any sort coming. \u201d He then looked to his left and saw an automobile approaching from the west on Valley Street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Believing that he \u201chad ample time to cross the street,\u201d he \u201cstarted to cross over,\u201d and as he \u201cwas going across\u201d he kept \u201clooking at this car\u201d in order to \u201cget by all right.\u201d He was about to look east again when the accident occurred. He was then in the lane between the two tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">While the defendant\u2019s evidence tended to prove that the accident happened farther to the west (indicating that Beauchamp may have taken a somewhat diagonal course), it did not controvert Beau-champ\u2019s assertion that he had not reached the northerly set of tracks when he was struck by the defendant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">There was abundant evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. It could be found that he approached the intersection at an excessive rate of speed and without signaling in any manner, and that he did not see Beauchamp until he was within a foot of him. Although he claimed to have been blinded by the lights of a car parked at the southwesterly corner of the intersection, he did not reduce his speed. Moreover, the driver of the eastbound car testified definitely that no car was parked \u201caround there anywhere.\u201d There was no error in the denial of the defendant\u2019s motions. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Temple, </em>86 N. H. 170, 171; <em>Feuerstein </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>86 N. H. 406; <em>Nicholaides </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>86 N. H. 465; <em>Carlin </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>89 N. H. 52, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In his argument to the jury plaintiff\u2019s counsel said: \u201cAre we bound by the testimony of Mr. Strusa that he was going twenty to twenty-five miles an hour? . . . Don\u2019t you think he may have been going a little more than that? You don\u2019t have to believe he was going only twenty-five miles an hour if you don\u2019t want to. . . . There is no testimony except that of Mr. Strusa that he was going twenty-five miles an hour. You have in connection with that the fact he struck Ludger Beauchamp with such force that he was hurled fifteen to eighteen feet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">The Presiding Justice permitted this argument to stand, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">The driver of the eastbound automobile testified that the defendant was thrown \u201ca distance of fifteen to eighteen feet\u201d by the impact, that \u201chis arms and legs were all spread out\u201d and that he \u201cwas doing the spread-eagle, so to speak.\u201d The left fender of the defendant\u2019s car was damaged by the force of the blow and the headlight was knocked off and left hanging. The defendant first said that his speed was about twenty miles an hour and that he was \u201cslowing down\u201d as he approached the intersection, but after an extended cross-examination he finally admitted that he was \u201cgoing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>twenty to twenty-five miles an hour\u201d when he \u201cstruck Mr. Beau-champ.\u201d In view of these circumstances it was permissible to argue that the defendant was driving at a greater speed than he was willing to admit. See 15-16 Huddy, Automobile Law (9th <em>ed,.), </em>s. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"AZh\">The defendant excepted to the granting of one of the plaintiff\u2019s requests for instructions. This request is not printed in the reserved case but is quoted in the defendant\u2019s brief as follows: \u201c It is not necessarily negligent for a pedestrian, when crossing a street, to postpone careful scrutiny of traffic approaching on his right until the lane occupied by such traffic is reached.\u201d This request comprises a sentence taken from the opinion in <em>Feuerstein </em>v. <em>Grady, </em>86 N. H. 406, 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">- The Presiding Justice did not grant the request without appropriate modification. He said: \u201cNow, Gentlemen, while it was not necessarily negligent for the plaintiff to postpone a careful scrutiny of traffic approaching from the east until he reached the lane normally occupied by this traffic, here again it will be for you to say whether in this case under all the circumstances he acted reasonably. If he didn\u2019t act reasonably, if he didn\u2019t act with the care of the ordinary man of average prudence in crossing that street, then you will find the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence, and your verdict will be for the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The defendant does not question the correctness of this instruction as a legal proposition, but suggests that since the question whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law was for the court, it was not only unnecessary but prejudicial to tell the jury that a person might properly do just what the plaintiff claimed he was doing. The defendant\u2019s rights were not prejudiced by the instruction. The exposition of a principle of law in general terms is not always adequate. <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Souther, </em>83 N. H. 29, 34. Throughout the trial defendant\u2019s counsel emphasized the contention that Beauchamp was at fault for walking \u201cmore than halfway across Valley Street without once looking to the east.\u201d In order that the jury might have an intelligent understanding of the issue submitted, the Presiding Justice was clearly warranted in dealing as he did with this particular request. See <em>Stowe </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>91 N. H. 261, 264. \u201cThe fairness of a trial requires that the charge shall inform the jury what the law is in its application to the case, when a proper request therefor is made.\u201d <em>Simoneau </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>78 N. H. 363, 365.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-9\">Branch, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
