Morton Rosenblum, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-7\"><em>Wyman, Starr, Booth, Wadleigh &amp; Langdell (Mr. Booth </em>orally), for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-8\">Marble, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACF\">In the absence of evidence of the New Jersey law, by which the rights of the parties are governed <em>(Gray </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>87 N. H. 82, 83, and cases cited), the Presiding Justice was warranted in applying the law of the forum on the assumption that the common law of New Jersey is the same as that here in force. <em>Trafton </em>v. <em>Garnsey, </em>78 N. H. 256, 257; <em>Saloshin </em>v. <em>Houle, </em>85 N. H. 126, 134; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, s. 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">In this jurisdiction the rule prevails that a defendant may be liable for a negligent misrepresentation which results merely in financial loss <em>(Weston </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>82 N. H. 157) as well as for one which causes physical injury <em>(Cunningham </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 435). In each case the defendant\u2019s conduct is said to be wrongful only when it contravenes some duty which the law attaches to the relation of the parties, and it is not unreasonable for the law, in recognition of comparative values, \u201cto find a relationship and to impose a duty\u201d <em>(Dillon </em>v. <em>Company, </em>85 N. H. 449, 453) less readily in those cases where pecuniary loss alone results from the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation than in those cases where the negligent misstatement causes physical harm. See <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Lamb, </em>69 N. H. 599; Seavey, \u201c Cardozo and the Law of Torts,\u201d 52 Harv. Law Rev. 372, 401. As in most actions for negligence, each case depends in large measure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>upon its own facts, and no hard and fast line may be drawn. <em>International &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>244 N. Y. 331, 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\">The misstatements in the present instance were not made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to enter into any transaction in which the defendant had a financial interest. He \u201cwasn\u2019t in the rug business\u201d and he had no authority to purchase rugs for the Y.M.C.A. The evidence indicates unmistakably that Garapedian was not misled as to either of these facts. Indeed, Dodge\u2019s remarks on the subject made so little impression on him, or were so indefinite, that he could not recall them in detail. All his dealings were with Dodge alone, and the declaration contains no allegation that the plaintiff was led to believe that the defendant was a silent partner or otherwise interested in Dodge\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">The defendant obtained nothing of value from the plaintiff, no credit was extended to Dodge on December 16, no goods were sold or consigned to him at that time, and Garapedian had some doubt about his ever returning. The statements which the defendant made to Garapedian concerning Dodge\u2019s integrity were voluntary' and purely gratuitous.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Professor Bohlen finds in such representations a similarity to \u201cthe turning over to another of land or chattels for the other\u2019s use,\u201d and suggests that if the gratuitous lender of a chattel is not liable for an injury to the borrower caused by a defect in the chattel of which the lender is unaware <em>(Gagnon </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>69 N. H. 264), no more should the individual be liable who in good faith, \u201ceither as a volunteer or by request, gratuitously gives\u201d to another individual information concerning a business matter in which the informant has no financial interest. 42 Harv. Law Rev. 733, 741, 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">It is unnecessary to decide whether this view can be completely reconciled with the views expressed in such cases as <em>Conway National Bank </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>76 N. H. 319, 324, and <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>79 N. H. 11, 13. But in each of those cases the negligent representation concerned a material fact, and whatever the rule may be in such a situation, we have no hesitancy in holding that where, as here, the representation relied on is a mere expression of opinion, given under such circumstances as those here disclosed, no duty of \u201cpreparatory care \u201d (42 Harv. Law Rev. 733, 743) or subsequent investigation concerning its correctness devolves upon the defendant. See <em>Trenton Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>187 Atl. Rep. (N. J.), 569, 574, affirmed 121 N. J. Eq. 85; <em>Berman v. Corporation, </em>109 N. J. Eq. 256, 261. See also, <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Colley, </em>6 N. H. 99, 102; <em>Bedell </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>28 N. H. 118, 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>But even if such a duty were held to exist in the present case, the defendant would nevertheless be entitled to a directed verdict, since the plaintiff has failed to sustain the burden of proof on the issue of contributory negligence \u2014 a burden which it must assume, since section 13 of chapter 384 of the Revised Laws applies only to \u201cactions on the case for personal injury or injury to personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">The defendant was an utter stranger to Garapedian, and he knew no more about him or about Dodge than each told him about the other. He testified, to be sure, that he believed that his secretary \u201casked the bank\u201d for information concerning the defendant, but he did not state what, if any, information was obtained, nor when the inquiry was made. It does not appear that the secretary asked the bank about Dodge, and there is positive testimony to the effect that in 1939 Dodge\u2019s reputation for \u201chonesty and dependability\u201d was not good. Indeed, the trial court has found that at the time the misrepresentations were made Dodge \u201cwas not living within his means but was in financial difficulty, and that fact was well known throughout the community in which he lived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Garapedian was not an illiterate Armenian unused to American business methods. On the contrary, he was a graduate of an American university of high standing and had been engaged in business for fifteen years. As the plaintiff\u2019s president and treasurer he operated a factory and maintained a sales floor in a metropolitan area. The evidence compels the conclusion that he was thoroughly familiar with credit reports and the conventional method of securing them, yet he failed \u201cto utilize obvious means of checking up\u201d the accuracy of the defendant\u2019s statements (42 Harv. Law Rev. 733, 740) and placed reliance on them merely because he understood from Dodge that the defendant was a \u201cprominent citizen,\u201d the general agent of an insurance company, and a director of the Manchester Y.M.C.A., and because he was \u201cdressed nice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">A finding that the plaintiff was free from fault contributing to its loss could not properly be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
