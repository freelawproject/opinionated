We are told that \u201cThe whole legislative history of the statute indicates the intention of the legislature to limit the ordering of allowances, except in the limited exception provided in the statute and in those cases in which extreme hardship other than financial loss might be sustained by one of the parties.\u201d We find nothing in the language of the statute or in its legislative history which indicates a purpose on the part of the legislature to limit the power of the court to make orders for support in divorce proceedings except in the matter of duration. No limitation to cases of \u201cextreme hardship other than financial loss\u201d is perceived. The effect of the statute is to bring up such orders for reconsideration every three years, but the power of the court to make such orders \u201cas may be deemed just\u201d is in no way limited. Here, at the end of the statutory period, the matter was properly reconsidered by the court and the libelee was given substantial relief. The situation of the libelant, as reported by the probation department, fully justified the order for further payments in the sum of $30 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
