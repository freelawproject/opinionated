When the accident occurred he was operating a gasoline-driven section car and proceeding easterly on the defendant\u2019s track toward North Berwick, Maine. He was seated at the left rear of the car facing east. His sole companion, a rail inspector, Stewart Cheney by name, \u201cwas seated on the right forward corner of the car\u201d and \u201cwas looking upward and back northerly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">The track at Indigo Hill Crossing was guardrailed. The channel or ffangeway, so called, between each main rail and the adjoining guardrail was at least five inches deep, an inch and three-quarters wide at the top, and five or six inches wide at the bottom. The plaintiff contended at the trial that stones large enough to derail the section car had been allowed to accumulate on the rails or in these fiangeways and that the accident was caused either by these stones or by a defective wheel on the section car or by both.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The defendant\u2019s evidence tended to prove that an automobile driven by George H. Yeaton, approaching the crossing from the south, struck the right side of the section car; that the rear end of the section car was thereby raised from the rails and strong pressure exerted against the left forward wheel, which, though properly inspected and in perfect condition, broke under the strain. Cheney testified that he \u201cfelt a crash,\u201d the \u201ccar jolted,\u201d there was a \u201cwrenching of metal,\u201d and he found himself \u201cgoing through the air.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>He \u201clanded in the middle of the track,\u201d and the plaintiff\u2019s intestate lay immediately ahead of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">The section car was not overturned, but the metal fenders covering the right-hand wheels were broken off and a gasoline can, which had been placed directly back of one of the fenders, was dented and scratched. The fenders and can are before us as exhibits. The fenders are scratched and bent; the can is dented and a portion of its red paint scraped off. There was evidence that scratches and a spot of red paint appeared on the bumper of Yeaton\u2019s automobile after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The plaintiff first brought action against Yeaton, alleging that her intestate\u2019s death was occasioned by the derailment of the section car caused by the impact of Yeaton\u2019s automobile. At the trial of the present action she denied that the automobile struck the section car at all and introduced some evidence to that effect. Yeaton, who was eighty-nine years old, was unable to appear at the trial but testified by deposition that he \u201cdid not hit Mr. Dade\u2019s car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The plaintiff stated that after bringing suit against Yeaton she found, on further investigation, \u201cthat there was no record at Concord of his automobile being involved in this accident,\u201d and she intimated that her suit was dropped for that reason. Thereupon, the defendant offered to prove that the sum of two thousand dollars was paid her in settlement of the case. The exception to the exclusion of this evidence need not be considered since, in our opinion, the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Although the section car did not tip over on its right side, the plaintiff offers no explanation for the broken fenders and the dented can. The wheel was composed of a \u201cdemountable tire\u201d (including spokes, tread, and flange) and a \u201cbolted hub\u201d \u2014 the two parts being \u201cheld together with four bolts.\u201d The hub was strengthened on the inner side of the wheel by eight sprocket-like projections known as reinforcing webs. These webs were welded to the cylindrical portion of the hub and to a supporting disk, which was bolted to the demountable tire. All eight of the reinforcing webs broke away from the disk when the wheel collapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Gilmore E. North, who picked up the pieces of the broken wheel shortly after the accident, professed to have discovered a flaw \u201con the hub.\u201d He stated that \u201con the hub of the wheel or the hub, the spoke that was broken there was the bright part of the new break and there was the discoloration of where the flaw was.\u201d He further described the \u201cappearance of the break\u201d as a \u201cplace on the hub on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>arm\u201d which \u201chad been broken off of the spoke, half of it was discolored, the other half was bright.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While these descriptions are clumsily phrased, it is fairly apparent that the witness was trying to assert that he had detected evidence of a crack in one of the reinforcing webs, which, to quote the words of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, \u201clook like spokes.\u201d There is no claim that there was a flaw in one of the large metal spokes of the wheel. The cylindrical part of the hub with the broken webs attached, which was introduced as an exhibit, completely refutes North\u2019s assertion. No breaks appear which are not fresh and clean. The cylindrical portion of the hub is not broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In the light of the evidence furnished by the various exhibits, the case might well be disposed of under the general rule that oral testimony must yield to indisputable physical facts. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Mailhot, </em>89 N. H. 240; <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>91 N. H. 304, 308; <em>Labor </em>v. <em>Company, ante, </em>256. But the oral testimony in the present case, quite apart from this particular rule, is insufficient, even if entirely true, to justify the submission of the issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">None of the experts who testified at the trial expressed an opinion concerning the effect on the wheel of a flaw such as that described by North. The testimony on which the plaintiff relies merely embodies such inept generalizations as that if a crack in the hub \u201cwere large enough to be a source of danger it would be detectable,\u201d that if the wheel of a section car breaks while the car is \u201cgoing along on an open track\u201d it \u201cmust be a defective wheel,\u201d that a crack in steel \u201cwill run unless stopped,\u201d and that \u201cthe more of the fins [webs] that were broken the more it would tend to weaken the wheel.\u201d A careful examination of the record fails to disclose any evidence tending to prove that a crack in a single reinforcing web would so far weaken the wheel as to cause it to break under the conditions claimed by the plaintiff. That such a consequence would be likely to result from such a defect is not a matter of common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">On the day of the accident trucks had passed over the crossing loaded with gravel for use on a certain construction project then in progress. It was the plaintiff\u2019s contention that stones falling from these trucks onto the rails or into the fiangeways had caused the derailment. No witness testified, however, to having seen a stone of any substantial size near the rails or any stone in a position to interfere with the safe passage of traffic. The testimony on the subject may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">A state motor-vehicle inspector who came immediately to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>scene of the accident saw down in the flangeways \u201ca few stones\u201d of the kind used for cement work; they were \u201cabout the size of a walnut\u201d or \u201ca little larger.\u201d (The depth of the flangeways, as already stated, was at least five inches.) Fifteen or twenty minutes after the accident a woman standing at the side of the road some distance from the crossing saw some men \u201ckicking what seemed to be like little rocks out from the track,\u201d and \u201cone man\u201d (she believed him to be a workman on the \u201cconstruction job\u201d) stooped down, and \u201che had his fingers in between the rails and he was digging out and like a little rock came out of the rail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The defendant\u2019s division engineer stated that section cars might be easily derailed by \u201cstriking objects on the rail\u201d and so were equipped with guards designed to \u201csweep obstructions off the top of the rail.\u201d The section car in question was so equipped. Stewart Cheney testified that he found \u201csmall stones\u201d in the flangeways which \u201cmight have dropped out of the end of trucks\u201d but none \u201cof any particular size.\u201d He observed nothing in the flangeways \u201cwithin at least three and possibly four inches of the top of the rail.\u201d This space left \u201csufficient clearance for the flange on the motor [section] car to run.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">It is plain that the foregoing testimony furnishes no data on which to base a reasonable inference that the section car was derailed because of stones on the rails or in the flangeways. The most that it indicates is the possibility that the accident may have been due to such a cause, and this court has repeatedly held that an issue of fact which depends wholly on conjecture cannot properly be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that she was entitled to go to the jury \u201cthrough the mere fact of derailment\u201d is untenable. The doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>is inapplicable where, as here, the accident may have been due to some cause other than the defendant\u2019s negligence. <em>Boucher </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 91, 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act \u201cdoes not make the carrier an insurer of the safety of its employees\u201d <em>(Sweeney </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>87 N. H. 90, 93) and since the plaintiff has failed to sustain the requisite burden of proof on the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence <em>(Watkins </em>v. <em>Hustis, </em>79 N. H. 285), the order must be</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b322-10\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>On Motion for Rehearing. After the foregoing opinion was filed the plaintiff moved for a rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b323-5\">Marble, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aog\">The plaintiff charges the defendant in effect with the suppression and fabrication of evidence and asserts that the record contains no intimation of an admission on her part that the material exhibits introduced by the defendant at the trial are authentic.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Direct evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s accusation is wanting. There is evidence, it is true, that some parts of the broken wheel were lost in the office of the defendant\u2019s supervisor of work equipment, but this evidence is merely persuasive, at most, and cannot serve as a substitute for proof of definite defects. <em>Jakel </em>v. <em>Brockelman, </em>91 N. H. 453, 455; <em>Login </em>v. <em>Waisman, </em>82 N. H. 500, 502. Furthermore, the applicability of the rule that a nonsuit is not ordered on evidence introduced by the defendant <em>(Fox </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>88 N. H. 355, 359; <em>Giroux </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>85 N. H. 355, 356, and cases cited) may be conceded, and yet the plaintiff cannot prevail. For, as stated in the opinion, there is no evidence that the defect which North claimed to have discovered was a substantial factor in causing the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">\n<em>Motion denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-12\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
