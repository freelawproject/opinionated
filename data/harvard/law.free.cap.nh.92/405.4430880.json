An affirmative finding that they had knowledge of these facts could not properly be based solely on their appearance and manner of testifying. <em>Albee </em>v. <em>Osgood, </em>79 N. H. 89, 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">But even if they possessed such knowledge, they were not necessarily disqualified. The evidence plainly indicates that the recovery of a verdict against the defendant would not, in any reasonable likelihood, have meant an increase in the premiums charged the policyholders of the automobile company or the levying of an assessment against them; and it is the rule in this jurisdiction that \u201ca juror may have a minute and remote interest\u201d in the outcome of the cause and yet \u201cbe found indifferent.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawtelle, </em>66 N. H. 488, 529; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>75 N. H. 613, 618; P. L., c. 321, s. 31 (R. L., c. 375, s. 31).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">In the case of <em>Shulinsky </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 86, the defendant lost the right to challenge a juror because of \u201cfalse information furnished under the court\u2019s authority.\u201d In such a situation a finding that the juror was indifferent could not render the verdict valid. The argument that a comparable situation here exists must be rejected. No inquiry concerning the jurors\u2019 interest in the Farm Bureau companies was made at the trial either by the court or by counsel, and if the jurors\u2019 silence could, as the plaintiff contends, be regarded as false information, there is no evidence that the plaintiff relied upon it. For aught that appears, the plaintiff may have known all the facts of which he now complains and waived his right to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">There is no merit in the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the court\u2019s general finding that the jurors were disqualified includes the special finding that the plaintiff was diligent, no request for a special finding to the contrary having been made. In the first place, the court\u2019s reference to the <em>Shulinshy </em>case as sufficient authority for the conclusion reached would indicate that the general finding, so called, is not strictly a finding of fact but rather a ruling of law. In the second place, the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, made at the conclusion of the evidence, raised the question of the sufficiency of the evidence as to every essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s claim <em>(Record </em>v. <em>Corporation, </em>89 N. H. 1, 7), and one of the essential requirements ncumbent on the plaintiff was proof that he had used due diligence to discover the jurors\u2019 competency <em>(Hazen </em>v. <em>Corporation, </em>89 N. H. 522, 523). In the <em>Shulinshy </em>case a finding of due diligence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>properly made, but in the present case neither the plaintiff nor his counsel saw fit to testify, and there is a total dearth of evidence from which any exercise of diligence on their part could be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b432-6\">Burque, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
