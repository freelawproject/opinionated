L., c. 299, <em>s. </em>1), it was the duty of the defendant railroad to keep it in a reasonably safe condition for public use. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 466, and cases cited. How far compliance with a detailed administrative order constitutes a defense in actions of this kind need not be determined, for the order on which the railroad here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>relies is couched in general terms and merely provides \u201cthat the proprietors of the Northern Railroad and the proprietors of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, as lessee of the Northern Railroad, shall construct a bridge over the tracks of the Northern Railroad at this point which shall be safe and suitable for highway travel over it.\u201d 10 N. H. P. S. C., 487, 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">It was not the original intention of the Commission, acting on the petition of the town for the relocation of the highway, to make any order whatever relating to the construction of the bridge. The chairman of the Commission, answering a letter received from the law department of the railroad, wrote on December 29, 1925, as follows: \u201cWe also notice that you refer to the commission making an order directed against the proprietors of the Northern Railroad. We had not planned to make any order in this case, provided the railroad was willing to go along voluntarily and construct this bridge without an order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Apparently, the Commission, in approving the working plans of the bridge, was not particularly concerned with the type of curb or railing erected, since in the same letter the chairman declared: \u201cAs previously stated to you, so long as the railroad constructs a bridge which is safe and adequate in width and dimension to properly accommodate the travel of the highway, and is not constructed in such a way as to obstruct the view to the highway travel approaching the bridge, the commission would not be critical as to the design of the bridge and the material entering into its construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Certain alterations in the plans were suggested by the bridge engineer of the State Highway Department, but none of these suggested changes related to the curb or railing. No formal written approval of the plans was ever entered on the records of the Commission. The informal preliminary approval (accorded in point of fact by the Highway Department rather than by the Commission), followed by a formal and final order merely requiring the railroad to construct a bridge \u201cwhich shall be safe and suitable,\u201d did not, in our opinion, relieve the railroad from liability for negligent construction. See <em>McGettigan </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>268 N. Y. 66. See also, <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Company, </em>86 N. H. 486. Cases on the subject are collected in 49 Harv. Law Rev. 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The case of <em>Cozzi </em>v. <em>Hooksett, </em>84 N. H. 530, on which the railroad relies, is inapplicable. The act there construed (P. L., c. 89, s. 2) expressly provides that a standard railing erected by a town \u201cshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>be held\u201d to be sufficient if approved by the State Highway Department. The Public Laws, effective at the time of the accident, contain no provision immunizing railroads from liability for faulty construction in cases where the construction has received Commission approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">The bridge was one hundred and twenty-nine feet in length and twenty-seven feet in width. The railing or \u201copen fence\u201d was designed \u201cjust to indicate the side of the bridge\u201d and to \u201cstand up against\u201d the wind. The curb comprised a wooden \u201cguard stick\u201d or \u201cwheel guard, \u201d approximately nine inches high, which ran along the base of the fence, its purpose being \u201cto deflect a wheel that\u2019s driven over the bridge parallel to the wheel guard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">It could be found that the speed of the car when it entered the bridge and commenced to skid was only twenty miles an hour. The car did not go swiftly through the fence but remained suspended for a few seconds (long enough, in fact, for the driver to turn off the ignition) before it fell to the ground below. There was expert testimony to the effect that a slightly higher curb would have prevented the accident. The question of the railroad\u2019s causal negligence was for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The bridge engineer for the State Highway Department testified that the bridge conformed to the requirements of the department for a bridge of that kind. He further testified that these requirements were \u201cmerely something for a guide\u201d and that a nine-inch curb was the \u201cminimum requirement which in the opinion of these engineers is safe.\u201d He testified without exception that pipe railings were maintained on some wooden bridges and stated, subject to exception, that \u201cstep-back curbs\u201d were specified by the American Association of State Highway Officials for bridges with concrete floors, carrying \u201capproximately the same travel as the bridge . . . under consideration.\u201d The evidence excepted to was offered \u201cto test the witness\u2019s knowledge as to curbs and the element of safety.\u201d What safety required was a question of fact under all the circumstances of the case. <em>Kelsea </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>80 N. H. 148, 152; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>83 N. H. 466. The evidence was admissible for the purpose stated. <em>Speares Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>80 N. H. 243, 244; <em>Romani </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>81 N. H. 206, 208; <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>Company, </em>85 N. H. 220, 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">The railroad excepted to the refusal of the court \u201cto withdraw the issue of the claim of negligence on account of the railings in contrast to the curb.\u201d Reliance on the curb alone was not justified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>as a matter of law. The jury could properly find that a railing designed merely to withstand the force of the wind was inadequate and that a somewhat stouter structure would have prevented the accident. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>83 N. H. 524, 527, and cases cited. The jurors were correctly instructed that the test for them to apply was \u201cwhether the curb and railing in question were such as the ordinary man would maintain at that place, taking into consideration the kind and amount of travel over the bridge or crossing.\u201d See <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>Bethlehem, </em>79 N. H. 78, 80; <em>Kelsea </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>80 N. H. 148, 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The railroad, seeking to apply to the situation the rule announced in <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>88 N. H. 462, requested the court to charge that if the bridge when built was reasonably adequate, the jury could not find the railroad negligent even though subsequent changes in the volume and mode of highway travel had rendered the bridge inadequate. The principle of the <em>Shea </em>case was not involved. The Presiding Justice informed the jury that the railroad \u201chad no duty to maintain the approaches to the bridge and had nothing to do about the location of the bridge\u201d and .that with respect to the bridge itself, the claim of the plaintiffs suing the railroad was \u201cthat the so-called curb and railing were not sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">There was evidence that snow had been allowed to accumulate at the sides of the bridge during the winter and that this snow, which was \u201cnearly as hard as ice,\u201d extended \u201cto the top of the curb.\u201d Under such circumstances, the curb \u201cwould not be effective in deflecting the wheel of an automobile.\u201d The railroad, having requested an instruction to the effect that it \u201chad no duty to remove snow on the bridge,\u201d excepted to that part of the charge in which the Presiding Justice instructed the jury that if a reasonable person would have removed the snow and ice from the curb, it became the duty of the railroad to remove it.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Since the liability of railroads for the improper maintenance of bridges is not, as in the case of towns, restricted to defects of structure (see <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Whitefield, </em>80 N. H. 245), it was the duty of the defendant railroad to exercise reasonable care to see that the bridge was free from unsafe accumulations of ice and snow unless relieved of that duty by statute. For some years the State Highway Department had taken care of the traveled surface of the bridge \u2014 had tarred it in the summer and \u201cplowed it and sanded it\u201d in the winter. There is no claim that this work was not prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>erly authorized. Section 1 of chapter 16 of the Laws of 1935 (R. L., c. 100, s. 10) provides that the State Highway Department \u201cshall assume full control of reconstruction and maintenance of all trunk lines, including bridges thereon, and all state-aided highways, excluding bridges thereon, now or hereafter constructed, and the removal of snow from such sections thereof as may be designated by the highway commissioner with the approval of the governor and council.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">An overhead highway bridge such as that erected by the defendant railroad, though technically a railroad crossing, is also for all practical purposes a part of the highway on which it is located, and although railroads are still required to keep overpass bridges in repair (see <em>Laconia </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>81 N. H. 408), it could hardly have been the legislative intent not to include such bridges within the operation of the snow-removal provisions of the statute. To have excluded them would have resulted in a most unexpeditious method of keeping the highways open for traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The bridge in question was located on the trunk line known as Route 11, and since the State Highway Department had assumed, under statutory authority, the maintenance of that route and the work of removing snow from the bridge, the railroad was, we believe, freed from all duties pertaining to snow removal and cannot be held liable for any negligence on the part of the Highway Department in the performance of that work. The exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The action of Daniel F. MacDonald was brought to recover for medical expenses incurred by him because of his daughter\u2019s injuries. Subject to exception, the jurors were instructed that if they should find the railroad at fault, their verdict would be for the plaintiff in that case, \u201cregardless of whether Miss MacDonald was or was not at fault.\u201d A majority of the court is in accord with the widely prevailing rule which denies recovery in such a situation. Restatement, Torts, <em>s. </em>494; Annotation, 42 A. L. R. 717, 718. It is suggested that while the totality of damage for injuring one may be apportioned among those sustaining it, there can be no severance of liability. The father\u2019s damage in the present case was \u201ca necessary concomitant of the bodily injuries suffered\u201d by his daughter. <em>American &amp;c. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Kopka, </em>88 N. H. 182, 183. Extraneous facts account for the division of damages, and liability to pay part of them but not the other part seems illogical. If the daughter were of age, the railroad would not be liable either to her or to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>father, and a rule which creates liability merely because she is a minor appears to involve an incompatible distinction. Nor does the denial of recovery to the father mean the imputation to him of his daughter\u2019s negligence. The verdict against Roselle exonerates the railroad from injuring her, and her medical expenses are merely a \u201cconsequential\u201d result of the bodily injury she has suffered. See <em>Lumbermen\u2019s &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Yeroyan, </em>90 N. H. 145, 146. The railroad\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Counsel for Roselle MacDonald (the daughter) in her action against the railroad excepted to the allowance of an alleged misstatement of the evidence by opposing counsel in his argument to the jury. The statement objected to was to the effect that a witness had testified that he found a \u201cgouge mark\u201d on the snow bank, \u201ca fresh mark made by this car\u201d opposite a big boulder. The statement was objected to on the ground that the witness \u201cdid not testify that the mark he found was made by this car.\u201d The witness was asked if he found \u201cany indication of the course of the car.\u201d He replied that there was a \u201cgouge mark in the snow bank,\u201d that it was \u201cabout opposite the boulder at the end of the bridge,\u201d that it gave \u201cevidence of having been made by an automobile,\u201d that it was a fresh mark, and that he \u201cnoticed the gouge in the banking\u201d when he \u201ctried to figure out the course the car took.\u201d Since counsel merely stated what was the fair import of the testimony, the exception is overruled. <em>Maravas </em>v. <em>Corporation, </em>82 N. H. 533, 538, 539; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Hillsborough Mills, </em>85 N. H. 517.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The trial was held at the October term, 1941, but the writs in the <em>Pease </em>and <em>Dolby </em>cases were not returnable until the April term, 1942. Counsel for the railroad, appearing specially, excepted to the order of the court requiring the trial of those cases with the others. Since new trials must be ordered in these actions because of the error in the charge already discussed, it is unnecessary to consider this particular exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The suits against Roselle MacDonald (hereinafter called the defendant) remain to be considered. The highway approached the bridge on a curve; it had been snowing during the day, the snow had melted to some extent and the road was slippery. The defendant entered the bridge without any reduction in speed, the car skidded to the left and the accident occurred. It could be found on the evidence that the defendant was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">On November 15, 1941, the plaintiff Young, who had brought an action against the railroad for himself individually and one as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>father and next friend of Dorothy Young, received from the railroad the sum of $200 in consideration of a covenant not to sue. This covenant contained an express reservation of rights against third persons. On December 8, 1941, the docket entry, \u201cNeither party, no further action,\u201d was made in each of the railroad cases in accordance with the stipulations signed by the parties. The defendant offered these stipulations and docket entries in evidence, claiming that they were in effect judgments constituting a complete bar to the actions brought against her. Her counsel now argue <em>t</em>hat the case of</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In the <em>Masterson </em>case both Fraser and the street railway were joined as defendants and the agreement was that \u201cthe following entry may be made between the plaintiff and the defendant James A. Fraser only: \u2018Neither party. No further action to be brought for the same cause.\u2019\u201d 393 Briefs &amp; Cases, 171. When the stipulations in the present cases are read in connection with the covenant not to sue, the meaning is clear: no further action is to be brought against the defendant railroad (the only defendant named in the action). That being the intention, no reason is apparent why the entries, if technically incorrect, cannot now \u201cbe altered to conform to such intention.\u201d <em>Colby </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>86 N. H. 568, 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The plaintiff Dorothy Young stated on cross-examination that she had \u201chad a suit against the railroad,\u201d whereupon counsel for the railroad moved the court to strike the statement out as \u201cvery prejudicial.\u201d Even if the statement was relevant, as defendant\u2019s counsel contend, it was within the court\u2019s discretion to strike it out as unduly prejudicial. <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>79 N. H. 52; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>80 N. H. 96; <em>State </em>v. <em>Braley, </em>81 N. H. 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Florence Calley, a plaintiff in one of the actions against the railroad, testified that the car \u201cwasn\u2019t going fast\u201d and denied ever having said that the accident was caused because \u201cthe car was going too fast.\u201d A witness stated that Miss Calley had made this latter assertion to him. The evidence was offered \u201cin contradiction of Miss Calley\u201d and as an admission against her in her case. Counsel for the railroad said: \u201cI suppose on the question of credibility it is admissible in all cases.\u201d The Presiding Justice answered : \u201cAll right. You may put the evidence in and the jury will apply it wherever it should be applied under proper instructions.\u201d The evidence was admissible for the purpose stated in the offer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>It is true that the Presiding Justice did not give the instructions which he intimated he would later give, but the trial was a long and complicated one and some duty rested on counsel, if he desired to have the limitations on the use of the testimony meticulously explained, to call the matter to the court\u2019s attention. See <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Company, </em>84 N. H. 156, 160; <em>State </em>v. <em>Hale, </em>85 N. H. 408, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Subject to the defendant\u2019s exception, counsel for the plaintiffs Young and Atwood was permitted to argue to the jury as follows: \u201cMr. Upton in his defense of the MacDonald case seemed to undertake more of a prosecution of Mr. Murchie\u2019s case against the railroad than he did a defense of his own driver, and that of course is always some sign of weakness in his defense.\u201d The railroad\u2019s negligence was immaterial in the <em>MacDonald </em>cases if the defendant was guilty of negligence contributing to the accident. The suggestion that in emphasizing the negligence of the railroad counsel was drawing the jury\u2019s attention away from the conduct of the defendant was not so unwarranted as to make applicable the rule announced in <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Company, </em>90 N. H. 1. See <em>Martel </em>v. <em>White Mills, </em>79 N. H. 439, 442, 443; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>80 N. H. 258, 267; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bozek, </em>81 N. H. 277, 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The defendant excepted to the trial court\u2019s instruction that if the jury \u201cshould find that the auto skidded in the first instance because of the manner in which the car was operated, it may be evidence of negligence on the part of the operator.\u201d The Presiding Justice did not say, as counsel imply, that if the defendant\u2019s operation of the car caused the skidding, such operation was necessarily negligent, but only that it might be negligent. See <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Cot\u00e9, </em>86 N. H. 167, 168. He had already said that skidding was not in and of itself evidence of negligence, and the passage excepted to was followed by a recital of the circumstances to be considered in determining whether or not the defendant\u2019s manner of driving was reasonably careful. The exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">In support of the remaining exception defendant\u2019s counsel argue as follows: \u201cThe fact that verdicts were returned for the plaintiffs in both actions brought by Herbert Young appears to indicate a finding by the jury that Dorothy Young was not contributorily negligent. On the other hand, the verdicts may be accounted for by the instructions to which exception was taken. One action brought by Herbert Young was to recover consequential damages suffered by him. The other was brought by him on behalf of Dorothy Young, his minor child, to recover for injuries suffered by her. The instruction that he was entitled to recover regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>his daughter\u2019s fault was not limited to the action brought by him individually, and may well have been understood by the jury to apply to both actions in which he was apparently party plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AgU\">It is highly improbable that any such misunderstanding was occasioned. In enumerating the cases at the beginning of the charge, the Presiding Justice said: \u201cDorothy Young has brought suit in the name of her father . . . and her father has brought suit for the expenses incident to her injuries.\u201d Immediately preceding the statement excepted to, the court instructed the jury concerning the injuries and case of Dorothy Young, and separate verdicts were returned in the \u201cconsequential-damage\u201d and \u201cnext-friend\u201d actions. Furthermore, the question now argued was not raised by the exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>In the actions of Daniel F.
