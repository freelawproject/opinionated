This description is substantially as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">The shore line at North Hampton Beach opposite the site of the accident runs approximately north and south. West of the ocean is the beach; west of the beach is a sea wall with steps leading up' from the beach to the land above; west of the sea wall is a sidewalk ten feet in width and separated from the parking area by a curbstone ; west of the sidewalk is the parking area, which slopes slightly to the west and is marked with yellow diagonal parking lines running in a northeast-southwest direction. This parking area is tarred and is fifty to sixty feet in width and about one mile in length. West of and adjacent to the parking area is the public highway known as Ocean Boulevard. This highway is twenty-four feet wide, thus making a continuous paved area from seventy-four feet to eighty-four feet in width measuring from the westerly edge of the public highway to the curbstone at the easterly edge of the parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">On the afternoon of the accident the defendant, who lived at Hampton Falls, took her three children to North Hampton Beach. When ready to return home, she backed her car out of the parking space and collided with the bicycle on which the plaintiff was riding. There was evidence that she realized \u201cthat there might be somebody on a bicycle riding in a northerly direction in back\u201d of where her car was parked; that her view to the south was obstructed by another parked car; that she did not request her children, two of whom were on the back seat, to keep a lookout, and that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u201cbacked out suddenly\u201d without sounding the horn of her car or giving any other warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">The plaintiff and three companions were riding northward from Hampton Beach toward Rye on bicycles in single file about three or four feet west of the line of parked cars. The plaintiff testified: \u201cI was riding along slowly and I was bearing in mind the fact that there were cars parked, but I had to keep my eye on the road ahead of me some and suddenly this car backed out and the right rear end of it hit the wheel of my bike. ... I was thrown over the handlebars. ... It just backed out suddenly . . . and without any warning and I could not do anything to prevent it. ... I tried to watch to see that no one was backing out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">On the foregoing evidence the jury might properly find that the defendant was negligent and that her negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. <em>Golej </em>v. <em>Varjabedian, </em>86 N. H. 244, 246. Nor does the evidence compel the conclusion that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory fault. There is no claim that she was violating any provision of section 12 of chapter 90 of the Public Laws. She took some care for her own safety. Whether she did all that the average person would have done under like circumstances was a question of fact for the jury. <em>Dorrien </em>v. <em>Sirois, </em>87 N. H. 144, 147. It follows that the motions for a nonsuit and directed verdict were correctly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">The defendant excepted \u201cto the persistence \u201d with which plaintiff\u2019s counsel asked a certain question relating to damages when the Presiding Justice had \u201cruled it out at least twice.\u201d In neither instance was the question answered. At the conclusion of the evidence the defendant \u201cmoved for a mistrial because of the prejudice\u201d occasioned by the conduct of counsel in asking the question. The denial of this motion included an implied finding of fact that the defendant had not been prejudiced by the alleged misconduct. <em>Lavigne </em>v. <em>Lavigne, </em>80 N. H. 559. The exception to the denial of the motion presents no question of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Danforth, 73 </em>N. H. 215, 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">In explanation of the plaintiff\u2019s reason for riding in the parking area her counsel said in his argument to the jury: \u201c\u2019What would you think of a girl in the middle of Ocean Boulevard, the traffic coming in both directions, riding a bicycle?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel excepted \u201cto that statement, traffic coming in both directions.\u201d It is true that the plaintiff testified that there was little traffic on the boulevard at the precise moment when the accident occurred. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>But she also testified that the traffic was heavy when she left Hampton Beach and that as she \u201crode along there was traffic going both ways spasmodically.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel merely suggested in interrogative form that the plaintiff was justified in riding where she did because of traffic conditions. In view of the evidence the suggestion, as made, was not an improper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel argued, subject to exception, that if the defendant had \u201csounded her horn\u201d the plaintiff \u201ccould have heard it and the accident would not have occurred.\u201d The fact that the defendant was under no statutory obligation to sound her horn did not absolve her from the duty of so doing if ordinary care required it. <em>Dowse </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>91 N. H. 419. The plaintiff was riding slowly and it was a legitimate inference from the evidence that she would have heard and heeded such a signal if given.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">The plaintiff testified: \u201cThere were some children in the car, one of them said to me, she rode down with us to the doctor, and she expressed her sympathy and said that she had seen me.\u201d No exception was ta'ken to this testimony, and it is evident that defendant\u2019s counsel misunderstood what the plaintiff had said, for in his cross-examination he asked several questions based on the assumption that the plaintiff had testified that it was the defendant who had admitted seeing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">During the course of his argument to the jury plaintiff\u2019s counsel, commenting on the plaintiff\u2019s care, asserted: \u201cShe could have asked her children, one of them was eleven years old at the time, she could have asked one of the children to look out the side window and I think there\u2019s some testimony in this case . . . that one of them did see Miss Halley before the accident.\u201d Thereupon the defendant excepted, and after some discussion with the court as to the existence of the evidence in question, plaintiff\u2019s counsel continued: \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you gentlemen to your recollection and your judgment that it was brought out in direct examination that one of these children that was with Mrs. Brown said that they had seen Miss Halley. Not only on direct, on cross-examination.\u201d The defendant excepted \u201cto. that statement,\u201d and the Presiding Justice remarked: \u201cI still don\u2019t remember any such statement. You will have to take your chance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">It is immaterial that the testimony to which counsel referred was hearsay. Since no objection was made to its admission, it could properly \u201cbe considered and given its logical probative effect.\u201d <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>Verrill, </em>88 N. H. 25, 28. See also <em>Janus </em>v. <em>Akstin, </em>91 N. H. 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>No claim is made that prejudice resulted merely because of the statement that the testimony had been given on cross-examination. It was contended at the trial and it is the contention here, as expressed in the defendant\u2019s brief, that plaintiff\u2019s counsel made a serious \u201cassertion of testimony which was not in the case at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-6\">Burque, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
