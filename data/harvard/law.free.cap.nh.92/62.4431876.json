The defendant, on the other hand, contends that contracts for support made in contemplation of death remain subject to the provisions of section 1, the purpose of section 38 being to prevent tax evasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">It is unnecessary to resolve these differences of interpretation, however, for in our opinion the plaintiff cannot prevail even if section 38 be given the construction for which he contends. When the agreement was made, Mrs. Sleeper had placed her property in the hands of a conservator (P. L., c. 291, s. 16) and could not make a valid contract disposing of that property in her lifetime without his approval. See P. L., c. 291, <em>s. </em>17; P. L., c. 289, s. 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">No approval of the contract in question was obtained from the conservator originally appointed, and if his successor, who is now the executor, may be said to have recognized the agreement in any particular, it was not in respect to the provision that called for immediate payment of the consideration, for he paid Mrs. Ball during Mrs. Sleeper\u2019s lifetime only what her services were presumably worth. The plaintiff\u2019s contention \u201cthat Mrs. Ball could have enforced the terms of the written contract, in so far as the consideration is concerned, at any time she wished\u201d overlooks the fact that, in view of the conservatorship, there was no valid written contract for payment of the consideration \u201cwithin the decedent\u2019s lifetime\u201d (P. L., <em>c. </em>72, s. 38) to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
