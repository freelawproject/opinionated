H. 95, <em>97; Jesukevich </em>v. <em>Laporte, </em>89 N. H. 242; 6 C. J. 1115. It was, therefore, incumbent upon the defendant to produce evidence of \u201csome understanding or agreement\u201d between Chris Sakellarios and his father, authorizing Chris to permit Rousseau to use the car as he did. There is no such evidence in the case, and the ruling of the trial court was, therefore, correct. The mere relationship of father and son subsisting between the assured and Chris Sakellarios furnished no basis for an inference that such an understanding or agreement existed between them. <em>Cronan </em>v. <em>Indemnity Co., </em>126 N. J. L. 56; <em>Hinton </em>v. <em>Carmody, </em>186 Wash. 242; <em>Shoup </em>v. <em>Clemans, </em>31 N. E. Rep. (2d) 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The argument that the clause in question was designed \u201cfor the protection of those lawfully travelling upon the public highway\u201d and that \u201cas long as the chain of express permissions has not been broken by a conversion or by an illegal taking, the policy should cover,\u201d might well be addressed to the legislature in advocacy of a change in the Financial Responsibility Act. It suggests no ground for holding the insurer responsible for a wholly unpermitted use of the insured car under a policy which covers only \u201cuse with the permission of the named assured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
