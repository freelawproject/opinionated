Cls. 468. We think it unnecessary to repeat or add anything to the opinion of the court in the case above cited as reasons for our final conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">If the plaintiff\u2019s action had been begun in time this court would have rendered a judgment in his favor, but the remedy has been lost by reason of failure to file the petition within the period of limitations. All that the court can now do is to require the findings to be certified to Congress and it is accordingly ordered that this be done.</p>\n<judges id=\"b313-10\">Whalet, <em>Judge; </em>Williams, <em>Judge; </em>Littleton, <em>Judge; </em>and Booth, <em>Chief </em>Justice, concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">(Note. \u2014 This ease, Congressional No. 17529, was erroneously included in Volume 86, page 756.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
