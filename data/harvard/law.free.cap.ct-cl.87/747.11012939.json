S. 267), the Supreme Court stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-18\">Petitioner paid, and in this suit seeks to recover, an amount included in a deficiency assessment made by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as additional income tax for the year ending January 31, 1932. The question is whether petitioner is liable under the Revenue Act of 1932. * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>For itself and a subsidiary corporation, petitioner made consolidated returns. The commissioner added to the income of the subsidiary on account of improvements made to its property by a lessee. He ruled the improvements were income to lessor in that year to the extent of their value at termination of lease. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-4\">For the year in question, the commissioner added to income of lessor $1,742.31, one-tenth of the cost so depreciated (over the term of the lease.) The resulting additional tax was $211.61. Petitioner paid it; the commissioner disallowed claim for refund. The lower court held petitioner not entitled to recover; it sustained the tax on the ground that, immediately upon completion of the improvements made by lessee, they became the property of lessor, and constituted compensation paid by lessee, as additional rental for the use of the leased premises. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">Concretely, the question presented is whether, under the lease here involved, one-tenth of what the commissioner and taxpayer call and agree to be estimated depreciated value, as of the end of the term, was income to the petitioner in the first year of the term. And that question is to be decided upon the lower court\u2019s findings unaffected by any statement of fact; reasoning or conclusion that may be found in its opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-6\">There is nothing, in the findings to suggest that cost of any improvement made by lessee was rent or an expenditure not properly to be attributed to its capital or maintenance account as distinguished from operating expense. * * * Even when required, improvements by lessee will not be deemed rent unless intention that they shall be is plainly disclosed. * * * The facts found are clearly not sufficient to sustain the lower court\u2019s holding to the effect that the making of improvements by lessee was payment of rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-7\">It remains to be considered whether the amount in question represented taxable income, other than rent, in the first year of the term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-8\">The findings fail to disclose any basis of value on which to lay an income tax or the time of realization of taxable gain, if any there was. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-9\">Granting that the improvements increased the value of the building, that enhancement is not realized income of lessor. * * * Treasury regulations can add nothing to income as defined by Congress.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-10\">But, assuming that at some time value of the improvements would be income of lessor, it cannot be reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>\u00ae qs st.g 8.2 S S \u201d w 2 C CD P d* CP <em>U </em>&lt;e 3*g \u2022r-4 ^3 d) O oj s &lt;d o B S ctS \u00ae O \u00a3 fs'g.

As it is unnecessary to decide whether such increase, if established, would constitute taxable income of the lessor, I do not joint in so much of the opinion as, upon an assumption contrary to the findings, undertakes to discuss that question.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
