In so doing, it changed some of the terminology used in Transportation article, \u00a7\u00a7 21-902(b) and 27-101(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Prior to the change, \u00a7 21-902(b) read as follows: \u201cA person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle <em>while his driving ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Section 27-101(f) provided a fine of up to $500, imprisonment up to one year, or both \u201cfor any person who [was] convicted of a second or subsequent violation of ... \u00a7 21-902(b) of this article [\u2018Driving while ability impaired by alcohol\u2019]____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The 1981 legislation repealed and reenacted with amendments those provisions \u2014 \u00a7\u00a7 21-902 and 27-101. <em>See </em>1981 Laws of Maryland, ch. 242. As a result, \u00a7 21-902(b) was changed to provide that \u201c[a] person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle <em>while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Consistent with this change, \u00a7 27-101(f) was amended to provide the enhanced penalty for \u201c[a]ny person who is convicted of ... a second or subsequent violation of ... \u00a7 21-902(b) of this article (\u2018Driving while under the influence of alcohol\u2019)....\u201d The only change in \u00a7 27-101(f) was the inclusion of the new terminology used in \u00a7 21-902(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In this appeal, we consider the issue mentioned but not addressed in <em>Kursch v. State, </em>55 Md.App. 103, 106, 460 A.2d 639 (1983): Whether a person convicted of \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d Transp. art., \u00a7 21-902(b), can be sentenced as a \u201csecond or subsequent offender\u201d under \u00a7 27-101(f) when the repeat offender treatment is based on prior convictions for \u201cDriving while ability impaired by alcohol\u201d (former \u00a7 21-902(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">On July 4, 1984, appellant was arrested for \u201cDriving while intoxicated.\u201d Transp. art., \u00a7 21-902(a). He submitted to a breathalyzer test, which measures an individual\u2019s blood alcohol content, and registered a .15 \u2014 two percentage points above the blood alcohol content level considered <em>prima facie </em>evidence of intoxication. Courts art., \u00a7 10-307(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Appellant initially requested a jury trial, and as a result his case was removed from the District Court for Montgomery County and docketed in the Circuit Court. In a letter dated August 20, 1984, the State informed appellant that it intended to treat him as a \u201csubsequent offender\u201d pursuant to Transp. art., \u00a7 27 \u2014 101(f) because of his two prior convictions for driving while impaired \u2014 December 13, 1977 and July 6, 1978. Before the scheduled trial date, the State and appellant reached a plea arrangement: the State among other things agreed to amend its charging document to allege \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol\u201d (Transp. art., \u00a7 21-902(b)) \u2014 a lesser offense than \u201cDriving while intoxicated\u201d (\u00a7 21-902(a)) \u2014 and, appellant, for his part, agreed to plead guilty to the amended charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">During a hearing on January 2, 1985, in which the court provisionally accepted appellant\u2019s guilty plea on the agreed-upon conditions, appellant argued that he could not be sentenced as a \u201csubsequent offender\u201d under \u00a7 27-101(f) because he had not been previously convicted of \u201cDriving while under the <em>influence of alcohol. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.) On May 9, 1985, the court held that his prior convictions for driving \u201cwhile his driving ability [was] impaired by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>consumption of alcohol\u201d brought him within the purview of the \u201csubsequent offender\u201d provision (\u00a7 27 \u2014 101(f)). It sentenced him to one year but suspended execution of all except 60 days of the sentence, in favor of two years\u2019 supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Pursuant to Courts art., \u00a7 12-302(e) and Rule 1096, appellant made application for leave to appeal the judgment entered upon his guilty plea, which we granted. He presses his claim that he cannot be treated as a subsequent offender based on his prior convictions for driving while \u201cimpaired,\u201d arguing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">(1) The \u201csubsequent offender\u201d statute (\u00a7 27-101(f)) expressly provides that a second or subsequent conviction for \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol\u201d is required and because that offense has only existed since July 1, 1981, his prior convictions for driving while impaired cannot serve as the predicate offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">(2) The legislative history demonstrates that \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol\u201d and \u201cDriving while ability impaired by alcohol\u201d are not interchangeable terms;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">(3) The plain language and due process considerations preclude subsequent offender treatment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">(4) A review of comparable statutes demonstrates that the Legislature knows how to provide enhanced punishment in a variety of situations but did not do so here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">We hold that appellant was properly sentenced as a subsequent offender under \u00a7 27-101(f) and therefore shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the actual legislative intent. <em>Reid v. State, </em>302 Md. 811, 816, 490 A.2d 1289 (1985); <em>Willis v. State, </em>302 Md. 363, 374, 488 A.2d 171 (1985); <em>Hawkins v. State, </em>302 Md. 143, 147, 486 A.2d 179 (1985). In this pursuit, the principal source for determining that intent is the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of the statute itself. If that language is unambiguous, no further inquiry is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Appellant first argues that \u00a7 27-101(f) unambiguously prescribes subsequent offender treatment only for those who have been convicted of two or more charges of \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol,\u201d an offense which has existed only since July 1, 1981. This argument, of course, begs the question because it does not address what the Legislature intended to do with prior convictions for \u201cDriving while ability impaired by alcohol.\u201d Fortunately, the Legislature specifically provided the answer in the very statute that changed the terminology. Section 2 of that Act (1981 Laws of Maryland, ch. 242) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cAND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That wherever \u2018driving while ability impaired by consumption of alcohol\u2019 shall appear in the Annotated Code of Maryland, it is the legislative intent that \u2018driving while under the influence of alcohol\u2019 shall be substituted and have the same meaning and effect as \u2018driving or attempting to drive while ability impaired or not impaired by the consumption of alcohol,[\u2019] as the case may be or the context requires.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABF\">We can think of no clearer expression of legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Appellant claims that \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol\u201d and \u201cDriving while ability impaired by alcohol\u201d cannot be treated as interchangeable because they are entirely different crimes. At oral argument, he suggested that under old \u00a7 21-902(b) (\u201cDriving while ability impaired by alcohol\u201d), the State was required to prove that the \u201cdriving ability\u201d of the accused was impaired, an element that he says is not required to convict for \u201cDriving while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d Appellant has cited no authority in support of this proposition and we have not uncovered any in our research. In our view, \u00a7 2, ch. 242, 1981 Laws of Maryland, providing that the terms shall have \u201cthe same meaning and effect,\u201d disposes of this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">We also believe that appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Brooks v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 123, 395 A.2d 1224 (1979), is misplaced. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>In <em>Brooks, </em>we held that former \u00a7 21-902(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (b) were not unconstitutionally vague, and in so doing commented that, \u201cIt remains ultimately a question for the jury whether an accused was intoxicated, impaired, <em>or </em>under the influence of alcohol in accordance with the <em>common meaning of those terms.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Appellant contends that, because we have delineated these terms disjunctively, we have recognized that they are separate offenses. We do not share that reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\"><em>Brooks, </em>of course, pre-dated the 1981 legislation. That fact alone would discount any value that might be placed on appellant\u2019s construction of <em>Brooks. </em>More important, the passage relied on by appellant, when read in context, in no way recognizes \u201cimpaired\u201d and \u201cunder the influence\u201d as different offenses. To the contrary, immediately before the passage, we noted, while ascribing a \u201ccommon meaning\u201d to the word \u201cimpaired,\u201d that \u201c[t]he caselaw seems to indicate that the phrases \u2018under the influence of alcohol\u2019 and \u2018ability impaired by alcohol\u2019 are synonymous.\u201d <em>Brooks, </em>41 Md.App. at 128 n. 2, 395 A.2d 1224. Thus, <em>Brooks </em>provides no support for his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Appellant\u2019s comparison of \u00a7 27-101(f) with other enhanced penalty provisions is likewise unpersuasive. Essentially, he argues that the Legislature knows how to enlarge the class it wants to cover, and \u201cwithout an express designation of [the] larger class the statute must be construed narrowly to include only those persons who have violated the specific violation stated in the statute.\u201d Suffice to say, \u00a7 2, ch. 242 of the 1981 Laws of Maryland sets forth the class, and appellant falls squarely within that class.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Obliquely, appellant raises a due process claim. He contends that \u201cbecause of the different wording of the statute [he] was not afforded fair notice of the possibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>subsequent offender treatment.\u201d The argument is entirely without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">Appellant\u2019s claim is apparently (and necessarily) based on the notion that the only public notice of the law is that provided by the Annotated Code. But that is not the case. The actual law is that set forth in the bill enacted by the Legislature, which is published in the annual session laws and is generally available to the public. <em>See Washington Sub. San. Comm\u2019n v. Pride Homes, </em>291 Md. 537, 543 n. 4, 435 A.2d 796 (1981). Courts art., \u00a7 10-201, captioned \u201cPublic General Laws,\u201d makes clear that the Annotated Code is merely \u201cevidence\u201d of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">With this fundamental concept in mind, it is clear that appellant\u2019s \u201cfair notice\u201d claim under the guise of due process is unfounded. As we noted, \u00a7 2, ch. 242 of the 1981 Laws of Maryland is explicit: \u201cDriving under the influence of alcohol\u201d shall have the \u201csame meaning and effect\u201d as its precursor, \u201cDriving while ability impaired by alcohol.\u201d That is the law and since its enactment has been a matter of public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\">. The Legislature did not change the terminology in \u00a7 21-902(a) when the change to subsection (b) was made in 1981. Subsection (a) did, and still does, provide that \"[a] person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while intoxicated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
