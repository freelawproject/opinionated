ALBERT MENCHINE, Judge, Specially Assigned.</author>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">On March 11, 1983, Southern Maryland Hospital Center (Southern), a subsisting general hospital in Prince George\u2019s County, filed an application with the State Health Resources Commission (Commission) for the issuance of a certificate of need for a proposed construction project that would add 120 beds to its existing or authorized 208 beds at a total cost of $14,825,900. Such a project required Commission approval under the provisions of Health General Article \u00a7 19-115e, h and k (1985 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">The Commission on February 14, 1984, issued a \u201cconditional\u201d certification of need, the precise form of which will be stated <em>infra. </em>An appeal to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, pursuant to the provisions of Health General Article \u00a7 19-121, was taken by Fort Washington Community Hospital, Inc. (Fort Washington), Greater Southeast Community Hospital (Greater Southeast) and Doctors\u2019 Hospital of Prince George\u2019s County (Doctors).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County entered judgment affirming the decision of the Commission. Fort Washington, Greater Southeast and Doctors have filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>further appeal to this Court. The appellees are Southern and the Commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Federal and State statutes and regulations control the issuance of a certificate of need. The necessity for such joint Federal-State action was declared by the Congress in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300k, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\n<em>Congressional findings</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">(a) The Congress makes the following findings:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">(1) The achievement of equal access to quality health care at a reasonable cost is a priority of the Federal Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">(2) The massive infusion of Federal funds into the existing health care system has contributed to inflationary increases in the cost of health care and failed to produce an adequate supply or distribution of health resources, and consequently has not made possible equal access for everyone to such resources.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">(3) The many and increasing responses to these problems by the public sector (Federal, State, and local) and the private sector have not resulted in a comprehensive, rational approach to the present\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">(A) lack of uniformly effective methods of delivering</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">health care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-12\">(B) maldistribution of health care facilities and manpower; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-13\">(C) increasing cost of health care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-14\">(4) Increases in the cost of health care, particularly of hospital stays, have been uncontrollable and inflationary, and there are presently inadequate incentives for the use of appropriate alternative levels of health care, and for the substitution of ambulatory and intermediate care for inpatient hospital care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-15\">(5) Since the health care provider is one of the most important participants in any health care delivery system, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>health policy must address the legitimate needs and concerns of the provider if it is to achieve meaningful results; and, thus, it is imperative that the provider be encouraged to play an active role in developing health policy at all levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">(6) Large segments of the public are lacking in basic knowledge regarding proper personal health care and methods for effective use of available health services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">(b) In recognition of the magnitude of the problems described in subsection (a) of this section and the urgency placed on their solution, <em>it is the purpose of this Act to facilitate the development of recommendations for a national health planning policy, to augment areawide and State planning for health services, manpower, and facilities, and to authorize financial assistance for the development of resources to further that policy.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aoo\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Congressional implementation of those findings are to be found in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300k through 300n (Federal Act), the pertinent parts of which will be cited or quoted <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">State implementation of those findings are to be found in Maryland Code, Health General Article \u00a7\u00a7 19-101 through 19-125, the pertinent parts of which will be cited or quoted <em>infra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A condition precedent to participation in the financial benefits offered under the Federal Act required the State to provide a \u201cState Program\u201d for the performance within the State by a \u201cState Agency\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the functions prescribed.by \u00a7 300m-2, including, <em>inter alia, </em>the duty to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ83\">administer a State certificate of need program, which applies to the obligation of capital expenditures within the State and the offering within the State of new institution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>al health services and the acquisition of major medical equipment and which is consistent with standards established by the Secretary by regulation.

Perry Smith) was a nullity, in violation of the Maryland Act \u00a7 19-118(d)(2) that reads as follows: \u201cThe Commission may delegate to a committee the responsibility for review of an application for a certificate of need, including the holding of an evidentiary hearing.\u201d The contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">While in some usage the word \u201ccommittee\u201d well may imply a multiple membership, in the subject statute the same sub-section provides that a Commission hearing shall be held \u201cin accordance with the contested case procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act\u201d (Maryland Code State Government \u00a7 10-201 et seq.), which specifically authorize the conduct of hearings before a single officer. In <em>State v. Loscomb, </em>291 Md. 424, 432, 435 A.2d 764, 768 (1981), it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-11\">It is a general rule of statutory construction that statutes that deal with the same subject matter, share a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>purpose, and form part of the same general system are in <em>pan materia </em>and must be construed harmoniously in order to give full effect to each enactment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We hold that the designation of a single commissioner to act as a committee for the Commission accords with the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Southern contends that the issues presented here were not raised before the Commission, citing the holding in <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Woods Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 518, 390 A.2d 1119, 1127 (1978), that alleged procedural and evidentiary errors not raised before an administrative agency may not be raised for the first time in judicial review proceedings. Examination of the record, however, establishes that all appellants filed exceptions to the single Commissioner\u2019s report prior to the passage of the order of February 14, 1984, from which the appeal in this case was taken, and participated in the hearing before the full Commission prior to the adoption of the report and the issuance of the certificate of need by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">At the hearing upon the exceptions before the full Commission, counsel for Doctors presented, <em>inter alia, </em>the following explanation for its opposition to the proposed order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">I think there is a very dangerous precedent that may be set in the case and that is [to] approve, submit, recommend any application which in many respects doesn\u2019t meet the criteria Health Systems Plan as noted in the recommendation itself.... There was an application submitted for 120 beds which was tailored for 120 beds, the cost analysis, the attendant information necessary for such an application was submitted. An examination of the recommendation will show that this approval is conditioned upon many things. Much information has to be supplied at a later date.... You really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re approving. To say that you can supply this information later on is merely to abdicate your review responsibility as we see it____ I\u2019ve listed on page two of my exceptions, specific areas this application was found not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>to be consistent with the criteria which has been established for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Counsel for Greater Southeast brought to the attention of the full Commission, <em>inter alia, </em>a contention</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARj\">that it is irregular for an application to be approved prior to an applicant providing financial feasibility____ It seems that an application being brought down from 120 to 37 beds represents a substantial change and therefore should have to be reviewed at the H.S.A. level once again.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Counsel for Fort Washington told the full Commission that he shared the prior comments by other counsel as briefly set forth <em>supra, </em>\u201cespecially those of the Clinton Community Hospital.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He added, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-8\">[Y]our statute further requires that your Committee can do one of two things, it can approve or it can deny. Your Committee\u2019s proposal does neither____ It recommends a series of changes. Nowhere in your statute is there any procedural authority for what you are proposing to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AL4p\">Appeal from a decision of the Commission, authorized by \u00a7 19-121, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a]ny aggrieved party ... may take a direct judicial appeal within 30 days of the final decision of the Commission.\u201d \u00a7 19-120, in pertinent part, defines an aggrieved party as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-11\">A person, including any health care facility ... who (i) ... has presented a position on a health care project to the Commission <em>before the decision of the Commission </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number><em>on that health care project; </em>and (ii) is affected adversely by the decision of the Commission on the project.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">We hold that all appellants presented a position to the Commission on the issues presently before this Court before the decision of the Commission had been made. This Court, accordingly, must consider the merits of the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\n<em>Decision on the Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">An appeal by a person adversely affected by a final decision of a State Agency (the Commission) is authorized under both the State and Federal Acts. Health General Article \u00a7 19-121; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300n-l(b)(12)(E). The Court\u2019s role in such an appeal is narrow. Under the Federal Act \u201c[t]he decision of the State Agency shall be affirmed upon such judicial review unless it is found to be arbitrary or capricious or not made in compliance with applicable law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">These statutory provisions accord with the standard prescribed for the review of administrative appeals generally by judicial decisions. <em>See Hoyt v. Police Commissioner, </em>279 Md. 74, 89, 367 A.2d 924, 932-33 (1977), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Despite the statutory complexity of the case, the dichotomy between the appellants and the appellees can be briefly and succinctly stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">Appellants argue that the Commission (a) failed to comply with statutory mandates and (b) in legal effect made no decision upon whether Southern was or will be entitled to a certificate of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Appellees argue (a) that the statutory mandates have been met by necessary inferences that may be drawn from the evidence and (b) that the Commission is granted specific statutory authority to grant a certificate of need subject to conditions such as were imposed in the subject case.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Southern had applied for a 120-bed addition coupled with an expanded ambulatory surgery department. The Commission, however, issued a contingent certificate of need for a 37-bed addition and denied the ambulatory surgery department expansion.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">At the outset, we shall reject the contention of the appellants that the Commission lacked authority upon its own motion to reduce the number of beds applied for in the grant of a certificate of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The record quite clearly supports the Commission\u2019s finding that the need for additional hospital beds is limited to a maximum of 37 beds in Prince George\u2019s County. The statutes vest in the Commission the non-delegable duty to restrict construction of hospital facilities to those required for implementation of the State health plan by the facility best suited to serve all elements of the population within the area in which it will function at a determined reasonable cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">A necessary corollary to the exercise of that duty is the power to reduce, when necessary, the number of beds sought by an applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">The record made before the Commission encompassed hearings conducted by Commissioner Smith on December 8, 9 and 16, 1983, and a hearing before the full Commission for consideration of exceptions by the appellants and others on February 14, 1984. No testimony was taken at the latter hearing. The exceptants were limited to arguments on their behalf by counsel. The order appealed from followed. The transcript of testimony consists of 855 pages, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>in the course of which 40 exhibits were received in evidence. Nine additional volumes of the record below contain many hundreds of documents filed administratively between the time of the filing of Southern\u2019s application to the time of the trial court\u2019s order affirming the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Eight hundred thirty-six pages of the transcript of testimony and 37 of the exhibits admitted in evidence relate to Southern\u2019s application for the addition of 120 beds.</p>\n<p id=\"ALlf\">Only 19 pages of the testimony and 3<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the exhibits specifically relate to the 37 bed addition conditionally authorized by the Commission. That evidence was brought into the proceedings after protest by counsel for Southern as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[By Mr. Alexander]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">I would like the record, Mr. Smith, if I could just to state that our application is for 120 beds. We have applied for that and this testimony should in no way be construed as a modification of our request. We are simply trying to answer the commissioner\u2019s question which you certainly have a right to ask as to how we would handle that or what would be involved. That\u2019s why we are supplying the information. I don\u2019t want the record to think\u2014 MR. SMITH: You made it very clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">Q. Mr. Suriani, have you, in fact, considered the possibility constructionwise of how the hospital would handle 37 beds and how it would be treated if that was, in fact, granted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">A. Yes, sir, I have. I, too, am under the understanding Mr. Smith did request of us to throw together some figures regarding 37 beds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>MR. SMITH: My request. Let\u2019s get this straight right now. My request was, had you given consideration to it or is it feasible?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-4\">Q. You say throw together figures. Have you made some type of analysis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">A. Yes, I have, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In consequence, there is an extreme paucity of evidence relating to a 37-bed facility.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We conclude from our examination of this record that the Commission\u2019s grant of the subject certificate of need to Southern was not made in compliance with the law. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The certificate of need issued by the Commission in this case plainly is in violation of a specific requirement imposed upon it by the Federal Act and in violation of a specific requirement of one of its own regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">The Federal Act, \u00a7 300m-6(a)(4), provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq-\">\n<em>In issuing a certificate of need, the State shall specify in the certificate the maximum amount of capital expenditures which may be obligated under such certificate.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">(Emphasis added). Counsel for the Commission seeks to justify its failure to comply with this requirement by contending (1) that the Federal Act is not binding on the State, and alternatively, (2) that Congress has prohibited termination of designation agreements and has continued appropriations to non-complying states. We reject both contentions. As to the first, the Legislature of Maryland in \u00a7 19-102(c) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">This State recognizes the Federal Act and any amendment to the Federal Act that does not require State legislation to be effective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>We regard this subsection as stating, without ambiguity, that the Commission <em>must </em>comply with the Federal Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As to the second contention, we are persuaded that the fact that Congress may have provided a pork barrell roll to non-complying states is without legal effect in this State. The Maryland Legislature has gone to the length of providing that Maryland\u2019s adherence to the purpose and scope of the Federal Act is so firmly fixed that the requisites of its own statute will continue that purpose and scope, even in the face of a federal repeal. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-102(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Regulations adopted by the Commission under the authority granted by \u00a7 19-107(a)(2), in relevant part, require the Commission to take the following action when it grants a certificate of need:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">Notice of Certification. Notice that the facility or project is certified shall be made in writing by the Commission to those agencies responsible under the licensure program and other agencies that may have interests or responsibilities related to the project. <em>The notice shall be given at the time the applicant and the local health planning agency are notified. </em>The notice of certification shall contain at a minimum the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">(1) The nature and scope of the certified health services or facilities, described in suitable detail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">(2) The actual capital costs associated with the certified project, to include construction, equipment, acquisition (whether by purchase or lease), architects and consultants\u2019 fees, and all other costs (other than financing costs) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>to be incurred by the applicant in order to bring the project to completion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">(3) The total principal amount of funds to be borrowed (if any), and a description of the terms of the financing mechanism through which this borrowing will be accomplished____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">COMAR 10.24.01.06K (emphasis added). It is instantly clear that compliance with this regulation by the Commission is impossible of performance because no evidence was received as to sub-parts (2) and (3) above with respect to a 37-bed facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">There is more. The Commission, in its grant of this certificate of need, did so with what it described as four \u201cconditions,\u201d relying for its action upon \u00a7 19-118(d)(4), which provides: \u201cThe full commission shall, <em>after determining that the Committee\u2019s report is complete, </em>vote to approve, <em>approve with conditions </em>or deny the application on the basis of the committee\u2019s recommendation and the whole record before the committee.\u201d (Emphasis added). The questions arise, accordingly, (1) whether the Committee\u2019s report was complete, and (2) whether what the Commission calls \u201cconditions\u201d in its order are \u201cconditions\u201d within the meaning of the statute. We find that both must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Completeness of the Committee\u2019s Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjM\">The Commission is required by statute to make a determination \u201cthat the Committee\u2019s report is complete.\u201d (\u00a7 19-118(d)(4).). The order passed by the Commission makes manifest that the report was not complete. Indeed, after considering the additional evidence it concedes is essential to ultimate determination, the Commission could conclude that Southern has not offered satisfactory proof of its entitlement to a certificate of need because of deficits in the applicant\u2019s capacity or because other institutions would better provide a health care system in the concerned area offering \u201cfor all citizens, financial and geographic access to quality health care at a reasonable cost.\u201d \u00a7 19-102(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The Commission in its contingent certificate of need speaks of four \u201cconditions.\u201d In fact, Southern is ordered to submit additional evidence bearing upon not less than six statutory criteria the Commission is required to consider <em>before </em>a certificate of need may be granted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">Within 180 days of the date of issuance [the applicant shall submit]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">(a) A revised statement indicating revenues, expenses, costs, charges and capital costs (including source of any loans at the proposed or lower interest rate contained in the application) at the level of 37 additional medical/surgical beds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Minimum criteria fixed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300n-l<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> includes the requirement that the Commission shall include consideration,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-7\">In the case of a construction project\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">(A) the costs and methods of the proposed construction, including the costs and methods of energy provision, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-9\">(B) the probable impact of the construction project reviewed on the costs of providing health services by the person proposing such construction project and on the costs and charges to the public of providing health services by other persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-10\"><em>See also </em>Health General Art., \u00a7 19-115(k); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.412(a)(4) and (15). The Maryland Regulations require consideration \u201c[i]n the case of construction projects, the costs and methods of the proposed construction, including the costs and methods of energy provision and the promotion of energy conservation programs.\u201d COMAR 10.24.-01.06B(2)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">As stated <em>supra, </em>the applicant produced no evidence relating to the construction of a 37 bed facility beyond what a single witness described as \u201cthrown together\u201d by him to indicate a square footage cost within acceptable limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>In the course of its \u201cfinding of facts,\u201d the Commission, after speaking solely to the proposed financing of the 120-bed addition (the record contains no evidence concerning financing of a 37 bed facility), stated that the applicant \u201chas not\u201d provided evidence of the availability of such funding. The Commission then stated that \u201cthe requirements of COMAR 10.24.01.06(2)(g) are partially met.

In sum, the Commission\u2019s comments demonstrate it needed further evidence before the requirements of this minimum criterium could be met.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">(b) A revised statement <em>indicating manpower needs </em>at the level of 37 additional medical/surgical beds____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">(Emphasis added). Minimum criteria fixed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300n-l include the requirement that the Commission shall include consideration of ((c)(6)(A)), \u201c[t]he availability of resources (including health manpower, management personnel, and funds for capital and operating needs) for the provision of such services.\u201d <em>See also </em>42 C.F.R. 123.412(9) (Criteria for State Agency Review).

The Maryland regulations require consideration of \u201cthe need for the proposed health services of the population served or to be served, including ... the extent to which low income persons ... and other underserved groups are likely to have access to those services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>In what the Commission described as its \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusion of Law and Final Order,\u201d the Commission declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">The Commission is concerned about a current policy of the applicant that distinguishes between Medicaid patients requiring emergency care and Medicaid patients who could, in the opinion of the hospital, safely be transported to other hospitals. This latter group would not be treated by the applicant and would, instead, be bypassed to a \u201cstate-approved\u201d facility at the expense of the applicant (SMHC Exhibit 13). The existence of the current policy (dated June 3, 1982), limits access to the facility. <em>The policy makes it impossible for the Commission to find that the accessibility standard is being met. </em>Any approval of the project would be conditional upon a change in the policy, allowing transport of only those Medicaid patients for whom treatment would be more appropriately provided at another facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">(Emphasis added). The Commission added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">The Commission accepts that a portion of SMHC\u2019s patient population will be unable to pay for service but finds that SMHC has not provided written documentation of a charity care policy including provisions for determining ability to pay. <em>The Commission finds that the standard has not been met and that any approval of this project would be subject to a condition to bring SMHC into compliance with SHP accessibility standard 3b.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Abg\">(Emphasis added). Again, additional evidence would be required before a determination could be made as to whether Southern would or could meet this minimum requirement.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">(e) Within 60 days from the date of this Certification [Southern] must document that the current placement of its critical care units constitutes the lowest cost configuration feasible or provide a proposal for meeting HSP cost standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Air\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Minimum criteria fixed by 42 U.S.C. 300n-l include the requirement that the Commission shall include consideration of ((c)(9)(B)), \u201cthe probable impact of the construction project reviewed on the costs of providing health services by the person proposing such construction project and on the costs and charges to the public of providing health services by other persons.\u201d <em>See also </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 123.-412(a)(3), (15). The Maryland Act (\u00a7 19-114(e)), relating to the certificate of need program, requires that the standards of the State Health Plan \u201cshall address the availability, accessibility, cost and quality of health care.\u201d The Maryland regulations, in pertinent part, require consideration of \u201cthe immediate ... financial feasibility of the proposal.\u201d 10.24.01.06B(2)(e).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">In its \u201cFindings of Fact,\u201d the Commission stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">As a condition to any certification, [Southern] must supply estimates of personnel FTES and costs based on a 37 bed project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">As <em>a condition to any certification, </em>the Commission would require the applicant to provide detailed estimates of its costs and to demonstrate that these costs are reasonable when compared to the Marshall and Swift evaluation quarterly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">(f) If it decides to establish a definitive observation unit [Southern] must supply within 60 days data demonstrating that the higher rate applicable to this unit will not invalidate the overall cost savings claimed to result from shortened lengths of stay in critical care beds, and reduced average medical/surgical rates; and must explore the feasibility and desirability of separate licensure of such a unit and report the results to the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxD\">Minimum criteria fixed by 42 U.S.C. 300n~l include the requirement that the Commission shall include consideration of ((c)(10)), \u201c[t]he special circumstances of health service institutions and the need for conserving energy,\u201d and (11) \u201c[i]n accordance with section 300k-2(b) of this title, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>factors which affect the effect of competition on the supply of the health services being reviewed.\u201d <em>See also </em>42 C.F.R. 123.412(a)(3) (\u201cThe availability of less costly or more effective alternative methods of providing the services to be offered, expanded, reduced, relocated, or eliminated\u201d) and (4) (\u201cThe immediate and long-term financial feasibility of the proposal as well as the probable effect of the proposal on the costs of and charges for providing health services by the person proposing the service.\u201d). Maryland regulations require consideration of \u201cthe availability of less costly or more effective alternative methods of providing these services,\u201d COMAR 10.24.01.06.B(2)(d), and \u201c[t]he immediate and long-term financial feasibility of the proposal, and the probable impact of the proposal on the costs of and charges for the provision of services by the applicant and other institutional providers in the area.\u201d COMAR 10.24.01.06.-B(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">As to this criterion, the Commission said, \u201cApplicant\u2019s request for 31 critical care and intensive care units is not certifiable at this time,\u201d later adding, \u201cThe Commission finds that the applicant has demonstrated a need for designated definitive observation beds [as distinguished from less costly general medical/surgical beds] but that it has not adequately supported claimed cost savings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">These findings by the Commission demonstrate the inadequacy of the evidence in support of many of the minimum criteria at the 37 bed level. The certificate of need as issued by the Commission contains the following notation within its body: \u201cFailure to meet these performances shall render this Certificate of Need null and void.\u201d We consider that language to constitute an acknowledgment by the Commission that the evidence submitted by and on behalf of Southern did not permit it to conclude, on the basis of its consideration of the whole record, that a certificate of need should be granted to Southern.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">The comments of the Commission upon this last stated minimum criteria perhaps serve best to illustrate the degree of its uncertainty concerning the manner in which the 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>beds must be utilized by Southern and the financial consequences stemming from such utility to the applicant, to other health care facilities and to the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The Commission contends, however, that a certificate of need in the form issued in this case is authorized by the provisions of Health General Article \u00a7 19-118(d)(4) which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The full Commission shall, after determining that the Committee\u2019s report is complete, vote to approve, <em>approve with conditions, </em>or deny the application on the basis of the committee\u2019s recommendation and the whole record before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\n<em>Conditions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We find the contention to be without merit. We have heretofore pointed out that the committee\u2019s report literally has been found by the Commission, as a whole, not to be complete in that further evidence relating to minimum criteria must be considered <em>before </em>a <em>viable </em>certificate of need may be granted. The Commission\u2019s cause is not aided by the statutory authority to \u201capprove with conditions.\u201d In <em>Pirner v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 50, 58, 411 A.2d 135, 140 (1980), Judge Wilner for this Court so clearly and succinctly stated \u201cthat the overriding imperative in all cases is to construe a statute reasonably so as to effectuate the intent of its enactor____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">The word \u201ccondition\u201d must be read in its relationship to the statutory scheme that imposes upon the Commission the non delegable duty to act upon applications for a certificate of need only when there is a showing of need on the record made before the Commission. \u00a7 19-118(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">So read, the word must be interpreted to mean a specific requirement or restriction within the unilateral capacity of the applicant to achieve or to prevent. It is impermissible for the Commission conditionally to grant a certificate of need on the basis of future evidence that the applicant may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>or may not be able to adduce and that the Commission itself has on the record, declared was indispensable to the exercise of its non delegable authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Given the purpose and scope declared in the Federal and State Acts to produce respectively \u201c[t]he achievement of equal access to quality health care at a reasonable cost\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300k), and \u201c[t]he development of a health care system that provides for all citizens, financial and geographic access to quality health care at a reasonable cost\u201d (\u00a7 19-102), the \u201cconditions\u201d imposed by the Commission are not conditions at all \u2014 they are merely deferrals of the exercise of its non delegable authority (\u00a7 19-118(d)) to act until additional evidence is supplied. In short, <em>no </em>decision has been made by the Commission upon the question whether Southern ultimately will or will not be entitled to receive a certificate of need.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">This is not to say that the Commission may not, in the course of its review, demand that an applicant provide further evidence bearing upon its entitlement to the grant of a certificate of need and to defer action pending the receipt thereof. Indeed, the regulations adopted by the Commission provide for just such action. COMAR 10.24.-01.06C provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\"><em>During the course of review </em>an HSA or the State Agency may require additional information from an applicant for the purpose of clarifying or more fully answering an informational requirement of the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR AN ORDER VACATING THE ORDER OF THE COMMISSION DATED FEBRUARY 14, 1984, AND REMANDING THE CAUSE TO THE COMMISSION FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
