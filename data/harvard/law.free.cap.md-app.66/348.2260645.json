Count Two incorporated the allegations of Count One, but added that appellee \u201cnegligently advised [appellants] to sign certain documents thereby exposing [them] to unnecessary risk of loss of their personal and real property\u201d; as a result, appellants \u201cwere subjected to unnecessary legal process\u201d and suffered certain other financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">Count Three appeared to charge appellee with fraud. After incorporating the averments of Counts One and Two, it alleged that appellee represented to appellants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>\u201cthat certain documents signed by them were a formality, and would not expose them or either of them to risk of loss of real property, although the statements and representations made by [him] as alleged hereinabove were known to [be] false and fraudulent by [appellee] at the time they were made by [him].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Count Three further asserted that appellants relied on appellee\u2019s representations, that they had a right to rely on them, that, had they known the truth, they would not have signed the documents, and that, as a result of signing the documents, they suffered financial loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Appellee responded to this declaration with a motion to dismiss under Md.Rule 2-322,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claiming (1) the issuance of process \u2014 more particularly, the clerk\u2019s reissuance of process \u2014 was faulty, (2) by reason of the reference in Count One to 1978, the claims were barred by limitations, and (3) because each count \u201cis so very vague and ambiguous,\u201d appellee was unable to frame an answer. \u201cSpecifically,\u201d he urged, \u201cthe defects contained in each of the Counts are, that no dates are mentioned in either Counts II or III, no specific facts are alleged in any of the Counts concerning the alleged torts of negligence and/or defamation <em>[sic </em>] and no details of any kind are alleged concerning the legal services involved and/or the relationship involved as between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">At a hearing on this motion, the court decided that there was no impropriety in the issuance of process and so rejected the first ground raised in appellee\u2019s motion. It also determined, however, that the declaration was vague, both in terms of the alleged conduct complained of and when that conduct occurred. In their argument on the motion, appellants asserted that appellee\u2019s employment continued into 1981, an averment not reflected in the declaration but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>possibly critical with respect to the defense of limitations. In response to a question by the court, counsel for appellee indicated that he filed a motion to dismiss rather than a motion for more definite statement (Md.Rule 2-322(d)) because of the possibility that the claim was barred by limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The court ultimately decided to grant the motion with 15 days leave to amend, a period appellants\u2019 counsel said would be adequate. For whatever reason, however, appellants failed to file an amended complaint within the time allotted, and so, on February 19, 1985, an order was filed dismissing the case with prejudice. This appeal ensued, in which appellants argue that their declaration \u201ccontained sufficient facts to support a cause of action for each count.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Unfortunately for appellants, that is not the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">As noted, appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss sought to raise three defenses \u2014 a procedural irregularity in the clerk\u2019s reissuance of summons, limitations apparent on the face of the declaration, and such vagueness in the pleading as to render appellee unable to frame an answer. We are not concerned with the first of those defenses, for it was rejected by the court. It is important, in considering the other two, to look at how they were presented to and treated by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Under the pre-1984 Rules, there was some difference between law and equity as to how a defendant could raise a limitations defense. In an action at law, Rule 342 required limitations to be specially pled. Unless the time within which the action had to be filed was an element of the cause of action itself \u2014 part of the right to sue \u2014 rather than mere<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>ly a condition to the remedy, that defense could not be raised by demurrer. The rationale for that doctrine was that \u201cin an ordinary suit at law in which limitations go to the remedy rather than the right to a cause of action, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to anticipate the defense of limitations and plead facts in avoidance thereof in stating his cause of action.\u201d <em>Hoover v. Williamson, </em>236 Md. 250, 256, 203 A.2d 861 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">In equity actions, Rule 371b permitted any defense which appeared \u201con the face\u201d of the bill or petition to be raised either by demurrer or answer. Thus, in an equity case, \u201cif the pleading of the plaintiff show[ed] on its face that the bar of time is applicable, limitations [could] be raised by demurrer.\u201d <em>Hoover, </em>236 Md. at 256, 203 A.2d 861. Otherwise, the defense had to be raised by answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">With the merger of law and equity procedure, the new Rules, unfortunately, are not quite so clear in this regard. Under Rule 2-323(g), \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d is an affirmative defense, to be raised in an answer to the complaint. To the extent that the matter is governed by that Rule, the defense still must be specially pled, the difference, in a law case, being that the paper in which it is to be set forth is denominated an answer rather than a plea. <em>Compare </em>the sample form answer in Niemeyer &amp; Richards, <em>Maryland Rules Commentary, </em>155-56, <em>with </em>former Md. Rules Appendix of Forms, Form 11. What is not so clear is whether the broad direction that \u201cstatute of limitations\u201d be raised as an affirmative defense in an answer was intended to preclude its being raised in a motion to dismiss where the bar is either part of the cause of action or is apparent on the face of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Both Md. Rule 2-322(b), permitting the defense of \u201cfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\u201d to be raised by motion to dismiss, and Md. Rule 2-323(g), making limitations an affirmative defense to be raised in an answer, were derived from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u2014 Rules 12(b) and 8(c), respectively. The Federal practice in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>this regard is therefore relevant. That practice, at least from the more recent cases, is that the defense of limitations may be raised by motion to dismiss when the time bar is apparent on the face of the complaint. <em>See Conerly v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>623 F.2d 117 (9th Cir.1980); <em>Munshi v. New York University, </em>528 F.Supp. 1088 (S.D.N. Y.1981); <em>Hendrickson v. Buchbinder, </em>465 F.Supp. 1250 (S.D.Fla.1979). <em>See generally </em>2A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 12.10; 5 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 1277.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">We see nothing in the \u201clegislative\u201d history of Rules 2-322(b) or 2-323(g) that would dictate a different result. If the time bar \u2014 whether part of the cause of action itself or merely a condition to the remedy \u2014 is apparent on the face of the complaint, the complaint would indeed fail to state a claim <em>upon which relief can be granted. </em>A motion to dismiss would therefore be an appropriate, although not a mandatory, way in which to assert that defense. <em>See Antigua Condominium Association v. Melba Investors Atlantic, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 726, 501 A.2d 1359 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">That is not the case, however, with respect to complaints about vagueness. Unless the complaint actually omits essential elements of the cause of action or is so utterly vague or deficient in articulation as not to allege a cognizable cause of action, the proper method for complaining about vagueness is a motion for more definite statement, not a motion to dismiss. <em>See Sisk v. Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept., </em>644 F.2d 1056 (5th Cir.1981); <em>Frito-Lay, Inc. v. WAPCO Constructors, Inc., </em>520 F.Supp. 186 (M.D.La.1981); <em>Mueller v. Rayon Consultants, Inc., </em>170 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>F.Supp. 555 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>application for leave to appeal denied </em>(2d Cir.), <em>petition for rehearing en banc denied </em>271 F.2d 591 (2d Cir.1959); <em>Rogers v. Dwight, </em>145 F.Supp. 537 (E.D.Wis.1956), so construing F.R.C.P. 12. Md. Rule 2-322(d) provides that, \u201c[i]f a pleading to which an answer is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot reasonably frame an answer, that party may move for a more definite statement before answering.\u201d That was the very complaint made by appellee; as noted, his argument as to vagueness was simply that the declaration was too ambiguous to permit him to frame an answer. To the extent that complaint was valid \u2014 and, as we shall see, it was indeed valid \u2014 he was not entitled to have the declaration dismissed outright but only to have it amplified by a more definite statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">That, we think, is the relief actually granted by the court. Viewing the declaration in the light of the colloquy that occurred during the hearing, it would appear that the court was not convinced that appellants had utterly failed to state a cognizable claim, but only that a number of important details as to what occurred and when were lacking, and that appellee was entitled to a better statement of the claims. Notwithstanding appellee\u2019s tactical decision to seek outright dismissal on the limitations issue, the court effectively treated the motion to dismiss as a motion for more definite statement and gave appellants an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies in their declaration by filing an amended complaint.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>We see nothing inappropriate in that procedure. While the Maryland Rules have often been characterized as \u201cprecise rubrics,\u201d which indeed they are, there is some flexibility in their application, especially as to matters of form. Thus, as was formerly the case with demurrers, motions to dismiss may be treated as motions for summary judgment <em>(see </em>Md. Rule 2-322(b); <em>Pemberton v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>66 Md.App. 133, 502 A.2d 1101 (1986)), and we see no reason why, in a proper case, such a motion cannot be treated as a motion for more definite statement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ordinarily, a court is free to grant a lesser form or amount of relief than that requested if it finds a basis for some relief but not that actually sought. The issue, then, is not whether the declaration sufficed to state one or more causes of action but whether it was so vague as to entitle appellee to a more definite statement of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Viewing the case in that context, we find no error in the court\u2019s action. It may be that, in alleging that appellee was retained as counsel, that he failed to file necessary pleadings, and that, as a result, appellants suffered financial loss, Count One minimally sufficed to state an action in negligence, although any such holding would be extremely generous to appellants. But even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Count One does indeed so suffice, in light of the vague reference to 1978, appellee was certainly entitled to know when these acts or omissions allegedly occurred in order to determine whether to assert limitations as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Despite the incorporation into Count Two of \u201c[a]ll of the allegations contained in Count One of this Declaration,\u201d thereby implying, if not actually stating, that Count Two also concerned the action in the District of Columbia, counsel informed the court that, except for the fact of appellee\u2019s employment, the factual bases of the two counts were unrelated. \u201cIt\u2019s a separate action,\u201d counsel argued, arising from acts performed in Maryland and having nothing to do with the proceeding in the District of Columbia. The court\u2019s response was an understatement: \u201cGee, we\u2019d never be able to figure that one out, would we?\u201d Count Three, according to counsel, also apparently arose out of acts committed in Maryland. It, too, we gather, was unrelated to the D.C. proceeding; whether it was connected with the activity complained of in Count Two is not clear. Given the reference to 1978 in Count One, limitations was an apparent issue in all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">A defendant reading this Declaration would really have no way of knowing how properly to answer it. Appellee clearly was entitled to a more definite statement of the claim in all three counts. We construe the court\u2019s grant of the motion with leave to amend as the equivalent of an order under Rule 2-322(d) for appellants to supply the additional information. When they failed to do so within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the allotted time \u2014 15 days \u2014 dismissal with prejudice was an appropriate sanction. <em>See </em>Rule 2-322(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANTS TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">. Although the declaration was filed in November, 1983, service of process was not effected until August, 1984. The motion to dismiss was filed in September, 1984, and thus is governed by the new Rules that took effect July 1, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">. After entry of the February 19 order, appellants attempted to file an amended complaint, and a flurry of motions, including motions to strike or revise that order, ensued. As none of the motions to revise were filed within 10 days of the order, the time for appeal was not stayed. This appeal was noted before any of those motions were decided, and, as a result, the court ultimately denied the motions for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Tiller v. Elfenbein, </em>205 Md. 14, 106 A.2d 42 (1954). No complaint is made in this appeal about that action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b382-6\">. Moore, indeed, goes further, stating that \u201c[e]ven where the defect does not appear on the face of the complaint, the defendant should be able to raise it by motion to dismiss accompanied by affidavits or other material, which Rule 12(b) permits the court to treat as a motion for summary judgment. If there is a question of fact as to the existence of the defense, the issue cannot be determined on affidavits.\" 2A <em>Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 12.10, at pp. 12-85 to 12-87 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b383-5\">. The relevant colloquy was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\"COURT: Seems to me I\u2019m going to have to grant the Motion as to the Three Counts and give you leave to amend.

Although Md. Rule 2-322 is not entirely clear on the point, it would seem that leave to amend may, and in some instances should, be extended even where a pure motion to dismiss is granted. Under the former demurrer rule (Rule 345), leave to amend was to be liberally granted if the pleading deficiency was correctible, and that is also the practice under F.R.C.P. 12, from which Md. Rule 2-322 was derived. We see no indication that the Court of Appeals intended to change that practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
