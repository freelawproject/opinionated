GETTY, Associate Judge of the Court of Special Appeals (retired), specially assigned.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-6\">ALPERT, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">In this appeal we are called upon to determine what constitutes \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the person [charged with the traffic violation] will disregard [the] traffic citation,\u201d and whether subjecting that person to a warrantless arrest for a traffic violation was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Willis T. Parker, appellant, having been found guilty in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, contends on appeal that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atk\">The court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress the drugs and money seized from appellant\u2019s pocket and from the car.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">We disagree and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Transportation Article, \u00a7 26-202(a)(2) (1984 Repl.Vol., 1985 Supp.) provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-11\">A police officer may arrest without a warrant a person for a violation of the Maryland Vehicle Law, ... if ... the person has committed or is committing the violation within the view or presence of the officer, and either: (i) the person does not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity; or (ii) the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person will disregard a traffic citation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">It was pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(h) that Officer John J. Fabula arrested the appellant on August 29, 1984, after concluding that he was operating a motor vehicle without an operator\u2019s license. Upon a search incident to the arrest, Officer Fabula recovered from the appellant\u2019s right pants pocket a small clear plastic bag with some rice and five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>gelatin capsules containing a white powder which he believed to be cocaine. The officer then conducted a search of the vehicle which the appellant had been operating and recovered a bag which contained a large clear plastic bag with rice and twenty gelatin capsules, again containing a white powder which the officer thought was cocaine. Subsequently, appellant was charged, by criminal information, with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and on February 4, 1985, a suppression hearing was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the Honorable Marshall Levin presiding. At that hearing both Officer Fabula and the appellant gave conflicting testimony concerning the arrest and subsequent search and seizure. For reasons more particularly stated in the record, Judge Levin resolved the conflicts in favor of the police officer. As factfinder, he believed the testimony of Officer Fabula over that of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The officer\u2019s testimony revealed that on August 29, 1984, at about 2:50 p.m., in the 700 block of Cumberland Street in Baltimore City, he observed the appellant driving an automobile without a left rear brakelight. He followed and eventually stopped the car. As he approached the vehicle, he observed the appellant nervously and quickly roll a paper bag and place it in the console of the automobile. When he asked the appellant for his driver\u2019s license and registration for the vehicle, the appellant \u201cbecame somewhat nervous and he exited the car for no reason and walked to the front of the vehicle.\u201d The officer further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">He had no reason to exit the car like that. I was surprised when he got out and walked fast like that, and for a moment I thought he was going to run so I quickly walked behind him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Again, Parker was asked for his license and registration and responded that he should not be driving the vehicle and that he had no driver\u2019s license or registration. When asked for any other identification, he produced a \u201cprison ID which contained his picture but no address.\u201d Appellant continued his nervous behavior, <em>i.e., </em>\u201che was rubbing his face, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>walking to the front of the car and repeating, \u2018Man, I should not have been driving the car, and all that\u2019s stuff, you know, you got me.\u2019 \u201d Additionally, the officer thought that the appellant \u201cwas on <em>something\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., some type of controlled dangerous substance, because the officer could discern no odor of alcohol, appellant\u2019s eyes were watering, he was talking fast and rubbing his eyes and nose. The officer determined via the police radio that the vehicle was not reported stolen and that the appellant had no driver\u2019s license. He placed him under arrest, initially testifying that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\">Because I didn\u2019t think that everything was going together ... as far as his attitude, nervousness, he was placed under arrest for no Maryland driver\u2019s license, the ID part of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Further on in the hearing, the officer testified that he thought the appellant might not show up for trial, or that he might run away because of \u201chis attitude, your Honor, the nervousness.\u201d At an even later point in the hearing, Officer Fabula stated that he arrested the appellant because: \u201cI thought he was not going to make the ticket good, your Honor.\u201d When asked by the court why he felt that way, he responded, \u201cJust that one piece of ID, your Honor [the prison card].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">After carefully summing up the testimony and evidence, Judge Levin overruled the motion to suppress, succinctly setting forth his reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">So now the question finally is, if I do believe him, was he reasonable when he says that he felt that the defendant would not show up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">Well the defendant, to the officer\u2019s mentality, was driving a car when he had no business driving that car. He did not have a license to drive it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">Number two, he was nervous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">Number three, he did not supply that degree of evidence as to his identity, which includes, I find, his address, to put the officer\u2019s mind at ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Next that he showed him a card which showed he had been in prison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">Next, that he made a suspicious move of putting a bag and attempting to hide from the officer\u2019s view, a bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">Now it is true that the officer did not know what the bag had in it, but I find that all of these factors together furnish objective reasonable ground to believe that he would not show up, that he would disregard the traffic citation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">In asserting that the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence, appellant launches a two-pronged attack claiming first, that the arrest was illegal, and second, that even if the arrest was legal, the \u201cinventory search\u201d of the car was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">I. <em>Legality of the Arrest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Appellant contends that the arrest was illegal because it was not based upon a reasonable belief that the appellant would ignore the traffic citation. He argues that an arrest for a minor traffic violation cannot be used as an investigative tool merely because the police officer suspected that everything was not \u201cgoing together.\u201d What constitutes \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the person will disregard a traffic citation\u201d has never been interpreted by our appellate courts. In this case of first impression, we have no difficulty in determining the intention of the legislature when it chose those words. We need look no further than the statute itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">First, we observe that for the more serious offenses, such as driving while intoxicated, driving while under the influence of any drug, failure to stop in the event of an accident and driving on a revoked license, \u00a7 26-202(a)(3), a police officer may immediately arrest the alleged offender without regard to concerns of identity or belief that the person will disregard the traffic citation. With that in mind, we observe that the legislature contemplated situations where, in order to enforce less serious traffic laws, it would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>necessary to insure the appearance of the defendant at trial. Thus, where the person has not furnished satisfactory evidence of identity or where the officer otherwise had reason to believe that the person would disregard the citation, that is, not appear for trial, the officer could arrest on the spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Because we have no difficulty in holding that \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d is tantamount to \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe, <em>Graham v. State, </em>13 Md.App. 171, 177, 282 A.2d 162 (1971), <em>cert, denied, </em>264 Md. 748 (1972), we may rely on the definition of \u201cprobable cause\u201d as the barometer for determining whether Officer Fabula had \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the appellant would not appear for trial. \u201cProbable cause has been defined as a non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for a belief of guilt requiring less evidence for such belief than would justify conviction, but more evidence than mere suspicion.\u201d <em>Cuffia v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 521, 525, 287 A.2d 319 (1972), <em>cert, denied, </em>265 Md. 736. Its existence, justifying an arrest without a warrant, must be determined by factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent persons, not legal technicians, act. 5 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Appeal and Error </em>\u00a7 48 (1962). As the Supreme Court said in <em>Brinegar v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), \u201cin dealing with probable cause, ... as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 69 S.Ct. at 1310. And we note that one definition of the word \u201cprobable\u201d is \u201cthat which is likely to be so, or more likely to occur than not to occur.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New Twentieth Century Dictionary </em>1433 (Unabridged 2d ed. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Returning to the definition set forth in <em>Cuffia, </em>we believe that it is fair to say that the establishment of \u201cprobable cause\u201d requires more than mere suspicion but less than belief \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d (the standard for a finding of guilt). Thus, we find ourselves dealing with a standard that perhaps we could characterize as being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>in the middle ground: the belief that what is alleged to have occurred was more likely so than not so.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In the multitude of cases where \u201cprobable cause\u201d has been evaluated, courts have dealt with it in the context of whether a police officer <em>had </em>probable cause to believe that a felony or misdemeanor <em>had </em>been or was being committed. It has been said that such determination of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">probable cause is not to be evaluated from a remote vantage point of a library, but rather from the viewpoint of a prudent and cautious police officer on the scene at the time of the arrest. The question to be answered is whether such an officer in the particular circumstances, conditioned by his observations and information, and guided by the whole of his police experience, reasonably could have believed that a crime had been committed by the person to be arrested____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-6\"><em>Patterson v. United States, </em>301 A.2d 67, 69 (D.C.1973). <em>See also VonSleichter v. United States, </em>472 F.2d 1244, 1248 (D.C.Cir.1971); <em>Davis v. United States, </em>409 F.2d 458, 460 (D.C.Cir.1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>395 U.S. 949, 89 S.Ct. 2031, 23 L.Ed.2d 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Thus, it is apparent that in the usual evaluation of \u201cprobable cause,\u201d we are analyzing the officer\u2019s judgment as to something that has either already occurred or is occurring contemporaneously. He must consider that which he sees and hears or has seen and heard, evaluate it, synthesize it, and determine whether criminal activity is occurring or has occurred and whether the person that he would arrest is the perpetrator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>In the instant case, although we still view the circumstances from that of the \u201cprudent and cautious police officer on the scene,\u201d and consider whether the particular circumstances, his observations and information, guided by the whole of his police experience, would reasonably cause him to believe that the offender would not appear, we are dealing here not with suspected past or present criminal activity. Rather, we are dealing with a forecast that the suspect will \u201cprobably\u201d fail to appear for trial in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">On the question of disregard of the traffic citation, he must ask himself, \u201cIs that more likely to occur than not to occur?\u201d His task is similar to that of a medical doctor making a \u201cprognosis.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Quite naturally, his prognostic ability is a reflection of his training, experience and intelligence, all of which contribute to his ability to reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Essentially, therefore, we are asked to extend the \u201creasonable grounds \u2014 probable cause doctrine,\u201d which generally is invoked retrospectively, to situations where it is invoked prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Against that backdrop, we must determine whether the trial judge\u2019s conclusion of reasonableness was correct. We hold that it was and shall explain our reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">It is uncontroverted that the appellant committed a traffic violation: driving without an operator\u2019s license, within the view or presence of the officer. Therefore, the only legal question before us to be viewed under our own \u201cindependent reflective constitutional judgment,\u201d <em>Dixon v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 19, 327 A.2d 516 (1974), is, as correctly stated by the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Whether the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the appellant would disregard the traffic citation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFP\">Appellant argues here, as he did below, that the purpose of his arrest was not to insure that he would appear for trial, but because the officer suspected something illegal was occurring when the appellant placed the bag into the console and put the lid on the console chamber down. Appellant suggests that the arrest was a subterfuge; that it was an investigative tool because the officer suspected criminal activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Further, the appellant somewhat boldly but obliquely suggests that the court's ruling was not really based on the five \u201cfacts\u201d indicated in its oral opinion, but rather on the officer\u2019s suspicion of illegal activity and the possibility in the mind of the officer that the evidence would disappear if he permitted appellant to leave the scene rather than placing him under arrest. The police officer, in response to questioning by the court, stated that he arrested the appellant because he believed that he would not \u201cmake good on the ticket.\u201d At this point he was \u201ceyeball to eyeball\u201d with the trial judge. The trial judge had the opportunity to judge his credibility. While the appellant may doubt the officer\u2019s sincerity and credibility as to that statement, we must defer to the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact in that regard. Our duty is to make an independent reflective constitutional judgment when reviewing, as we do here, the trial judge\u2019s conclusions based upon that which he found to be true, <em>i.e., </em>the police officer\u2019s version.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">We recognize that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-6\">[Although we give great weight to the findings of the hearing judge as to specific, first-level facts (such as the time that an interrogation began, whether a meal was or was not served, whether a telephone call was requested, etc.) we must make our own independent judgment as to what to make of those facts; we must, in making that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>independent judgment, resolve for ourselves the ultimate, second-level facts....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><em>Walker v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 684, 694-95, 280 A.2d 260 (1971). <em>See Borgen v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 61, 79, 472 A.2d 114 (1984); <em>Manalansan v. State, </em>45 Md.App. 667, 415 A.2d 308 (1980); <em>Fidazzo v. State, </em>32 Md.App. 590, 363 A.2d 583 (1976); <em>Dixon v. State, </em>23 Md.App. 19, 327 A.2d 516 (1974); <em>Howell v.

State, </em>282 Md. 625, 630, 386 A.2d 780 (1978). Here the \u201csecond-level fact\u201d is the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds to believe that the appellant would disregard the traffic citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The police officer\u2019s version of what occurred and his articulation of their impression upon him are evaluated as \u201cfirst level facts.\u201d As such, we must give great weight to the findings of the trial judge with respect to these first level facts. As an appellate court, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As\">can reject the testimony of a witness credited by the triers of the fact only when the testimony is inherently improbable. There must exist a physical impossibility that the statements of the witness are true or their falsity must appear without resorting to inferences or deduction. The appellate court may not substitute its judgment with respect to the credibility of a witness for that of the ... trial judge on the ground that the evidence is inherently improbable unless it is so clearly false and unbelievable that reasonable minds may not differ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-7\"><em>Borgen, supra </em>[58 Md.App.] at 79-80, 472 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Because Officer Fabula\u2019s testimony was neither inherently improbable nor physically impossible, we must accept the trial court\u2019s findings as to the first level facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The concept of first and second level facts arose primarily from \u201cconfession\u201d cases in which the ultimate question of voluntariness is one of fact. It has been extended, however, to cases in which the ultimate question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>one of law \u2014 whether an officer\u2019s knowledge sufficed to give him probable cause to make an arrest or conduct a warrant-less search. Although in a literal sense it is probably inappropriate to refer to such a legal conclusion as a \u201cfact\u201d \u2014even a \u201csecond level\u201d or \u201cconstitutional\u201d fact \u2014 the same analysis is employed. We give the trial court deference with respect to the underlying facts \u2014 what the officer observed and what his mental state was \u2014 but use our own judgment as to whether the legal conclusion drawn by the court from those facts is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">Now, in making our own independent judgment as to what to make of those facts, <em>Walker, supra, </em>we must resolve for ourselves the ultimate second level facts of this case \u2014 the existence or non-existence of (\u201creasonable ground\u201d) probable cause to believe that the appellant would not appear for trial. Was the officer justified in determining that it was more likely so than not so that the appellant would fail to appear at trial? We must remember that unlike situations where a police officer is assessing past conduct, as we noted earlier, Officer Fabula was making a prognosis. Based on his experience as a police officer, based on what he saw the appellant do at the scene, he had to \u201cprognosticate\u201d as to whether the appellant would honor the citation. We must remember that the police officer, through his testimony, placed a great deal of weight on the nervous behavior of the appellant. We cannot say that was unreasonable. Likewise, he placed a great deal of weight on the only type of identification presented by the appellant \u2014 the prison I.D. card. That this was not a very reassuring piece of identification was not an unreasonable concern of Officer Fabula. The conduct of the appellant in exiting the car in a manner which caused the police officer to believe he.would flee, again, was not an unreasonable consideration on the part of the police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">Like other cases involving \u201cprobable cause,\u201d what is reasonable turns on the particular facts and evidence presented. The facts must be carefully weighed and sensi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>tively balanced in each case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> so that the constitutional rights of the individual citizen to be free from unwarranted intrusion shall be carefully considered in harmony with the necessity of diminishing the carnage on our highways by fair enforcement of the motor vehicle laws. <em>See Mercer v. State, </em>6 Md.App. 370, 251 A.2d 387 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>255 Md. 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">We hold that under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, the arrest was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\n<em>The Inventory Search</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">Appellant asserts that the \u201cso-called inventory search was merely an excuse to discover what was in the paper bag in the console compartment.\u201d The State incorrectly contends that this issue was not preserved. This issue was clearly raised below, but was not expressly ruled upon by the trial judge. We believe, however, that by overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, the trial judge implicitly ruled on the issue, and therefore it is properly before us for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>We hold that the search of the vehicle was legal. Having validly arrested the defendant, Officer Fabula proceeded to make a lawful search incident to the prior lawful arrest. <em>Gustafson v. Florida, </em>414 U.S. 260, 94 S.Ct. 488, 38 L.Ed.2d 456 (1973); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973); <em>Jones v.

His observation on the appellant\u2019s person of what he believed to be cocaine thereafter placed the officer in a position where he had the legal right to search the automobile, particularly since he had earlier observed the appellant conceal a bag within the console of that vehicle. <em>Colorado v.

In arguing that there were not sufficient reasonable grounds to arrest appellant, appellant cites three cases, each of which we may easily distinguish. In <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>597 F.2d 187 (9th Cir.1979), the Ninth Circuit held a search of defendant\u2019s person to be unconstitutional, not because it stemmed from an allegedly unlawful arrest, as is asserted here, but because the search violated <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and its progeny. In <em>State v. Hehman, </em>90 Wash.2d 45, 578 P.2d 527 (1978), the defendant had been stopped and had produced a recently expired driver\u2019s license. In holding the custodial arrest to be illegal, the Washington court noted a statutory alternative to arrest, signing a written promise to appear in court, was not given to the defendant. The court, however, said \"we do not imply that a law enforcement officer must disregard custodial arrest if he has other reasonable grounds apart from the minor traffic violation itself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>578 P.2d at 529. Finally, appellant\u2019s cite to <em>State v. Corner, </em>28 Wash.App. 439, 624 P.2d 204 (1981), is without merit, as the holding there was based on an unreasonable \"third search\u201d at the police station after the defendant had been <em>legally </em>arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Here the trial court determined there existed enough factors to constitute \"reasonable grounds\u201d to arrest the appellant. Accordingly, there was no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b42-6\">ROBERT M. BELL,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar\">Judge, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">I cannot agree with the majority that \u201cunder the particular facts and circumstances of this case, the arrest was lawful;\u201d rather, I believe that the facts and circumstances of this case clearly demonstrate that appellant\u2019s arrest was a mere subterfuge to search appellant and his car in order to obtain evidence of crime. Consequently, I would reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">The law applicable to arrest for traffic offenses is codified in Md. Transportation Code Ann. \u00a7 26-202. Since the offense for which appellant could have been arrested is not one of the offenses specifically enumerated in subsections (a)(1) or (a)(3) and subsections (a)(4) and (a)(5) are inapposite, we direct our attention to subsection (a)(2) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">(a) <em>In general </em>\u2014 A police officer may arrest without a warrant a person for a violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Maryland Vehicle Law, including any rule or regulation adopted under it, or for a violation of any traffic law or ordinance of any local authority of this state, if: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-4\">(2) The person has committed or is committing the violation within the view or presence of the officer, and either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">(i) The person does not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">(ii) The officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person will disregard a traffic citation ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Because the trial judge found that Parker furnished sufficient evidence of identification, this appeal turns upon the meaning and application of subsection 2(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">The majority correctly concludes that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d as used in the statute is synonymous with \u201cprobable cause\u201d. <em>Edwardsen v. State, </em>231 Md. 332, 337, 190 A.2d 84 (1963) (\u201cthe \u2018reasonable grounds\u2019 or \u2018probable cause\u2019 may consist of facts and circumstances within the officer\u2019s knowledge or of which he has reasonably trustworthy information... \u201d) <em>Mulcahy v. State, </em>221 Md. 413, 421, 158 A.2d 80 (1960) (\u201c... a peace officer may arrest without a warrant, provided there were <em>reasonable grounds </em>to believe at the time of arrest that a felony had been committed and that the person arrested had committed the offense, [emphasis added]\u201d.) <em>Johnson v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 187, 191, 259 A.2d 97 (1969) (\u201c... [T]he rule of probable cause is [a] non-technical conception of a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, ..., but more evidence than would arouse a mere suspicion.\u201d) <em>See also Murray v. State, </em>236 Md. 375, 203 A.2d 908 (1964); <em>Ford v. State, </em>37 Md.App. 373, 377 A.2d 577 (1977). As such, as the majority has correctly set forth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>\u201creasonable grounds\u201d requires less evidentiary justification than would be required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the violator will not appear, but more than would be required to arouse a \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d, which \u201cinvolves a significantly lower degree of objective evidentiary justification than does probable cause... \u201d. <em>Watkins v. State, </em>288 Md. 597, 606, 420 A.2d 270 (1980). Furthermore, the test of the existence or non-existence of reasonable grounds is an objective one. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Section 26-202(a)(2)(ii) <em>does </em>require that probable cause exist with regard to prospective, rather than retrospective conduct, which, as the majority stresses imposes a duty on the officer at the scene to prognosticate; however, it does not signal the lessening of the quantrum of evidentiary justification for an arrest or the permissibility of applying a more subjective standard to the probable cause determination on review. The objective test remains both viable and mandatory. It is in this context that we must determine if the facts and circumstances shown by the evidence and as enunciated by the trial judge, objectively constitute \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the person will disregard a traffic citation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Our threshold task, when reviewing a probable cause determination, is to identify objective factors which directly relate to the probability of non-compliance with a citation. It is against such factors that the officer\u2019s initial determination and the court\u2019s later one must be judged. Md.Rule 4-216(f) provides some guidance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">(f) <em>Factors Relevant to Conditions of Release. </em>\u2014 In determining which conditions of release will reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant as required, the judicial officer, on the basis of information available or developed in a pretrial release inquiry, may take into account:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">(1) The nature and circumstances of the offense charged, the nature of the evidence against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>fendant, and the potential sentence upon conviction, insofar as these factors are relevant to the risk of nonappearance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">(2) The defendant\u2019s prior record of appearance at court proceedings or flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at court proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(3) The defendant\u2019s family ties, employment status and history, financial resources, reputation, character and mental condition, length of residence in the community, and length of residence in the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">(4) The recommendation of an agency which conducts pretrial release investigations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">(5) The recommendation of the State\u2019s Attorney;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(6) Information presented by defendant\u2019s counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">(7) The danger of the defendant to himself or to herself or others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">(8) Any other factor, including prior convictions, bearing on the risk of a wilful failure to appear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-11\">I recognize, of course, that the information contemplated by this rule will be developed in a more leisurely fashion and will be more complete in the context of a bail hearing than is possible at the scene of an arrest; however, it is obvious to me, given the purpose of the rule \u2014 to <em>\u201creasonably ensure </em>the appearance of the defendant as required\u201d (emphasis added), Md.Rule 4-216(d) \u2014 that the factors enumerated are also relevant to a similar determination required to be made to justify an arrest. Therefore, although the rule requires that the determination whether and under what circumstances a defendant will appear at trial be made at a different and later stage of the criminal prosecution than the determination required by \u00a7 26-202(a)(2), I think the factors enumerated in subsection (f), particularly numbers 1, 2, 3, 6,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 8, being objective in nature, are helpful in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>judging whether \u201creasonable grounds to believe that the person will disregard a traffic citation\u201d existed in this case. Another factor relevant to this determination is whether the officer sought to issue the person a citation, the receipt of which the person refused to acknowledge, <em>See </em>Transp. art. \u00a7 26-203(b) and (c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With this background, I now proceed to consider the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">No question of the propriety of the stop of appellant\u2019s vehicle has been raised and, because appellant was driving without a license, it is clear that a violation of the traffic laws had occurred.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, only the facts before the court and those factors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> enunciated by the trial judge as forming the reasonable grounds for the officer\u2019s belief that appellant would disregard a traffic citation need be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">The trial judge relied on the following factors: (1) appellant was nervous; (2) appellant \u201cdid not supply that degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>of evidence as to his identity, which includes, I find his address, to put the officer\u2019s mind at ease\u201d; (3) appellant produced a prison identity card; and (4) appellant \u201cmade a suspicious move putting a bag and attempting to hide from the officer\u2019s view, a bag.\u201d He concluded that \u201call of these factors together furnish objective reasonable grounds to believe that he would not show up, that he would disregard the traffic citation,\u201d thus focusing on the appropriate standard. The trial judge\u2019s concluding remarks, however, reflect an entirely different focus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">I admit it is not that powerful a case that there cannot be a cogent argument, as there has been by Mr. Hedgepeth, but I also believe that if that officer had released that defendant and let him drive away in that ear, that that officer himself would have been subject to criticism by his superiors, who would have said why did you let that man go under these circumstances, because if you suspected something illegal was going on when he put the lid on the console chamber down, if you had any suspicions at all, you can bet your boots that any evidence that there might be, would disappear once you let him go, and I think the officer may well be subject to censor if he had not arrested the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">It is in this context that the evidence and the findings of the trial judge must be independently, reflectively judged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\u00ae The evidence does not support the trial judge\u2019s findings that the officer had reasonable grounds to arrest appellant. Three of the four factors enumerated by the trial judge are directly relevant to, and probative of, a belief that appellant may have been engaged in criminal activity. If germane at all to appellant\u2019s probable non-compliance with a citation, they are only indirectly and tangentially so. Obvious in this regard is the reliance on appellant\u2019s secreting of a bag <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>when he was stopped. That act unquestionably was suspicious, and unquestionably aroused the officer\u2019s suspicion that criminal conduct was afoot. That act, however, at best, sheds but little light on the probability of appellant\u2019s compliance with a traffic citation had one been issued to him. Similarly, appellant\u2019s \u201cattitude, nervousness\u201d, assuming that a violation of the traffic laws \u2014 even a minor one<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 does not legitimately engender some nervousness, when viewed in the context of this case, tells us a great deal more about appellant\u2019s possible involvement in criminal activity than it does about his likelihood to obey a citation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The display of a prison identification card is the least helpful yet; at best, it is neutral. Although it shows that appellant had been in prison for a more serious charge, the reasonable inferences deducible therefrom do not support the conclusion that appellant would fail to comply with a traffic citation, especially since, in this case, none of those inferences rises above speculation. Thus, taken singly or as a group, these factors do not come close to establishing reasonable grounds to believe that appellant would not comply with a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The failure to provide an address <em>is </em>a significant factor in predicting whether a person will obey a citation. The trial judge properly found that appellant did not supply an address. Even so, the circumstances of this case do not provide the required evidentiary justification for the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>The only offense for which probable cause<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to charge and/or arrest existed was driving without a license, the maximum penalty for which is a five hundred dollar ($500) fine and, as to which, a court appearance may not be required.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When stopped, appellant either volunteered or supplied upon request, the following information, which was verified: a visual inspection of the engine area of the car verified that there was a problem with the transmission; a stolen car check verified that the car was not reported stolen and was registered to a female friend of appellant\u2019s;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and a license check verified what appellant volunteered\u2014 that he did not have a driver\u2019s license. Significantly, the license check did not disclose that appellant had outstanding traffic citations or that his privilege to drive was either suspended or revoked. Although it contained no address, appellant did supply, as the court found, identification on request. And contrary to the officer\u2019s professed fear, appellant did not flee or attempt to flee. Juxtaposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>against this background are the following: the officer did not ask appellant for his address and, in fact, testified at trial that he was not interested in appellant\u2019s address. The arrest was. made, in the officer\u2019s words, \u201c[bjecause I didn\u2019t think that everything was going together ..., honestly, as far as his attitude, nervousness. He was placed under arrest for no Maryland driver\u2019s license, the ID part of it.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS\">This is not a case in which pertinent information <em>was requested </em>and refused or the pertinence of information explained, but still not produced. Here, the information relied upon at trial was not requested at the scene because the officer apparently deemed it unimportant. The trial judge\u2019s reliance on appellant\u2019s failure \u201c[to] supply that degree of evidence as to his identity, which includes, I find, his address, to put the officer\u2019s mind at ease\u201d imposed a requirement that appellant negate at the scene of his arrest, and in a vacuum, the existence of probable cause for the officer to believe that he would not obey a citation and, in effect, made the test for judging the existence of that probable cause a subjective one, totally dependent on the officer\u2019s state of mind.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant could not possibly meet the burden thus placed on him. He could not know unless he was told what the standard was which he was required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>to negate, nor could he know, again without having been told, what would satisfy the officer. The officer, on the other hand, is permitted to arrest a minor traffic violator without obligation to first request relevant information or to explain its importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">I would hold that when an arrest has been made pursuant to \u00a7 26-202(a)(2)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the record must objectively reflect the existence of reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested will not comply with a traffic citation. This may require, depending upon the circumstances, that the officer affirmatively develop and verify relevant information at the scene. Such a requirement will not be onerous since much of that information is readily available or may be obtained as a result of checks routinely made. For example, the nature of the offense, including the potential sentence, and the evidence against the defendant are matters uniquely within the knowledge of the arresting officer; aspects of the defendant\u2019s community stability, such as, for example, his address and employment status, are proper, indeed, necessary, subjects of interrogation; and, in the context of a traffic violation, information regarding the defendant\u2019s prior record of non-compliance with citations may be obtained as a part of the normal license check procedure. Of course, a defendant\u2019s refusal to acknowledge receipt of a traffic citation after its issuance would be such clear and objective reasonable grounds. In short, prior to the arrest of the traffic law offender, generally the officer must afford the offender an opportunity to provide information relevant and necessary to an assessment of his or her likelihood of compliance with a citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">I agree with appellant that the officer\u2019s actions in this case were motivated by a desire to investigate suspected criminal activity and not by any concern that appellant would not obey a citation. Likewise, close scrutiny of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>court\u2019s analysis, although partially couched in the appropriate statutory language, reveals that the court applied, in reality, the wrong standard. The precipitating event in the chain leading to appellant\u2019s arrest was the officer\u2019s belief that appellant secreted a bag from him. Thereafter, the way in which the officer viewed appellant\u2019s actions was colored by the officer\u2019s suspicions that appellant was engaged in criminal activity: appellant\u2019s nervousness was attributed to a cause other than his having violated the traffic laws and appellant\u2019s display of a prison identification card was viewed as corroborating those suspicions. Fortuitously, appellant did not have a driver's license. This fact thus became, for the officer, the vehicle to discover the nature of the criminal activity he suspected. As the concluding comments of his ruling demonstrate, the trial judge adopted and legitimized this faulty premise. This arrest was a mere subterfuge for the search for evidence that followed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-12\">. It is not likely defendant\u2019s attorney will be present at the scene of the arrest for traffic violation. Therefore the information required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>number 6 must be read as being information obtained from the defendant, himself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\">.

Neither the trial judge, nor the majority deigns to elucidate how these factors support the conclusion that appellant would not comply with a citation. I find this failure on the part of the majority to be significant since it has itself recognized that when reviewing the trial judge\u2019s conclusions, \u201d[o]ur duty is to make an independent reflective constitutional judgment.\u201d It is not evident to me, from its opinion, that it has so judged the trial judge's conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b47-7\">a.
