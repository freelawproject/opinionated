He was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and to three years on the deadly weapon conviction, with the sentences to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">At trial, it was apparently undisputed by appellant that he killed the victim, Kevin Smothers. His defense was that (1) the killing was in \u201cself-defense,\u201d and (2) if not in self-defense, then he killed because of a \u201chot-blooded\u201d response to provocation, a defense which would mitigate murder to manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Appellant noted a timely appeal and before us complains that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\u201cI. The trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the offense of manslaughter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">II. The trial court erred in excluding evidence that the victim had shot Appellant a few months prior to the homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">III. The trial court erred in permitting Appellant to be impeached on the basis of a conviction of assault with intent to murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-10\">IV. The trial court erred in failing to to propound a requested <em>voir dire </em>question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-11\">V. The trial court erred in refusing to call Andre Farmer as a court\u2019s witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">We find merit in two of appellant\u2019s contentions and therefore shall reverse and remand for a new trial on his murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-14\">Appellant first contends that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on the subject of manslaughter as he requested. The exact point in dispute is whether there was sufficient evidence adduced at trial to support a manslaughter instruction based on the \u201cRule of Provocation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>As Judge Orth noted in <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 7, 10-11, 262 A.2d 316 (1970),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">\u201cFor the \u2018Rule of Provocation\u2019 to be invoked there are four requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">(1) There must have been adequate provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-6\">(2) The killing must have been in the heat of passion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">(3) It must have been a sudden heat of passion \u2014 that is, the killing must have followed the provocation before there had been a reasonable opportunity for the passion to cool;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">(4) There must have been a causal connection between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-9\"><em>See also Scott v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 311, 323, 494 A.2d 992 (1985); <em>Cunningham v. State, </em>58 Md.App. 249, 258, 473 A.2d 40 (1984). With these requirements in mind, we now turn to the evidence at hand, viewing it in the light most favorable to appellant, to determine if there was evidence from which the jury could have found that appellant killed in response to a hot-blooded provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Appellant testified that at approximately 8:30 p.m. on November 21, 1983, he encountered the victim on the corner of Milton Avenue and East Hoffman Street, that the two exchanged \u201ca few words and whatnot,\u201d and that an \u201caltercation\u201d arose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He claimed that he and the victim \u201cstarted tussling with one another,\u201d that the victim brandished a knife but that he was able to get the knife from the victim. At this point, according to appellant, he was in an enraged state, having \u201clost complete control\u201d of himself, and began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>chasing the victim, who had apparently started to retreat once disarmed. The chase lasted some 60 to 90 seconds.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">On direct examination, appellant testified that when he caught the victim, he stabbed him \u201c[b]ecause I felt he was trying to get a gun like he usually have.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On cross-examination, he testified that the victim \u201cgot tired of running from me and turned to try to take [the knife] away from me.\u201d He added, in this account, that he stabbed the victim in.the upper body as the victim \u201crushed\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">1. <em>Was there \u201cadequate provocation\u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">For a provocation to be \u201cadequate,\u201d it must be \u201ccalculated to inflame the passion of a reasonable man and tend to cause him to act for the moment from passion rather than reason.\u201d R. Perkins, <em>Perkins on Criminal Law, </em>at p. 56 (2d ed. 1969). <em>See also Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 155 (C. Torcia ed. 1979). \u201cThere is adequate provocation when there is a mutual quarrel or combat. \u2018The combat is mutual if the intent to fight is mutual, and in such situations the question of which one actually strikes the first blow is not controlling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitehead v. State, supra, </em>9 Md.App. at 11, 262 A.2d 316 (quoting Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at p. 49).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">In his brief, appellant\u2019s principal argument is that he and the victim engaged in a \u201cmutual quarrel or combat.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In our view, his testimony recounting the \u201caltercation\u201d and the \u201ctussling,\u201d though hardly indisputable, fairly generated sufficient evidence of \u201cadequate provocation\u201d when considered in the light most favorable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>2. <em>Was the killing in the \u201cheat of passion \u201d?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The focus of the element is subjective: did the slayer act while in the throes of actual hot-blooded passion? <em>See Tripp v. State, </em>36 Md.App. 459, 469, 374 A.2d 384, <em>cert. denied </em>281 Md. 745 (1977). Generally speaking, only he can attest to the \u201chot-blooded\u201d nature of the killing. <em>Bartram v. State, </em>33 Md.App. 115, 175, 364 A.2d 1119 (1976), <em>affirmed </em>280 Md. 616, 374 A.2d 1144 (1977); <em>Tripp v. State, supra, </em>36 Md.App. at 469, 374 A.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Here, appellant did testify in this regard. <em>Compare Tripp v. State, supra. </em>By his own account, he was in an enraged state; he was \u201cmore or less like in a blackout,\u201d \u201ccouldn\u2019t handle what happened, what had transpired\u201d between him and the victim, and just \u201clost complete control.\u201d Thus, we believe appellant adduced legally sufficient evidence to generate the question of whether he subjectively killed in the \u201cheat of passion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">3. <em>Was the killing in the \u201csudden\u201d heat of passion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">In the analysis of this element, we are \u201cconcerned with the objective test of whether there had been a sufficient cooling time for the passions of an average and reasonable man to abate.\u201d <em>Tripp v. State, supra, </em>36 Md. App. at 470, 374 A.2d 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">From appellant\u2019s testimony, his passions were aroused to the boiling point during his \u201caltercation\u201d and \u201ctussling\u201d with the victim. Further, it was uncontroverted that the ensuing chase lasted some 60 to 90 seconds. In our view, this short elapse of time could hardly be deemed sufficient as a matter of law for a \u201chot-blooded\u201d passion to subside and to allow for \u201ccool deliberation.\u201d <em>Compare Cunningham v. State, supra, </em>58 Md.App. at 259, 473 A.2d 40; <em>Tripp v. State, supra, </em>36 Md.App. at 469, 374 A.2d 384. Indeed, a jury could find that the chase intensified the fury of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>4. <em>Was there a \u201ccausal connection </em>\u201d <em>between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Lastly, the \u201cRule of Provocation\u201d requires that there be some direct causal relationship between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act. That is, \u201c[t]he adequate provocation must have engendered the heat of passion, and the heat of passion must have been the cause of the act which resulted in death.\u201d Perkins, <em>supra, </em>at p. 69.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In the instant case, as we have pointed out in the \u201cmutual quarrel or combat\u201d analysis, during the \u201caltercation\u201d and \u201ctussling\u201d between the two, the victim purportedly expressed regret for being unsuccessful in a prior attempt to kill appellant, promised to be successful in his efforts next time, and apparently drew a knife on appellant during their quarrel. This, as appellant testified, evoked \u201chot-blooded\u201d passion, and prompted him to fatally stab the victim after a heated chase. We hold that appellant made the requisite minimal showing necessary to generate the issue of direct causal relationship between the provocation, the passion, and the fatal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">As we noted (n. 1, <em>ante), </em>appellant claimed that the victim had shot him in the head during the summer of 1983 \u2014 a few months before the killing giving rise to the instant appeal \u2014 and sought to introduce evidence to that effect. The State objected, asserting that, except for appellant\u2019s \u201cbald allegation,\u201d there was no evidence that the shooting had actually occurred. The court sustained the objection, opining that, if appellant had some basis for \u201calleging that he was shot by this deceased,\u201d it would be admitted into evidence, but that otherwise the incident could not be referenced. Defense counsel made a proffer of the incident, and, although no formal charges or statement had been made accusing the victim, counsel offered a hospital record to show that appellant had been treated for the injury on a certain date. In refusing appellant\u2019s testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>as to the prior shooting we believe that the lower court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">As we said, appellant posited two theories intended to exculpate or mitigate the homicide \u2014 self-defense and \u201chotblooded\u201d provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We agree with appellant\u2019s contention that the shooting tended to show the victim\u2019s violent proclivities and thus would be admissible in connection with the defense of self-defense to show that appellant acted reasonably. <em>See Thomas v. State, </em>301 Md. 294, 306-07, 483 A.2d 6 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We disagree, however, that the prior shooting could be introduced to show that appellant went \u201cout of control.\u201d As we pointed out in Part I, the theory of \u201chot-blooded\u201d provocation requires that there be a causal relationship between the provocation (here, a mutual combat or quarrel), the \u201chot-blooded\u201d passion aroused by the provocation, and the fatal act. Since the causal relationship is required, and this prior shooting could only evidence a \u201cgrudge,\u201d not the \u201cpassion\u201d invoked by the provocation, it could not, within the confines of the \u201chot-blooded\u201d response to provocation analysis, tend to prove any of the requisite elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Accordingly, we hold that evidence of the prior shooting was admissible for purposes of self-defense, although not with respect to the \u201cprovocation\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Appellant\u2019s third complaint is that the trial court erred in permitting the State to impeach him on the basis of a conviction for assault with intent to murder. He argues that impeachment founded on this conviction was erroneous \u201cbecause it was never established that [he] had been represented by counsel, or had been an adult, when it occurred.\u201d To support his contention, appellant relies on an isolated passage in the transcript, wherein he answered that he had been convicted of the charge by way of a \u201cplea bargain,\u201d apparently, he says, without first being questioned as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>whether he was an adult or was represented by counsel at the time. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Quite simply, the argument is factually incorrect. Immediately before asking appellant whether he had been convicted of specific offenses \u2014 namely, robbery, escape, day-house breaking, and the assault with intent to murder charge complained of \u2014 the State\u2019s Attorney prefaced the area of inquiry with a question delving into the subjects that appellant claims were not established. Specifically, he asked appellant: \u201cMr. Carter, since your eighteenth birthday, have you been convicted of a crime where you had an attorney or waived your right to an attorney?\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is clear that appellant considered and understood the State\u2019s inquiry as prefatory to each question about the specific offenses, for when the State asked about the robbery conviction appellant maintained that the conviction was overturned because he was a juvenile. In our view, the State\u2019s line of inquiry concerning appellant\u2019s prior convictions, when viewed in context, establishes the requisite foundation that appellant was an adult, and was either represented by counsel or waived his right to counsel when he was convicted of the assault with the intent to murder by way of the \u201cplea bargain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Appellant next alleges error on the part of the lower court in refusing to ask the prospective jurors, on <em>voir dire </em>examination, \u201cwhether they had any problem with the proposition that the mere fact that a person has been charged with a crime is not evidence of guilt.\u201d Although the trial judge indicated that he would cover the point in his instructions to the jury, and did so, appellant claims that the very different purposes underpinning <em>voir dire </em>and jury instructions made the judge\u2019s ruling prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>In <em>Twining v. State, </em>234 Md. 97, 198 A.2d 291 (1964), one of the requested <em>voir dire </em>questions related to whether the jury would give the accused the benefit of the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. The Court of Appeals held that the lower court had not abused its discretion in refusing the question for <em>voir dire, </em>recognizing and following the generally accepted rule \u201cthat is is inappropriate to instruct on the law at the <em>[voir </em>dire] stage of the case, or to question the jury as to whether or not they would be disposed to follow or apply stated rules of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 198 A.2d 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The <em>voir dire </em>question requested here has all the attributes of the one held to be properly refused in <em>Twining. </em>Indeed, we believe that the instant request is squarely within the rule espoused in <em>Twining, </em>and accordingly hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In any event, it appears that the substance of appellant\u2019s request was fairly covered by two other questions asked of the prospective jurors by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">(1) \u201cIs there <em>any reason whatsoever </em>why you could not render a fair and impartial decision based <em>solely </em>on the evidence and the law presented to you during the course of the trial?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">(2) \u201cWould the race, sex, age of the defendant or witness, the nature of this case, <em>or any other circumstance </em>have any [ejffect on your ability to render a fair and impartial verdict?\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Moreover, the jurors are sworn to render an \u201cimpartial\u201d verdict based on the evidence presented at trial and the law as instructed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">Appellant\u2019s final complaint is that the lower court abused its discretion when it refused to call Andre Farmer as the \u201ccourt\u2019s witness.\u201d Mr. Farmer, who initially was scheduled to be called as a prosecution witness and who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>was called by the defense to testify during a preliminary suppression hearing held immediately before the trial began, apparently changed his account as to what he witnessed on November 21, 1983 \u2014 the night of the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Although it is not entirely clear from the record, it appears that the substance of Farmer\u2019s original story was similar to that of Reginald Evans and Kevin Brice \u2014 the two prosecution witnesses who testified that they saw appellant chase, catch, and then fatally stab Kevin Smothers. In a three-page witnessed statement dated August 29, 1984, Mr. Farmer recanted his original version of the events, and in its stead essentially maintained that appellant was \u201cframed.\u201d He averred (1) that he had \u201cno knowledge of the crime that took place,\u201d (2) that appellant \u201cwas not in the neighborhood or the 1400 block N. Milton Ave\u201d at the time of the killing or at anytime that day, (3) that when anything \u201chappens in the neighborhood, people will bring up Mr. Carter\u2019s name,\u201d (4) that Kevin Brice and Reginald Evans have \u201cattitudes\u201d against appellant because of some \u201cpast run-ins,\u201d and (5) that he, Brice, and Evans all came to the scene after the incident occurred, and that they \u201cwere going to send Mr. Carter to jail because he had stood up against\u201d Evans and Brice.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The decision as to whether to call an individual as a court\u2019s witness is within the sound discretion of the court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>See Patterson v. State, 275 </em>Md. 563, 578, 342 A.2d 660 (1975); <em>Scarborough v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 276, 282, 437 A.2d 672 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>292 Md. 639 (1982). In <em>Patterson, </em>the Court of Appeals pointed out that the majority view is that since \u201cthe parties themselves have the primary responsibility of producing evidence, a trial judge should call a witness as a \u2018court witness\u2019 only when the adversary system fails to produce the necessary facts and a <em>miscarriage of justice would likely </em>result.\u201d <em>Patterson v. State, 275 </em>Md. at 577, 342 A.2d 660 (emphasis added.) In <em>Scarborough, </em>we analyzed the <em>Patterson </em>decision and enumerated various factors, emanating from the <em>Patterson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>holding, which aid in determining the necessity of calling a \u201ccourt\u2019s witness.\u201d They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">(1) The party\u2019s inability (usually the prosecutor) to vouch for the veracity of the witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">(2) The close relationship between the witness and the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">(3) The existence of contradictory or inconsistent statements by the witness;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">(4) The hostility of the witness; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-8\">(5) The necessity for the testimony, <em>i.e., </em>where the witness possesses material evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-9\"><em>See Scarborough v. State, </em>50 Md.App. at 282, 437 A.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\"><em>Patterson </em>and <em>Scarborough </em>are without doubt factually distinguishable from the case at bar because in each of those cases the prosecution asked the court to call as the \u201ccourt\u2019s witness\u201d the mother of the accused, who in each instance was \u201chostile\u201d to the prosecution. Still, the principles announced in those cases provide the analytical framework for the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">Although appellant\u2019s counsel noted that he was unable to vouch for the credibility of Farmer, and, as we said, Farmer apparently made inconsistent statements, it remains that Farmer was not seemingly \u201chostile\u201d to appellant, and that there was no close relationship between the two. <em>Compare Patterson v. State, supra; Scarborough v. State, supra. </em>Moreover, since Farmer\u2019s latest version was that he was not present at the crime scene, it appears that the import of his testimony rested solely on his claim that Evans and Brice had \u201cframed\u201d appellant and thus that their stories were not credible. In essence, his only apparent input was that of impeachment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">We note that defense counsel considered calling Farmer, and indeed a <em>voir dire </em>examination was conducted outside the presence of the jury, but that appellant withdrew the request for Farmer to testify. This was apparently a tactical decision, for Farmer\u2019s assertion that appellant was not even in the neighborhood seemingly conflicted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>appellant\u2019s theories of self-defense and \u201chot-blooded\u201d provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On balance, we find that the court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to call Farmer as a \u201ccourt\u2019s witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">For the reasons we have set forth in Parts I and II of this Opinion, appellant\u2019s murder conviction must be reversed and remanded for a new trial. As for his deadly weapon conviction, we have found no error that would affect its validity; accordingly, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">JUDGMENT OF MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE (INDICTMENT NO. 18335420) REVERSED AND REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR A NEW TRIAL; JUDGMENT FOR CARRYING A DANGEROUS AND DEADLY WEAPON (INDICTMENT NO. 18335421) AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-11\">. Appellant testified that the altercation arose because the victim \"had told me that \u2014 he had told me that he meant to kill me before, but I got away, and ... next time he ain\u2019t going to miss____\u201d Appellant claimed that the victim had shot him in the head during the summer of 1983 and sought to introduce hospital records to substantiate that claim. Because there was no police report filed or any other evidence to show that the victim had indeed shot him, save only appellant\u2019s testimony, the court refused to allow him to establish this point, something which we will see was also error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-9\">.
