We shall focus our attention on the meaning of the phrase \u201caircraft chartered with crew\u201d which pertains to the following aircraft exclusion clause contained in an excess liability policy which belonged to0one of the individuals alleged to have been responsible for the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number><em>This insurance does not apply </em>... to the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of <em>any aircraft other than aircraft chartered with crew </em>by or on behalf of the insured. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The history of this case takes us back to March 30, 1978, when six men flew to Nassau for a short vacation. They were Robert Altimus, Wayne Rairigh, Jack Rockman, Robert Lynn Walker, William Matthews and Donald Erlbeck. Rockman elected to extend his vacation and was not aboard when the light plane uncontrollably dove into the ocean surf while attempting a \u201cbuzzing\u201d maneuver over a hotel soon after departing from Nassau International Airport on its return flight to Baltimore on April 3, 1978. All of the passengers perished on impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The airplane was a dual-control, six-seat, twin-engine Aero-Commander Aircraft owned by Phoenix Aviation, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The stockholders of Phoenix were Rockman, Walker, Erlbeck and Michael T. Volatile, all of whom were businessmen, most of whom had pilots\u2019 licenses. Since a portion of the journey would be over water, however, a pilot licensed for instrument flight would enhance safety. Volatile, who had an instrument-rated pilot\u2019s license, was scheduled to make the trip to Nassau but canceled for business reasons. Erlbeck then invited Matthews, another instrument-rated pilot, to take his place. Matthews did from time-to-time fly professionally, but this was not his primary occupation. He and Erlbeck were friends. As observed by Judge Caplan, \u201cMatthews did not pilot the plane from Baltimore to Nassau; Erlbeck flew two of the legs and Walker flew one leg. Matthews was exempted from paying a share of the $40/hour flight fee, but did pay his share of all ground transportation, food, and lodging expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Although the flight plan listed Erlbeck as the pilot, at the crash site Matthews\u2019 body was found in the left-front command pilot seat of the aircraft. Erlbeck\u2019s body was positioned at the right-hand controls. Whether Erlbeck or Matthews was in control of the plane at the time of the crash remains undetermined. For purposes of the summary judgment, however, Fireman\u2019s Fund conceded Matthews to be the pilot.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">In Phase One of this ligitation the estate of Walker, Rairigh, and Altimus sued the estates of Matthews and Erlbeck alleging that they were responsible for the accident. The suits were settled by an agreement under which each plaintiff obtained a consent judgment in the amount of $500,000 for a total of $1.5 million against the estates of Erlbeck and Matthews. Southeastern Aviation Underwriters, Inc. (\u201cSEAU\u201d), the airplane\u2019s liability insurer, paid a total of $300,000 in partial satisfaction of the judgments. In return, the appellants agreed not to collect the $1.2 million deficiency from the assets of the Erlbeck and Matthews estates but to look to the Personal Excess Liability Policy (the Policy) of Erlbeck issued by the appellee, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company (Fireman\u2019s Fund).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Phase Two of this litigation began when the appellants sued Fireman\u2019s Fund on the Policy in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. As previously related, Fireman\u2019s Fund denied coverage upon its contention that the plane had not been \u201cchartered with crew\u201d by Erlbeck. The appellants secured judgments against Fireman\u2019s Fund when the lower court ruled that the appellees had waived the right to contest coverage by wrongfully refusing to defend its insured in the Phase One suits. The court entered a pre-trial summary judgment against Fireman\u2019s Fund for the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">We reversed on appeal after concluding that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s prior refusal to defend did not estop it from contesting the coverage issue, and that the duty of an excess insurer to defend an insured is not triggered until the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>limits of primary insurance have been paid over. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Rairigh, </em>59 Md.App. 305, 475 A.2d 509 (1984). We remanded the case to the trial court to determine whether the Fireman\u2019s Fund Policy provided coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">On remand, Phase Three of the litigation, the appellees filed a Motion for Summary Judgment asserting that the undisputed facts showed that the airplane was not \u201cchartered with crew\u201d and consequently there was no coverage. In granting summary judgment, the lower court analyzed the language and purpose of the insurance contract and ruled that no reasonable policyholder would have considered himself covered under the circumstances presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">\n<em>Construing Insurance Contracts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">The appellants contend that the phrase \u201caircraft chartered with crew\u201d is so vague and ambiguous that the question of whether there was coverage under the policy should have been decided by a jury. To enable us to answer this question we must first review the principles applicable to the construction of an insurance contract. Recently the Court of Appeals decided <em>Pacific Indemnity Company v. Interstate Fire and Casualty Company, </em>302 Md. 383, 488 A.2d 486 (1985) in which a few well-established principles were again considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In Maryland, insurance contracts are treated like any other contract; thus, we construe the instrument as a whole to determine the intention of the parties. <em>Aragona v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>281 Md. 371, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977). In so doing, we \u201cshould examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution.\u201d <em>Pacific Indemnity, supra, </em>302 Md. p. 388, 488 A.2d 486. Furthermore, words in a policy should be given their ordinary and accepted meaning, the test being \u201cwhat meaning a reasonably prudent layperson would attach to the term.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>The court, as it did in the case <em>sub judice, </em>may construe unambiguous insurance provisions as a matter of law. Additionally, we must be mindful that language is not ambiguous simply because it is general in nature or undefined by the policy. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Marks Rentals, Inc., </em>288 Md. 428, 433, 418 A.2d 1187 (1980). In fact, ambiguity arises only if the language is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning by a reasonably prudent layperson. <em>Id. </em>In the event that language is found to be ambiguous, extrinsic evidence may be admitted to determine the intention of the parties. If the extrinsic evidence clarifies the ambiguity, interpretation- of the contract is a matter for the court. If the extrinsic evidence fails to clarify and the ambiguity persists, then the interpretation of the contract becomes a matter for the jury to decide. <em>Pacific Indemnity, supra, </em>302 Md. at 389, 488 A.2d 486; <em>Ebert v. Millers Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>220 Md. 602, 610-11, 155 A.2d 484 (1959); <em>Della Ratta, Inc. v. American Better Community Developers, Inc., </em>38 Md.App. 119, 380 A.2d 627 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The Policy clearly states that it is not applicable \u201cto the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of any aircraft <em>other than aircraft chartered with crew </em>by or on behalf of the insured____\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has noted that technically there can be three types of charter in which a plane is provided either with or without crew. <em>Block v. Compagnie Nationale Air France, </em>386 F.2d 323, 329 (5th Cir.1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 905, 88 S.Ct. 2053, 20 L.Ed.2d 1363 (1968). The first is a \u201cbarehull,\u201d \u201chire,\u201d or \u201clease,\u201d in which the owner supplies a plane to an individual who furnishes his own crew, pays his own expenses, and uses the plane as he pleases. The second is a \u201ctime charter,\u201d in which the owner provides a fully equipped plane and crew for a specified duration. The third is a \u201cvoyage charter,\u201d in which the owner supplies a fully equipped plane and crew for a predetermined trip. 386 F.2d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Although \u201ccharter\u201d may have the varying technical meanings explicated by the Fifth Circuit in <em>Block, </em>in normal, everyday use, we believe the phrase \u201caircraft chartered with crew\u201d is not ambiguous and means a transportation arrangement by which both the plane and its crew are supplied together. In support thereof, we note that Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary (ed. 1981) defines \u201ccharter\u201d as being \u201ca travel arrangement in which the transportation (as a bus or plane) is hired by and for one specific group of people.\u201d In Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary Unabridged (2d ed. 1934) defines \u201cwith\u201d as a functional word used to indicate \u201calongside of; among; in the company of.\u201d It defines \u201ccrew\u201d as \u201cthe body or number of workmen required to man a machine, apparatus, etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">We hold, therefore, that a reasonably prudent layperson who contemplated obtaining an \u201caircraft chartered with crew\u201d would only enter into such a transportation arrangement by which both the plane and the crew are supplied together.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Our sole remaining task is to determine whether a reasonable policyholder would consider himself covered under the circumstances as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\n<em>Application of Policy Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Even assuming that a single pilot could indeed constitute the \u201ccrew\u201d of an aircraft, there is no evidence to suggest that Phoenix Aviation engaged Matthews as a pilot and furnished him to the other men as \u201ccrew.\u201d The appellants, however, maintain that Erlbeck, as an officer and director of Phoenix, chartered the plane \u201cwith crew,\u201d the crew being Matthews. In support of their theory they contend that Erlbeck arranged with Matthews on behalf of Phoenix that Matthews be compensated for his pilot\u2019s services by being exempted from payment of the flight-time fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">We believe, however, that it cannot be reasonably inferred that Erlbeck was acting on behalf of Phoenix. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>facts reveal that there was no employment contract between Matthews and Phoenix, and that Matthews was not paid by Phoenix for his flight or waiting time. In fact, Rockman and Matthews\u2019 wife Diana denied that Matthews had been employed to serve as \u201ccrew\u201d on the trip. Furthermore, it is undisputed that Matthews did not pilot the plane on the flight from Baltimore to Nassau.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The \u201cchartered with crew\u201d provision is a narrow exception to a broad aircraft exclusion. It affords the insured only a limited form of aircraft coverage. However, under the appellants\u2019 theory Erlbeck would have been covered whenever he invited another pilot along and relieved him from paying pro-rata share of the flying fee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We agree with Judge Caplan\u2019s finding that the appellant\u2019s theory contradicts the character and purpose of the $69.00 annual premium umbrella policy. \u201cThe premium, ordinarily, is the agreed price for assuming and carrying the risk; that is, the consideration paid an insurer for undertaking to indemnify the insured against a specified peril.\u201d 5 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>2d \u00a7 30:1. The liability coverage on the Policy was $1 million. Yet the annual premium was less than one-ten thousandth of the coverage. Such a proportionately low premium, in our view, reflects the appellee\u2019s belief that the risk of loss under the Policy was severely limited.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Howell v. Harleysville Mutual Ins. Co., </em>305 Md. 435, 505 A.2d 109 (1986). Indeed, that belief would be in direct harmony with the very purpose of the restrictive language of the Policy which covered an insured\u2019s flight of a chartered aircraft; provided, in es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>sence, that the \u201ccharter\u201d included an aircraft together with its own qualified professional crew to fly it. We hold that the lower court properly granted summary judgment on behalf of Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. The stockholders each paid $50/month for the upkeep of the plane, and there was a S40/hour charge for flight time. Occasionally, the plane was rented to non-shareholders at S90/hour flying time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b722-6\">. Judge Caplan observed as to appellant\u2019s interpretation of the aircraft exclusion clause: \"Indeed, it is only the sharpest policy-holder in search of loopholes who could consider himself covered under the circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b722-7\">.

Moskios, </em>209 Md. 162, 117, 120 A.2d 678 (1956) were quoted with approval: \u201d[o]ne usually gets in this life only what he pays for.
