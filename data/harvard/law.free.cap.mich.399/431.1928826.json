After our decision in <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), we ordered that the defendants\u2019 appeals be jointly submitted and argued to consider the applicability of GCR 1963, 785.7 to probation violation proceedings. We conclude that subrule does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Defendant Rial pled guilty to possession of marijuana in 1973 and was placed on probation for two years. Defendant Beene pled guilty to attempted larceny in a building in 1972 and was also placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Bench warrants were subsequently issued for the arrest of both defendants for having violated the terms of their probations. At their initial hearings, both defendants waived their rights to appointed counsel and to a formal hearing on the charges. Both admitted that they had violated the terms of their probations. In each case, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>judge revoked probation and subsequently sentenced the defendant pursuant to the original conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">Defendants argue that, prior to the court\u2019s acceptance of a waiver of the right to a formal probation violation hearing and to an attorney, the court must advise a defendant of his rights at such a hearing and also of the possible penalty involved if probation were revoked. Defendants urge this Court to equate a formal probation violation hearing with a trial by imposing restrictions and standards on a defendant\u2019s admission of probation violation which are similar to those imposed upon a plea of guilty under Rule 785.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In <em>Gagnon v Scarpelli, </em>411 US 778, 782; 93 S Ct 1756; 36 L Ed 2d 656 (1973), the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\"Probation revocation, like parole revocation, is not a stage of a criminal prosecution, but does result in a loss of liberty. Accordingly, we hold that a probationer, like a parolee, is entitled to a preliminary and a final revocation hearing, under the conditions specified in <em>Morrissey v Brewer, supra.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Defendants\u2019 analogy to a trial and a guilty plea is unsound. Probation revocation is not a stage of a criminal prosecution. In these proceedings we deal not with the procedural rights of an accused in a criminal prosecution, but with the more limited due process rights of one who is a probationer because he has been convicted of a crime. <em>Gagnon, supra, </em>at 789. See also, <em>People v Pickett, </em>391 Mich 305; 215 NW2d 695 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on MCLA 768.35; MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>28.1058 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is also misplaced. We are not concerned with a plea of guilty in these proceedings. The guilt of the defendants had already been determined. The scope of a probation violation hearing is limited. The procedure is summary and informal, not subject to the rules of evidence or pleadings applicable in criminal trials. MCLA 771.4; MSA 28.1134; <em>Morrissey, supra. </em>The hearing is designed to lead \"to a final evaluation of any <em>contested </em>relevant facts and consideration of whether the facts as determined warrant revocation\u201d. <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>at 488. (Emphasis added.) A formal hearing is not required if the probationer admits at a preliminary hearing the alleged violations, and those violations are found by the court to be reasonable grounds for revoking probation under the law. <em>Morrissey, supra, </em>at 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Each defendant was advised by the court that if he wished to contest the alleged violations of his probation, a hearing would be held to determine the truthfulness of the charges, and he would be entitled to counsel at the hearing. Given the limited nature of these hearings, we hold that both defendants were adequately informed of their procedural and constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Defendants also contend that they were not advised of the possible penalty before waiving their rights to an attorney and to a formal hearing. Each defendant was aware that his probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>could be revoked as a result of these proceedings. This \"penalty\u201d is the direct result of a probation revocation hearing. What defendants actually argue is that the court should have again advised them of the possible minimum and maximum sentence which might be imposed following conviction for the crime to which they had originally pled. They ask this Court to rule that a waiver of their constitutional rights should not be accepted by the trial court until they again have been advised that if they have failed to comply with the terms of their probations, the court will sentence them for the crimes of which they were convicted. To adopt such a ruling would be to exalt form over substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Defendants do not allege that they were unaware of the penalty for the crime to which they pled guilty, nor do they allege that they were unaware that probation, in lieu of sentencing, was pur\u00e9ly a matter of grace, and not of right. MCLA 771.4; MSA 28.1134. They do not allege that, at the time they entered onto probation, they were unaware of all the terms and conditions thereof, including the penalty for violation. It would be unrealistic for this Court to believe that a probationer willingly complies with all the strict terms and conditions of his probation, including regular meetings with his probation officer, without being aware of what might happen should he refuse to comply with those terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Under these circumstances, and particularly in light of the nature of probation violation hearings, defendants\u2019 arguments must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b531-9\">Kavanagh, C.

However, it has been held an individual accused of violating his probation has the right to counsel, the right to produce witnesses, the right to notice of the charges against him, and the right to an opportunity to explain away the charges filed against him. We believe these cases indicate a minimum requirement that the hearing must be conducted in .a meaningful way.\u201d <em>People v Martin, </em>61 Mich App 102, 107; 232 NW2d 191 (1975) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\"[T]he probationer must be served with written notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>of the charges against him prior to the hearing. <em>In re McLeod, </em>348 Mich 434; 83 NW2d 340 (1957); <em>People v Wood, </em>2 Mich App 342; 139 NW2d 895 (1966). At the hearing the probationer is entitled to produce witnesses and evidence as well as to cross-examine and confront witnesses. <em>In re Bobowski, </em>313 Mich 521; 21 NW2d 838 (1946). The state must present proof of violation of the charges. <em>People v Myers, </em>306 Mich 100; 10 NW2d 323 (1943). Evidence of the charge is the only factor to be considered in determining whether to revoke probation. <em>People v Sutton, </em>322 Mich 104; 33 NW2d 681 (1948); <em>People v Elbert, </em>21 Mich App 677; 176 NW2d 467 (1970). There must be a record of the hearing that demonstrates the due process requirements have been satisfied. <em>People v Wood, supra. </em>If the probationer desires, he is entitled to representation by counsel. <em>People v Kitley, </em>59 Mich App 71; 228 NW2d 834 (1975); <em>People v Hazen, </em>19 Mich App 576; 172 NW2d 860 (1969); <em>People v Brown, </em>17 Mich App 396; 169 NW2d 522 (1969); <em>People v Marshall, </em>16 Mich App 578; 168 NW2d 480 (1969). The probationer is entitled to an appeal as of right following determination of a probation violation on those matters relating to the probation violation and the hearing thereon. <em>People v Pickett, </em>391 Mich 305; 215 NW2d 695 (1974); <em>People v Donald Moore, </em>55 Mich App 139; 222 NW2d 64 (1974).\u201d <em>People v Leroy Jackson, Jr, </em>63 Mich App 241, 247-248; 234 NW2d 467 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Although neither statute nor court rule expressly requires that a judge advise a person charged with probation violation of his right to a hearing, it cannot be doubted that a probationer is entitled to advice regarding his constitutional and statutory right to a hearing and the nature of that right. The very informality of the hearing makes it especially important that there be advice and that it be transmitted in a meaningful manner. Most persons have at least a vague idea of what a trial is. Unless they have gone through the experience, few persons, even lawyers, will have any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>conception of the nature of a probation violation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">On the same principle which requires that an accused person pleading guilty to a criminal offense be informed of his constitutional rights and of the incidents of a trial \"as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that he understood what a trial is and that by pleading guilty he was knowingly and voluntarily giving up his right to a trial and such rights and incidents\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the record should reflect that a probationer desiring to plead guilty to a charge of probation violation was informed of his constitutional rights and of the incidents of a probation violation hearing \"as reasonably to warrant the conclusion\u201d that he understands what such a hearing is and that in pleading guilty he is knowingly and voluntarily giving up his right to a hearing and such rights and incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">In <em>People v Becker, </em>349 Mich 476, 487; 84 NW2d 833 (1957), an appeal from a probation revocation, it was observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\"We reject, instanter, any thought that the defendant, because a convicted criminal, stands before us with any degree of vulnerability, that he is shorn of any of his constitutional rights. These guarantees, in truth, meet their real challenge when sought to be employed by the wicked. The upright and the righteous need them not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">The defendants contend that the judges\u2019 failure to advise them of the maximum sentences that might be imposed upon revocation of their probations requires that their guilty pleas be vacated. The memorandum opinion responds that the defendants did not allege that they were unaware of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>the penalty far the crimes to which they pled guilty or of the penalty for probation violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Probationers may be expected in the future to make the necessary allegations and to seek evidentiary hearings on whether they understandingly, knowingly, and voluntarily pled guilty. A court rule stating the procedure to be followed in probation violation hearings and the nature of the advice to be given would provide an objective basis for evaluating such allegations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Such a court rule should require advice regarding any minimum and the maximum sentence the judge may impose if probation is revoked. While the judge is required to provide such advice to a defendant pleading guilty to an offense, a probationer may not have received such advice because he was convicted at a trial or he may not understand that on revocation of probation he will be sentenced for the substantive offense of which he was convicted, some time ago, not for the violation of a condition of probation, often a seemingly inoffensive matter, <em>e.g., </em>failure to report to a probation officer, staying out after hours, consumption of alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Although the defendants assert that they should have been given such advice in the instant cases, absent a court rule requiring it or a factual predicate for a finding that they were unaware of the sentences that might be imposed and in consequence their pleas were not understandingly, knowingly, and voluntarily made, there is no basis for reversal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aaf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">It appears that there was a relationship between the condition of Beene\u2019s probation that was violated, drinking intoxicating beverages, and his history of criminal behavior. It further appears that after he was placed on probation he continued to drink and to commit larcenies and, thus, there is a substantial relationship between the condition of probation that was violated and the revocation of probation and subsequent imposition of a prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In Rial, the relationship between the condition, \"association\u201d with a person having a criminal record, and the asserted violation, revocation, and sentence, appears tenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Rial was convicted of possession of marijuana on evidence that she was in an automobile in which a large quantity of marijuana was found and her acknowledgment that she was culpable. The automobile was driven by a young man. He too was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">The principal charge of probation violation \u2014 the other asserted violations all relate to this charge\u2014 is that Rial was with Dan Pease (not the young man she was with at the time of her arrest on the marijuana charge) when he was arrested on a charge, the nature of which does not appear, and continued to associate with him although her probation officer told her not to see him. It is not claimed that Pease was engaged in criminal activity at the time he was arrested or that Rial violated any law after her conviction of possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">Arguably, Rial\u2019s involvement with the law resulted from her association with exceptionable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>young men. Nevertheless, absent a showing that her \"association\u201d with a person with a criminal record had resulted or will result in her becoming involved in further criminal activity, association alone does not tend to justify revocation of probation and imposition of a jail sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">When Rial was placed on probation, the judge told her she must refrain from the use of liquor and marijuana. There is no evidence that she violated that condition. He told her she would have to continue to work at her job. It appears that she did so and then lost her job at least in part as a result of her detention for investigation of probation violation following Pease\u2019s arrest. Her two failures in a six-day period to report to her probation officer were related to her apparently well justified fear that he was moving against her because of events following her detention in connection with Pease\u2019s arrest, including an intemperate outburst on her part when she was detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">In recent years the notion that the probationer\u2019s conditional liberty can be revoked except in accordance with fair procedures and upon careful inquiry has undergone considerable modification.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Conditions of probation are increasingly subjected to judicial review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>New probationers will appeal a condition of probation on the ground that it is beyond the power of the court to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Most will take their chances, attempt to comply and hope that to the extent they do not the probation officer or the judge will be lenient. The appeal process is far too time consuming to provide a meaningful alternative; a two-year period of probation will generally expire before an appeal is completed. Moreover, while the appellate courts are now more willing to review conditions, success on appeal is far from certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">It will be a relatively rare case where a person charged with probation violation will not be guilty of at least a technical violation. Advising him of his rights is important. It is more important to encourage the probationer, if indigent, to accept assignment of counsel, and to provide a meaningful hearing<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> at which inquiry can be made whether the condition he is charged with violating was properly imposed and whether the asserted violation justifies revocation and incarceration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\"Given the vague and all-encompassing nature of conditions of probation, it is not difficult for the probation officer to muster a technical violation as needed. Many probationers are in a steady state of probation violation as a result of conditions relating to keeping 'decent hours,\u2019 abstaining from alcohol, and various prohibitions relating to sexual activity. These violations usually go unenforced by the probation officer until such time as he is given reason to believe that a new criminal offense has occurred.\u201d Czajkoski, <em>Exposing the Quasi-Judicial Role of the Probation Officer, </em>37 Federal Probation 9, 12-13 (Sept, 1973).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Peggy Rail was emotionally involved with Dan Pease.

Technical violations are those which are somehow covered by the conditions of probation but which are not specified in the criminal statutes. Failure to report to the probation officer or failure to avoid undesirable persons might be a type of technical violation. Oftentimes probation officers proceed on the basis of technical violation when new criminal offenses are suspected but cannot be easily proved. Police and prosecutors regularly call upon the probation officer to invoke some technical violation against a probationer who they believe has committed a new crime. It is patently easier to put a defendant behind bars as a result of a probation violation hearing than it is to send him to prison as a result of a full-fledged trial. In consenting to proceed on the basis of a technical violation when the real issue is a new criminal offense, the probation officer is playing a judicial role. In effect, he is deciding that there is sufficient basis to conclude that the defendant is guilty of the new offense and thus deserves to have the technical violation placed against him.\u201d Czajkoski, <em>Exposing the Quasi-Judicial Role of the Probation Officer, </em>37 Fed Probation 12 (Sept, 1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">The American Bar Association Standards Relating to Probation (Approved Draft, 1970) provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\"5.3 Proceedings following commission of another crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-10\">\"A revocation proceeding based solely upon commission of another crime ordinarily should not be initiated prior to the disposition of that charge.

The basis of the trial court\u2019s revocation order, however, was defendant\u2019s anti-social conduct. Assuming arguendo that defendant was properly notified of the initial charge, defendant had no notice that he was expected to meet a charge of anti-social behavior. While the trial court\u2019s finding may be viewed as a mere characterization of the conduct contained in the charge, we have previously held that a probationer must have notice of the specific violation charged and the revocation hearing is to be restricted thereto. <em>People v Elbert, </em>21 Mich App 677; 176 NW2d 467 (1970); <em>People v Davenport, </em>7 Mich App 613; 152 NW2d 553 (1967).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Similarly, <em>see People v Hill, </em>69 Mich App 41, 44; 244 NW2d 357 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
