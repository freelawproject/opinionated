The Court of Appeals well summarized the pertinent facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">\"Certain of the plaintiffs prior to 1970 were employed in various city departments where, pursuant to Ordinance 90-F and Ordinance 303-G, they were allowed a reduced work schedule of 35 rather than 40 hours per week. On July 17, 1970 the mayor of the City of Detroit ordered all employees to begin working 40 hours per week. This order was held in an action in the Wayne County Circuit Court to be ineffective because, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>the ordinances, only department heads had the power to so alter the work schedule. A comparable order was subsequently issued by the appropriate department heads requiring these employees to work 40 hours for the same annual salary they had received for 35 hours of work per week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\"On August 24, 1970, many of the unions representing city employees affected by this change filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission. On December 28, 1970, a trial examiner rendered a decision and recommended issuance of a cease and desist order to compel the city to rescind its unilateral action, and also recommending that the employees\u2019 claim for back pay for the extra five hours per week be denied. On March 12, 1971, the full Michigan Employment Relations Commission affirmed the trial examiner\u2019s decision and order. The City of Detroit filed an application for leave to appeal to this Court which was denied. The affected employees and their unions made no effort to appeal the commission\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">\"In July, 1973, 200 members of the Senior Accountants, Analysts and Appraisers Association brought a class action seeking to recover compensation for the extra time worked during the period of approximately nine months before the cease and desist order was entered. On February 19, 1974, the trial court granted defendant city\u2019s motion for a summary judgment accompanied by a letter to the attorneys indicating 'that the defense of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel is valid for the reasons and grounds asserted by defendant city in its brief.\u2019 \u201d 60 Mich App 606, 608-609; 231 NW2d 479 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">On April 25, 1975, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs applied for leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>appeal. This Court granted leave on December 5, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">II \u2014 Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We granted leave in this case \"limited to the consideration of this issue: Does an unappealed determination by the Michigan Employment Relations Commission, that plaintiff is not entitled to 'back pay\u2019 for a determined unfair labor practice, operate as a collateral estoppel to the subsequent maintenance of a suit in circuit court to recover the same reimbursement as 'damages\u2019 for breach of contract?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In resolving this issue, it is essential that we keep in mind the precise questions of law and fact decided by the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) trial examiner. First, the trial examiner held, as a matter of law, that the city\u2019s unilateral increase of the work week to 40 hours \"without notice and bargaining with the representatives of its employees violated \u00a7 10(a) and (e) of [the public employment relations act] PERA.\u201d Accordingly, the trial examiner recommended \"the usual remedial order in such cases\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This decision and order of the trial examiner was affirmed by the full Michigan Employment Relations Commission and is not in dispute in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Second, the trial examiner was asked by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>charging parties \"that the city be required to pay all employees affected by the increase in hours time and one-half for all hours worked between 35 and 40\u201d as an additional remedial order to the order stated <em>supra. </em>Clearly, it was within the trial examiner\u2019s power to order such a \"back-pay\u201d remedy. As \u00a7 16(b) of the public employment relations act, MCLA 423.216(b); MSA 17.455(16)(b) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\"If upon the preponderance of the testimony taken the board is of the opinion that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in the unfair labor practice, then it shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the person an order requiring him to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">The trial examiner correctly noted that the legal test for determining whether a \"back-pay\u201d order (or monetary reimbursement) is appropriate is \"whether or not the employee in question would have been paid absent the unlawful unilateral action\u201d. <em>Hooker Chemical Corp, </em>186 NLRB No 49; 75 LRRM 1357 (1970). Applying this test to the case before him, the trial examiner made the following determinations of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\"The record in the instant case conclusively establishes that under the ordinances and the collective bargaining agreements applicable to employees working a 35 hour week, the practice has been that the pay week is computed on a 40 hour basis and no overtime is paid for work between 35 and 40 hours in a normal work week. The only exception to this policy and practice has been those instances where the employees involved worked a 35 hour week and were called in to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>work a sixth day of work. This exception to the policy of crediting overtime only for work in excess of 40 hours was designed to alleviate a hardship on employees required to work a sixth day without forcing them to work five hours without any compensation or compensatory time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">In the absence of any evidence to establish that under past practice, ordinance, or contract such payment has ever been made for the additional five hours work in a normal work week, or that such payment even could be made under existing city policy, the undersigned can find no basis for a reimbursement remedy herein. Therefore, the undersigned will refuse to recommend any monetary reimbursement or compensatory time as part of the remedy in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The full MERC also affirmed this decision of the trial examiner. Furthermore, as mentioned in the facts, the affected employees and their unions made no effort to appeal the affirmance of the full commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Plaintiffs Senior Accountants, et al., then brought suit in circuit court against the city alleging breach of contract and asking the court to award damages \"in an amount equal to five hours wages per, at overtime rates, for the full period they were forced to work 40 hours, plus interest at five percent (5%) from the date of work * * * \u201d, <em>i.e. </em>damages based on the extra 5 hours per week worked since the 40-hours work order went into effect (essentially the same remedy sought before MERC). The question before us is whether plaintiffs are barred from maintaining this suit because of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. In this particular case, the answer to this question is yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">It is established law in this state that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel apply to administrative determinations which are adjudi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>catory in nature, where a method of appeal is provided, and where it is clear that it was the legislative intention to make the determination final in the absence of an appeal. <em>Roman Cleanser Co v Murphy, </em>386 Mich 698, 703-704; 194 NW2d 704 (1972), reversing and adopting Judge (now Justice) Levin\u2019s dissent in <em>Roman Cleanser Co v Murphy, </em>29 Mich App 155, 166-171; 185 NW2d 87 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The applicable test for collateral estoppel in this case is accurately stated in \u00a7 68 of the Restatement Judgments, p 293:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">\"Where a question of fact essential to the judgment is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive between parties in a subsequent action on a different cause of action * * * ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">See <em>Howell v Vito\u2019s Trucking &amp; Excavating Co, </em>386 Mich 37, 41-42; 191 NW2d 313 (1971); <em>Jones v Chambers, </em>353 Mich 674, 680-681; 91 NW2d 889 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In the instant case, if the trial court were to rule on whether plaintiffs are entitled to the \"damages\u201d for which they complain (\"an amount equal to five hours wages per, at overtime rates, for the full period they were forced to work 40 hours\u201d), the court would have to determine whether the legal basis of plaintiffs\u2019 employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>relation \u2014 past practice, ordinance, contract, or existing city policy \u2014 required such monetary reimbursement. But the trial examiner made these precise determinations in finding \"back pay\u201d was improper in this case. See Joint Appendix, exhibit A, pp 48-50, and discussion <em>supra. </em>In other words, the questions of fact necessary for a determination of \"damages\u201d by the trial court in this case would be identical to the questions of fact already determined by the trial examiner in his conclusion that \"back pay\u201d was improper in this case. Consequently, plaintiffs are barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from re-litigating these same questions of fact in their subsequent action for \"damages\u201d based on a breach of contract theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">We uphold the circuit court and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">No costs, a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-6\">Coleman, Fitzgerald, and Lindemer, JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\"> The Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">\"The grounds asserted in support of the motion were that the issues raised in the complaint were barred by a prior judgment. The motion should properly have been brought under the accelerated judgment provisions of GCR 1963, 116.1(5). <em>Dunlap v Southfield, </em>54 Mich App 398, 399, 400; 221 NW2d 237 (1974).\u201d 60 Mich App 606, 608, fn 1.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-8\"> The order was to \"require the city to cease and desist from unilaterally changing hours and other terms and conditions of employment of its employees without notice and bargaining with the collective bargaining representatives of said employees; restore the status quo by placing all employees whose hours were unlawfully increased back on the same work week which they were working prior to the unlawful increase in working hours; require the city to bargain collectively with the collective bargaining representatives of their employees with respect to hours and other terms and conditions of employment; and post appropriate copies of a notice to all employees, setting forth the terms of the recommended order herein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\"> The doctrine of collateral estoppel also requires that \"the second action is between the same persons who were parties to the prior action\u201d. Restatement Judgments, \u00a7 68, p 294; <em>see, also, Howell, supra, </em>and <em>Jones, supra. </em>Plaintiff union was, of course, party to the action before MERC. The individual plaintiffs in this case do not dispute the Court of Appeals holding that \"[t]he individual plaintiffs here are substantially identical to the labor organizations which represented them as charging parties before MERC\u201d, 60 Mich App 612. <em>See Steelman v Portage, </em>12 Mich App 334; 162 NW2d 837 (1968), and cases cited therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b553-7\">Levin, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMb\"><em>(dissenting). </em>The issues in this circuit court action for money damages and in the earlier Michigan Employment Relations Commission unfair labor practice proceeding arise out of the city\u2019s action in increasing the work week of the plaintiff employees of the city from 35 to 40 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">The MERC found that the city was guilty of an unfair labor practice in unilaterally increasing the work week. A cease and desist order was entered. The MERC declined to award back pay for the five additional hours because there had been no history of paying for additional hours worked in a normal work week.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The circuit court dismissed this action seeking money damages for alleged breach of the collective bargaining agreements in requiring the employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>to work additional hours on the ground that further litigation is barred under the doctrines of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The Court of Appeals affirmed as does this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">This Court declares that the employees are barred under the doctrine of collateral estoppel from \"re-litigating\u201d in the circuit court \"questions of fact already determined\u201d by the MERC when it refused to award back pay as part of the remedial order for the city\u2019s unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The MERC construed the statute as permitting an award of back pay where the \"employee in question would have been paid absent the unlawful unilateral action\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \"Back pay,\u201d in this construction of the act, means pay actually paid in the past \u2014 pay the employee would have received if there had been no unfair labor practice. The MERC concluded that where the unfair labor practice does not cause a stoppage of pay, there being no actual loss of pay, there is no past or back pay to award.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The MERC found as a fact that there was no evidence in the instant case that <em>\"payment </em>has ever been made for the additional five hours work in a normal work week\u201d (emphasis supplied). Since there had been no stoppage or actual loss of pay as a result of the unfair labor practice, there was no past or back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">It is apparent that the employees do not seek to relitigate the MERC factual determination that there was no history of payment for additional hours worked. Indeed, this was never in dispute. They contend rather that contract damages, in contrast with back pay to remedy an unfair labor practice, do not depend on a showing that the employees would have been paid for the additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>hours even if the city had not increased the work week (and in consequence they are out-of-pocket compensation they would have received but for the unfair labor practice), and that the factual and legal issues respecting their claim for compensation in a law action are sufficiently different from those in an unfair labor practice proceeding that decision in the administrative proceeding does not preclude a law action.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Further, the employees contend that where a remedy is denied, not on the merits, but because it is not available in the forum where it is sought, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not bar an action to obtain a remedy in a forum where it is available.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We agree that the contentions of the employees are sound and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The Court declares the trial examiner concluded and the MERC agreed that there was no basis for awarding back pay in the absence of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\" 'evidence to establish that under past practice, ordinance, or contract such payment has ever been made for the additional five hours work in a normal work week, or that such payment even could be made under existing city policy.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">We agree with the foregoing statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">The Court also declares if the employees were permitted to maintain an action for damages in the circuit court, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\"court would have to determine whether the legal basis of plaintiffs\u2019 employment relation \u2014 past practice, ordinance, contract, or existing city policy \u2014 required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>such monetary reimbursement. But the trial examiner made these precise determinations in finding 'back pay\u2019 was improper in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">We agree that before awarding damages the circuit court would necessarily determine whether the asserted violation of the collective bargaining agreements provides a \"legal basis\u201d for a money judgment. The trial examiner did not determine, however, whether the \"legal basis\u201d of the employment relationship, the collective bargaining agreements, requires the entry of such a judgment. The MERC stated that the trial examiner did <em>\"not\u201d </em>\"interpret the contract\u201d and further stated that its decision affirming the trial examiner was <em>\"not a \u00f1nding </em>that [the collective bargaining agreements] have been, or have not been breached\u201d (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The Court further declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\"the questions of fact necessary for a determination of 'damages\u2019 by the trial court in this case would be identical to the questions of fact already determined by the trial examiner in his conclusion that 'back pay\u2019 was improper in this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Again, we disagree. Whether the employees had been theretofore paid for additional hours, although held to be determinative for back pay purposes, would not be determinative of their right to contract damages for being required, in asserted violation of the collective bargaining agreements, to work additional hours. The \"questions of fact necessary for a determination of 'damages\u2019 \u201d would not \"be identical to the questions of fact already determined by the trial examiner in his conclusion that 'back pay\u2019 was improper in this case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The question whether contract damages are recoverable would depend on whether it was a breach of the collective bargaining agreements to require the employees to work the additional hours or to require such additional work without compensation. Resolution of that question would depend on the terms of the agreements, all the pertinent facts, and the law of contracts, not on the historical fact whether \"payment has ever been made\u201d for additional hours in a normal work week or whether such payment could be made under existing city policy. Even if the employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>had never been paid for working additional hours in a normal work week and could not be paid for those hours under existing city policy, damages would be recoverable if it was a breach of contract to require them to work the additional hours or to require such additional work without compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The Court misperceives the issue in concluding that the MERC\u2019s finding that payment for additional hours had not historically been made and could not be made under existing city policy precludes a determination in a law action that the employees are entitled to money damages under the collective bargaining agreements for the additional hours worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The true issue is whether, when employees assert that an employer\u2019s action in requiring additional work constitutes both a breach of the collective bargaining agreement and an unfair labor practice, they are precluded from recovering money damages in a law action for breach of contract by seeking relief from the MERC and its decision in entering a cease and desist order but refusing to award back pay for the additional work.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">When the city required the additional work without compensation, the employees protested, claiming that the city\u2019s action constituted an unfair labor practice <em>and </em>a violation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">An unfair labor practice charge must be filed with the MERC;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an action for breach of contract, in the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Plainly, if back pay had been awarded and it was the functional equivalent of money damages, a law action could not be maintained; the employees may not obtain a double recovery. Also, if the MERC had declined to award back pay on the ground that the city had not required the employees to work the additional hours <em>(e.g., </em>they had as a matter of civic spirit volunteered the additional work), or that their claims of having worked additional hours were not factually supported, then a collateral estoppel would arise because the MERC would have found facts inconsistent with a finding of breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">But where the MERC\u2019s findings are not inconsistent with maintenance of a law action and it simply concludes that a back pay award is not available under the remedial standards it has developed, its conclusion does not preclude such an action.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The policies of the PERA and of the law of contracts are different.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The power to award back pay<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> enables the MERC to further the act\u2019s<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> purpose of promoting peaceful labor relations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has observed, in reference to the back pay provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, the model for the corresponding provisions of the Michigan labor relations acts:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\"To make an award, the Board must first be convinced that the award would 'effectuate the policies\u2019 of the Act. 'The remedy of back pay, it must be remembered, is entrusted to the Board\u2019s discretion; it is not mechanically compelled by the Act.\u2019 <em>Phelps Dodge Corp v Labor Board, </em>313 US 177, 198 [61 S Ct 845; 85 L Ed 1271; 133 ALR 1217 (1941)]. The power to order affirmative relief under \u00a7 10(c) is merely incidental to the primary purpose of Congress to stop and to prevent unfair labor practices. Congress did not establish a general scheme authorizing the Board to award full compensatory damages for injuries caused by wrongful conduct.\u201d <em>International Union, UAW v Russell, </em>356 US 634, 642-643; 78 S Ct 932; 2 L Ed 2d 1030 (1958).\u201c<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The MERC is concerned with speedy and prompt restoration of peaceful labor relations. To achieve that objective it may only be necessary to issue a cease and desist order; there may be no need to award back pay. The back pay issue may not loom large at the time in the context of labor relations peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Whether the MERC would in all cases limit its back pay remedy, in this case it was apparently of the view that in order to effectuate the policies of the act it was not necessary to award back pay for the additional hours the city unilaterally required the employees to work. While they had labored additional hours, they received the same weekly pay they had theretofore received. There was no actual loss of pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The law of contracts takes a different view of the matter. Under that body of law, requiring an employee to give up his time and expend labor beyond the requirements of the employment contract may entitle him to compensation for the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and labor expended;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> payment to the employees of the full weekly wage agreed upon in the contract does not preclude an action for additional compensation for additional hours worked.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Given the distinctive nature of the administrative and judicial functions, inquiries, and remedies, the MERC\u2019s failure to award back pay does not bar a subsequent action for damages unless facts found by the MERC are inconsistent with a determination that the collective bargaining agreement has been breached.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the instant case, the \"fact\u201d that historically the employees had not been paid for additional hours in a normal work week is not inconsistent with a finding that the collective bargaining agreements had been breached, and therefore does not preclude a determination that the employees have a right to recover a money judgment under the provisions of those agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"ADDD\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">The application of collateral estoppel in the instant case to bar the employees\u2019 action for damages treats the administrative remedy of back pay \u2014a remedy the MERC found was not available<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\u2014 as the exclusive remedy. The United States Supreme Court has stated, however, that the remedies for an unfair labor practice, provided in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>NLRA, do not exclude an action for breach of a collective bargaining agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\"Congress 'deliberately chose to leave the enforcement of collective agreements \"to the usual processes of the law\u201d See also HR Conf Rep No. 510, 80th Cong, 1st Sess, p 52.

He found that it had not been made. His negative statement that such payment had not been made \"under the contract\u201d is not an affirmative finding or conclusion that the agreements did not, in this instance, require compensation or, their breach, an award of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">Any prior failure to make payment may itself have been a violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>of the agreements. The circumstances of any prior failure to pay for additional hours may have been different from those in this case. This appears to have been the first time that a permanent increase in the length of the work week had been ordered. Construction of the contract would require an assessment of the entire history of the relationship (not just a single element in the limited context of a labor relations remedial order) which neither the trial examiner nor the MERC purported to, and indeed expressly declined to assume the responsibility of making.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\"> The MERC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether an unfair labor practice has been committed. <em>See Rockwell v Crestwood School District Board of Education, </em>393 Mich 616, 630; 227 NW2d 736 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(1975); <em>Southgate Community School District v Morrison, </em>1970 MERC Lab Op 161, 178-179.
