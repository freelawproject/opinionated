The paragraph 12th exemption provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\"><em>\"All products, </em>materials and/or goods processed or otherwise and in whatever form but expressly excepting alcoholic beverages, <em>located in a public warehouse, </em>dock or port facility on December 31 of each year, <em>if such products, </em>materials and/or goods <em>have been designated as in transit to destinations out of state </em>pursuant to the published tariffs of any railroad or common carrier by the filing of the freight bill covering such products, materials and/or goods with the agency designated by such tariffs, so as to entitle the shipper to transportation rate privileges * * * .\u201d MCLA 211.9; MSA 7.9 (paragraph 12th) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">A second, unnumbered paragraph of paragraph 12th provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-10\">\"For the purpose of this section, a public warehouse, dock or port facility is defined as any warehouse, dock or port facility owned or operated by any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of storing products, materials and/or goods for hire for profit who issues a schedule of rates for storage of such products, materials and/or goods and who issues warehouse receipts pursuant to the provision of Act No. 303 of the Public Acts of 1909: Provided, That no portion of a public warehouse, dock or port facility leased to a tenant and <em>no portion of any premises owned or leased or operated by a consignor or consignee or any affiliate or subsidiary of such consignor or consignee shall be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>deemed to be a public warehouse, </em>dock or port facility.\u201d <em>Id </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The paragraph 14th exemption provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\"><em>\"Farm products </em>processed or otherwise, the ultimate use of which is for human or animal consumption as food, but expressly excepting wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages, <em>regularly placed in storage in a public warehouse, </em>dock or port facility, <em>as defined in the twelfth subdivision </em>of this section, <em>shall, while so in storage be considered in transit and only temporarily at rest, and not subject to personal property taxation * * *.\u201d Id </em>(paragraph 14th) (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Frost-Pack paid the personal property tax under protest and filed this action for refund.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The circuit judge was of the opinion that Frost-Pack\u2019s \"position is the better reasoned one in view of the context and technical language used throughout the General Property Tax Act\u201d. He felt bound, however, by the implications of <em>Frigid Food Products, Inc v Detroit, </em>31 Mich App 402; 187 NW2d 916 (1971), where an owner of farm products stored in a public warehouse was denied an exemption on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Court of Appeals affirmed and held that the term consignor \"encompasses more than entrustment for shipment. It includes delivery of goods for care or storage.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Also rejected was Frost-Pack\u2019s alternative challenge on constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>grounds to the classification resulting from the Court of Appeals construction of the term consignor. Justice O\u2019Hara dissented on constitutional and constructional grounds. The city\u2019s construction, he said, \"runs squarely into the interdiction of <em>United States Cold Storage Corp v Detroit Board of Assessors, </em>349 Mich 81; 84 NW2d 487 (1957)\u201d, where this Court declared that the classification \"must not be exercised in 'clear and hostile discriminations between particular persons and classes\u2019. 349 Mich 92; 84 NW2d 493.\u201d Addressing the constructional issue, he continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\"I believe that the legislative intent of subsection 12 was to eliminate the danger of the holding that Michigan was placing an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce, which, of course, is proscribed under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. The whole thrust of the subsection speaks to this purpose because it specifically provides for reassessment in any succeeding year if the materials and goods are <em>not in fact </em>shipped outside this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\">\"In the case at bar plaintiff did none of the things which would place it in the category of a consignor. It did not designate the goods as in transit to destinations out of state pursuant to the published tariffs of any common carrier. It filed no freight bills covering the products with any agency designated by such tariffs. Consignor is not a mysterious nor an occult term. Simply put, a consignor is one who places property in transit via a certificated carrier pursuant to a published tariff. If the product is committed to shipment and placed in a warehouse under a freight bill so as to entitle it to transportation rate privileges the owner by most known usage becomes a 'consignor\u2019. The consignee is simply the one to whom the shipment is consigned. Because in transportation law there often are questions as to when the title to the consigned goods passes, the Legislature included the term 'consignee\u2019 so that the assessing authority would not be bugged by a lot of Mickey Mouse as to whether title on the assessing date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>was in the 'consignor\u2019 or 'consignee\u2019. It has to be in one or the other dependent upon the terms of the contract of carriage. So if, as I noted earlier, the product never actually enters the stream of interstate commerce either the consignor or consignee is going to have to pay the tax in some succeeding year. Thus, the device of phony warehousing for tax avoidance is foiled\u201d (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">He also noted that the issue in <em>Frigid Foods </em>was whether the owner of the public warehouse was an \"affiliate\u201d, and no other question was presented or decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Without reaching the constitutional issue, we reverse the Court of Appeals on the constructional issue for the reasons cogently stated by Justice O\u2019Hara.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Farm products are exempt under paragraph 14th whether or not actually in transit to destinations out of state. The city agrees.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As stated, albeit in dissent, by three members of this Court in <em>United States Cold Storage Corp v Detroit Board of Assessors, supra, </em>p 94:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\">\"It appears that the plain intent of the legislature in the quoted language is to exempt from personal property taxation such farm products, as defined above, as are found in public warehouses in the State of Michigan on tax date, regardless of whether such products are destined for use inside or outside the State of Michigan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>or whether such destination is unascertained at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The majority did not disagree with that construction; it held that such an absolute exemption for storage of farm products in a public warehouse was not, when compared with the taxation of other personal property, violative of Const 1908, art 10, \u00a7 3, providing for uniformity in taxation. .</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">This construction is also borne out by a comparison of paragraph 12th with paragraph 14th: paragraph 12th provides, at considerable length, regarding proof that products and goqds are in fact in transit te destinatiens cut of state, that reports be filed with the assessor when goods for which exemption has been claimed are shipped from the warehouse,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that if such goods are not shipped out of state they shall be assessed upon the next succeeding or any subsequent assessment roll.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Comparable language does not appear in paragraph 14th, nor is it incorporated from paragraph 12th by reference; paragraph 14th incorporates by reference only paragraph 12\u2019s definition of the term \"public warehouse\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">My colleague recognizes but argues against the irrebuttability of the paragraph 14th presumption that farm products stored in a public warehouse are in transit and not subject to personal property taxation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Farm products need not, contrary to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>argument, be in transit to be within the \"reason for the exemption\u201d; they are exempt under paragraph 14th whether or not actually in transit. It undermines the statutory differentiation between goods that must be \"in transit\u201d to destinations out of state to be entitled to exemption (paragraph 12th) and those that are irrebuttably presumed to be in transit and specifically stated to be \"not subject to personal property taxation\u201d (paragraph 14th) to deny an exemption under paragraph 14th because the goods are not in fact in transit. There was no need to enact a paragraph 14th exemption for farm products actually in transit to destinations out of state; they are exempt under paragraph 12th.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The terms \"consignor\u201d and \"consignee\u201d are not defined in the act. In the context of paragraph 12th, providing at length regarding the determination of whether goods are in fact in transit in interstate commerce, a \"consignor\u201d is \"a shipper or transmitter of goods\u201d, and a \"consignee\u201d is the \"person to whom the carrier is to deliver a shipment of goods\u201d. Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d ed), p 251.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> If goods are not shipped or placed in transit there is no consignment, no consignor, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>consignee. In this case there was no shipment; the owner of the farm products was not a consignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The words \"consignor\u201d and \"consignee\u201d are terms of art in the law and should be given the legal meaning appropriate to the context. Definitions of these terms in nonlegal dictionaries set forth in my colleague\u2019s opinion are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">There is no need to give the term \"consignor\u201d an expansive construction to enforce the policy of the proviso denying an exemption where the goods are stored in a consignor\u2019s or consignee\u2019s or an affiliate\u2019s or subsidiary\u2019s warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Both the purpose of the exemption and of the consignor/consignee qualification become apparent on consideration of the immunity from local taxation of goods moving in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-9\">Goods in transit in interstate commerce are, by reason of the United States Constitution, immune from local taxation; \"the States may not tax property in transit in interstate commerce\u201d. <em>Minnesota v Blasius, </em>290 US 1, 9; 54 S Ct 34; 78 L Ed 131 (1933).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Once the interstate journey commences \"[t]he crucial question to be settled in determining whether personal property moving in interstate commerce is subject to local taxation is that of its continuity of transit.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Warehousing goods as \"a convenient intermediate step in the process of getting them to their final destination\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> does not break continuity of transit.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>The paragraph 12th exemption for goods in transit to destinations out of state manifestly is derived from the Federal Constitution and incorporates the concept that the continuity of transit requisite for exemption under the Federal Constitution is not broken by storage in a public warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Paragraph 12th is a legislative effort to provide administrative machinery for implementing Federal constitutional requirements and at the same time to guard against tax avoidance by the owners of goods located in a public warehouse they assert are in transit to out of state destinations that in fact are not.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">To avoid extending the exemption beyond what is required by the Federal Constitution, the Legislature, in the provisos to paragraph 12th, established a number of safeguards against misuse of the federal exemption (see fns 9 and 10 and accompanying text, <em>supra). </em>The safeguard here in issue provides in effect that the interstate journey will not be deemed to have commenced if the goods are stored in a warehouse owned by the shipper (consignor) or its affiliate or subsidiary. Similarly, the interstate journey will be deemed to have ended if the warehouse is owned by the person ultimately destined to receive the goods (consignee) or its affiliate or subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The exclusion of goods stored in a consignor\u2019s or consignee\u2019s or an affiliate\u2019s or subsidiary\u2019s warehouse guards against tax avoidance where, because of the relationship between the owner of the goods and the owner of the warehouse, interstate shipment (\"transit\u201d) never in substance<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> began, or has ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>The separate paragraph 14th exemption for farm products, in contrast, can be obtained by their mere placement in a public warehouse without regard to whether they are actually in transit. Where the exemption does not depend on whether the goods are actually in transit, it is of no significance whether interstate shipment has in substance begun or ended; the Legislature having determined that farm products not in transit, stored in a public warehouse, are exempt, there can be no misuse of the exemption or possible tax avoidance in placing farm products in the owner\u2019s or an affiliate\u2019s or subsidiary\u2019s warehouse. Defining the term \"consignor\u201d as a shipper of goods and \"consignee\u201d as the person destined to receive them is consonant both with the \"in transit\u201d context of paragraph 12th (where those terms appear) and the policy of the proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The Court of Appeals in defining \"consignor\u201d to include \"delivery of goods for care or storage\u201d deprives the term \"consignee\u201d of complementary meaning in the delivery-for-care-or-storage usage. The circuit judge said, \"[i]f the words 'consignor\u2019 were to be given the meaning for which defendant contends, the corresponding word 'consignee\u2019 contained in the same statutory exclusion would be absolutely meaningless and make the exclusion meaningless\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">If \"consignor\u201d does not mean a shipper of goods <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>and \"consignee\u201d the person ultimately destined to receive them,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> then the owner of the public warehouse rather than the ultimate recipient becomes the consignee. Clearly, the Legislature could not have meant that the owner of the warehouse was the consignee for then <em>no warehouse </em>could qualify as a public warehouse. If one substitutes \"warehouse owner, lessee or operator\u201d for \"consignee\u201d then the exclusion would read \"no portion of any premises owned or leased or operated by a * * * [warehouse owner, lessee or operator] * * * shall be deemed to be a public warehouse\u201d. The expansive meaning sought by the city does not work unless there can be a consignor without a consignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Moreover, unless consignee means the ultimate recipient, goods in transit to Michigan would not be deemed, by reason of the consignee qualification, to have ended their interstate journey if the warehouse in which they are located is owned by that person, an affiliate or subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">It would be necessary to give the term \"consignor\u201d different meanings under paragraph 12th and paragraph 14th to preserve the apparent objective of guarding against tax avoidance in the \"entrustment for shipment/in transit\u201d situation under paragraph 12th and at the same time to include the delivery-for-care-or-storage situation for the purpose of paragraph 14th.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">Where \"language is of doubtful meaning, a reasonable construction must be given, looking to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>purpose subserved thereby. Its occasion and necessity are matters of judicial concern, and its purpose should be effected if possible\u201d. <em>Webster v Rotary Electric Steel Co, </em>321 Mich 526, 531; 33 NW2d 69 (1948) (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\"Few words have a 'content so intrinsic\u2019 that their meaning does not become doubtful in the context of a particular question. <em>Wyandotte Savings Bank v State Banking Commissioner, </em>347 Mich 33, 40 [78 NW2d 612] (1956).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">\"We seek to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the Legislature. <em>Grand Rapids v Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178, 182 [189 NW 221] (1922). But, as Karl Llewellyn observed, only infrequently 'a legislative intent with some concrete reality can be uncovered in circumstance or legislative history. For the rest, the court\u2019s work is not to <em>\u00f1nd, </em>any more than it is with case law. It is to <em>do, </em>responsibly, fittingly, intelligently, with and within the given frame.\u2019 (Emphasis by author.) Llewellyn, The Common Law Tradition, Deciding Appeals, p 382. Much the same point was made in language quoted approvingly in <em>Wyandotte Savings Bank v State Banking Commissioner, supra, </em>pp 40-41: '\" 'the intention is to be taken or presumed, according to what is consonant to reason and good discretion.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 1 Kent\u2019s Commentaries (14th ed), p 462.\u201d <em>People v McFarlin, </em>389 Mich 557, 563-565; 208 NW2d 504; 64 ALR3d 1274 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">In construing a legislative enactment we are not at liberty to choose a construction that implements any rational purpose but, rather, must choose the construction which implements the legislative purpose perceived from the language and the context in which it is used.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The consignor and consignee exclusion appears designed to guard against tax avoidance and extension of the paragraph 12th statutory exemption beyond the Federal constitutional exemption. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>not within that purpose to apply this exclusion in paragraph 14th where taxpayers are in effect invited to avoid personal property taxation of farm products by placing them in a public warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Since the paragraph 14th exemption may be obtained by mere delivery for care or storage, the construction placed on the term consignor by the Court of Appeals (\"delivery of goods for care or storage\u201d) does not implement a legislative purpose of preventing tax avoidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">There are two essential questions where exemption is claimed under paragraph 12th: (1) Does the warehouse issue a schedule of rates.for storage of such goods and warehouse receipts pursuant to 1909 PA 303, and (2) were the goods designated as in transit to destinations out of state.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The consignor/consignee qualification protects only against tax avoidance in respect to question (2). Defining consignor, as did the Court of Appeals, does not address any issue that might arise under question (1), the only question pertinent to a claim of exemption under paragraph 14th.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">The reason why the terms consignor/consignee have no apparent meaning in paragraph 14th is that their function is related to question (2) only, a question not pertinent under paragraph 14th. While the fact that those terms do not, under the taxpayer\u2019s construction, have an apparent meaning in paragraph 14th is reason to consider whether there is another or additional legislative purpose consistent with the usage of those terms that would give them meaning in paragraph 14th, it does not justify adoption of the city\u2019s proffered construction unless it is in accord with a perceived purpose and ordinary usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The city contends that the legislative purpose was simply to prevent owners of goods or farm products who own or whose affiliates or subsidiaries own a warehouse from availing themselves of the paragraph 12th and paragraph 14th exemptions. If we were to adopt that purpose it would equate the word \"owner\u201d with the terms \"consignor\u201d/\u201dconsignee\u201d and thereby attribute to them in both paragraphs 12th and 14th a meaning different from any known or reported usage. An owner may be a consignor or consignee, but need not be. A consignor or consignee may be an owner, but need not be. Neither the Court of Appeals nor my colleague equates \"consignor\u201d/\u201dconsignee\u201d with \"owner\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Absent reason to believe from the language chosen by the Legislature or from the context that there was a legislative purpose in paragraph 14th as in paragraph 12th (guarding against tax avoidance) to distinguish between storage in a stranger\u2019s public warehouse and storage in the owner\u2019s or an affiliate\u2019s or subsidiary\u2019s public warehouse, and, on the contrary, since the paragraph 14th exemption is obtainable upon mere delivery of the farm products to a public warehouse, we are not warranted in giving the term \"consignor\u201d an additional and separate meaning for the purpose of paragraph 14th only which would deny the exemption there provided because of a relationship between the owner of the warehouse and the owner of the goods who makes the delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion without costs, a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Coleman and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b780-4\">Ryan and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<author id=\"b780-5\">Kavanagh, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyqM\">This is an appeal from summary judgment granted defendant City of Grand Rapids, denying plaintiff exemption from the personal property tax levied by the city upon certain farm products stored in a public warehouse. The Court of Appeals affirmed over dissent by Justice O\u2019Hara. 52 Mich App 694; 218 NW2d 75 (1974). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">The facts giving rise to this controversy are stipulated.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">Plaintiff is a Michigan corporation engaged in the sale and distribution at wholesale of various food products, primarily in frozen state. Plaintiff is also the parent corporation of a wholly-owned subsidiary corporation, Triple Temp Storage Company, a public warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">Plaintiff has paid the same schedule of fees charged to other customers of Triple Temp Storage Company. As a public warehouse facility, Triple Temp Storage Company has, in addition to plaintiff, a large and varied clientele. Plaintiff accounts for approximately 30% of Triple Temp\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">Triple Temp Storage Company and plaintiff are separate corporate entities. A common wall separates and segregates the physical facilities occupied by the two businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">In the course of the conduct of its wholesale business, plaintiff regularly places farm products for storage in Triple Temp Storage Company. Upon the December 31, 1967, tax date, farm prod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>ucts in the amount of $197,967.80 were so stored in Triple Temp Storage Company. These farm products had neither been sold or invoiced to any customer, nor were they the property of any supplier of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The City of Grand Rapids assessed the farm products stored on the tax date in Triple Temp Storage Company as a part of plaintiff\u2019s 1968 personal property assessment. Plaintiff, claiming an exemption under MCLA 211.9; MSA 7.9, appealed this assessment to the Grand Rapids City Assessor where its claim of exemption was denied. Plaintiff paid its 1968 personal property tax under protest after its appeals to the Board of Review and the Michigan State Tax Commission failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">In Count I of its complaint, plaintiff asserted that its property was exempted by \u00a7 9, paragraph 14th, of the General Property Tax Act, MCLA 211.9; MSA 7.9. Defendant\u2019s answer to this contention was that the exemption did not apply because by virtue of plaintiff\u2019s ownership of the warehouse, the facility could not be regarded as a public warehouse under \u00a7 9, paragraph 12th. Plaintiff maintained that the ownership provision had no application because its use did not amount to \"consignment\u201d as contemplated in paragraph 12th.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Both parties moved for summary judgment on Count I of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. The circuit court denied plaintiff\u2019s motion and granted a summary judgment in favor of the defendant.

The amount of the assessment is unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The defendant, however, denied the claim of exemption contending that when the plaintiff placed its farm products in storage, plaintiff became a \"consignor\u201d within the meaning of the exclusionary language of paragraph 12th, <em>supra. </em>Because, argues the defendant, the public warehouse is owned as a subsidiary corporation by the plaintiff, and because the plaintiff is a \"consignor\u201d of its farm products by virtue of their storage therein, the plaintiff\u2019s warehouse ceases to be a public warehouse as to plaintiff\u2019s products and plaintiff loses the exemption from taxation granted under paragraph 14th.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Unfortunately, the General Property Tax Act as a whole, and \u00a7 9 specifically, does not contain any definition of the term \"consignor\u201d to provide precise guidance as to what the Legislature intended by its use of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Plaintiff urges that we adopt the \"mercantile\u201d definition of the term, which it contends is found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>in the Uniform Commercial Code, MCLA 440.7102(1); MSA 19.7102(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\"(b) 'Consignee\u2019 means the person named in a bill to whom or to whose order the bill promises delivery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">\"(c) 'Consignor\u2019 means the person named in a bill as the person from whom the goods have been received for shipment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Another \"mercantile\u201d definition was given in <em>Wasey v Whitcomb, </em>167 Mich 58, 72; 132 NW 572 (1911):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">\" 'To consign\u2019, in mercantile terms, is, ordinarily, to send or transfer goods to a merchant or factor for sale, and the consignee is consequently the person to whom they are consigned, shipped, or otherwise transmitted, and the term implies an agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">These definitions, it is argued, do not support an interpretation that one in plaintiffs position, who merely deposits his unsold goods in a warehouse for storage, is a consignor. We are persuaded, however, that plaintiffs proffered definition is too narrow. This is not a case to determine rights in the typical commercial transaction between competing parties. We are not, for example, determining the rights of competing creditors of the consignor or consignee of goods delivered for sale, as would be covered under the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">While we agree that \"consignor\u201d may be correctly defined as plaintiff suggests, we regard a broader definition more appropriate in the present context.

The earliest consequential ancestor to the present \u00a7 9 was 1939 PA 232. No exemption from personal property taxation was therein granted to <em>any </em>agricultural products, much less to those stored in a warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">1949 PA 261 next amended \u00a7 9, and did so by adding a paragraph 13th, which provided that all agricultural products, grown in Michigan, located in a public warehouse were made exempt from personal property taxation if such</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-8\">\"agricultural products have been designated as in transit pursuant to the published tariffs of any common carrier by the filing of the freight bill covering such agricultural products with the agency designated by such tariffs, so as to entitle the shipper to transportation rate privileges applicable only to through shipments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>By 1952 PA 213, \u00a7 9 was again amended. Paragraph 13th of \u00a7 9, as it had been introduced into \u00a7 9 by 1949 PA 261, was amended by the addition of certain provisions. The definition of a public warehouse in paragraph 13th was amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">\"For the purpose of this section, a public warehouse is defined as any warehouse, owned or operated by any person, firm or corporation engaged in the business of storing agricultural products, goods for hire and who shall annually issue a schedule of tariffs for the agricultural products which such warehouse is capable of storing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">It is to be noted that paragraph 13th, both as introduced by 1949 PA 261 and as amended by 1952 PA 213, provided that if the agricultural products exempted from taxation on the grounds of being \"in transit\u201d were not, in fact, shipped outside of the State of Michigan pursuant to the freight bill under which they had been warehoused, their exemption was lost and the products were considered as having been omitted from the tax rolls and reassessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Finally, by 1956 PA 206 paragraphs 12th and 14th of \u00a7 9, as relevant here, came into existence. The prior paragraph 13th became new paragraph 12th and the exemption from taxation previously granted only to agricultural products stored in a public warehouse was expanded to include \"All products, materials and/or goods processed or otherwise and in whatever form\u201d that were located in a public warehouse on tax day if such products, materials and/or goods had been designated \"as in transit to destinations out of the state pursuant to the published tariffs of any railroad or common carrier by the filing of the freight bill\u201d covering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>such products so as to entitle the shipper to transportation rate privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Farm products were removed from the new paragraph 12th (old paragraph 13th) by 1956 PA 206 and given separate treatment under a newly created paragraph 14th. Under the new paragraph 14th, farm products, to obtain exemption from personal property taxation, now needed only to be stored in a public warehouse and no longer was it required that they be designated as in transit pursuant to published tariffs, etc. No longer was it the case that if farm products were not, in fact, sent into the stream of interstate commerce they would lose their exemption from taxation. See <em>United States Cold Storage Corp v Detroit Board of Assessors, </em>349 Mich 81; 84 NW2d 487 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">A further change was added by 1956 PA 206 and this change occurred in the definition of a public warehouse provided by the new paragraph 12th (old paragraph 13th). A public warehouse was redefined as a warehouse that issued receipts pursuant to the provisions of 1909 PA 303. The act further provided, however, that a warehouse owned, leased or operated by a consignor or consignee, or by any affiliate or subsidiary of such consignor or consignee, was not to be considered as within the definition of a public warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">This history indicates, as Justice O\u2019Hara stated in his dissent in the Court of Appeals, that \"the legislative intent of subsection 12 was to eliminate the danger of holding that Michigan was placing an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce * * * \u201d. 52 Mich App 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Goods actually designated as being in transit, located in a public warehouse, are exempted from the tax; farm products are <em>presumed </em>in transit if stored in a public warehouse. The purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>legislation is furthered by both of these provisions. The reason <em>why </em>the Legislature chose to \"presume\u201d farm goods so stored to be in transit is open to conjecture; the reason may have been nothing more than a recognition of the fact that such goods <em>are </em>very transitory, and as the Court of Appeals majority stated in considering the constitutional challenge to the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">\"Differentiation on a case-by-case basis as to the 'true purpose\u2019 with which goods are stored in an owned or affiliated warehouse would place an intolerable burden on the taxing authorities. Thus, it appears that the Legislature resolved to apply a conclusive presumption to products stored in each category of warehouses, without regard to a factual inquiry as to individual circumstances.\u201d 52 Mich App 701.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The purpose of the legislation is furthered also by excluding from the exemption those farm products stored in a warehouse owned by a consignor or consignee of the goods stored therein. The reason, simply put, is that the presumption that such goods are \"in transit\u201d is not warranted in such circumstances. The goods will either not yet have started in transit (if stored in consignor\u2019s warehouse) or will have completed their transit (if stored in the consignee\u2019s warehouse). The reason for the exemption is not present in such a situation. This statutory scheme is furthered only by including an owner of the goods stored within the term \"consignor\u201d and thus not exempted from taxes on the farm products stored in its own warehouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">To interpret the term \"consignor\u201d to exclude an owner of such goods would frustrate the entire purpose of the statute. The language must be read in the light of the general purpose sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>accomplished. <em>Ballinger v Smith, </em>328 Mich 23; 42 NW2d 49 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">We are also assisted in our determination by the oft-repeated rule of statutory construction that imposition provisions of a taxing statute are construed in favor of the taxpayer, while exemption provisions must be strictly construed in . favor of the taxing agency. <em>Evanston YMCA Camp v State Tax Commission, </em>369 Mich 1; 118 NW2d 818 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">An intention on the part of the Legislature to grant an exemption from taxation may not be implied from language which will admit of any other reasonable construction. \" 'In other words, since taxation is the rule, and exemption the exception, the intention to make an exemption ought to be expressed in clear and unambiguous terms; it cannot be taken to have been intended when the language of the statute on which it depends is doubtful or uncertain; and the burden of establishing it is upon him who claims it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Detroit v Detroit Commercial College, </em>322 Mich 142, 149; 33 NW2d 737 (1948), citing 2 Cooley on Taxation (4th ed), \u00a7 672, p 1403.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Considering, as we must, the overall statutory scheme involved, the several acceptable definitions of \"consignor\u201d, and the rule of strict construction against the taxpayer of exemption provisions, we hold that an owner of farm products that stores those products in a public warehouse which it owns and operates as a wholly-owned subsidiary is a \"consignor\u201d of those goods, and is thereby denied the exemption from taxation afforded by MCLA 211.9; MSA 7.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Plaintiff contends that the exclusionary lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>guage of paragraph 12th, when incorporated into paragraph 14th, constitutes an unreasonable and arbitrary classification for tax purposes, and is, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Plaintiff agrees that in the case of paragraph 12th, the exclusion from the definition of public warehouse of a warehouse owned by a consignor constitutes a reasonable basis for discrimination, the distinction being whether or not the goods involved are in interstate commerce. The argument is that when dealing with paragraph 14th, where any distinction between inter- and intrastate commerce is immaterial to the grant of an exemption, the exclusion of a warehouse owned by a consignor from the definition of public warehouse becomes an act of classification based solely on considerations of ownership. Those who store farm products in a public warehouse, and also own that warehouse, are treated differently for tax purposes from others who store identical goods in the same warehouse. This, it is argued, is not a differentiation between classes of property, but rather it is the nature of the owner which determines whether or not there is an exemption, and that is unconstitutional as violative of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 3, and the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art 1, \u00a7 2, of the Michigan Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">In <em>United States Cold Storage Corp v Detroit Board of Assessors, </em>349 Mich 81; 84 NW2d 487 (1957), paragraph 14th of this statute, which exempted farm products stored in a public warehouse from taxation due to the presumption that they are \"in transit\u201d was challenged as a violation of Const 1908, art 10, \u00a7 3, which provided for \"a uniform rule of taxation\u201d (now Const 1963, art 9, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>\u00a7 3).

The purpose of the legislation is furthered by both of these provisions. The reason <em>why </em>the Legislature chose to 'presume\u2019 farm goods so stored to be in transit is open to conjecture; the reason may have been nothing more than a recognition of the fact that such goods <em>are </em>very transitory, and as the Court of Appeals majority stated in considering the constitutional challenge to the statute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-9\">\" 'Differentiation on a case-by-case basis as to the \"true purpose\u201d with which goods are stored in an owned or affiliated warehouse would place an intolerable burden on the taxing authorities.

The reason, simply put, is that the presumption that such goods are 'in transit\u2019 is not warranted in such circumstances. The goods will either not yet have started in transit (if stored in consignor\u2019s warehouse) or will have completed their transit (if stored in the consignee\u2019s warehouse). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>reason for the exemption is not present in such a situation.
