October 16, 1968, plaintiff filed suit against Robert J. Lewis, the principal defendant in this matter, and served a writ of garnishment upon defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-8\">\"2. October 18, 1968, defendant filed a disclosure which denied liability to the principal defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-9\">\"3. October 23, 1968, plaintiff served interrogatories on defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-10\">\"4. October 31, 1968, defendant answered the interrogatories disclosing that on October 25, 1968, instead of October 16, 1968, the bank held the following property of the principal defendant: $159.84 in a checking account, $17.21 in a joint saving account, and notes receivable securing a commercial loan with a balance of $7,281.56. Defendant\u2019s answer relating to the loan was stated as follows: 'This loan is secured by an assignment of notes receivable and security agreement. Financing statement filed December 8, 1967.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">\"5. February 10, 1969, a default judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor was entered against the principal defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-12\">\"6. On or about February 14, 1969, a state receiver was appointed pursuant to an order of the circuit court for the principal defendant herein in the case of <em>Ormal K. Lewis vs Robert J. Lewis, </em>file no. 815-C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-14\">\"7. On or about March 25, 1969, defendant voluntarily turned over to the state receiver, without court order and without notice to plaintiff, the notes receivable belonging to the principal defendant and held as security for the commercial loan noted above, upon demand from the receiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\"8. April 4, 1969, the circuit court confirmed the sale by the receiver of the assets of the principal defendant, including the notes receivable turned over to the receiver by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\"9. April 15, 1969, the principal defendant filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition and was adjudicated a bankrupt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">\"10. On May 24, 1969, counsel for plaintiff wrote a letter to counsel for defendant stating that he had learned in bankruptcy court that defendant held notes receivable belonging to the principal defendant on the date the writ of garnishment was served in an amount in excess of $15,000, noting that he believed the bank would be liable under GCR 1963, 738 for the amount of plaintiff\u2019s judgment against the principal defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">\"11. May 27, 1969, plaintiff filed a demand for pretrial conference on the liability of defendant together with proof of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">\"12. July 11, 1969, plaintiff served a second set of interrogatories upon defendant asking expressly, <em>inter alia, </em>about the notes receivable belonging to the principal defendant and held by defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">\"13. December 15, 1969, defendant answered plaintiff's second set of interrogatories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">\"14, March 18, 1970, a second demand for pretrial conference on the liability of defendant was made by plaintiff together with proof of service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">\"15. July 16, 1970, the principal defendant in this matter was discharged in bankruptcy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">\"16. The docket entries and pleadings reflect that plaintiff sought every few months since May 27, 1969 to bring the issue of defendant\u2019s liability to trial, the matter finally having been heard upon motion for summary judgment in August, 1973, with judgment for defendant entered on October 16, 1973.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">The Court of Appeals reversed and imposed liability on the bank.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a memorandum opinion filed July 23, 1975, we reversed and remanded to the trial court for dismissal of the prejudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>garnishment action. On application of the plaintiff, we granted rehearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We now affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The first issue to be considered is whether the disclosure on the part of the garnishee bank was insufficient in view of the language of GCR 1963, 738.6. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">\"Disclosure. The garnishee shall file with the clerk of court a disclosure under oath within 15 days after the date of the service of the writ upon him. The disclosure shall reveal any liability to the principal defendant as specified in subrule 738.5, and, except as to claims for unliquidated damages for wrongs or injuries, may claim any setoff of which the garnishee could have availed himself against the principal defendant if he had not been garnisheed. Unless the plaintiff takes further steps as authorized by these rules within 10 days after the receipt of notice of the filing of the garnishee\u2019s disclosure, the disclosure shall be held to be sufficient.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Rule 738.5 establishes the extent of a garnishee\u2019s potential liability to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The effect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>subrules .5 and .6 of Rule 738, when read together, is a requirement of extensive disclosure of a garnishee\u2019s liabilities to a principal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The disclosure filed by Peoples State Bank in this case denied liability to the principal defendant. Five days after the bank filed its disclosure the plaintiff, Ernest L. Mary, served interrogatories upon the bank, pursuant to GCR. 1963, 738.9. In answer to the interrogatories, the bank stated that the principal defendant, Robert Lewis, doing business as Peoples Finance Company, had an outstanding loan of $7,281.56 secured by an assignment of notes receivable and a security agreement, noting that a financing statement was filed December 8, 1967. The bank admits that at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the service of the writ of garnishment it held notes receivable belonging to the principal defendant with a face value of over $20,000, and that these notes were subject to garnishment under GCR 1963, 738. The bank contends that it performed its disclosure responsibilities under the court rule by advising Mr. Mary where he could obtain additional information regarding the notes if he were interested. It is clear, however, that GCR 1963, 738.5 and 738.6, as read together, establish that a garnishee must disclose any liability to the principal defendant subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. Further, the garnishee must disclose the true condition of its liability to the principal defendant. <em>Hirth v Pfeifle, </em>42 Mich 31; 3 NW 239 (1879). <em>Baios v Clark, </em>304 Mich 159; 7 NW2d 255 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The bank\u2019s failure to disclose the total face value of the notes held as security meant that plaintiff was not informed whether the security held was greater or less than the secured indebtedness. Merely telling plaintiff <em>where </em>he could obtain information as to the notes held by defendant did not meet the requirements of the court rule. The duty is one of disclosure by the garnishee, not one of search and discovery by the plaintiff. The Court of Appeals decision that the bank\u2019s disclosure was insufficient was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">The second issue presented is whether the lien acquired by plaintiff on the principal defendant\u2019s notes receivable, held by the bank at the time of the service of writ of garnishment, was affected by the bankruptcy of the principal defendant. The judgment against the principal defendant was entered within four months preceding his bank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ruptcy, though the writ of garnishment was served upon the bank more than four months before principal defendant\u2019s bankruptcy. Section 67a of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USC 107(a), provid\u00e9s that a lien obtained by legal proceedings within four months prior to the filing of a petition in bankruptcy shall be \"null and void\u201d if certain other conditions are present.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The bank contends that plaintiffs lien was not \"obtained\u201d until the time when judgment was entered against the principal defendant and was therefore void as having been obtained within four months of the bankruptcy. The Court of Appeals held that the lien was obtained on the date of service of the writ of garnishment and was, therefore, unaffected by the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Michigan follows the general rule that a garnishment lien attaches upon service of the writ. <em>Kyte v MacIvor, </em>266 Mich 258; 253 NW 289 (1934). <em>Rickman v Rickman, </em>180 Mich 224; 146 NW 609 (1914). In the case of a prejudgment garnishment, the entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiff perfects the lien acquired upon service by removing its inchoate status and establishing the exact amount of the debt owed by the principal defendant and, thus, the amount for which the garnishee may be held liable. Should the plaintiff fail to obtain a judgment, the lien would be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">In the context of a bankruptcy adjudication, Professor Collier observes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\"It seems now to be generally accepted * * * that if garnishment over four months before bankruptcy gives rise to a lien by state law, it is of no consequence that the lien may be regarded as inchoate for certain purposes. Perfection by judgment against the garnishee within the four-month period does not subject the lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to voidability under \u00a7 \u00a77a; indeed, the inchoate lien of a garnishment need not be perfected at all in order to prevail in bankruptcy.\u201d 4 Collier on Bankruptcy (14th ed), \u00a7 67a(1), pp 131-132.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In the case at bar, the lien attached upon service of the writ more than four months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition and, therefore, is unaffected by the subsequent bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">In granting a rehearing this Court specifically requested that the parties address the issue of whether 1974 PA 371<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> affects this case and, if so, how.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">1974 PA 371 sets forth, <em>inter alia, </em>new restrictions on prejudgment garnishments, limiting their use to situations where the principal defendant is not subject to the judicial jurisdiction of this state or cannot be served with process after a diligent effort has been made. Neither exception is involved in the case at bar. Therefore, if the act applies to the prejudgment garnishment in this case, the writ of garnishment would be void. Section 3 of the act provides: \"[t]he provisions of this act shall apply to all actions pending or commenced on or after the effective date of this act\u201d. Section 4 states: \"[t]his amendatory act shall take effect April 1, 1975\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">On April 1, 1975, this case was before this Court on an application for leave to appeal. The question then is whether this case was \"pending\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3 on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d ed) defines \"pending\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>as: \"[b]egun, but not yet completed; unsettled; * * * in process of settlement or adjustment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">1 Am Jur 2d, Actions, \u00a7 91, p 620, states that an action may be deemed pending after judgment has been rendered provided a motion for new trial is pending, or an appeal is being taken, or even as long as the time for appeal has not expired, although no appeal has in fact been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Under the common law, an action is said to be pending until the judgment is satisfied, though only for the purpose of enforcing it or instituting proceedings provided by law to reverse or modify it. <em>Sweetser v </em>Fox, 43 Utah 40; 134 P 599 (1913). While from the foregoing it may at first appear that this case was pending at the time of the effective date of the statute, it is necessary to look at both the legislative intent as to the meaning of the expression \"pending or commenced\u201d and the purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">This amendatory act sets forth new restrictions on <em>prejudgment </em>garnishments. It limits prejudgment garnishments to situations where a principal defendant is not subject to the judicial jurisdiction of the state or where the principal defendant cannot be served with process after a diligent effort is made. The statute is designed to protect the due process rights of a principal defendant, not a garnishee defendant. 1974 PA 371 is a legislative response to recent Federal cases<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> invalidating prejudgment garnishment procedures which violate the due process rights of principal defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">At the time of entry of judgment against the principal defendant, the prejudgment dimension of such a garnishment proceeding is removed along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>with the potential due process problems with which the Legislature has dealt in 1974 PA 371. Moreover, when a judgment is entered against the principal defendant, the plaintiffs lien is perfected, thereby becoming a fully vested property right.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Under Michigan case law, statutes affecting property rights are presumed not to operate retrospectively. <em>Michigan Public Service Co v Cheboygan, </em>324 Mich 309; 37 NW2d 116 (1949), <em>Stitt v Casterline, </em>89 Mich 239; 50 NW 847 (1891), <em>Van Fleet v Van Fleet, </em>49 Mich 610; 14 NW 566 (1883). As the Court of Appeals correctly stated in <em>Chesapeake &amp; O R Co v Public Service Commission, </em>5 Mich App 492, 506; 147 NW2d 469 (1967), <em>aff'd by an equally divided court, </em>382 Mich 8; 167 NW2d 438 (1969):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">\"It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that statutory amendments not be given any retroactive effect unless the legislature clearly and unequivocally indicates otherwise. The statutory amendment during the pendency of a suit has no bearing upon the rights of the parties fixed by law before its enactment.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">In addition, the \"pending\u201d language is in the context of the phrase \"shall apply to all actions pending or commenced on or after the effective date of this act\u201d. The \"pending or commenced\u201d language indicates that the Legislature intended to bar only the issuance of prejudgment writs of garnishment after the effective date of the statute, not to invalidate and cause to be relitigated all judgments that had been obtained subsequent to a prejudgment garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We hold that 1974 PA 371 did not nullify the instant prejudgment garnishment where both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>writ and the judgment against the principal defendant were issued six years prior to the effective date of the statute, and were not challenged by the party the statute was designed to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The final question to be resolved is the effect of <em>Cochrane v Westwood Wholesale Grocery Co, </em>394 Mich 164; 229 NW2d 309 (1975), on the instant case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">In <em>Cochrane </em>we affirmed the circuit court\u2019s order quashing the writ of garnishment challenged by the principal defendant on the basis that the writ was violative of the due process rights of the principal defendant. The issue we addressed in <em>Cochrane </em>was the constitutionality of the Michigan garnishment statute and court rule. In the instant case the principal defendant never, contested the principal claim, never challenged the writ of garnishment, and never raised the constitutional questions regarding due process rights. Moreover, the prejudgment dimension of this action ended early in 1969 when the judgment, which was never appealed, was entered against the principal defendant. It is therefore necessary to consider whether the constitutional protection of due process extends to the garnishee defendant; that is, whether the bank has standing to raise the question of the constitutionality of the instant prejudgment garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>As a general rule, one party may not raise the denial of another person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>United States v Raines, </em>362 US 17; 80 S Ct 519; 4 L Ed 2d 524 (1960). Defendant quotes portions of Justice Brennan\u2019s dissent in <em>Village of Belle Terre </em>v <em>Boraas, </em>416 US 1; 94 S Ct 1536; 39 L Ed 2d 797 (1974), where two exceptions to this general rule are discussed: first, those situations where there is evidence that the direct consequence of the denial of the constitutional rights of the other would impose substantial economic injury upon the party asserting the right; second, those instances where the litigant\u2019s interest and the other\u2019s interest intertwine and the latter\u2019s rights may not be effectively vindicated in any other manner because they are capable of evading constitutional review.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In this case the bank does not show how it qualifies under either of these exceptions. The fact that the writ of garnishment issued prior to judgment against the principal defendant was, in itself, not the direct cause of a substantial economic injury to the bank. Nor has there been any showing that the principal defendant could not have effectively asserted his own due process rights. We therefore conclude that the bank has no standing to interpose the due process rights of the principal defendant regarding the prejudgment garnishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-8\">Kavanagh, C.

Prejudgment garnishment is now available only to secure \"judicial jurisdiction\u201d of a principal defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The amendment is applicable \"to all actions pending or commenced on or after the effective date\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">I agree with the majority, for different reasons, that the present phase of the litigation, between the plaintiff judgment creditor and the garnishee defendant bank, is not an \"action pending\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in this legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">The majority states that the amendment bars \"only the issuance of prejudgment writs of garnishment after the effective date.\u201d Under the majority\u2019s construction, the amendment, in practical effect, applies to actions commenced after the effective date; had the Legislature so intended it would not have made the act applicable \"to all actions pending <em>or </em>commenced\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">Prejudgment writs of garnishment, when issued at all, usually were issued at the time the action was commenced on the plaintiff\u2019s affidavit that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\"is justly apprehensive of the loss of his claim against the defendant unless a writ of garnishment is issued\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Since relatively few plaintiffs who did not know of garnishable funds or who were not so apprehensive at the time the action was commenced, thereafter learned of such funds or became apprehensive and acted on that new information or sense of insecurity by causing a writ of garnishment to issue before obtaining a judgment, only a small proportion of the actions commenced before the effective date of the amendment in which writs of garnishment ultimately were issued are affected by the retroactivity provision as construed by the majority; the amendment applies retroactively only in the atypical case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The apparent purpose of this legislation was to relieve principal defendants of the burden of having funds frozen during often prolonged civil litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Consistent with that purpose the Legislature made this new policy applicable to \"actions pending\u201d, thereby making the amendment retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The apparent purpose of retroactivity was to require the release of funds garnished<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> before the effective date. It is not consistent with that purpose to deny the benefit of retroactivity to principal defendants in the typical case where the writ of garnishment w;as issued and funds were garnished before the effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s construction unnecessarily and, I think, unwisely exposes to action by unpaid judgment creditors a garnishee defendant who, relying on the amendment and the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>meaning of the word \"pending\u201d, released impounded funds to the principal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In ordinary usage, the pendency of an action does not depend on when it was commenced; an action continues to be pending during an appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Lawyers advising banks and other garnishee defendants holding funds impounded by a pre-effective date garnishment would have understandably advised their clients that upon the effectiveness of the amendment they were obliged to release the funds to the principal defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The retroactivity provision of the amendatory act is concerned with garnishment as it affects principal defendants, and the extent of the retro-activity can properly be limited on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">It is beyond the remedial purpose of the retroactivity and the meaning of the term \"actions pending\u201d as used in this legislation for the amendment to be effective in a situation that does not tend to benefit the principal defendant or a person claiming in respect to him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">In this case the funds had been turned over to the principal defendant\u2019s receiver before the enactment of the amendment. The funds were not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>leased by the bank to the principal defendant in reliance on the legislative directive. Retroactivity in this case would not tend to benefit the principal defendant or a person claiming in respect to him. On that basis I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-10\"> 1974 PA 371.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\"> The pertinent provision of the amended statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">\"(3) A writ of garnishment may be issued before judgment only as provided in this subsection.
