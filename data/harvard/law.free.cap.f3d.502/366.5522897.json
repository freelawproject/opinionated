Helm argues that the district court erred in sentencing him as an armed career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. Helm also argues that \u00a7 924(e) of the ACCA violates the due process clause, and that his sentence infringes on his Eighth Amendment rights. Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Christopher Helm was indicted on one charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). The charge against Helm arose after officers were summoned to a hotel to investigate complaints of attempted burglary. The officers discovered Helm and found that he had a firearm on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">During arraignment, the government put Helm on notice that he was potentially subject to a sentencing enhancement under the ACCA based on his status as an armed career criminal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). Helm pleaded guilty to the charge against him. The district court found that Helm had the necessary prior convictions to justify his treatment as an armed career criminal under the ACCA and sentenced him to the 180-month statutory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a sentence enhancement provision <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> United States v. Montgomery, </em>402 F.3d 482, 485 (5th Cir.2005). Helm raises due process and Eighth Amendment arguments related to his sentence for the first time in this appeal. Therefore, as related to those arguments, we review Helm\u2019s sentence only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>489 F.3d 679, 681 (5th Cir.2007) (recognizing that errors not preserved at trial level are to be reviewed for plain error). Under the plain error framework, Helm must show that (1) there was legal error, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected his substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-17\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b393-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b393-19\">The ACCA imposes a mandatory fifteen-year sentence on a felon who has been convicted of the unlawful possession of a firearm, and who has three previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>convictions for a \u201cviolent felony\u201d or a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). In the instant case, Helm\u2019s sentence was enhanced due to three prior convictions, all burglary offenses. As admitted by Helm at sentencing, each of these convictions qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for the purposes of the ACCA. While Helm admits that he falls under the letter of \u00a7 924(e), he argues that he should not be treated as an armed career criminal under the ACCA because his felonies were committed when he was 18 years old, and because at the time of sentencing he claimed to be an addict of methamphetamine. Specifically, Helm argues that Congress did not intend \u00a7 924(e) to target criminals in Helm\u2019s situation, presumably those with older qualifying convictions and current drug addictions, even if they meet the statute\u2019s requirements. Neither the statute nor any caselaw suggest that the age of a qualifying conviction impacts the application of the ACCA. In arguing that he falls outside the purposes of the statute, Helm relies exclusively on a district court case from Minnesota, <em>United States v. Weber, </em>132 F.Supp.2d 1202 (D.Minn.2001). However, <em>Weber </em>provides no relief for Helm. In <em>Weber </em>the court determined that the ACCA should not apply to Weber because two burglaries committed on the same day were deemed one offense, and therefore Weber did not meet the ACCA\u2019s three-conviction requirement to qualify as an armed career criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 1204. <em>Weber </em>does not suggest that an offender who meets the ACCA\u2019s requirements might somehow avoid its mandatory minimum sentence. Because Helm provides no reason to deviate from the statute\u2019s text, the statute applies to Helm as clearly written. The district court did not err in determining that the ACCA applies to Helm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Helm argues on appeal that the application of \u00a7 924(e) violates the due process clause because the statute enhances his punishment based on facts (ie., the existence of his convictions) that were not submitted to a jury nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Helm\u2019s argument fails to meet the first step of plain error review, a showing of error. Helm recognizes that his due process argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent but raises it to preserve possible review by the Supreme Court. We have recognized that \u00a7 924(e) operates as a sentencing enhancement. As such, we have held that the existence of prior convictions need not be found by a jury. See <em>United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Affleck, </em>861 F.2d 97, 99 (5th Cir.1988). Our prior holdings control in this case. The district court did not err in sentencing Helm as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Finally, Helm argues that his sentence under the ACCA violates the Eighth Amendment because it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment. Here again, Helm fails to show any legal error in the district court\u2019s sentence. Helm argues that the application of \u00a7 924(e) to him amounts to a punishment grossly disproportionate to the crime committed. In <em>Harmelin v. Michigan, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole for one drug conviction in the face of an Eighth Amendment challenge. 501 U.S. 957, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991). There the Court recognized that \u201c[sjevere, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense, having been employed in various forms throughout our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 994-95, 111 S.Ct. 2680. We have upheld <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the federal \u201cthree strikes\u201d law, 18-U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c), against an Eighth Amendment proportionality challenge. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>431 F.3d 846, 853 (5th Cir.2005). Helm\u2019s is not a life sentence, and his enhancement is based on his involvement in a series of \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d In comparison to <em>Martin </em>and <em>Harmelin, </em>it is clear that the application of the ACCA to Helm does not violate the Eighth Amendment. In so holding, we join the other circuits that have considered an Eighth Amendment challenge to the ACCA. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Reynolds, </em>215 F.3d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.2000) (upholding ACCA against Eighth Amendment challenge); <em>United States v. Cardoza, </em>129 F.3d 6, 18 (1st Cir.1997) (same); <em>United States v. Rudolph, </em>970 F.2d 467, 469-70 (8th Cir.1992) (same); <em>United States v. Crittendon, </em>883 F.2d 326, 331 (4th Cir.1989) (same); <em>United States v. Pedigo, </em>879 F.2d 1315, 1320 (6th Cir.1989) (same); <em>United States v. Dombrowski, </em>877 F.2d 520, 526 (7th Cir.1989) (same); <em>United States v. Baker, </em>850 F.2d 1365, 1372 (9th Cir.1988) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">For the foregoing reasons we AFFIRM the sentence of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-13\">. The government contends that Helm raises this error for the first time on appeal, and thus that this issue should be reviewed for plain error. However, Helm raised an objection during his sentencing hearing to his being treated as an armed career criminal under the ACCA despite the fact that he admitted that the statute, based on its text, appears to apply to him. Therefore we treat his objection as preserved and review it accordingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
