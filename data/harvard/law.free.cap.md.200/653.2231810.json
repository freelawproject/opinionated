He alleges that he was unable to employ counsel and his request for court-appointed counsel was denied. The allegation is wholly insufficient to show that counsel was necessary or that lack of counsel resulted in an unfair trial. Cf. <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>200 Md. 651, 89 A. 2d 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The petitioner alleges in his brief filed in this court, that evidence was obtained by an illegal search of his home, and that there was a failure of proof of identification. These points were not made below, but if they had been, they would furnish no grounds for the writ. <em>Cuttings v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 670, 81 A. 2d 645; <em>Tyson v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 684, 84 A. 2d 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
