He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>alleges that upon arraignment he asked the court to appoint counsel for him, but he received a letter from the judge\u2019s bailiff stating that the judge was unwilling to appoint counsel and petitioner should retain counsel at his own expense. Petitioner alleged he was without means to do so. He was charged with (1) larceny of an automobile, for which the maximum penalty is fourteen years (Art. 27, sec. 396) and (2) unauthorized use of an automobile (Art. 27, sec. 397).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The petition does not state petitioner\u2019s age, experience or lack of experience with criminal prosecutions, or any fact that would necessitate appointment of counsel for him. It alleges only the gravity of the offense charged and asserts an absolute constitutional right to appointment of counsel. In a brief in this court petitioner asserts that he was faced with (1) the impossible alternative of defending against the first charge without assistance of counsel or (2) pleading guilty to the second charge, thus without opportunity to contest his guilt of any crime at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The right to appointment of counsel is not an absolute right. It exists only upon a showing of facts which make it necessary in the particular case. To assert that petitioner could not without counsel defend against the second charge without being convicted of the first begs the question. <em>Loane v.
