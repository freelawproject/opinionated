The only question presented is whether a motion to quash a search warrant was properly denied and evidence obtained by search under the warrant was properly admitted. The sufficiency, in law and in fact, of the evidence (if admissible) is not questioned. The question is, whether the facts stated in the affidavit and application for the search warrant are sufficient to show probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">The affidavit and application of Captain Emerson, dated May 10, 1951, states that: The premises in question are \u201cthe premises on the second floor, combination restaurant and poolroom, 1019% W. North Avenue, a two-story brick building\u201d. On May 7, 1951, a named officer watched the premises from 7 to 8:15 p.m. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>7:10 p.m. the officer was standing on the southeast corner of Madison and North Avenues, when two white men walked up on the corner and began talking. One said, \u201cIf I don\u2019t start winning soon on these night games, I\u2019ll have to stop betting.\u201d The other man said, \u201cYou worry too much, come let\u2019s go up to Tiger\u2019s, he owes me twenty bucks from yesterday\u2019s game.\u201d The two men then entered the premises 1019% W. North Avenue. The officer then walked east on North Avenue, past No. 1019% where the two men had entered. There was a white man, described by age, height and weight, standing in the doorway looking up and down the street. The officer crossed the street and stood on the northwest corner of Eutaw Place and North Avenue and watched. Between 7:25 and 8:15 p.m. he saw twenty-five white men enter the premises No. 1019%. Of the twenty-five only three came out. Each time a white man entered or left the premises, the described man \u201cwould look up and down the street in a suspicious manner, acting in the capacity of a watchman\u201d. On May 8, 1951 the officer again watched the premises from 7 to 8:15 p.m. Upon arrival at Madison and North Avenues the same man was standing in the same doorway \u201clooking up and down the street in a suspicious manner\u201d. Between 7 and 7:30 p.m., the officer saw ten white men enter the premises 1019% W. North Avenue. At 7:35 p.m. the officer was standing on the corner of Madison and North Avenues, near a group of men who were talking about baseball. One man said, \u201cTiger is giving good odds on the Orioles tonight, I think I\u2019ll put $10.00 on them\u201d; he then entered the premises No. 1019%. At 7:45 p.m. a white man approached the man standing in the doorway and said to him, \u201cGive this action to the boss\u201d. He handed the man white slips of paper with some United States currency. The man then went up the steps of the premises and returned to the doorway in a few moments. Between 7:50 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. six white men entered the premises. The search warrant directed search of \u201cthe said premises on the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>floor, of <em>10191/2 </em>W. North Avenue, a two-story brick building\u201d for baseball betting paraphenalia \u201cused in the unlawful operation of gambling on the results of baseball games\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Apparently baseball betting differs in some respects from the pattern, judicially familiar to us, of numbers betting and much bookmaking. In baseball betting most of the customers do not make flying visits. In view of this difference, and the fact that these premises had an ostensible lawful use, \u201ccombination restaurant and poolroom\u201d, we put no stress on the numbers that entered the premises. But we think the conversations between persons some of whom immediately entered the premises \u2014 and the statement, to the \u201cwatchman\u201d, of one who left money there without entering \u2014 furnished ample probable cause for belief that a baseball betting establishment was being maintained there. These statements were not hearsay from unknown sources, but were significant verbal acts of men who \u201csuited the action to the word and suited the word to the action\u201d. <em>Cf. Carpenter v. State, </em>200 Md. 31, 88 A. 2d 180, just decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Defendant says the application did not sufficiently identify the premises as all the second floor. We think, this is a hypercritical interpretation of the words of the affidavit. The premises were the second floor of a two-story building. There were \u201csteps\u201d at the doorway, <em>i.e., </em>the doorway was the usual upstairs entrance to a two-story building of which the two storys were used, presumably or possibly, by different persons for different purposes. We think \u201cthe premises on the second floor, combination restaurant and poolroom\u201d, does not mean \u201cpart of the premises\u201d or \u201cone of the premises\u201d on the second floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
