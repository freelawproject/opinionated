He alleges that he was arrested, apparently without a warrant, and without a charge against him, by breaking into his apartment, that a prosecuting witness testified that he was introduced to petitioner by an informer, who was not present at the trial, and that his counsel (of his own choosing) \u201cat no time during the trial defended him to the full extent\u201d, without specifying any respect in which counsel failed to do so. He does not allege fraud or bad faith or collusion on the part of his counsel and any state officer. As Judge France held in his memorandum, petitioner\u2019s contentions could all have been made on motion for a new trial or on appeal and cannot be made on <em>habeas corpus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
