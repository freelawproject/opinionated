He says he did rob, and attempt to rob, with a pistol which was \u201cbroken and empty\u201d and therefore was not a deadly weapon. He also contends that his sentence violated the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment. He alleges that his \u201ccourt-appointed counsel * * * rendered no help whatever. In his failure to question the legality of the faulty indictment [which is not in the record] and judgment, the defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>acted in a manner inimical to the best interests of the appellant\u201d. He does not allege fraud, bad faith or collusion with any state\u2019s officer, or that he complained to the trial court against his counsel or made any attempt to move for a new trial or to appeal. All the contentions made by petitioner, as to the nature of his crimes or the legality of his sentence \u2014 or his trial \u2014 can be made on motion for a new trial or on appeal and not on <em>habeas corpus.
