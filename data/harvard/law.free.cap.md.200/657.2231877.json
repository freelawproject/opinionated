He alleges that he was twice arrested (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>second time while on bail for the first alleged offense) without a warrant by breaking into \u201can apartment\u201d (not expressly, but inferentially alleged to be his) and not clearly, but perhaps by inference, that evidence was obtained by unconstitutional, unlawful search and seizure. These contentions could all have been made on motion for a new trial or on appeal, but not on <em>habeas corpus. Loughran v.
