On a previous application he sought to raise the same point he now seeks to raise, that he was tried without counsel, while his codefendant was represented by counsel. <em>Williams v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 689, 85 A. 2d 464. He again fails to allege any circumstances that would justify the granting of the writ. The burden is upon a petitioner to state facts tending to show that \u201cfor want of benefit of counsel an ingredient of unfairness actively operated in the process that resulted in his confinement\u201d. <em>Quicksall v. Michigan, </em>339 U. S. 660, 70 S. Ct. 910, 913, 94 L. Ed. 1188. Cf. <em>Langrehr v. Warden, </em>198 Md. 683, 84 A. 2d 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
