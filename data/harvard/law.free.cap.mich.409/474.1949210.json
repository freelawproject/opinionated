The prosecution seeks, by this appeal, the opportunity to retry Anderson on a charge of first-degree murder. The issue is whether retrial is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-12\">We hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The trial judge\u2019s action represented a resolution of \"some or all of the factual elements\u201d of the murder charge and was therefore an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes, barring reprosecution. It is irrelevant that the acquittal</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">a) was not so denominated by the trial judge,</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">b) may have been erroneous both procedurally and in terms of the questions of law on which it was founded, and</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">c) came about with defendant\u2019s cooperation and consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Elva Jean Anderson was charged with first-degree murder. Willie Young testified that he saw her shoot and kill Willie Ray Russell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-10\">Young, a doorman at a hotel, testified that Barbara Golden and Russell came to the hotel and went to the front desk. Golden kept looking \"funny\u201d at Young. She talked with the desk clerk and with Young. After Young said, \"You turn around and go on back out the door. I don\u2019t want no trouble in here\u201d, Russell left the hotel. Golden made a telephone call, and then waited with Young in the hallway of the hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">About 20 minutes later, a taxicab pulled up and two passengers stepped out; Anderson was one of them. Golden ran up to Anderson, who slapped her. Anderson, Golden and the other person who had arrived in the cab walked around the side of the hotel. About two to three minutes later, Young saw Anderson pull a shotgun out of her \"britches\u201d and open the door to the car in which Russell was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>now sitting. A brief conversation ensued, Young heard Golden say \"don\u2019t shoot him\u201d, and then he heard a shot. After the shot, Young heard Anderson say \"[m]otherfucker, I bet you won\u2019t try to rape nobody else\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Anderson was bound over on a charge of first-degree murder. A pretrial motion to quash was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">At trial, the prosecution had presented its first five witnesses, but had not yet completed presenting its case, when the judge entertained a motion for reduction of bond. Over the prosecutor\u2019s objection the judge granted Anderson\u2019s release on personal bond, stating that \"the proofs [of murder] in this case are not strong\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Thereupon, an off-the-record side bar conversation was held with counsel. Immediately thereafter, following an apparently brief conversation between Anderson and her counsel, she offered to plead guilty to a charge of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, the judge proceeded to take Anderson\u2019s guilty plea, advising her of her rights and establishing a factual basis for her plea. She said that Golden was her lover and had called her saying that a man was waiting outside the hotel with a gun and was trying to rape her and asked Anderson to come pick her up. Anderson said that she brought her shotgun because she believed Golden when she said that a man with a gun was waiting outside the hotel and was trying to rape her. Anderson said that she approached the car in which Russell was sitting because she believed that he had attempted and still intended to rape Golden. She asked Russell to get out of the car, \"because I didn\u2019t want to shoot him\u201d, and repeated the request several times. Anderson thought that Russell \"was digging for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>gun or something\u201d and when he didn\u2019t come out she shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"pAIo\">The judge accepted Anderson\u2019s plea to the charge of manslaughter, said he was dismissing the \"charges of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree\u201d and discharged the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial on first-degree murder. It held that the judge was not. authorized to accept a plea to a lesser offense and dismiss the murder charge over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, and declared that \"no double jeopardy question arises\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">The people contend, relying on <em>Genesee Prosecutor I</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Genesee Prosecutor </em>II,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the Court of Appeals correctly found that the judge erred in dismissing the murder charge. Anderson claims that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars further prosecution for murder whether the judge erred or not. We agree that reprosecution is constitutionally impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">In <em>Genesee Prosecutor I </em>this Court held that a judge is not authorized, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, to accept a plea of guilty of an offense not charged or included in the information or indictment. <em>Genesee Prosecutor II </em>enlarged this holding and declared that a judge cannot, over the prosecutor\u2019s objection, accept a plea of guilty of a lesser included offense and dismiss the charge of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>greater offense; we set aside a plea of guilty of manslaughter and remanded for trial on the charged offense of murder. In those cases, however, the plea was offered and the charge dismissed before trial and impaneling of a jury. We noted that there was no double jeopardy issue in <em>Genesee Prosecutor II </em>because the defendant \"has not been tried for murder\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The judge\u2019s actions in accepting a plea of guilty of the lesser offense of manslaughter and dismissing the murder charge appear to have been violative of <em>Genesee Prosecutor II. </em>It is, however, a separate question, one controlled by the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, whether the Double Jeopardy Clause would be violated by a retrial of Anderson for murder after jeopardy had attached in respect to that charge. We conclude (Part III, <em>infra) </em>that the Double Jeopardy Clause would be violated by retrial because the judge made a factual determination upon the prosecutor\u2019s proofs that one or more elements of murder could not be established. This is true notwithstanding that the judge\u2019s acceptance of a plea to a lesser offense over the prosecutor\u2019s objection appears to have violated the specific dictates of <em>Genesee Prosecutor II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The constitutional protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are implicated only when jeopardy has \"attached\u201d. Jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury has been impaneled and sworn.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">The Clause secures the defendant\u2019s interests in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(1) the finality of judgments,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (2) protection against multiple prosecutions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">If a trial ends in a judgment of acquittal, both interests are implicated, and there can be no retrial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This has been called \"the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence\u201d,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and is absolute. It applies whether the acquittal is based on findings of a judge or the verdict of a jury,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and whether it is erroneously based<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or brought about with the defendant\u2019s voluntary participation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Where, however, the trial or proceeding does not end in a judgment of acquittal or conviction, only the second interest is implicated, and the constitutional protections are not absolute. The defendant has an interest in avoiding harassment from repeated proceedings<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and in having his guilt de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>cided by the jury impaneled to try him.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The people, however, have a competing interest in having one complete opportunity to try those accused of breaking the law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Where there is no judgment of conviction or acquittal, these interests are balanced.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">If the trial or proceeding ends without the defendant\u2019s consent, further prosecution is generally barred; the defendant\u2019s \"valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> was taken from him, and reprosecution smacks of harassment. An exception is recognized, and retrial permitted, where \"manifest necessity\u201d compelled the termination of the first trial or proceeding.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Where the defendant himself brings about the termination of the proceeding on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, retrial is generally permitted.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The defendant, having deliberately chosen to take the case from the jury cannot complain of the loss of the first trier of fact or of prosecutorial harassment through multiple prosecutions; he must live with \"the consequences of his voluntary choice\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> An exception is made, and retrial barred, when the defendant\u2019s motion is induced by bad-faith conduct of the prosecutor or judge.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-3\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The prosecution contends that it is apparent from statements by the judge following acceptance of the guilty plea and dismissal of the murder charge that he merely found an abuse of discretion in the pretrial charging process. From this it argues that the trial did not end in an acquittal on the murder charges \u2014 there was no \"final judgment\u201d that Anderson has an interest in preserving; because the trial was terminated on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, with Anderson\u2019s cooperation and over prosecutorial objection, her interests are subordinate to those of the people; she cannot complain of harassment by multiple prosecution; the people seek only \"one fair opportunity\u201d to convict, which was wrongfully taken from it by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">We reject the premise of the people\u2019s argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>We conclude that the judge\u2019s action was an acquittal of the murder charges for double jeopardy purposes. No balancing of interests is required; reprosecution is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">To be sure, the judge did not say that he was directing a verdict, and no formal judgment of acquittal was entered. The determination of what the judge did, however, does not turn on how the judge characterizes his actions. \"[T]he trial judge\u2019s characterization of his own actions cannot control the classification of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> What constitutes an \"acquittal\u201d is not controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">To decide how a trial judge\u2019s action should be characterized, the reviewing court \"must determine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\u201d.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> There is an acquittal and retrial is impermissible when the judge \"evaluated the Government\u2019s evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction\u201d.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>We conclude that the judge\u2019s decision to accept Anderson\u2019s mid-trial plea and to dismiss the murder charge involved a resolution of factual elements of the offense charged, and was based on his belief, correct or incorrect, prematurely formed or not, that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In accepting Anderson\u2019s plea to manslaughter, the judge considered her factual guilt or innocence of that lesser offense. The judge examined Anderson to determine whether there was a factual basis for her plea. The judge found that she <em>had </em>committed manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The transcript convinces us that the judge chose to accept this plea to manslaughter because he concluded that Anderson <em>had not </em>committed murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The prosecution emphasizes the judge\u2019s statements that he was merely granting Anderson\u2019s pretrial motion to quash the information charging murder. But those statements were made only as an afterthought in response to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments and objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The judge expressed his belief that there is an exception to the <em>Genesee Prosecutor </em>cases when the prosecutor has abused his charging discretion and said that the exception \"does not apply\u201d \"to this case except to the following extent\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\"The court would find in this case <em>after hearing the testimony up to this time, </em>that the charge of murder should not have been made in this case; that the judge who conducted the examination in this case, if she had heard the testimony that <em>has been given in this court, </em>would not have bound the defendant over on the charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>of murder in the first degree and that this court, prior to the trial of the case, when considering a motion made by the defense to dismiss the case, would have dismissed the charges of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree <em>if the court had been </em>in possession of the facts <em>which this court has heard in this case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The judge proceeded to explain his understanding of the law of homicide, particularly the defenses of excuse and justification.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> On the basis of this understanding, he expressed his belief that the prosecution had not and could not overcome Anderson\u2019s assertion of a justification defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">\"The <em>people, nevertheless, in a case have the burden of proving that it was not a case of justi\u00f1cation, or excuse </em>\u2014 this has been held in a number of recent cases and the people must also prove a number of other exceptions to the law \u2014 that it was not an accident, for instance, and, in this particular case, we are dealing with the situation of a private citizen who took the law into her hands and killed another person \u2014 as she says \u2014enforcing the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">\"In determining whether the defendant was justified under these circumstances <em>the matter must be determined from the standpoint of the defendant in the case, not from the standpoint of the officers </em>\u2014 the officer in charge of the case, nor from the standpoint of the prosecutor, or the judge, but from her own honest intentions in a matter of this kind, and the court feels that there was \u2014 under these definitions, if the defendant had only used reasonable force in the case, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>would have been justified under the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\"><em>\"The reason that this court has accepted the plea of manslaughter in the ease is the fact that the court concludes that she did not limit herself to reasonable force in this case but that she went beyond reasonable force in the case, </em>and, therefore, committed the offense of manslaughter in this case, which is the crime as, for instance, where a policeman, in making an arrest, uses excessive force and commits a homicide \u2014 the crime is manslaughter and the same rule would apply to a citizen as in this case and, <em>accordingly, this court dismisses the </em>\u2014 court <em>grants Mr. Roth\u2019s motion \u00f1led prior to the trial of this case to dismiss to the extent that it applies to the charges of murder in the \u00f1rst degree and murder in the second degree, </em>leaving the charge of manslaughter to which the defendant has just pled guilty in this case.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">After the prosecutor objected that there was sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction and that he had two more res gestae witnesses that the court had not allowed to testify, the judge responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\"><em>\"[T]he court concluded that the people simply had not overcome their burden of proving that there was no excuse or provocation as to murder in the \u00f1rst and second degree </em>and, accordingly, the court would have had to eventually direct a verdict of not guilty on those two counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-8\">\"You are overlooking the fact that the law \u2014 it is clearly established that in determining matters of this kind, it must be looked at from the belief and position of the defendant, not the beliefs or position of the officers in the case or any other person, <em>and that the court, having heard witnesses called by the people in the case, was convinced that she was well justified in believing that there was an attempted rape in the </em>case.\"(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Another prosecutor then appeared to add his protest to that previously made. He also inquired whether \"by proffering this plea, and by the court accepting it, that the defense would waive any question of jeopardy that may arise in the substantive case?\u201d Defense counsel responded negatively. The judge then said \"that is a question that would properly have to be determined by the United States Supreme Court\u201d. He indicated that his decision was <em>not </em>based on an examination of the preliminary examination transcript, saying that he had felt that \"based on the testimony taken at the examination, that the prosecution was justified in taking the matter to trial without any reduced plea\u201d. He then added somewhat gratuitously that \"if the examining magistrate had heard the testimony that has been heard in this court that the defendant would not have been bound over for trial on the charge of first-degree murder in this case\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The . judge did not determine that there was a defective information or dismiss the murder charges on a ground unrelated to Anderson\u2019s guilt or innocence;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> he did not find an abuse of discretion by the examining magistrate or prosecutor. He determined, rather, that Anderson could assert a defense of excuse, that its merits must be assessed from the standpoint of her reasonable belief, and that, based on what he had heard at trial, the prosecution had not proved and could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not believe the killing was necessary to prevent the commission of a felony. The witnesses up to that point had not given testimony disproving excuse \"from the belief and position of the defendant\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>and the judge was convinced that testimony of the remaining witnesses would, for the same reason, be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">That ruling was a determination of Anderson\u2019s factual innocence of murder, although rested on questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The United States Supreme Court has held that an appellate ruling that there was insufficient evidence to rebut an insanity defense was \"a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,\u201d and thus an acquittal barring reprosecution.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Subsequently, commenting on that holding, the Court elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-7\">\"The defense of insanity, like the defense of entrapment, arises from 'the notion that Congress could not have intended criminal punishment for a defendant who has committed all the elements of a proscribed offense\u2019 * * * where other facts established to the satisfaction of the trier of fact provide a legally adequate justification for otherwise criminal acts. Such a factual finding <em>does </em>'necessarily establish the defendant\u2019s lack of criminal culpability\u2019 * * *. By contrast, the dismissal of an indictment for preindictment delay represents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">A defense of excuse or justification, like defenses of insanity or entrapment, \"necessarily establishes lack of culpability\u201d within the meaning of the passage just quoted, because it goes to the central issue of criminal intent.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It is irrelevant that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>resolution of the factual issue depended on rulings of law concerning the defense of excuse and justification.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Once it is determined that the judge resolved factual questions dispositive of elements of murder in Anderson\u2019s favor, it follows that retrial for murder is barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>Fong Foo v United States</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>highlights that the rule prohibiting retrial after acquittal is absolute. After three government witnesses had testified, and while a fourth was in the process of testifying, the trial judge directed verdicts of acquittal and entered formal judgments accordingly. He advanced two reasons for doing so: there was improper conduct on the part of the prosecutor and the witnesses lacked credibility. The Court of Appeals set aside the acquittals and ordered retrial. The Supreme Court reversed in a brief opinion, holding that because the trial terminated in final judgments of acquittal, government appeal was barred even though \"[t]he Court of Appeals thought, not without reason, that the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous founda<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>tion. Nevertheless, '[t]he verdict of acquittal was final, and could not be reviewed * * * without putting [the petitioners] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\u2019 <em>United States v </em>Ball 163 US 662, 671 [16 S Ct 1192; 41 L Ed 300 (1896)]\u201d.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In <em>Sanabria v United States, </em>437 US 54; 98 S Ct 2170; 57 L Ed 2d 43 (1978), where the judge excluded certain evidence and acquitted the defendant for evidentiary insufficiency, the Court, on the basis of <em>Fong Foo, </em>held that retrial was impermissible and observed that \"when a defendant has been acquitted at trial he may not be retried on the same offense, even if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous\u201d.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">In the instant case, the judge should have allowed the prosecution to present all of its witnesses. He could then have entertained a motion for a directed verdict. <em>Fong Foo </em>demonstrates, however, that a procedural error, even of this magnitude, does not change the finality of an acquittal, any more than would an erroneous determination on the elements of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Citing <em>United States v Scott, 437 US 82; </em>98 S Ct 2187; 57 L Ed 2d 65 (1978); <em>Lee v United States,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>United States v Dinitz,</em><footnotemark><em>38</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the people argue that retrial is permitted after a defendant causes or participates in termination of trial on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence. That argument, however, falls with its premise that the first trial was brought to a close \"on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The trial in <em>Dinitz </em>ended in a mistrial after the judge expelled one of the defendant\u2019s lawyers. In <em>Scott, </em>the indictment was dismissed because of preindictment delay. In <em>Lee, </em>the information failed to list all the elements of the offense charged.
