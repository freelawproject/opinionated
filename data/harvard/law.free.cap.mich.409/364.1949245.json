In <em>Richmond, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the right of the public and press to attend criminal trials is guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The result in this case is consistent with the result reached in <em>Richmond </em>and could now be predicated upon the holding in <em>Richmond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">In the instant case, the parties perfunctorily raised First-Amendment arguments. Our analysis consists of an alternate ground for decision to that contained in <em>Richmond </em>and is primarily based upon the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">The underlying issue before this Court is whether and upon what rationale a trial judge may exclude the public, including the press, from attendance at a criminal trial upon the affirmative waiver by defendant of the right to a public trial. Specifically in this case the question is: Did the trial judge act properly in issuing the order of exclusion?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">On the basis of common law and \u00a7 1420 of the Revised Judicature Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the public may not be excluded from a criminal trial without first giving full and fair consideration to the public\u2019s interests in maintaining an open proceeding. This conclusion is required even if the defendant waives his right to a public trial with the consent of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">A high school English teacher, a department head, was charged with criminal sexual conduct in the second degree under MCL 750.520c; MSA 28.788(3). The conduct charged allegedly occurred with a 14-year-old student in the school building during school hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Following the preliminary examination, on November 16, 1977, the trial judge, upon stipulation of counsel, issued an order suppressing all pretrial publicity in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Trial was scheduled to begin on February 3, 1978. On that day, just prior to the selection of a jury, a proceeding was held in chambers. Counsel for the teacher made a motion that the trial be closed to the public, giving the following as reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\"It is the defendant\u2019s position that this should be a closed trial and not a public one because of the possible impact on the community as a whole in terms of influencing cases of this kind; the possibility of influencing youngsters, teenagers in terms of bringing these kind <em>[sic] </em>of charges up against their teachers as a way of getting back at them. And, if publicized, this trial would influence youngsters not only towards authority figures themselves, but especially towards the teaching profession.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-5\">\"Also, we are concerned that [the teacher] * * * has a recognized status in the community and a public trial would do nothing but ruin that reputation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The prosecution made no objection to this request. Without providing an open hearing or stating reasons, the trial court issued an order excluding the public from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">On February 6, 1978, the Detroit Free Press and Susan Brown, the reporter assigned by the Free Press to the trial, filed a complaint for superintending control and a motion for immediate consideration with the Court of Appeals. Before the Court of Appeals could act, on February 7, 1978, the trial was concluded, with the jury returning a verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Recognizing that the conclusion of the trial rendered the application for superintending control moot, the Court of Appeals treated the application as one for leave to appeal and granted leave. The Free Press then filed an application with this Court for leave to appeal from the Court of Appeals prior to decision by that Court. On May 1, 1978, we granted leave to appeal. 402 Mich 926 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">At first blush, it appears that this Court\u2019s hold<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ing in <em>Detroit Free Press v Macomb Circuit Judge, </em>405 Mich 544; 275 NW2d 482 (1979), would be dispositive of the issue raised in the instant case. In <em>Macomb Circuit Judge, </em>which was a case remarkably similar to the case at bar, we opined: \"The parties may not, by their mere agreement, empower a judge to exclude the public and press\u201d. <em>Macomb Circuit Judge, supra, </em>549. Our decision in that case rested upon \u00a7 1420 of the RJA, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\"><em>\"The sittings of every court within this state shall be public </em>except that a court may, for good cause shown, exclude from the courtroom other witnesses in the case when they are not testifying and may, in actions involving scandal or immorality, exclude all minors from the courtroom unless the minor is a party or witness. This section shall not apply to cases involving national security.\u201d (Emphasis added.) MCL 600.1420; MSA 27A.1420.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">While we think that our narrow, statutorily based holding in <em>Macomb Circuit Judge </em>is equally applicable here, respondent maintains that \u00a7 1420 is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Respondent asserts that the language of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \"In all criminal prosecutions, the <em>accused </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial\u201d, and the language of Article 1, \u00a7 20, Michigan Constitution of 1963, \"In every criminal prosecution, the <em>accused </em>shall have the right to a speedy and public trial\u201d, vests the right to a public trial in the accused and the accused alone.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>right to public trial could be affirmatively waived as can other substantive rights enjoyed by the accused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">\n<em>Common-Law Origins of the Right to Public Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Although the exact origin of the tradition of holding trials in public is unknown, it is clear that the tradition has existed for a long time and enjoyed a favored position in the English common-law courts. One of the first commentators to note the fact that trials in England were held publicly was Sir Thomas Smith in his book <em>De Rep\u00fablica Anglorum, </em>published in 1583. Smith commented:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\"Evidences of writinges be shewed [to the jury], witnesses be sworne, and heard before them not after the fashion of the civill law but openly, that not only the xii, the Judges, the parties and as many as be present may heare what ech witnesse doeth say.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\"All the rest is doone openlie in the presence of the Judges, the Justices, the enquest, the prisoner, and so manie as will or can come so neare as to heare it.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>A later commentator, Sir Matthew Hale, writing in 1670, not only lauded the fact that trials were held publicly but also gave substantive reasons for the desirability of such a practice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\"Ninthly, the excellency of this Open course of evidence to the jury, in presence of the judge, jury, parties and counsel, and even of the adverse witnesses, appears in these particulars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\"1st, That it is openly, and not in private before a commissioner or two, and a couple of clerks; where, oftentimes witnesses will deliver that, which they will be ashamed to testify publicly.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">It is clear that at the time Smith and Hale were writing, the right to a public trial was one which inhered in the public and was not a right enjoyed by the accused. While the public was encouraged and often required to attend trials,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the accused possessed few substantive rights and could hardly be said to benefit from a public trial. One historian noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\"(1) The prisoner was kept in confinement more or less secret till his trial, and could not prepare for his defence. He was examined, and his examination was taken down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-10\">\"(2) He had no notice beforehand of the evidence against him, and was compelled to defend himself as well as he could when the evidence, written or oral, was produced on his trial. He had no counsel either before or at the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-11\">\"(5) It does not appear that the prisoner was allowed to call witnesses on his own behalf; but it matters little whether he was or not; as he had no means of ascer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>tabling what evidence they would give, or of procuring their attendance. In later times they were not examined on oath, if they were called.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Various reasons have been given as to why the English courts developed a system of holding trials in public. Although there is no entirely satisfactory explanation, one of the commonly accepted reasons for this practice was the distrust of secret trials fostered by the abuses of the Spanish Inquisition,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the English Court of Star Chamber<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the French monarchy\u2019s <em>lettre de cachet. </em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AU5\">The common-law system of open and public trials was hailed by the early English commentators. Both Blackstone and Wigmore viewed the \"open forum\u201d as a natural check on possible abuse of judicial power. They also emphasized that public trials could enlighten the public about their government and enhance respect for judicial remedies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But, as Jeremy Bentham declared, the most resounding theme was the important role that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>publicity could have in insuring fairness and preventing abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-6\">\"Without publicity, all other checks are insufficient: in comparison with publicity, all other checks are of small account. Recordation, appeal, whatever other institutions might present themselves in the character of checks, would be found to operate rather as cloaks than checks \u2014 as cloaks in reality, as checks only in appearance.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Publicity, Bentham declared, \"is the soul of justice\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">\n<em>The Public Trial Concept: The American Development</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">The \"open court-open trial\u201d concept developed early in the American system of jurisprudence. One of the earliest expressions of the public trial right is found in the \"Frame of Government of Pennsylvania of 1682\u201d, a document signed by William Penn. The document proclaimed the following guarantees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-11\">\"V. That all courts shall be open, and justice shall neither be sold, denied nor delayed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">\"VI. That, in all courts all persons of all persuasions may freely appear in their own way, and according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>their own manner, and there personally plead their own cause themselves; or, if unable, by their friends.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The Colonies fully adopted the concept of conducting criminal trials in public. There is no evidence to suggest that Colonial courts recognized that an accused may require that his trial be private.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">At the first Congress of the United States, James Madison proposed to the drafters of the Bill of Rights that a provision be included providing for public trials. This proposal was codified in the Sixth Amendment guarantee that 'Tn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial\u201d. Following the Federal model, all states recognize the right to public trial either by constitutional provision, statute or judicial interpretation.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Although the language of the Sixth Amendment public trial guarantee may seem clear and unambiguous, interpretative problems have arisen regarding the dimensions of the right. Courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>wrestled with problems such as the extent an accused can invoke the right of public trial; whether the right is one which belongs to the accused alone or is one which the accused shares coextensively with any or all of the public who choose to attend a trial; and what limitations, if any, a court can impose on public attendance at a trial. Resolution of these problems has been difficult and on occasion has produced contrary results.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">From a literal standpoint, the Sixth Amendment provides the right to a public trial to \"the accused\u201d. Based on this provision, the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>In re Oliver, </em>333 US 257; 68 S Ct 499; 92 L Ed 682 (1948), makes clear that the trial and conviction of an accused in secret, even in a contempt proceeding, will be grounds for reversal. The <em>Oliver </em>Court recognized that our public trial guarantee \"has its roots in our English common law heritage\u201d. Citing both the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\"In view of this nation\u2019s historic distrust of secret proceedings, their inherent dangers to freedom, and the universal requirement of our federal and state governments that criminal trials be public, the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that no one shall be deprived of his liberty without due process of law means at least that an accused cannot be thus [in the secrecy of the judge\u2019s chambers] sentenced to prison.\u201d <em>Oliver, supra, </em>273.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Amplifying the <em>Oliver </em>decision, the United States Court of Appeals in <em>United States v Kobli, </em>172 F2d 919, 923 (CA 3, 1949), declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">\"[T]he Sixth Amendment precludes the general indiscriminate exclusion of the public from the trial of a criminal case in a federal court over the objection of the defendant * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Emphasizing the importance of the constitutional right involved, the <em>Kobli </em>court opined that an accused who was denied the right to a public trial need not show any actual prejudice to obtain a reversal of the conviction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\" '[Violation of the constitutional right necessarily implies prejudice, and more than that need not appear. Furthermore, it would be difficult, if not impossible, in such cases for a defendant to point to any definite, personal injury. To require him to do so would impair or destroy the safeguard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kobli, supra, </em>921.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">The Sixth Amendment public trial guarantee, however, does not vest absolute rights in the accused. While the accused has the right to demand a public trial to insure fairness and to prevent judicial abuse, the accused possesses no corresponding right to compel a private trial. <em>Singer v United States, </em>380 US 24, 35; 85 S Ct 783; 13 L Ed 2d 630 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">In <em>Singer, </em>the Court rejected the argument that since the accused possessed the constitutional right to a jury trial, he had an absolute right to demand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>a bench trial. In that case the Court reviewed the English common-law and Colonial practice. It was concluded that history failed to establish an independent right in the accused to be tried by a judge alone. Thus, the accused was not empowered by the Sixth Amendment to compel the opposite of what he was specifically guaranteed by the Constitution. \"The ability to waive a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist upon the opposite of that right. For example, although a defendant can, under some circumstances, waive his constitutional right to a public trial, he has no absolute right to compel a private trial.\u201d <em>Singer, supra, </em>34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Similar reasoning was applied by the <em>Singer </em>Court involving other Sixth Amendment rights. It was reasoned that although the accused \"can waive his right to be tried in the State and district where the crime was committed, he cannot in all cases compel transfer of the case to another district\u201d. <em>Singer, supra, </em>35. Also, while he \"can waive his right to be confronted by the witnesses against him\u201d, he cannot compel the prosecutor \"to try the case by stipulation\u201d. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Furthermore, in a different context, the Sixth Amendment has been held to implicate interests beyond those of the accused. In <em>Barker v Wingo, </em>407 US 514; 92 S Ct 2182; 33 L Ed 2d 101 (1972), with respect to the right to a speedy trial, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\"In addition to the general concern that all accused persons be treated according to decent and fair procedures, there is a societal interest in providing a speedy trial which exists separately from, and at times in opposition to, the interests of the accused.\u201d <em>Barker, supra, </em>519.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>It is thus clear that our English heritage, Colonial American tradition and recent constitutional case interpretations provide no basis on which to predicate a constitutional right in favor of an accused to close a criminal trial by simply waiving his right to a public trial. Furthermore, a careful study of common-law tradition reveals that the public-trial concept developed primarily for the benefit of the public. It is basic to a free and open society that public access to trials be maintained. The societal interests served by this principle are separate from and at times may be in opposition to the interests of the accused. The accused, therefore, cannot waive his right to a public trial in absolute derogation of the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The interests of society in having access to criminal trials usually are compatible with the interests of an accused. Yet, this by no means diminishes the interest the public has in seeing that justice is administered openly and publicly. A New York Federal District Court in <em>United States v </em>Lopez, 328 F Supp 1077, 1087 (ED NY, 1971), poignantly elucidated the important societal interests that are protected by the public-trial guarantee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\"The public has an independent right to be present to see that justice is fairly done. It is important that our citizens be free to observe court proceedings to insure a sense of confidence in the judicial process. Conducting trials behind closed doors might engender an apprehension and distrust of the legal system which would, in the end, destroy its ability to peacefully settle disputes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Additionally, because a criminal prosecution is brought in the very name of the people, the public has a substantial interest in seeing that its concerns are adequately represented. The Kentucky Court of Appeals has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\"It is insisted by some the right to public trial is solely for the benefit of the criminal defendant and if he has no objection to a closed trial then the public should not be permitted to object. This contention overlooks the fact that the public is a party to all criminal proceedings. The proceeding is prosecuted in the name of the public. In our opinion there is nothing that better protects the rights of the public than their presence in proceedings where these rights are on trial.\u201d <em>Johnson v Simpson, </em>433 SW2d 644, 646 (Ky, 1968).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Further, since one of the purposes of the public trial guarantee is the protection against perjury, the public has an equally important interest in assuring that criminal prosecutions are decided on truthful and complete records. Certainly, the defendant would prefer an open proceeding to insure that perjured testimony is not brought against him. But the presence of the public also insures that no favoritism is afforded the defendant and protects against perjury by the defendant and his witnesses. It extends assurance that the appearance of justice is maintained. <em>United States v Cianfrani, </em>573 F2d 835, 852-853 (CA 3, 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In addition, the public\u2019s concern extends to the actions of its legal officers, the judge and prosecutor. In Michigan these officials are elected, which adds a dimension to the societal interests involved. The performance of essential responsibilities by these officials during criminal trials should be open to public evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Although an accused has no right to trial closure, in rare specific circumstances, limitations have been placed upon public access to criminal proceedings. Although there is support for the proposition that the court has a duty to provide facilities for a reasonable number of the public, <em>Estes v Texas, </em>381 US 532, 584; 85 S Ct 1628; 14 L Ed 2d 543 (1965) (Warren, C.J., concurring), it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>generally agreed that the size of the courtroom may justifiably limit attendance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Note, <em>The Right to a Public Trial in Criminal Cases, 41 </em>NYU L Rev 1138, 1144 (1966). Likewise, in the interest of fairness, a court can exclude from the courtroom members of the public who are creating physical disturbances or causing potentially dangerous situations. E <em>W Scripps Co v Fulton, </em>100 Ohio App 157, 169; 125 NE2d 896 (1955). And, also, in the name of what is termed \"public health or morals\u201d, courts have allowed exclusion of minors in trials involving sexual matters. <em>Kobli, supra, </em>922.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The limitations imposed are few in number and, for the most part, are required to effectuate the essential dignity and the integrity of the trial process. <em>Craig v Harney, </em>331 US 367, 377; 67 S Ct 1249; 91 L Ed 1546 (1947); <em>People v Greeson, </em>230 Mich 124, 147; 203 NW 141 (1925). In those rare instances where this integrity is compromised by the creation of a \"zoo atmosphere\u201d, the result may be reversal of a criminal conviction. <em>Sheppard v Maxwell, </em>384 US 333; 86 S Ct 1507; 16 L Ed 2d 600 (1966); <em>Estes, supra. </em>In those cases it was determined that the media severely intruded upon court decorum. And on the few occasions where extensive publicity mandated reversal in favor of a defendant, media coverage gave inordinately wide dissemination of critical information at crucial times. <em>Rideau v Louisiana, </em>373 US 723; 83 S Ct 1417; 10 L Ed 2d 663 (1963); <em>Irvin v Dowd, </em>366 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>717; 81 S Ct 1639; 6 L Ed 2d 751 (1961); <em>Sheppard v Maxwell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">During this past year the Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 split opinion, held that the public has no affirmative constitutional right of access to a criminal <em>pretrial proceeding. Gannett Co, Inc v DePasquale, </em>443 US 368; 99 S Ct 2898; 61 L Ed 2d 608 (1979). The Court reasoned that publicity concerning pretrial suppression hearings poses special risks of unfairness because potential jurors may be informed of inculpatory information inadmissible at trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In the instant case, however, we are dealing with closure of the trial itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Our tracing of the historical development of the public trial concept causes us to reject the contention of respondent in this case. While in its inception at common law the public trial right was established for the benefit of the public alone, it later developed to include protections for the accused. These protections or benefits conferred by the Sixth Amendment and Article 1, \u00a720, of the Michigan Constitution include freedom from judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>cial or prosecutorial oppression, freedom from perjured testimony, and an assurance of basic fairness because transactions occur openly and publicly.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">But in providing these protections to the accused, there was no intent to denigrate the interests of the public which are at the root of the public-trial guarantee. The very public itself has a substantial interest in assuring that justice is openly and fairly meted out in its name. The public must also be confident that its judicial representatives do not abuse the power which the public confers upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">While it is obvious that there are practical limitations on the ability of large numbers of the public to attend a trial, this should by no means inhibit the public\u2019s interest in being informed. In this regard, the public must depend upon a vigorous press to keep it advised, as Justice White has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\"In the first place, in a society in which each individual has but limited time and resources with which to observe at first hand the operations of his government, he relies necessarily upon the press to bring him in convenient form the facts of those operations. * * * With respect to judicial proceedings in particular, the function of the press serves to guarantee the fairness of trials and to bring to bear the beneficial effects of public scrutiny upon the administration of justice.\u201d <em>Cox Broadcasting Corp v Cohn, </em>420 US 469, 491-492; 95 S Ct 1029; 43 L Ed 2d 328 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Thus, the press, as a segment of the public, acts to assist the whole public in guaranteeing the openness and integrity of the trial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The trial participants, including the judge, may not necessarily appreciate or fully recognize the fundamental societal interests. Upon occasion the tactics of a defendant and prosecutor may coincide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>to demand closure. Perhaps due to indifference or mere timidity one party may accede by stipulation to a request by the other to hold a secret trial. Who, then, may truly stand to protect the people\u2019s interest to know? We are convinced that this principle, deeply rooted in the common law, may be asserted by members of the public when deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We have concluded that an accused has no right to exclude the public from a trial by affirmative waiver. However, we further recognize, under extraordinary circumstances to preserve the due process right of a fair trial, an accused may request that the public\u2019s access to a trial be limited or temporarily denied. Upon such rare occasion, the court must exercise its discretion in balancing competing interests. The judge must always carefully balance the fundamental common-law principle of open trials with the specific unusual circumstance that allegedly endangers a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">An accused who seeks closure has the heavy burden to show by a substantial probability that prejudicial error denying the accused a fair trial will result from proceeding in public. In addition, it must be shown by a substantial probability that closure will be effective in dealing with the danger and no alternatives to closure exist that would protect the fair trial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The accused here would, in effect, limit the public\u2019s ability to attend and participate in the trial process. Not only would this limitation befall the public in general but also the press in particular. We find such limitation untenable. We are not unaware that one wrongfully accused can suffer acute embarrassment and damage to reputation through the trial process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, because it is not only the accused who has interests in the tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>process, any limitation on the public\u2019s right to attend a trial must adhere to a standard that there is a substantial probability that prejudicial error denying the accused a fair trial will result.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Furthermore, in Michigan, this common-law principle of public access to trials has been codified by legislative pronouncement.

There was no full and fair consideration given to the public\u2019s interests in maintaining an open proceeding by the court prior to ordering the trial closed. Therefore, the order entered by the trial court excluding the public from attending the trial is reversed.

That case involved whether members of the press and public have a constitutional right of access to attend criminal <em>pretrial hearings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">Although the lead opinion of Mr. Justice Stewart could be read to apply to trials as well as pretrial exclusionary proceedings, Chief Justice Burger\u2019s concurring opinion clearly recognized a distinction.

The United States Supreme Court held that the right of the public and press to attend criminal trials is guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b487-9\"> It is well recognized that although an accused has the right to a jury trial, such right may be waived. <em>People v Stoeckl, </em>347 Mich 1; 78 NW2d 640 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">However, it has been also recognized that absolute deference need not be accorded an accused\u2019s waiver of his right to trial by jury. In <em>Singer v United States, </em>380 US 24; 85 S Ct 783; 13 L Ed 2d 630 (1965), the Court rejected the contention that an accused had an absolute right to waive his jury trial right and to be tried by a judge alone.

(Footnotes and citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">We have intentionally delayed the release of our decision in this case for months, awaiting the decision in <em>Richmond Newspapers, supra, </em>suspecting the decision in that case would control resolution of the issue before us. Just as suspected, <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>is squarely on point and, in my view, is dispositive of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The majority of this Court, however, while acknowledging <em>Richmond Newspapers, </em>has held merely that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">\"On the basis of common law and \u00a7 1420 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>Revised Judicature Act, we conclude that the public may not be excluded from a criminal trial without first giving full and fair consideration to the public\u2019s interests in maintaining an open proceeding.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Therefore, notwithstanding that the factual similarities of <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>and this case render the two cases jurisprudentially indistinguishable, the majority holds that the public has a mere <em>interest </em>in access to criminal trials based upon the common law and the statute, and declines to recognize a <em>constitutional right </em>of access under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Although declaring that the \"result in this case is consistent with the result reached in <em>Richmond </em>and could now be predicated upon the holding in Richmond\u201d, the majority prefers \"an alternate ground for decision\u201d and thus declines to hold that the Detroit Free Press and its representatives, and indeed the entire public, have the same constitutional rights as do the Richmond Newspaper and its representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">While no reason is stated for that preference, my colleagues\u2019 opinion suggests, but certainly does not state, that the disinclination to recognize the plaintiffs constitutional right to attend criminal trials is because the parties before us only \"perfunctorily raised First-Amendment arguments\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">While it is true that the appellant\u2019s claim that the public has a constitutional right to attend criminal trials was based upon the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, nevertheless the appellants stated four separate times in their brief that the public\u2019s right to be present at such trials was also guaranteed, \"arguably, by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>First Amendment\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the appellee Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, in his answering brief, four times acknowledged that the appellant was relying on an \"arguable\u201d First Amendment claim and indeed explicitly asserted that \"neither the First nor the Sixth Amendments to the Federal Constitution gives the public or the press a right to be present at the trial of a criminal defendant\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Thus, while the parties were principally concerned with an asserted Sixth Amendment constitutional right to attend criminal trials, the appellant raised an \"arguable\u201d First Amendment claim, if only as a secondary argument, and the appellee specifically replied to it. In any event, the resolution of this case is governed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution as it is made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. The United States Supreme Court has said as much in <em>Richmond Newspapers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The parties before us have been waiting a year and a half for our decision. We purposely delayed its release, awaiting United States Supreme Court guidance on the question in the <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>case. We have that guidance now and we should follow it. Surely we cannot have laid aside this case for months awaiting <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>merely in order to acknowledge its release, declare we could have predicated today\u2019s <em>result </em>upon it, and otherwise ignore its precedent-shattering holding. In my view, the route taken by my colleagues assures the irrelevance of today\u2019s decision and fuels the increasingly widespread notion that state courts cannot be depended upon to adequately address and resolve cases involving major Federal constitutional issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>If it is thought that there is any conceivable basis upon which this case can be distinguished from <em>Richmond Newspapers, </em>or that the rule of that case should not be applied until the parties before us have further addressed the issues, an order might enter requiring them to file typewritten supplemental briefs within 30 days addressing the applicability of <em>Richmond Newspapers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In my view, however, even that is not necessary. I would hold that under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, the public, including representatives of the press, have a constitutional right to attend criminal trials.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> Appellant\u2019s brief, pp 10,16, 25 and 27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> Appellee\u2019s brief, p 16.
