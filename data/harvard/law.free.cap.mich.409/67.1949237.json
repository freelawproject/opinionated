Williams commenced this action in circuit court against the administrator of Garnett\u2019s estate, Steven A. Grossman, and others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> within the three-year limitational period, but over two years after an order had been entered in the probate court closing the estate. No notice of the hearing on claims or of the pendency of probate proceedings had been given to Williams other than such as is provided by newspaper publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The circuit judge granted Grossman\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment on the ground that Williams had failed to file a claim in the probate estate or to commence this action before the estate was closed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">We granted leave to appeal to consider whether a person having a cause of action for negligence against a decedent is entitled to notice, in addition to whatever notice is provided by newspaper publication, of the time for filing and the hearing on claims against the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We subsequently asked the parties to file supplemental briefs on \"[w]hether <em>In re Curzenski Estate, </em>384 Mich 334 [183 NW2d 220] (1971), should: (a) be overruled and, if so, (b) whether there is any need to reach and decide the issue of whether probate court notice procedures are constitutionally [adequate]\u201d. In that case this Court declared that an action cannot be commenced directly against the personal representative of an estate after it has been closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We overrule <em>In re Curzenski Estate. </em>Although the probate of an estate has been completed and the estate closed, where a person has an action which by statute may be commenced directly against the personal representative of the decedent without first filing a claim against his probate estate,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the administration of the estate is \"incomplete\u201d within the meaning of the statute and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>petition the estate may be reopened<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to provide a suable person so that the action can be commenced. Because the person having the right of action has not filed a claim in the probate proceeding (or, before it was closed, notice of suit pending), recovery of money damages is limited to sources other than assets of the probate estate theretofore distributed, <em>e.g., </em>to sources such as the estate\u2019s right of indemnification from an insurer or the obligation of the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to compensate victims of uninsured drivers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">We see no need to decide whether notice should have been given to known creditors<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 the issue on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>which we first granted leave to appeal. All the assets of this probate estate have been distributed to Will Garnett, Jr. Although he was named as a defendant in this action, he has not been served; accordingly, a determination that notice should have been given could not be the basis of a money judgment against him. Nor, considering the state of the law and the practice at the time of the asserted failure to give notice, would such a determination justify a personal judgment against the former fiduciary for failing to give such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">While a person with a cause of action in negligence against a decedent may file a claim in the probate court, this is rarely, if ever, done.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">A statute, which in general bars actions against the personal representative of a decedent, permits commencement of an action for negligence,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and provides that if the plaintiff files notice of suit pending in the probate court the assignment of property to heirs and payment of most debts shall be deferred until the litigation is concluded.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>This Court has held that the statute makes \"it optional upon the part of a claimant to file a claim based upon a tort in the probate court or file a tort action in the circuit court\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">While a person asserting that he has been damaged by a decedent\u2019s negligence may thus submit his claim to the probate court, ordinarily a negligence action is commenced in district, common pleas or circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The principal source for recovery of judgments rendered in automobile negligence cases is automobile liability insurance, not other assets of the defendant or of his estate. When the defendant dies and his estate is probated, notices of suit pending often, it appears perhaps even ordinarily, are not filed in the probate proceeding. The probate of the estate proceeds apace without regard to any automobile negligence action pending against the decedent or the personal representative of his estate. The estate is fully administered, creditors are paid and assets are distributed to heirs although the negligence action is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">An action against a decedent is maintained by naming his personal representative as the defendant. If administration has not been sought by a spouse or other family member, a creditor may seek to have an administrator appointed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">In the instant case, an administrator was appointed on June 22, 1972, and the estate was closed 8-1/2 months later on March 6, 1973, less than one year after the automobile accident on March 19, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">A section of the Probate Code permits reopening an estate for the purpose of administering \"after discovered assets <em>or </em>to complete the administration of the same in case said estate was closed without being fully administered by the fiduciary or court * * *: Provided, however, That the failure of a claimant to file a claim against said estate during the original administration thereof shall not be a cause for reopening the same or for the appointment of a successor fiduciary\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In <em>Kangas v Lefko, </em>369 Mich 341; 119 NW2d 645 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>(1963), the facts paralleled this case except the estate there had not been \"closed\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Plaintiff was injured in an automobile accident and the driver of the other automobile was killed. The estate of the driver was fully administered, the final account was approved, the administrator was discharged, but words to the effect that \"the estate is closed\u201d were not included in the order. Over four months later,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the plaintiff sought to have the estate reopened. The motion was granted and a negligence action was commenced. Also, a claim was filed in the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">In affirming the denial of a motion to dismiss the action, two justices relied on alternative grounds: (i) a claim was filed with the probate court within 18 months of the time originally fixed for the presentation of claims and before the estate was closed,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (ii) the action had been commenced in the circuit court while the estate was still open. Three justices, stating their agreement in the result, said that a negligence action \"depends on no claim filed in probate\u201d, <em>id., </em>p 344, and that the only question was whether there was a legally suable defendant and held that there was one because the estate was still open: \"the estate has not as yet been closed for want of a probate order of closing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 345.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In <em>In re Curzenski Estate, supra, </em>the estate had been closed. While that case might be distin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>guished on its facts,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> this Court declared that ordinarily<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> no action may be commenced in the circuit court against a decedent after the estate is closed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court said that liability insurance is not an \"after discovered asset\u201d and therefore a closed estate may not be reopened on that basis.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">We are persuaded that probate and closing of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>estate should not bar an action that may yet, within the applicable statute of limitation, be commenced directly against the personal representative of the decedent. Just as the failure of heirs to probate a decedent\u2019s estate does not preclude the commencement of an action, neither should the closing of an estate preclude the commencement of an action which otherwise is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The result reached in <em>Curzenski </em>is not consistent with the provision of the Probate Code authorizing the commencement of actions directly against the decedent\u2019s personal representative. The question before us does not concern the time or procedure for filing claims against the probate estate but, rather, the means of providing a suable defendant for an action which the statute authorizes to be commenced directly against the decedent\u2019s personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The section of the statute authorizing the reopening of a closed estate provides that the failure of a \"claimant\u201d to file a \"claim\u201d against the estate during the original administration thereof \"shall not be a cause\u201d for reopening it. Williams is not, however, a \"claimant\u201d seeking to reopen the estate for the purpose of filing a claim payable out of probate assets, but, rather, seeks its reopening so that she can file an action against the decedent\u2019s personal representative in an attempt to vindicate her right to proceed against him directly with a view to reaching assets other than those of the probate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">The statute (see fn 9 for text) provides that an action of ejectment or to recover the possession of real estate and actions of replevin and trespass on the case (negligence) and any other action in which the decedent might have been properly joined with others as a party defendant may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>commenced directly against the personal representative of the decedent, without requiring the filing of a claim against the decedent\u2019s probate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">While it has been said that probate will not ordinarily be granted unless there are \"assets of some actual value upon which the proceedings can operate\u201d,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a decedent\u2019s right to be indemnified under a policy of insurance may be deemed an asset for this purpose.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">A person who has obtained a judgment for negligence may be able to collect it without regard to whether the defendant has \"assets\u201d or is financially responsible. Even if he is insolvent or bankrupt,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> his insurer must nevertheless defend the action and pay if a judgment is rendered for plaintiff. Similarly, the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund is obliged to pay if a judgment is rendered against an insolvent uninsured motorist.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>A negligence action can thus be maintained although the defendant is a pauper, and a pauper\u2019s estate may be probated solely to create a suable defendant to realize on the pauper\u2019s right of indemnification from his insurer or to enable maintenance of an action against a known uninsured driver with a view to payment by the MVACF.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">By reason of <em>Curzenski, </em>however, if a fiduciary has closed the estate of the pauper or of a man of wealth, another plaintiff, perhaps asserting a claim arising out of the same tortious act which prompted probate, cannot maintain an action even though there may be several years left to run in the statute of limitation. The effect of the closing of the estate may, as here, be to shorten the three-year statute of limitation generally applicable to negligence actions<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to less than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">A person having a cause of action for negligence may commence an action at any time within the three-year period although the defendant has died and his estate has been fully probated with any assets distributed, as long as it has not been closed, and look to the decedent\u2019s insurer or the MVACF for recovery. If the estate has been \"closed\u201d, however, a person with a cause of action may not, because of <em>Curzenski, </em>commence an action and recover from an insurer or the MVACF, although the action is filed within the three-year limitational period and although no recovery is sought from the heirs or other creditors paid with assets of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The purpose of the non-claim provisions of the Probate Code<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> is to facilitate the administration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>estates, the payment of creditors and the distribution of assets to heirs and legatees. Relieving insurers and the MVACF on a random basis of their obligations does not serve any apparent legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The distinction between decedents whose estates have not been probated at all or whose estates have not been closed, on the one hand, and those whose estates have been probated and closed, on the other, serves no interest of the decedent\u2019s heirs, creditors, personal representative or probate estate or of the probate court. It does not appear that there is any legislative purpose to relieve fortuitously a decedent\u2019s insurer of its contractual obligations or the MVACF of its statutory obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The non-claim provisions are a part of the procedure established for determining claims against the personal representative where payment is sought out of assets which must be probated. That procedure is not mandatory where certain causes of action are asserted and the circumstances are such that any recovery does not depend on assets which must be probated; in such a case the statute permits an action to be maintained directly against the personal representative. The right to proceed in this manner cannot be exercised unless there is a personal representative against whom the suit may be brought. Providing such a personal representative is therefore part of the business of administering an estate. Administration is not complete as long as a person has a cause of action he can yet bring by suing a personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">The <em>Curzenski </em>construction of the statute serves no purpose of the non-claim provision of the Probate Code and frustrates the provision of the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ute authorizing the commencement of actions directly against the decedent\u2019s personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We conclude that the administration of a decedent\u2019s estate is \"incomplete\u201d, within the meaning of the statute, to the extent a person may yet commence an action against the decedent\u2019s personal representative under the statute. Upon request of a person asserting a cause of action that may be so maintained, a closed estate shall be reopened so that an action may be commenced against a successor fiduciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">In the instant case a petition to probate Gar-nett\u2019s estate was filed by Williams within the three-year statute of limitation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The petition was denied when it developed that the estate had previously been probated and closed. Because of <em>Curzenski </em>no useful purpose would have been served by filing a petition to reopen the estate. This action against Grossman, the former personal representative of Garnett\u2019s closed estate, and the other defendants was commenced within the three-year limitational period.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">In the circumstances of this case, we see nothing to be gained by remanding to the probate court for the appointment of a successor fiduciary. Pursuant to GCR 1963, 865, providing that this Court may \"make any order which ought to have been given or made\u201d, we treat Williams\u2019 petition for adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tration as a petition to reopen the decedent\u2019s estate and order Grossman appointed the successor fiduciary, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>so that there was a suable person. This action was duly and timely commenced when he was served.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">There is no need to decide in the instant case whether the personal representative of a decedent must give notice by mail to known creditors of the decedent. Even if we were to hold that a tort claimant is entitled to such notice in addition to whatever notice newspaper publication provides and that the estate should not have been closed without such notice, such a determination would not, considering the state of the law and the practice at the time of the asserted failure to give notice, justify a personal judgment against Gross-man for failing to give such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Personal representatives could reasonably rely on the past practice of not giving such notice. Courts generally have held that the <em>Mullane</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>doctrine does not apply to probate estates.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>Fjerstad Estate</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>was decided before this estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>was closed. It has not been the practice of the probate courts to require such notice to be sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The only remedy which <em>might </em>be appropriate would be to order that Will Garnett, Jr., who received the assets of the probate estate, reimburse the plaintiff. But Garnett, although named as a defendant, does not appear to have been served<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and therefore any declaration by us on the notice issue would not be binding on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Our colleague criticizes our suggesting on our own initiative an alternative basis of disposition and ordering further briefing. We did so to avoid deciding the adequacy of present probate court notice procedures in a case where the claimant cannot recover out of or in respect to the assets of a probate estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">We reverse and remand to the circuit court for trial. Costs to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Coleman, C.J., and Kavanagh, Williams, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> The other defendants are the City of Detroit, the Penn Central Railroad Company, and decedent\u2019s father, Will Garnett, Jr. The automobile hit an abutment of a viaduct of the railroad. It was claimed that the city and railroad had taken inadequate precautions to safeguard the traveling public in respect' to the abutment. The residue of the estate, $6,794.70, was distributed to Will Garnett, Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">An accelerated judgment was entered in favor of the city because of the failure to commence the action within two years. The equal protection challenge to the validity of that limitation was decided adversely to Williams\u2019 contentions in <em>Forest v Parmalee, </em>402 Mich 348; 262 NW2d 653 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-9\"> Grossman also relied on the three month limitation on rehearing a probate court order.

That factual issue was not framed by the motion for accelerated judgment. There is no supporting affidavit directed to that issue. Since the factual issue of whether Williams or her claim or her intention to file a claim was known to Grossman was not framed by Grossman\u2019s motion, Williams was not obliged to respond to that factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">It appears from the probate court file that Grossman was in possession of records which revealed the existence of Williams and the likelihood that she had a cause of action for negligence against the decedent. Grossman\u2019s final accounting with the probate court charges the estate with the cost of obtaining a copy of the Detroit Police Department accident report. The accident report, a public record, shows Williams to have been a passenger in the decedent\u2019s automobile when it struck the abutment causing his death, and states her residential address. It also appears to indicate that she was taken to a hospital. The medical examiner\u2019s report, included in the accident report, indicates that the decedent was intoxicated. See <em>Hubenschmidt v Shears, </em>403 Mich 486; 270 NW2d 2 (1978). It is a reasonable inference that a passenger in a one-car accident which caused the driver\u2019s death within an hour and a half has suffered some injury and has a cause of action against the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">It thus appears that Grossman may have been on notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>Williams might assert a cause of action and had an address to which notice of the time for filing claims and of the hearing on claims could have been sent.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Our disposition makes it unnecessary to remand for fact-finding on the issue whether Williams was a known creditor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\"> An action for negligence is referred to in the statute (see fn 9, <em>infra) </em>under its historic appellation, as an action for trespass on the case.

It is that our courts must decide them as if no liability insurance existed. Any liability which accrued against a decedent during his lifetime became <em>his </em>liability, whether he had that liability insured or not. When he dies his fiduciary must respond whether the injured person has or has not sued before the death occurred. Hence, if the person injured has not sued prior to the death, and has not made timely claim against the decedent\u2019s estate or commenced timely suit against the latter\u2019s fiduciary (see <em>Kangas v Lefko, </em>[369 Mich 341; 119 NW2d 645 (1963)]), no remedy survives save upon some showing of fraud committed by any one or severed whom equity may hold responsible for the consequences of that fraud.

Not satisfied to address the issue for which leave was granted, the Court subsequently issued a supplemental order requesting the parties to brief the issues \"[w]hether <em>In re Curzenski Estate, </em>384 Mich 334 [183 NW2d 220] (1971), should: (a) be overruled and, if so, (b) whether there is any need to reach and decide the issue of whether probate court notice procedures are constitutionally [adequate]\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">It is indeed a novel approach in our adversary system for the appellate court to conjure up issues and posit arguments for parties who failed to raise those issues on their own. Even more troublesome to me, however, is the fact that the Court\u2019s supplemental order did not adequately apprise the parties of the issue that the Court wanted to address and consider. The issue that the Court apparently wanted to decide was whether the Probate Code may properly be interpreted as precluding the bringing of all actions against the personal representative within the applicable limitation period but after the three-month bar<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> following the closing of the estate. The order, however, instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the parties to consider whether <em>In re Curzenski Estate </em>should be overruled. A fair reading of that case would lead one to conclude that the holding in <em>Curzenski </em>was that liability insurance is not an \"after discovered asset\u201d within the meaning of MCL 704.56; MSA 27.3178(307), and therefore a person with a negligence claim against the estate is precluded from having the estate reopened in order to sue the personal representative and recover insurance proceeds. My colleagues, on the other hand, state that <em>Curzenski </em>stands for the proposition that an action cannot be commenced in circuit court directly against the personal representative of an estate after it has been closed. The Court then proceeds to overrule that proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">While there is dictum in <em>Curzenski </em>to that effect, it is clear that the parties were not fairly apprised that such was the proposition that this Court was instructing them to address. In fact, the parties did not know how the <em>Curzenski </em>case was relevant to the issues they briefed<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and told us so.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">The ramifications of the Court\u2019s opinion are significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>In search of a remedy for plaintiff and with an eye to a collectible defendant, in this instance the Motor Vehicle Accident Claims Fund, the Court would hold that an action may be commenced directly against the personal representative at any time during the applicable statutory limitational period, although the decedent\u2019s estate has been closed for more than three months, with recovery being limited to sources other than the assets of the probated estate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In such cases where the claimant has failed to file his claim in probate court, the administration of the estate is to be deemed \"incomplete\u201d within the meaning of MCL 704.56; MSA 27.3178(307), and upon petition the estate may be reopened. In so holding, the Court has not only overruled <em>In re Curzenski Estate, </em>but has also ignored a long line of firmly established precedent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Faced with a far more sympathy-evoking tardy claimant wishing to reopen a decedent\u2019s estate to recover probate assets, this Court, in <em>In re Cook Estate, </em>366 Mich 323, 326-328; 115 NW2d 98 (1962), cautioned against the judicial approach taken by the majority wherein it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\"This Court takes judicial notice of the fact that because of errors or omissions in probate proceedings, estates of decedents are reopened, sometimes years after the completion of the original probate.

Similarly, a claimant who chooses to pursue his remedies in circuit court pursuant to MCL 708.22; MSA 27.3178(432) rather than file his claim in probate court must do so before the estate closes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">\"The only question requiring present determination is whether the defendant is a suable fiduciary under [MCL 708.22; MSA 27.3178(432)].

Whether the claimant expects recovery from assets previously distributed by the personal representative, from proceeds under a liability policy or a government fund is immaterial in the face of the clear and unambiguous language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In an attempt to avoid the statutory mandate that forbids reopening an estate after three months following its closing order, and thereby avoiding the effect of a shorter statute of limitations under the Probate Code, the Court merely rewrites the statute. In my view, the task of determining the proper and just period of limitation for claims against a decedent\u2019s estate is best left to the Legislature \u2014 in fact, is required to be left there.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The task of the judiciary is to interpret the statute before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The issue we chose to address in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>granting leave to appeal was whether a person having a cause of action for negligence against a decedent is entitled to actual notice of the time for filing and the hearing of claims against the decedent\u2019s estate.

The Court of Appeals, in deciding this case of <em>Williams, </em>therefore, looked to Probate Court Rule 18, in effect when it commenced, to obtain the definition of \"interested party\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">PCR 18, \u00a7 1(B) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\"In all cases where notice has been given by publication, as provided by law, on the hearing of any of the following: * * * hearing on claims of any decedent or person under guardianships * * * the petitioner or fiduciary, as the case may be, or his attorney, shall cause notice, by personal service or by registered, certified, or ordinary mail to be given <em>all known interested parties, </em>whose existence and whereabouts are known to the petitioner or fiduciary, or can be ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence, at least 14 days before the date originally set for hearing.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">PCR 18, \u00a7 2(A)(9) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\"In the hearing on claims of any decedent or ward, the beneficiaries of any testate estate, the heirs-at-law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>of any intestate estate, and the presumptive heirs-at-law of any ward, are interested parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Since the court rule did not include claims by any creditors, the Court of Appeals concluded that plaintiff was not an \"interested person\u201d for purposes of receiving actual notice pursuant to MCL 701.32; MSA 27.3178(32), and therefore her tardy claim was properly barred under MCL 701.19; MSA 27.3178(19).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">I cannot accept that interpretation of then-existing PCR 18.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> I do not believe that when this Court promulgated PCR 18 it intended it to be an exhaustive list of interested parties for purposes of MCL 701.32; MSA 27.3178(32). A common-sense reading of the language of the rule suggests that the persons listed were those who, in all circumstances, were to be understood as being \"interested parties\u201d and not that it was an exclusive listing of such persons as though there can be no others who in an appropriate case would be \"interested\u201d. The rule was not meant to exclude other known persons from receiving actual notice in claims hearings where they have significant interests in the assets of the estate and where the disposition at such a hearing would materially affect their rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Support for this interpretation of \"interested parties\u201d under Rule 18 may be found in \u00a7 2(C) <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>the same rule which authorizes the probate judge, where actual notice is required to be given to known interested parties, to require actual notice be given to persons not specified as interested parties. Thus, this section contemplates the existence of additional interested parties for purposes of various probate proceedings although they are not specifically mentioned in the previous section.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">In addition, authors Moore and Denison in their treatise on Michigan probate practice include creditors as interested parties under Rule 18 for purposes of receiving actual notice where their rights may be affected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\"All interested parties must be served. Interested parties are the following: namely, the devisees and legatees, fiduciaries and beneficiaries of a trust under the will, the heirs-at-law of the testator, or intestate decedent, the possible beneficiaries, the principal and surety on any bond, the presumptive heirs-at-law of any ward, the <em>creditors, </em>and the Department of Social Welfare of the county of which the ward is a resident or the Attorney General on behalf of the State of Michigan. <em>Such persons are interested persons in any proceedings, motion, petition, or hearing, wherein their interest or right may be affected. </em>In all cases a guardian ad litem is an interested party if the person he represents is an interested party. The court may require notice to be given to persons not specified as interested parties and the proponent, petitioner, or fiduciary, or his attorney, must cause notice to be given to any other interested parties.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 3 Moore &amp; Denison, Michigan Practice: Probate Law and Practice (2d ed), \u00a7 475, pp 157-158.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">It therefore follows that plaintiff, as a potential tort creditor, may be an interested party for purposes of MCL 701.32; MSA 27.3178(32), and PCR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>18, \u00a7 1(B) and thus entitled to actual notice of hearings on claims if she qualifies as a <em>\"known </em>interested party\u201d pursuant to PCR 18, \u00a7 1(B). Whether or not plaintiff was known to the personal representative of decedent\u2019s estate will be discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Plaintiff maintains, that in addition to the statutory notice requirement she has a due-process entitlement to actual notice. She cites <em>Mullane v Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co, </em>339 US 306; 70 S Ct 652; 94 L Ed 865 (1950), and <em>Dow v Michigan, </em>396 Mich 192; 240 NW2d 450 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The threshold question to be addressed in resolving the due-process issue is whether plaintiff has a constitutionally protected property interest in the estate. Although her interest as a creditor may be \"intangible\u201d, it is settled that \"the property interests protected by procedural due process extend well beyond actual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money\u201d. <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v Roth, </em>408 US 564, 571-572; 92 S Ct 2701; 33 L Ed 2d 548 (1972). Further, property interests are not created by the Constitution but rather are created and defined by existing rules such as state law. <em>Roth, supra. </em>In turning to our own state law, it is clear that this Court has recognized that an accrued cause of action is a significant interest in property within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\"It is axiomatic that the constitutional provision of due process extends to protect that 'property\u2019 construed to be a vested right and that generally an accrued right of action is a vested property right which may not be arbitrarily impinged. See 16 Am Jur 2d, Constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Law, \u00a7\u00a7 421 <em>et seq. \u201d Grubaugh v City of St Johns, </em>384 Mich 165, 170; 180 NW2d 778 (1970).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Since plaintiffs accrued cause of action in tort is an interest in property within the meaning of the Due Process Clause, plaintiff may not be deprived of that interest without the procedural protection provided by that clause which guarantees notice and an opportunity to be heard appropriate to the nature of her case. <em>Mullane, supra, </em>p 313. The United States Supreme Court has declared the notice requirement under the Due Process Clause this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\"An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections. * * * But if with due regard for the practicalities and peculiarities of the case these conditions are reasonably met, the constitutional requirements are satisfied.\u201d <em>Mullane, supra, </em>pp 314-315.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The second inquiry under a due-process analysis is to decide what type of notice is required under the given facts in order to satisfy the <em>Mullane </em>standard. <em>Mullane </em>does not purport to announce a hard and fast rule for determining when actual notice is required.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">\"The Court has not committed itself to any formula achieving a balance between these interests in a particular proceeding or determining when constructive notice may be utilized or what test it must meet. Personal service has not in all circumstances been regarded as indispensable to the process due to residents, and it has more often been held unnecessary as to nonresidents. We disturb none of the established rules on these subjects. No decision constitutes a controlling or even a very illuminating precedent for the case before us.\u201d <em>Mullane, supra, </em>p 314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Instead, the Court employed a balancing test, weighing the state\u2019s interest in avoiding the burdens of providing actual notice against the individual\u2019s interest in receiving adequate notice. This Court has held that \"[t]he kind of notice required depends on the circumstances of the case and the availability of other means in both a theoretical and economic sense\u201d. <em>Alan v Wayne County, </em>388 Mich 210, 351; 200 NW2d 628 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Our task of examining the circumstances and balancing the interests in an attempt to determine the type of notice required is aided by past determinations. In <em>Mullane, </em>the Court held that mailed notice to known beneficiaries of a common trust fund must be provided where the trustee had the names and addresses of income beneficiaries in its books.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In <em>Dow, supra, </em>this Court held that in proceedings to foreclose a statutory lien for nonpayment of taxes the state must provide notice by mail \"before sale to the person to whom tax bills have been sent and to 'occupant\u2019 \u201d, and after the sale, \"formal notice to all owners of significant property interests of the constitutionally required opportunity for hearing and redemption\u201d. 396 Mich 212. The Court further found in <em>Dow </em>that the obligation to provide mail notice would not seriously burden the government by observing that tax title buyers have long been required, and apparently have been able, to provide mail notice to the owners of significant interests in the land purchased after nonpayment of taxes. 396 Mich 208-209. Noting that real property interests of record are easily identifiable, the Court held that if the interests were of record or if the treasurer or assessor was aware of the interests, mailed notice is required. 396 Mich 210-211.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>In <em>City of New York v New York, NH &amp; HR Co, </em>344 US 293; 73 S Ct 299; 97 L Ed 333 (1953), the Court held that a lien creditor was entitled to receive actual notice of the time to file its claims against the bankrupt. It is reasonable to conclude that the Court found the duty to provide actual notice would not be too burdensome on the receiver since the instant creditor and the character of its claims could be easily ascertained from the bankrupt\u2019s records.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 344 US 296. In addition, since the plaintiff had a lien on real property, it is likely that the lien was recorded with the appropriate register of deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Although a potential tort creditor\u2019s interest is on equal footing for purposes of due process with the interests of a beneficiary of a trust or a title holder of real property or lien creditor, there <em>may be </em>a significantly different and greater burden imposed upon the personal representative obligated to ascertain the existence of a potential tort claimant. For example, in requiring a personal representative to give actual notice to all potential tort claimants, he or she will be required to determine from the records of the estate the existence of a claim, the validity of the claim, and the likelihood that the claimant will pursue his legal rights against the estate. In other words, such a determination could entail making a legal judgment, in the sense of forming a professional opinion, whether or not another person had a viable tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>claim against the estate and one that is likely to be pursued. This is a significantly greater burden than is placed upon a receiver in bankruptcy, for example, who may easily ascertain the existence and character of a lien creditor\u2019s interest from an examination of the bankrupt\u2019s personal records of accounts payable or from the register of deeds. However, once a tort claimant files a claim in probate court, files a complaint in circuit court, or otherwise indicates to the personal representative that he will pursue his legal rights against the estate, the existence and character of the tort creditor\u2019s claim on the decedent\u2019s estate also becomes easily ascertainable for the personal representative and there is no longer a requirement that a legal judgment be made as to the validity of a potential claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">This Court has declared heretofore that the kind of notice required depends on the circumstances of the case. <em>Alan, supra. </em>A personal representative is obligated to give actual notice under the Probate Code and under the Constitution only to those persons who are \"known interested parties\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> I would hold that a tort claimant<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is known and therefore entitled to personal notice of the time for filing and hearing on claims when he has taken some steps toward pursuing his legal remedies against the estate <em>(i.e., </em>either by filing a claim or complaint or engaging in settlement negotiations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>with a representative of the decedent) or has manifested an intent to pursue his legal rights against the estate and has communicated that intent in some fashion to the personal representative. The mere fact that a personal representative has knowledge of an occurrence which could conceivably lead to potential liability is not sufficient to make a claimant known since that knowledge does not remove the overwhelming burden of requiring the personal representative to make a legal judgment of expert character based on mere probabilities.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The accommodation reached by this standard providing for actual notice to certain interested persons who have made their interests \"known\u201d and notice by publication to other persons, is compatible with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The trial court did not make any finding on the issue whether defendant knew of the existence of plaintiff and of her possible claim. Since the factual issue of whether plaintiff or her claim or her intention to file a claim was known to defendant was not framed by defendant\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment, plaintiff was not obliged to respond to that issue and the issue was not before the trial court for decision. I would therefore remand this cause to the trial court for a determination whether, in accordance with the standards announced herein, the administrator was chargeable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>with knowledge of claim by plaintiff against the estate and thus obligated to give plaintiff actual notice of the time for filing and the hearing on claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-9\"> MCL 701.19; MSA 27.3178(19).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b203-7\"> It is interesting to note that plaintiff, who would prevail in the instant action by virtue of overruling <em>Curzenski, </em>states in her brief that she cannot answer the question posed by the supplemental order and attempts to distinguish <em>Curzenski:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\"We find that we cannot directly answer all of the questions as stated.
