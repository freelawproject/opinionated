When plaintiffs were laid off in the wake of local strikes at other GM plants, their eligibility for unemployment benefits was contested because of certain dues payments they had made to their union strike fund several months before, in the midst of a national strike against Ford Motor Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">This controversy arises under the labor dispute disqualification provision of the Michigan Employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ment Security Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> subsection 29(8),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which, at the time, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">\"(8) An individual shall be disqualified for benefits for any week with respect to which his total or partial unemployment is due to a labor dispute in active progress, or to shutdown or start-up operations caused by such labor dispute, in the establishment in which he is or was last employed, or to a labor dispute (other than a lockout) in active progress, or to shutdown or start-up operations caused by such labor dispute, in any other establishment within the United States which is functionally integrated with such establishment and is operated by the same employing unit. No individual shall be disqualified under this subsection 29(8) if he is not directly involved in such dispute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-5\">\"(a) For the purposes of this subsection 29(8), no individual shall be deemed to be directly involved in a labor dispute unless it is established that:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\"II. He is participating in or financing or directly interested in the labor dispute which causes his total or partial unemployment. The payment of regular union dues (in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute) shall not be construed as financing a labor dispute within the meaning of this subparagraph * * *.\u201d 1967 PA 254.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The application of subsection 29(8) to the facts of this case potentially raises three connected questions:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">(1) Was plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment \"due to\u201d labor disputes in active progress at other establishments operated within the United States by the same employing unit and functionally integrated with the establishments where plaintiffs were employed?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">(2) If so, were plaintiffs\u2019 emergency dues payments to the strike fund sufficiently connected with the labor disputes which caused their unemployment to constitute \"financing\u201d of those labor disputes unless excepted by the terms of subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II)?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">(3) If so, are plaintiffs\u2019 temporary emergency dues payments excepted from the category of \"financing\u201d because they were \"regular union dues (in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute)\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">We conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment was due to labor disputes in active progress at functionally integrated domestic GM plants. The basic disqualification provision of subsection 29(8) disqualifies an individual whose unemployment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>claimed to result from a labor dispute if that labor dispute is shown to be a substantial contributing cause of his or her unemployment. While the Legislature did not intend to withhold benefits from individuals who would have been unemployed even if an apparently related labor dispute had not occurred, the dispute need not be the sole cause of the unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Before considering whether the emergency dues payments may be regarded as having financed the labor disputes that caused plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment, we seek to determine whether those payments are specifically exempted from treatment as financing by the second sentence of subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II). We agree with the Court of Appeals that that provision requires union dues to satisfy two conditions in order to be exempted as a matter of law from possible classification as financing a labor dispute: the dues must be (1) regular and (2) in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of the labor dispute that caused the claimant\u2019s unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">We further agree with the Court of Appeals that the temporary emergency dues paid by UAW members in October and November, 1967 were not \"regular\u201d but extraordinary. The Legislature chose the term \"regular\u201d to exclude from possible treatment as financing those dues payments required uniformly of union members and collected on a continuing basis without fluctuations prompted by the exigencies of a particular labor dispute or disputes. The payments in question, enacted as a temporary emergency measure to build the union strike fund in the midst of a national strike against Ford Motor Company, cannot properly be described as \"regular\u201d. We therefore need not decide whether the emergency dues were estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>lished \"prior to the inception of [the] labor dispute\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">The referee, the appeal board and the Court of Appeals all implicitly assumed that unless the emergency dues payments fell within the specific exemption for \"regular union dues (in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute)\u201d the payments would constitute financing because the union strike fund had paid strike benefits to workers involved in the labor disputes that caused plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The determination that the emergency dues payments are not exempted from treatment as financing by the second sentence of subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II) does not, however, require the conclusion that plaintiffs financed the local labor disputes which caused their unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Since the appeal board, the tribunal with the most experience and expertise in the application of the act, did not discuss the meaning of \"financing\u201d, we remand this matter to the board\u2019s successor for further explication of the term \"financing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">In supplemental briefs filed after oral argument, the parties have addressed the question whether federal labor policy prohibits a state from disqualifying union members for unemployment compensation benefits because they have made required payments into a union\u2019s general strike fund. We do not decide whether the federal labor law preempts the application of the \"financing\u201d disqualification of the Employment Security Act because the construction given the term \"financing\u201d after remand may make it unnecessary to address the federal preemption issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">We retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\">Every three years the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America and the three major automakers (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler) negotiate new national collective bargaining agreements. The case has its roots in events contemporaneous with and subsequent to the 1967 automobile industry contract negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">In June, 1967, the UAW notified each of the three major automakers by letter of its intent to terminate all national and local collective bargaining agreements when they expired on September 6, 1967. GM and the UAW began negotiations toward a new national agreement on July 15, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">In a vote taken during the latter part of August, the UAW\u2019s GM membership authorized strikes, if necessary, on national and local issues. However, the expiration of the agreements did not immediately result in strikes at GM plants because Ford, not GM, was selected as the strike target for that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">On October 8, 1967, while a nationwide UAW strike against Ford was in progress, a special UAW convention amended article 16 of the union\u2019s constitution to provide for \"emergency dues\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The new dues, effective immediately and continuing \"during the current collective bargain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ing emergency as determined by the International Executive Board and thereafter, if necessary, until the International Union Strike Insurance Fund has reached the sum of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000)\u201d, increased each member\u2019s monthly contribution to the union Strike Insurance Fund from $1.25 to $11.25 or $21.25, depending upon the average hourly wage at the member\u2019s plant. After the emergency ended or the $25,000,-000 goal was reached, each member\u2019s monthly dues would consist of two hours\u2019 \"straight time\u201d pay, with 40% earmarked for the member\u2019s local union and 30% each allocated to the International Union\u2019s Administrative and Strike Funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">UAW members employed at GM plants in Michigan, including each of the plaintiffs, paid the emergency dues in October and November, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>On November 30, 1967, the UAW determined that there would be no nationwide strike at GM plants during December, 1967 and waived collection of the emergency dues during December, 1967 and January, 1968. However, the letter informing GM of the waiver noted that \"the collective bargaining emergency is not yet ended\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">The UAW and GM reached agreement on all national issues by December 15, 1967. Following ratification by the membership, the new national agreement took effect bn January 1, 1968. However, local bargaining issues at a number of plants remained unresolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">During January, 1968, GM foundries at Saginaw, Michigan; Defiance, Ohio; and Tonawanda, New York, were each shut down for approximately 10 days because of strikes called by the UAW over local issues. It is stipulated that the striking UAW members at these establishments received strike benefits from the strike fund in which the emergency dues collected in October and November were deposited. The local strikes at the foundries were followed by shutdowns or cutbacks in production at 24 other GM plants in Michigan and over 19,000 workers, including the plaintiffs, were laid off from their employment in the affected plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Michigan Employment Security Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>approved plaintiffs\u2019 applications for unemployment compensation benefits. GM appealed to a hearing referee who reversed the Commission\u2019s decision and ruled that plaintiffs were disqualified under subsection 29(8) of the Michigan Employment Security Act because they had financed the labor disputes which caused their unemployment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The referee found that plaintiffs\u2019 increased contributions to the union\u2019s strike fund during October and November, 1967 were not \"regular union dues\u201d within the meaning of the subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II) exception because they were not \"in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute\u201d. The referee\u2019s opinion did not discuss what activities were intended to fall under the heading of \"financing\u201d but, rather, implicitly assumed that the dues in question were financing unless expressly excepted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Michigan Employment Security Appeal Board agreed with the referee that the emergency dues could not properly be described as \"regular union dues\u201d. Like the referee, the appeal board treated the parenthetical language \u2014 \"(in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute)\u201d \u2014 as an explanation of the word \"regular\u201d. The board focused upon the meaning of that language and the associated question when \"such labor dispute\u201d has its inception, and, rather than explicating the concept of \"financing\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>assumed that the emergency dues payments disqualified plaintiffs unless the stated exception applied. Declaring that the inception of the labor dispute had preceded the adoption of the increased strike fund dues, the board upheld the referee\u2019s decision disqualifying plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\">On appeal to circuit court, the board\u2019s decision was affirmed by the Ingham Circuit Court and reversed by the Genesee and Wayne Circuit Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The Court of Appeals, construing the subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II) exclusion of \"regular union dues\u201d from the definition of financing as evidence of a legislative intent to treat non-regular or extraordinary union dues as financing a labor dispute if used to support a strike, held that the increased strike fund dues paid during October and November, 1967 were not \"regular\u201d as that term is ordinarily understood. Finding that the referee and the appeal board had correctly determined that claimants were disqualified for financing the labor dispute which caused their unemployment, the Court of Appeals affirmed the Ingham Circuit Court and reversed the Genesee and Wayne Circuit Courts. Having concluded that the emergency dues were extraordinary rather than regular, the Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to explore the parenthetical language or to decide when the labor dispute causing plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment had its inception.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">We granted leave to appeal, limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\"(1) Did payment of the dues in question constitute financing of the labor dispute as a matter of law;_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\"(2) Was plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment caused by a labor dispute in active progress?\u201d 402 Mich 828 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Every state\u2019s unemployment compensation statute includes some provision disqualifying from benefits an individual whose unemployment results from a labor dispute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Most provisions are patterned after the corresponding section of the draft bills published by the Social Security Board<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> following passage of the Social Security Act of 1935,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which provided federal funding for state unemployment insurance programs.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The concept of labor dispute disqualification and the various statutes embodying it have engendered substantial litigation<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and commentary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">The Michigan statute declares the basic condition of labor dispute disqualification in its introductory sentence:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\"An individual shall be disqualified for benefits for any week with respect to which his total or partial unemployment is due to a labor dispute in active progress, or to shutdown or start-up operations caused by such labor dispute, in the establishment in which he is or was last employed, or to a labor dispute (other than a lockout) in active progress, or to shutdown or start-up operations caused by such labor dispute, in any other establishment within the United States which is functionally integrated with such establishment and is operated by the same employing unit.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-3\">But under our statute, as under most statutes, determining whether a claimant\u2019s unemployment falls within the terms of the basic disqualification is the beginning, not the end, of the inquiry.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The seemingly categorical disqualification principle of the first sentence is tempered by the language that follows it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-4\">\"No individual shall be disqualified under this subsection 29(8) if he is not directly involved in such dispute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The statute requires that \"direct involvement\u201d be shown by establishing one of four enumerated circumstances. This case concerns but one aspect of the second of the listed alternatives:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-6\">\"II. He is participating in or <em>\u00f1nancing </em>or directly interested in <em>the labor dispute which causes his total or partial unemployment. </em>The payment of regular union dues (in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute) shall not be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>strued as financing a labor dispute within the meaning of this subparagraph * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Because the basic disqualification provision of subsection 29(8) applies only if the claimant\u2019s unemployment is \"due to a labor dispute in active progress\u201d in the establishment where he is or was last employed, or in a functionally integrated establishment operated within the United States by the same employing unit, the threshold consideration is whether the facts of this case evidence the requisite causal link between plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment and a dispute in active progress.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Absent that causal connection, plaintiffs are not disqualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The Court of Appeals regarded the appeal board\u2019s finding that plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment was due to a labor dispute in active progress at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>functionally integrated plant as conclusive because supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We agree with the Court of Appeals assessment of the evidence but find its conclusion only partially responsive to plaintiffs\u2019 arguments. We understand plaintiffs to assert not only that the appeal board erred in finding a causal connection in fact, but also that the board and all courts except the Wayne Circuit Court<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> misunderstood the legal standard of causation required by this subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">Plaintiffs argue that a claimant may be disqualified under subsection 29(8) only if a labor dispute in active progress is the sole cause of the claimant\u2019s unemployment. They assert that their unemployment was due not only to the labor disputes in progress at the functionally integrated foundries and plants, but also to the seniority provisions of the national and local agreements, which marked them as the first to be laid off, and to a combination of GM business decisions, particularly the choice not to replace materials supplied by the struck establishments through purchases in the open market. Plaintiffs urge us to conclude that the causal connection required to support the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>threshold finding of disqualification has therefore not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">We disagree. An individual is disqualified for benefits under the basic provision if a disqualifying labor dispute is shown to be a substantial contributing cause of his or her unemployment. The dispute need not be the sole cause of the unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The decisions of this Court relied on by the plaintiffs establish only that disqualification is inappropriate where other circumstances unrelated to the labor dispute would themselves have been sufficient to cause the unemployment for which benefits are claimed.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Legislature did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>not intend to withhold benefits from individuals who would have been unemployed even if an apparently related labor dispute had not occurred. Those decisions all support the conclusion that the Legislature intended the basic disqualification provision to apply when a claimant\u2019s unemployment was caused by a labor dispute and no independent and sufficient cause for the unemployment could be shown.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">The seniority provisions and management decisions which plaintiffs identify as contributing causes of their unemployment would not them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>selves have caused plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment or any unemployment were it not for the labor disputes in active progress at the functionally integrated foundries. But for those disputes, materials would have been available at plaintiffs\u2019 places of employment, the work force at those establishments would not have been reduced, and the seniority provisions would not have become operative. The labor disputes in active progress at the foundries were shown by competent, material and substantial evidence to have been substantial contributing causes of the layoffs which idled plaintiffs. We affirm the board\u2019s finding that plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment was \"due to a labor dispute in active progress\u201d within the meaning of subsection 29(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-3\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Once it has been determined that the basic disqualification provision applies, the inquiry progresses to whether the claimant is directly involved in the labor dispute which caused his or her unemployment. In this case, plaintiffs\u2019 emergency dues payments to the strike fund are alleged to constitute \"financing\u201d of the local disputes at the foundries \u2014 a disqualifying direct involvement under subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II). That subparagraph, however, also declares that certain kinds of union dues payments may not be construed as \"financing a labor dispute\u201d. Since plaintiffs would escape disqualification if their emergency dues payments fall within the protective provision, we consider whether those payments are specifically exempted from treatment as \"financing\u201d before attempting to determine whether they may be affirmatively classified under that heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Subparagraph 29(8)(a)(II) states that the \"payment of regular union dues (in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of such labor dispute) shall not be construed as financing a labor dispute * * Except for the parenthetical language, which was added in 1963,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> this proviso has been part of Michigan\u2019s unemployment compensation act since 1937.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-3\">The referee and the appeal board both treated the parenthetical language as a limitation that would preclude labeling certain payments \"regular\u201d union dues and concluded that the payments in question did not satisfy the parenthetical condition. The Court of Appeals reasoned that the express exclusion of \"regular union dues\u201d from the category of \"financing\u201d evidenced a legislative intent to leave every other type of union assessment used to support a labor dispute within the terms of the subsection 29(8) disqualification, and that the language added in 1963 only qualified the \"regular union dues\u201d exception further. Employing the word \"regular\u201d as the first branch of a two-pronged test completed by the parenthetical language, the Court of Appeals declared that \" 'regular\u2019 is synonymous with 'normal\u2019, 'typical\u2019 and 'natural\u2019 to the extent that they all mean 'being of the sort or kind that is expected as usual, ordinary or average\u2019 \u201d, and concluded that the increased dues paid pursuant to the October, 1967 constitutional amendment did not meet that description.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">Plaintiffs attack the Court of Appeals reliance upon everyday meanings of the word \"regular\u201d and urge us to construe the term \"regular union dues\u201d as the equivalent of \"periodic dues\u201d under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u00a7 8(a)(3) of the National Labor Relations Act,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> a term which they assert means \"those uniformly levied union dues which are enforceable through a union security clause and which may be required of union members as a condition of continued employment\u201d.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In plaintiffs\u2019 view, it is immaterial whether the amount of the dues is temporary or permanent, fixed or variable, so long as they are part of the union\u2019s constitutionally adopted dues structure rather than separately imposed special assessments. Plaintiffs contend, alternatively, that the Legislature intended the parenthetical language added in 1963 to explain the meaning of \"regular union dues\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">The parties direct us to no legislative history which would aid us in reaching a more precise understanding of the meaning of \"regular union dues\u201d or the relationship between that phrase and the parenthetical language added in 1963. Mindful of the remedial purpose of the Michigan Employment Security Act to provide relief from the hardship caused by involuntary unemployment,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> we seek a liberal construction that will effectuate that legislative purpose,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> yet be consonant with reason and good discretion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>We conclude, as did the Court of Appeals, that the parenthetical language states a separate test that union dues must meet in order to be exempted as a matter of law from possible classification as financing a labor dispute. In order to be exempt under all circumstances, union dues must be both (1) regular and (2) in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of the labor dispute that caused the claimant\u2019s unemployment. We further agree with the Court of Appeals that the temporary emergency dues paid in October and November, 1967 were not \"regular\u201d union dues.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\">Every word of a statute should be given meaning and no word should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory if at all possible.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Before the 1963 amendment, the word \"regular\u201d described a type of union dues, payment of which would not expose a union member to potential disqualification for financing however the dues payments were used. Had the Legislature intended the parenthetical phrase added in 1963 to be a complete definition of \"regular\u201d, it should have made that intention clear or supplanted the word \"regular\u201d altogether.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It did not. We conclude that the word retains independent significance as a limitation upon the types of union dues automatically exempted from potential classification as financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">The words of the Employment Security Act, like other statutes, are to be given their plain and ordinary meaning absent some indication that the Legislature intended otherwise.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We perceive no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>evidence of a legislative intention to equate \"regular union dues\u201d with \"periodic dues\u201d enforceable through a union security agreement under \u00a7 8(a)(3) of the NLRA. The federal statute\u2019s reference to \"periodic dues\u201d was not inserted until ten years after the \"regular union dues\u201d proviso was added to the Michigan Employment Security Act.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We conclude that the Legislature chose the term \"regular\u201d to exclude from possible treatment as financing those dues payments required uniformly of union members and collected on a continuing basis without fluctuations prompted by the exigencies of a particular labor dispute or disputes.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Such a construction is consistent with ordinary usage and the common understanding of the word and serves to distinguish between sums customarily and continually collected and unusual collections for the purpose of supporting a labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">In <em>Burrell v Ford Motor </em>Co,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> this Court approved the appeal board\u2019s determination that UAW members had not financed local labor disputes which caused their unemployment merely because a portion of their monthly membership dues had been allocated to a union strike insurance fund from which payments were disbursed to strikers involved in the unemployment-producing local disputes. The appeal board had stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\"We believe that any differentiation between adminis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>trative dues and Strike Insurance Fund dues is merely an internal designation by the union and still establishes that the regular union dues are established to be $5 monthly under Article 16, Section 2 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\">The record in <em>Burrell </em>disclosed that each UAW member\u2019s $5 monthly dues consisted of $3.75 in administrative dues ($1.75 of which was forwarded to the international union) and $1.25 for the union\u2019s strike insurance fund.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> There was no indication that the dues had been increased at any time relevant to the labor dispute in question. Monthly dues continued to be $5 per member until the union constitution was amended on October 8, 1967.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">We are persuaded that the October and November, 1967 strike fund dues are not comparable to the strike fund portion of the pre-amendment monthly dues. The text of the amendment shows that each member\u2019s strike fund dues were increased from $1.25 per month to $11.25 or $21.25 per month<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> for the duration of the then existing collective bargaining emergency and perhaps until the fund contained 25 million dollars. It was not contemplated that the increased amounts would be collected indefinitely; following the emergency, dues would be set at \"two hours straight time pay per month\u201d. The emergency dues provided by the amendment constituted a marked deviation from the regular pattern of dues collection; they were a temporary emergency measure whose obvious purpose was to replenish the union strike fund. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Court of Appeals correctly concluded that these payments could not properly be termed \"regular\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Because the emergency dues payments were not \"regular union dues\u201d, we need not decide whether they were \"in amounts and for purposes established prior to the inception of [the] labor dispute\u201d. We turn to the question whether payment of the emergency dues constituted \"financing\u201d of the local labor disputes which caused plaintiffs\u2019 unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">While the statute does not require that payments made by individuals whose disqualification is in issue be traced into the hands of workers involved in the labor dispute which caused the individuals\u2019 unemployment, the term \"financing\u201d suggests a meaningful connection between the payment or class of payments said to constitute financing and the labor dispute allegedly financed. The appeal board did not give separate consideration to the meaning of \"financing\u201d, in general or as applied to this case. We therefore remand this matter to its successor, the tribunal with the most experience and expertise in the application of the act, to reconsider, in light of its own unique familiarity with the act, practical considerations and related issues implicated by this question, whether plaintiffs\u2019 emergency dues payments were sufficiently connected with the local labor disputes which caused their unemployment to constitute \"financing\u201d of those labor disputes. The parties shall be provided an opportunity to present additional evidence, arguments and briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">After this case was argued, this Court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>plaintiffs permission to file supplemental briefs limited to two issues said to \"necessarily result from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>New York Telephone Co v New York State Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>440 US 519; 99 S Ct 1328; 59 L Ed 2d 553 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-3\">\"I. Is the financing proviso of \u00a7 29(8)(a)(II) of the MESA, as interpreted by the Court of Appeals, preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\">\"II. Alternatively, can and should the financing proviso of \u00a7 29(8)(a)(II) be narrowly construed to apply only to direct payments to strikers by those sought to be disqualified thereunder and/or direct payments from a fund specially earmarked for such strikers, as opposed to a nationally established, general and regular strike insurance fund?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Plaintiffs argue that, if the financing provision of the labor dispute disqualification is construed to disqualify them for the payment of dues required to maintain their union membership, that provision is preempted by federal labor law on two grounds: (1) it penalizes plaintiffs for maintaining membership in and providing financial support to their union, an activity expressly protected under \u00a7 7 of the NLRA; (2) under such an analysis, the state burdens and interferes with internal union decisions regarding allocation of dues and the amount and timing of dues increases, matters which Congress intended to leave free from both state and federal regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">So far as this Court can determine, federal preemption issues were not raised before the referee or the appeal board, were fleetingly noted in the circuit courts, and were not extensively briefed in the Court of Appeals. Except for a terse cdnclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>sory statement by one circuit judge, none of those tribunals addressed these questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\">We are asked, after oral argument, to consider questions not yet decided by any court which have heretofore played a secondary role in the case and which lie in an area where the present direction of the United States Supreme Court is far from clear.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">It is unclear what types of cases, other than the few to reach the appellate courts, have presented \"financing\u201d issues in the past, and in which of those cases disqualification for financing a labor dispute has been enforced. Nor does it appear whether the financing provision has any practical significance outside of auto industry disputes between the UAW and the major automakers. We should also be better informed concerning the pragmatic consequences that might follow adoption of any possible definitions of \"financing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">If plaintiffs did not engage in \"financing\u201d as a matter of state law, it may be unnecessary to decide in this case whether federal law preempts that provision of the state unemployment compensation act. And, even if plaintiffs are ultimately held to have financed the labor disputes which caused their unemployment, we are of the opinion that an asserted conflict between state and federal law should not be passed upon until the challenged state provision has been definitively construed. We therefore defer decision of the issues raised in plaintiffs\u2019 supplemental brief until after remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">The briefs of the parties after remand shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>include (1) all historical materials that might assist this Court in determining (a) the extent to which Congress intended that the amounts and purposes of union dues should be subject to or free from state regulation or inquiry and (b) the extent to which Congress intended that the states should be permitted to disqualify, or prohibited from disqualifying, claimants from unemployment compensation benefits for financing through union dues the labor disputes that caused their unemployment; (2) any further argument the parties desire to make on the federal preemption issue; and (3) argument on the First Amendment and Equal Protection challenges raised in plaintiffs\u2019 and <em>amicus curiae </em>United Steelworkers\u2019 supplemental briefs.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">We remand to the board of review, the successor to the appeal board,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
