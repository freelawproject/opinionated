The parents\u2019 complaint was filed on November 28, 1972. The complaint on behalf of the child was filed on February 23, 1973. The defendant hospital filed a motion for summary and/or accelerated judgment on the ground that the hospital was engaged in a governmental function and was therefore immune from tort liability under MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107). The circuit court granted the hospital accelerated judgment on December 3, 1975. The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished per curiam opinion on June 12, 1978. Application for leave to appeal to this Court was filed on June 28, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">On December <em>27, </em>1978 this Court rendered a decision in <em>Parker v Highland Park, </em>404 Mich 183; 273 NW2d 413 (1978). Subsequently we granted leave to determine whether the <em>Parker </em>decision should be applied to this case to require reversal and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings. We hold it should, and the rule of <em>Parker </em>is to be applied to all cases pending on December 27, 1978 in which an express challenge to the defense of governmental immunity was made and preserved as well as all cases started after that date. See <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638, 662-668; 275 NW2d 511 (1979); <em>Pittman v City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41, 50; 247 NW2d 512 (1976); <em>Daley v LaCroix, </em>384 Mich 4, 14; 179 NW2d 390 (1970); <em>Bricker v Green, </em>313 Mich 218, 236; 21 NW2d 105 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">In <em>Parker, </em>four Justices agreed that the activities of a municipally owned general hospital did not constitute a \"governmental function\u201d within the meaning of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), and thus were not entitled to governmental immunity. Plaintiffs claim that the rule of <em>Parker </em>should apply to the instant case for several reasons: The injury involved here occurred approximately two months after the injury of Parker; they have disputed the defendant hospital\u2019s claim to immunity at every step of the proceeding; the fortuity that Parker\u2019s case attacking governmental immunity for the day-to-day operation of a hospital was decided first should not deprive plaintiff of the benefit of the rule. (See <em>Placek, supra, </em>667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Defendant, citing <em>Parker v Port Huron Hospital, </em>361 Mich 1; 105 NW2d 1 (1960), argues for the rule adopted in that case and urges that <em>Parker v Highland Park, supra, </em>be applied prospectively from the date the opinion was released and not cover other cases pending on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We are satisfied that the adventitious disposition of <em>Parker </em>while we held plaintiffs\u2019 application in abeyance should not deprive plaintiffs of the benefit of the rule or make available to defendant a defense we will no longer enforce for others.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">We acknowledge that whenever a new rule of law is promulgated some unfairness to those who have relied on the old rule may be claimed. Courts, however, do not alter an established rule of law without thorough evaluation of the policy considerations involved. When the decision to overrule precedent is finally made, the Court is satis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>fied that the importance of the result reached outweighs any unfairness to those negatively affected by the decision. Applying the ruling prospectively with the exception of that case and cases pending on appeal in which the issue was raised and preserved is an attempt to limit any such unfairness.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">As Justice Moody recognized in his concurring opinion in <em>Parker </em>we have removed a defense, not imposed a liability.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\"It also should be noted that a full trial is still forthcoming. At trial, plaintiffs will be required to prove their allegations of malpractice by a preponderance of the evidence. Defendant will have a full day in court. Therefore, though the defense of governmental immunity for public general hospitals is removed, all the safeguards of a trial remain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Reversed and remanded. No costs, a public question.</p>\n<judges id=\"b333-8\">Levin, Fitzgerald, and Blair Moody, Jr., JJ., concurred with Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b333-9\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxDG\"><em>(concurring). </em>A majority of this Court in separate opinions determined a municipally owned general hospital providing a public medical service for a fee was not performing a governmental function within the meaning of MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107). <em>Parker v Highland Park, </em>404 Mich 183; 273 NW2d 413 (1978). I joined two of my colleagues in dissenting from that result. 404 Mich 183, 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">However, now that the rule in <em>Parker </em>is the law of this state, I concur with my Brother Kavanagh that that rule should apply \"to all cases pending on December 27, 1978 in which an express chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>lenge to the defense of governmental immunity was made and preserved as well as all cases started after that date\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p 221). See my concurring opinion in <em>Pittman v City of Taylor, </em>398 Mich 41, 51; 247 NW 512 (1976); <em>Bricker v Green, </em>313 Mich 218, 236; 21 NW2d 105 (1946). The prospective only ruling of <em>Parker v Port Huron Hospital, </em>361 Mich 1; 105 NW2d 1 (1960), is not entirely applicable to this case. First of all, that case involved a charitable hospital, whereas this case involves a public hospital. Second, unfortunately, the state of the law as to what constitutes governmental immunity, without further legislative definition, has for some years been in flux. While in the field of governmental immunity there has been no such clear and simple signal of change as was specifically given in comparative negligence, <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638, 662-668; 275 NW2d 511 (1979), the opinions of this Court have been such as should warn those who might possibly be affected that they had better seek protection either through insurance or through legislative redefinition. See, for example, <em>Parker v Port Huron Hospital, </em>361 Mich 1; 105 NW2d 1 (1960), itself; <em>Williams v Detroit, </em>364 Mich 231; 111 NW2d 1 (1961); and more recently and subsequent to the facts of this case, the dissenting opinions in <em>Thomas v Dep\u2019t of State Highways, </em>398 Mich 1, 14, 25; 247 NW2d 530 (1976); <em>Bush v Oscoda Area Schools, </em>405 Mich 716, 734; 275 NW2d 268 (1979).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b334-5\">Ryan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_a\"><em>(dissenting). </em>The argument for excepting the operation of a publicly-owned hospital from the immunity provided governmental agencies in MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107), was convincing to four Justices of this Court in <em>Parker v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>Highland Park, </em>404 Mich 183; 273 NW2d 413 (1978), and thus has becom\u00e9 the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Consequently, the only remaining question in this case is whether the 1978 change in the law of governmental immunity effected by <em>Parker </em>should be applied retroactively to benefit the instant plaintiffs who claim against the defendants for negligence alleged to have occurred in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">From the Court\u2019s affirmative answer to that question, I respectfully dissent and would apply <em>Parker </em>in a purely prospective fashion; that is, to causes of action accruing after December 27, 1978, the date of decision in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\"><em>Parker </em>was decided almost six years after the acts and omissions for which the plaintiffs make complaint in these cases. For more than three-quarters of a century before <em>Parker </em>was decided, the courts of this state followed the settled rule that the operation of a public hospital was a governmental function and, as a result, such institutions were immune from tort liability. See <em>Nicholson v Detroit, </em>129 Mich 246; 88 NW 695 (1902); <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950); <em>Schwartz v Detroit, </em>83 Mich App 590; 269 NW2d 237 (1978), <em>rev\u2019d </em>405 Mich 839 (1979).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">In <em>Parker, </em>recognizing that the Court was changing the meaning of \"governmental function\u201d, as that expression had historically been defined and applied to the operation of public hospitals in this state, Justice Fitzgerald said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\"><em>\"In the past </em>this Court did hold that the operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>a hospital was a governmental function. <em>Nicholson v Detroit, </em>129 Mich 246; 88 NW 695 (1902); <em>Martinson v Alpena, </em>328 Mich 595; 44 NW2d 148 (1950).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">\"We do not believe that because we <em>once </em>held the operation of a hospital to be a governmental function we must do so <em>today. </em>A comparison of the reasoning employed by this Court in <em>Nicholson </em>with that of <em>Martinson </em>shows that the meaning of the term 'governmental function\u2019 has varied as the judiciary\u2019s thinking on the nature of government has evolved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\"Nor do we believe that the Legislature intended that we must today hold the operation of a hospital to be a governmental function because we did so in 1902 and 1950.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\"><em>\"It is time </em>we recognize that our case-law precedent, as it attempts to distinguish between a governmental and a proprietary function, is 'inherently unsound\u2019.\u201d 404 Mich 190-193. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In similar recognition, Justice Moody, writing separately, said;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\"It is held <em>today </em>that activity conducted in a general hospital operated by a municipality is not a governmental function for immunity purposes. This conclusion is predicated on the basis that the term 'governmental function\u2019 is limited to those activities <em>sui generis </em>governmental \u2014 of essence to governing.\u201d 404 Mich 199. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Thus at the time of the incidents involved in this case, the law was well-settled that the operation of a publicly-owned hospital was a governmental function for which there existed immunity from tort liability. In addition to this Court\u2019s adherence to that doctrine for three generations, the Legislature, just three months prior to the acts or omissions complained of in this case, reenacted the statute declaring governmental agencies to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>immune from tort liability when engaged in the exercise and discharge of the governmental function, MCL 691.1407; MSA 3.996(107); a reenactment employing the language of art having the well-settled meanings announced and adopted by this Court in <em>Nicholson </em>and <em>Martinson, </em>and by the Court of Appeals in <em>Schwartz, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In light of that history, the defendant hospital authority was entitled to conclude in 1970, and indeed for the eight years thereafter until <em>Parker </em>was decided, that this Court and the Legislature meant what they had said about the immunity of public hospitals. Reliance by appellant, and those similarly situated, upon the immunity doctrine as historically applied was important, not alone as an abstract matter of assuring consistency and predictability in the law of torts and all that implies, but also as a matter of fairness to the taxpayers who own and fund this public hospital authority which was not insured for the liability to which this Court today retroactively exposes it.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In her separate opinion in <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638, 683; 275 NW2d 511 (1979), Chief Justice Coleman persuasively advanced a number of reasons for the purely prospective application of the newborn doctrine of comparative negligence. Her views did not carry the day with a majority of the Justices. I subscribed to them, however, and assign the identical reasons for purely prospective overrulement in this case. A few of those reasons, as I perceive them to be particularly applicable to this case, can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u2014When the Court so clearly and concededly engages in the lawmaking process, the fiction that it is merely giving effect to the preexisting rights of the litigants, which were frustrated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>overruled law, is especially inapt. A more accurate assessment of judicial lawmaking recognizes that the Court is, instead, making <em>new </em>law. Accordingly, it ought to \"legislate\u201d with purely prospective effect as our sister branch, the Legislature, does.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u2014As a practical matter, retroactive application of the <em>Parker </em>doctrine will confer a cause of action upon an uncertain number of potential plaintiffs who, in this age of heightened sensitivity to medical malpractice, will unquestionably add a substantial burden to already overcrowded civil trial dockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\u2014Perhaps most importantly, in extending the newly announced \"Parker doctrine\u201d retroactively to embrace a cause of action which accrued more than nine years ago by a pronouncement which concededly changed the law, the Court once again undermines this state\u2019s badly damaged doctrine of stare decisis, of which the rule of purely prospective application is a logical corollary. Retroactive application of new law, especially that effecting significant change, depreciates the ends to which the doctrine of stare decisis is directed: stability, certainty, and fairness. In essence, these ends protect the basic and justified expectation that one may rely upon law as it exists at the time of reliance. By today\u2019s action, then, we prove, among other things, that insurers, attorneys, the Legislature, governmental agencies, courts and the public, which will ultimately pay for today\u2019s generosity, were unwise to rely upon our statements on the law of governmental immunity and hence should not rely upon our future pronouncements because we may change the law, retroactively, for a period of as much as a decade.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">I also note in this regard that at a time when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>the cost of health care is soaring beyond the financial capacity of many, even to the extent of a national crisis calling for congressional action, this Court\u2019s retroactive ruling imposes upon the taxpayers of this state the obligation to finance the cost of litigation and, in many cases, the jury awards for negligence claims accruing as long as a decade ago. Whether public hospital and medical care institutions had either the foresight or the lack of confidence in this Court to obtain insurance against such liability during the last decade, or whether, as is the case of the defendants at bar, such agencies are uninsured, in the last analysis the cost of the Court\u2019s generosity today will ultimately be borne, as indeed it always is, by Michigan\u2019s beleaguered taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Purely prospective, or \"Sunburst\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> application of <em>Parker </em>would be judicial recognition of the case for what it is: judicial legislation thought by a majority of the Justices to be fairer and wiser than the old rule. Prospective application would preserve the integrity of and respect for our doctrine of stare decisis; treat all litigants heretofore concerned with this issue the same, without selective reward or disadvantage; afford public funding authorities the opportunity to prepare for the burden of ever-increasing medical malpractice litigation; and, not unimportantly, acknowledge the validity of the defendant\u2019s claim in this case that there is a basic injustice in changing the rules of the game after the final whistle is blown.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">1 recognize that during the last several months, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>in reliance upon <em>Parker </em>and without any majority statement of retroactive application, this Court has peremptorily reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals in some 17 cases<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in which our settled law acknowledging immunity was applied by that Court. We have returned those cases to the trial courts for consideration in the light of <em>Parker. </em>To have done so in those cases was error, since <em>Parker </em>made no statement as to its application, forward or backward. I decline to compound that error, however, by opting for retroactive application of the new doctrine because I believe such application to be unjust.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">For the foregoing reasons I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in these cases and declare the rule announced in <em>Parker, supra, </em>to be applicable to causes of action accruing on or after December 27, 1978, the date of decision in that case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-6\">Coleman, C.J., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-10\"> <em>Schwartz </em>is one of approximately 17 Court of Appeals decisions which were reversed by this Court upon peremptory order, citing <em>Parker </em>and giving it retroactive effect without saying so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> <em>Great Northern R Co v Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co, </em>287 US 358, 365; 53 S Ct 145; 77 L Ed 360 (1932) (Cardozo, J.):</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">\"The common law as administered by [a state\u2019s] judges ascribes to the decisions of [its] highest court a power to bind * * * that is unextinguished, for intermediate transactions, by a decision overruling them.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em> Snow v Freeman, 405 </em>Mich 837; <em>Schwartz v Detroit, </em>405 Mich 839; <em>Jackson v Sturgis, </em>405 Mich 839; <em>Tauber </em>v <em>Highland Park General Hospital, </em>405 Mich 840; <em>Colby v Wayne County General Hospital, </em>405 Mich 840; <em>Thorpe v Wayne County General Hospital, </em>406 Mich 855; <em>Poulos v Outer Drive Hospital, </em>406 Mich 855; <em>Martin v River Dist Community Hospital Authority, </em>406 Mich 856; <em>Mieksztyn v Sarragh, </em>406 Mich 856; <em>Decker v Outer Drive Hospital, </em>406 Mich 857; <em>Robb v Pontiac General Hospital, </em>406 Mich 858; <em>Brown v Detroit, </em>406 Mich 859; <em>Ricca v Hug, </em>406 Mich 860; <em>Raines v City of Flint, </em>406 Mich 865; <em>Thomas v Wyandotte General Hospital, </em>406 Mich 865; <em>Montie v Wayne County General Hospital, 406 </em>Mich 867; <em>Warfield v Wyandotte, </em>406 Mich 904.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
