They contend that the statute is void for vagueness and because it deprives them of equal protection of the law. Woll further contends that the statute is inapplicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We hold:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">1) The Legislature intended that the statute apply to workers\u2019 compensation cases, at least where the claim arises out of an accident. Because of ambiguity in the expression the statute did not, however, provide the notice requisite for a criminal statute that workers\u2019 compensation claims were within its ambit. We therefore give prospective effect only to our construction that the statute applies to the solicitation of workers\u2019 compensation cases arising out of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">2) The limitation to prosecution of personal injury claims does not deny equal protection of the law. The Legislature could properly conclude that solicitation of personal injury claims presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>risk of harm significantly different from solicitation of other legal business, including personal injury defense, and that a special criminal disincentive was needed to discourage such behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">3) While the statute may be unconstitutional because of overbreadth, the overbreadth can be cured by a limiting construction. The statute when so construed can be applied retroactively to the complained-of conduct, because, although the statute is overbroad, it provided adequate warning that it proscribed in-person solicitation of the kind that the Legislature can prohibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">4) The indictments must, however, be dismissed because the grand juries\u2019 assessment of the evidence had not theretofore been circumscribed by a construction limiting the grand juries\u2019 discretion; the grand juries, applying a literal construction of the statute, may have indicted and an amended indictment may have been filed for conduct protected by the First Amendment. Since the statute provided adequate warning that it proscribed conduct that can be prohibited, dismissal is without prejudice to reindictment after a limiting construction is placed on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">5) None of the parties have considered in their briefs what would constitute a proper limiting construction. Woll sought a declaratory judgment. We remand his case to the Court of Appeals so that it can determine a limiting construction consistent with the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The Court of Appeals held the statute unconstitutional in <em>Posner </em>and <em>Keane </em>and constitutional in <em>Woll. </em>We granted leave to appeal to resolve the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>conflict, limited to whether the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad in that it infringes protected areas of freedom of speech and expression, and whether it violates the equal protection guarantees of the Michigan and United States constitutions and, in <em>Woll, </em>additionally, to whether the statute applies to workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">\n<em>Posner and Keane</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Posner and Keane were indicted by a citizens\u2019 grand jury on a charge of conspiracy to solicit personal injury claims. After preliminary examination they were bound over for trial and an amended indictment was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">The Recorder\u2019s Court denied motions to dismiss which alleged that the statute is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection and is vague in failing to give adequate notice of its proscription and in being overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Court of Appeals granted interlocutory appeal. Without reaching the equal protection claim, it held that the statute is unconstitutionally over-broad, and dismissed the indictment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">\n<em>Woll</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">Woll filed a complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the Attorney General and Wayne County Prosecuting Attorney. He alleged that he is an attorney engaged in a personal injury and workers\u2019 compensation practice, that an actual controversy exists because any attorney engaged in such a practice would be liable for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>prosecution under the statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, additionally, because there was already underway an inquiry into his activities by a law enforcement agency.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Woll claimed that the statute is unconstitutional because it denies equal protection of the law and because it is vague in i) failing to provide adequate notice of the conduct prohibited, ii) infringing on protected areas of speech (overbreadth) and iii) conferring excess discretion on governmental authorities. Woll also sought to have the statute, if constitutional, construed as inapplicable to workers\u2019 compensation cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">Within the month, Woll was indicted by a citizens\u2019 grand jury on charges of solicitation of personal injury claims, conspiracy to solicit personal injury claims, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The following day the Attorney General filed a counterclaim in Woll\u2019s declaratory judgment action asking the court to construe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>statute in \"a manner consistent\u201d with the constitutions of the United States and Michigan.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\">The circuit court held that the statute denied equal protection of the law and was unconstitutionally overbroad. The Court of Appeals held that the facial overbreadth doctrine is inapplicable to a statute addressed to commercial speech<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that the statute as applied to Woll is not unconstitutional on vagueness or equal protection grounds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Woll contends that the statute does not prohibit the solicitation of workers\u2019 compensation claims. He argues that it \"should be construed in a narrow manner, consistent with the doctrine that penal statutes are to be strictly construed, so that the [statutory] term 'person injured as the result of an accident\u2019 does not apply to workers\u2019 compensation cases\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The statute applies to \"[a] person * * * who shall * * * solicit a person injured as the result of an accident * * * for the purpose of representing that person in making a claim for damages or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>prosecuting an action or causes of action arising out of a personal injury claim * * *\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Woll contends that the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is a specific statute which comprehensively addresses the entire subject matter of workers\u2019 compensation claims and a general statute such as the solicitation statute does not apply. This aid to construction is inapplicable<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> where, as here, there is no conflict between the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Similarly, while a criminal statute is strictly construed,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we understand that to mean only that persons are entitled to fair warning that the conduct is proscribed and that the courts will not by construction stretch the meaning beyond the terms of the statute to include conduct outside the legislative intendment. \"The rule of strict construction confines an offense to the words of the statute, but it permits the words not only to be read naturally but to be given a meaning in harmony with the purpose and intent of the law as far as may be done without distortion of language.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In construing a criminal statute, as any other statute, we seek to determine and implement the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">As originally enacted in 1912,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Worker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Disability Compensation Act covered \"accidental\u201d injury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The solicitation statute, enacted in 1925,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> speaks of solicitation of a person \"injured as the result of an accident\u201d. Since the workers\u2019 compensation statute covered accidental injury, the language of the solicitation statute in terms includes the solicitation of workers\u2019 compensation claims. An injury resulting from accident undergoes no transformation when it also arises \"out of and in the course of\u2019 employment; the \"person injured\u201d is nevertheless \"injured as the result of an accident\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">The term \"personal injury claim\u201d describes a workers\u2019 compensation claim<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> as well as a claim in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">While \"action\u201d or \"causes of action\u201d sounds in common-law pleading, the alternative phrase of the solicitation statute, \"in making a claim for damages\u201d, can mean either a claim in tort or for workers\u2019 compensation. An injured worker who has suffered a specific loss or who requires medical attention or is disabled from earning wages has suffered \"damages\u201d no less than if the workers\u2019 compensation act had not been enacted and his claim for recovery could only be asserted in a court of law. Although a worker seeks \"compensation\u201d rather than a money judgment, he asserts a \"claim for damages\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Woll argues that whatever rationales support the general prohibition, they are inapposite to workers\u2019 compensation because attorneys\u2019 fees in workers\u2019 compensation cases are supervised.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>attorney fees have always been subject to judicial supervision and contingent fees in personal injury suits are now regulated by court rule.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">There is no contemporaneous legislative history or construction by a court on the question whether the solicitation statute applies to workers\u2019 compensation cases. Because it appears to have been primarily directed to the solicitation of claims brought in a court of law its meaning could be confined to the solicitation of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">We perceive, however, a larger legislative purpose, one directed to the protection of injured persons against importuning, the protection of defendants against those who would drum up claims and the protection of the judicial system from being overloaded with claims which otherwise would not be presented. If the scope of the statute were limited to the precise evil which apparently occasioned its enactment (the solicitation of automobile negligence claims), it arguably would not apply to the solicitation of cases which were not major sources of litigation or the entitlements for which did not exist at the time of its enactment, <em>e.g., </em>product liability and malpractice cases and no-fault automobile actions against an insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The risks of importuning of clients and fomentation of litigation are as real in the workers\u2019 compensation area as in general personal injury litigation. Crowded dockets are a problem in the workers\u2019 compensation field as well as in general personal injury litigation. As with other personal injury claims, insubstantial workers\u2019 compensation claims have coercive value as \"nuisance suits\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">We are persuaded that, absent some evidence or a contemporaneous construction that the Legisl\u00e1<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>ture did not intend to include the solicitation of personal injury claims for which recovery could be sought under the workers\u2019 compensation statute, we should construe the solicitation statute to include the solicitation of such claims because they are within the policy underlying the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\">While we conclude that the statute is directed to the solicitation of workers\u2019 compensation claims as well as tort claims, we concede that a different construction could be placed upon the statute. It is especially important that a criminal statute provide fair warning of the conduct proscribed so that persons affected can conform their conduct to the statutory requirement. Fairness requires that the construction that the solicitation of workers\u2019 compensation claims is included be given prospective effect only.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">We address next the contention that the solicitation statute denies equal protection of the law<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in that it singles out solicitation of personal injury claims, leaving all other forms of solicitation of employment by attorneys untouched.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">When a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds, the first and, some have said, the decisive question, is the appropriate test \u2014 minimum rationality, means scrutiny or strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Woll </em>(the issue was not reached in <em>Posner </em>and <em>Keane) </em>applied the tradi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>tional minimum rationality test as did the judges who first considered the challenge. Under that test a statute will be upheld if the challenged classification bears a rational relation to a legitimate state interest.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We are urged to apply the \"strict scrutiny\u201d (\"compelling state interest\u201d) test,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> on the ground that the statute interferes with First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">It is not contended that \"strict scrutiny\u201d is triggered whenever a statute regulates speech or conduct within the scope of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Rather, it is claimed that the classification represents a direct interference with protected freedoms because it is based on the content of the speech \u2014 a proposal to provide representation in prosecuting a personal injury claim is banned, but a proposal to provide representation in any other sort of lawsuit is permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In <em>Police Dep\u2019t of Chicago v Mosley</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>States Supreme Court indicated that the state must show a compelling state interest to justify discrimination based on content.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> But the activity regulated in <em>Mosley </em>\u2014 protest through peaceful picketing \u2014 lies near the core of First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>guarantees. The Court\u2019s concern about government interference with the free flow of ideas was central to the Court\u2019s decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">\"To permit the continued building of our politics and culture, and to assure self-fulfillment for each individual, our people are guaranteed the right to express any thought, free from government censorship. The essence of this forbidden censorship, is content control. Any restriction on expressive activity because of its content would completely undercut the 'profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u2019 \u2019,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The solicitation statute simply does not implicate the interests the Court protected in <em>Mosley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">It is urged, citing <em>Button,</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> Trainmen,</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> United Mine Workers,</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>United Transportation Union,</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that equally important First Amendment interests are involved in the regulation of attorney solicitation. In <em>Button </em>the civil rights litigation solicited was itself a form of political expression. In the other three cases the associational rights of the clients, members of labor unions, were involved. Here, however, it is apparent that the solicitation charges grew out of proposed commercial transactions not involving associational rights or political expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">In commercial speech, the speaker \"does not wish to editorialize on any subject, cultural, philosophical, or political. He does not wish to report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>any particular newsworthy fact, or to make generalized observations even about commercial matters.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has cautioned against hasty application of First Amendment precedents to such speech.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> It has also indicated that in-person solicitation merits even less protection than other forms of commercial speech.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In light of the lesser protection given to solicitation, we conclude that <em>Mosley </em>does not require \"strict scrutiny\u201d of the solicitation statute.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although First Amendment protection has been extended to some forms of solicitation by attorneys, in-person solicitation in a commercial context is not accorded protection as a fundamental right<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> and, hence, does not trigger strict scrutiny of a statute regulating such conduct when it has been challenged on equal protection grounds. We hold that the statute should be tested against the ra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tional relationship standard applicable to economic legislation generally: The inquiry is whether \"the classification challenged [is] rationally related to a legitimate state interest\u201d.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">It is asserted that the solicitation statute is unconstitutional under any equal protection standard because the special treatment of personal injury claims is arbitrary and capricious. We conclude that the classification is rationally related to interests which the state may legitimately advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">We turn first to an identification of the interests sought to be advanced by the solicitation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">In <em>Ohralik v Ohio State Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>436 US 447, 460; 98 S Ct 1912; 56 L Ed 2d 444 (1978), the United States Supreme Court said that \"[i]n addition to its general interest in protecting consumers and regulating commercial transactions, the State bears a special responsibility for maintaining standards among members of the licensed professions\u201d.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It continued that protection of the public from those aspects of solicitation involving \"fraud, undue influence, intimidation, overreaching, and other forms of 'vexatious conduct\u2019 \u201d is a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>state interest.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The Court said that in-person solicitation may \"provide a one-sided presentation\u201d and \"encourage speedy and perhaps uninformed decisionmaking\u201d without \"an opportunity for comparison or reflection\u201d and \"critical comparison of the 'availability, nature, and prices\u2019 of legal services.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Court also said that there is a risk that the lawyer\u2019s pecuniary self-interest will interfere with his exercise of judgment on behalf of his client.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In <em>Kelley v Judge of Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit, </em>239 Mich 204, 212-213; 214 NW 316; 53 ALR 273 (1927), in rejecting an equal protection challenge to the solicitation statute, this Court did not specifically identify the interest sought to be advanced by the statute. It did indicate, however, that personal injury claims were \"inviting to litigation and exploitation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\"><em>Hightower v Detroit Edison Co, </em>262 Mich 1, 7-8; 247 NW 97; 86 ALR 509 (1933), subsequently listed the following evils associated with \"ambulance chasing\u201d: \"(1) fomenting litigation with resultant burdens on the courts and public purse, (2) subor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>nation of perjury, (3) mulcting of innocent persons by judgments, upon manufactured causes of action and perjured testimony, and by settlements to buy peace, and (4) defrauding of injured persons having proper causes of action, but ignorant of legal rights and court procedure, by means of contracts which retain exorbitant percentages of recovery and illegal charges for court costs and expenses and by settlements made for quick return of fees and against the just rights of the injured persons.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In sum, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Ohralik, </em>identified as state interests protecting consumers, regulating commercial transactions and maintaining standards among members of the licensed professions, and this Court, in <em>Hightower, </em>spoke as well of the impact of solicitation on defendants and the judicial system resulting from drummed-up litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Neither <em>Ohralik </em>nor <em>Hightower </em>was an equal protection case; the challenge in <em>Ohralik </em>was on First Amendment grounds and <em>Hightower </em>presented a constructional issue. While equal protection analysis requires us to identify the state interest sought to be advanced by the challenged statute, since we decide that there are one or more legitimate state interests which would be furthered by this statute and that the challenged classification is sufficiently related to the furtherance of each interest, we see no need to attempt to particularize which interest \u2014 the protection of the client against overreaching by soliciting lawyers or the protection of defendants and the justice system from the fomentation of litigation \u2014 was in the forefront of the legislative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">We turn to the question whether the limitation to personal injury claims is sufficiently related to the furtherance of the state interests involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We conclude that personal injury claims as a class have distinguishing characteristics which justify special treatment in light of the state interests involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In <em>Kelley v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge </em>this Court, in rejecting an equal protection challenge to this statute, made observations concerning the special attributes of personal injury claims which are also pertinent today:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">\"[T]here exists a marked difference between injuries inflicted on the person and injuries done to property, plainly recognizable in fact and reasonably distinguishable in law. Property, whether personal or real, has as a rule some fairly determinable market value susceptible of definite proof, within limits beyond which neither evidence nor expectation can range. Market value for personal injuries is unknown. The measure of damages and rules of proof are distinctly different in injury to property and personal injury cases. Pain and suffering, disfiguration, permanency, humiliation and other personal elements foreign to property which have no distinct standard of money measurement are permissible elements of damages in the latter. This may and often does in the minds of many give rise to great expectations and surrounds such claims with a tempting atmosphere of speculation unknown to property tort actions inviting to litigation and exploitation as generally known and so indicated by the proportion of such actions crowding our courts.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">We are persuaded that there is greater likelihood of harm to the client as the result of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>solicitation of personal injury claims than of other claims. Personal injury claims, in contrast with general civil litigation and personal injury defense, are almost universally handled on a contingent fee basis and there is no fixed dollar value for the claimant\u2019s injuries. The combination of these factors creates opportunities for taking advantage of the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The absence of a fixed dollar value allows a lawyer to cloud the mind of the client with promises of large awards. Expectations may be created that cannot be realized, and the client thereby exploited. Even when there is reality to the promise, the allure of the potential gain and the absence of client financial obligation may create the belief that there is nothing to lose and everything to gain by entering into the arrangement. The client may do so without reflection and comparison. He may even feel pressured to do so for fear of losing the opportunity presented by the lawyer. As a result he may lose the opportunity for better representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Claimants in general civil litigation are less likely to be exploited by the creation of expectations that cannot be realized and, because they generally have a financial obligation to the lawyer, are more likely, as are defendants, to compare and reflect before accepting a lawyer\u2019s proposal for representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Also characteristic of personal injury practice is a high volume of claims which has substantially contributed to the overloading of the justice system and also presents problems for defendants faced with a large number of claims. The system depends upon negotiated settlement to dispose of most cases and puts defendants, as well as plaintiffs, under pressure to settle; the cost of defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>also puts pressure on defendants to settle. This characteristic of personal injury claims, in combination with the contingent fee, may encourage some lawyers to emphasize quantity rather than quality of representation, to settle claims for. less than their full value and to prepare for trial less adequately; the absence of a fixed dollar value often prevents clients from evaluating the result and detecting deficient representation. Discouraging solicitation of claims which would add to the volume may tend to improve the quality of representation. High volume coupled with contingent fee compensation of lawyers is not characteristic of general civil litigation or personal injury defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\">We are also persuaded that there is greater likelihood of harm to the justice system and defendants as the result of the solicitation of personal injury claims than of other claims. The same characteristics of the personal injury claim practice \u2014 high volume, the contingent fee, absence of a fixed standard \u2014 encourage the bringing of marginal and nuisance claims, an imposition on the justice system and defendants, especially insurers and deep pocket defendants. The pressures to settle make it impractical to insist on a disposition on the merits of all such claims. Where the claimant seeks out the lawyer it is less likely that the claim is marginal or nuisance than where the lawyer seeks out the claimant. Barring the solicitation of personal injury claims discourages the fomentation of litigation and is rationally related to a legitimate state interest in discouraging the bringing of marginal and nuisance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">In arguing that the risks of solicitation are not limited to personal injury claims, some specific points are made:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">(1) undue influence depends on the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>stances of the solicitation, and not on the type of claim being solicited \u2014 the statute does not prohibit a lawyer from approaching an injured person to solicit representation in a property damage action, but a person who has recuperated from his injury may not be approached regarding a personal injury claim;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">(2) the fomenting of litigation is possible in any context, and lawyers who bring public interest, civil rights and consumer class actions instigate lawsuits that would not otherwise be brought;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">(3) other sorts of claims, such as arson and property damage claims, are equally susceptible to being brought fraudulently; and</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">(4) unwarranted settlements may be as readily procured in stockholder derivative and consumer class actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">It is further claimed that if personal injury litigation is distinguishable, then the prohibition should extend to injury defense as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">We respond:</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">(1) Because of the contingent fee (absence of financial obligation to the lawyer) and the potential of a large award, even a healthy solicited person is less likely to make an informed decision when a personal injury claim rather than property damage or other general civil litigation is involved;</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">(2) The volume of public interest, civil rights and consumer class actions is considerably less than that of personal injury claims. Because such actions present novel and often important issues, the defendant is more likely to defend than to settle. The prospect of large pecuniary gain for the client is not the basis on which his or her participation in the action is solicited. While some such actions are brought with a view to justifying large legal fees, it is federal and state policy to encourage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>such actions as a means of enforcing statutes aimed at commercial and other practices contrary to the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\">(3) While property damage claims can be brought fraudulently, the volume of such claims has not created the same pressures to settle as personal injury claims; also, persons who have such claims are less readily found than personal injury claimants and the value of such claims is more certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">(4) There is little risk of imposition on the claimant in a stockholder derivative or consumer class action, and they do not clog the dockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In sum, it is the coincidence of many factors that distinguishes personal injury claims; pointing to particular risks of harm in other litigation, including personal injury defense, does not render the classification irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">It is also contended, based on a provision of the Revised Judicature Act<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> which voids all solicited agreements, that \u201cif the Legislature has seen fit to treat all forms of solicitation as equal in the civil arena, then a criminal defendant charged with solicitation should be given the same evenhanded treatment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">While that statute bars solicitation of any legal business and renders solicited contracts, contingent or otherwise, void, it does not follow that the classification of the solicitation statute is invalid in singling out the solicitation of personal injury claims for the additional penalties of a criminal statute. The Legislature could properly conclude that an added deterrent was necessary to discourage the solicitation of personal injury claims. A decision to solicit depends in part on an assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>ment of the likely gain and risk of loss. In most areas of litigation the threat of invalidating the contract may be sufficient to discourage the solicitation. In the personal injury area the presence of a potential for indeterminate gain, a high volume of cases making the invalidation of any single contract less important, and the absence of a fixed dollar value which might encourage clients to police the quality of representation, make the sanction of invalidation less efficacious. In addition, because most injured persons are taken to hospitals and identified, personal injury claimants are more readily solicited than general civil litigants. Also such claimants, in contrast with commercial litigants and personal injury defendants, generally do not have retained legal counsel. We conclude that the Legislature could properly decide that the invalidation of solicited contracts was not an adequate deterrent and that a special criminal disincentive was necessary to discourage the solicitation of personal injury claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We do not mean to disparage the role played by the personal injury bar. Still we must conclude that the Legislature could appropriately find that a special measure was necessary to prevent solicitation in that field.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The limitation to personal injury claims bears a rational relation to the state interests sought to be furthered by the solicitation statute. The lawyers in these cases are not denied equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We turn to the contention that the statute is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>A statute may be challenged for vagueness on the grounds that it</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">\u2014is overbroad, impinging on First Amendment freedoms, or</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">\u2014does not provide fair notice of the conduct proscribed, or</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\u2014is so indefinite that it confers unstructured and unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether an offense has been committed.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">The primary challenge is on the ground of over-breadth.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">It is asserted that</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">\u2014the prohibition against solicitation would allow application of the statute to activities meant to advance valid associational interests found to be protected in the <em>United Transportation </em>Union<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and other cases<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> and to a form of political expression found to be protected in <em>In re </em>Primus<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> and <em>National Ass\u2019n for the Advancement of Colored People v Button, </em>371 US 415; 83 S Ct 328; 9 L Ed 2d 405 (1963), and_</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>\u2014the prohibition against \"directly or indirectly soliciting\u201d could reach truthful advertising given First Amendment protection in <em>Bates v State Bar of Arizona,</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">\u2014in the context of in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain, the blanket prohibition is too broad because under <em>Ohralik,</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>such activities can be proscribed only when done in circumstances that present a significant danger of overreaching or undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">An overbreadth challenge does not require that the challenger show he is injured by the overinclusiveness of the statute. He can rely on the rights of hypothetical third persons and may obtain a declaration of the statute\u2019s non-enforceability without showing that the conduct he himself engaged in is constitutionally protected. An over-breadth challenge thus does not depend on the factual context of the case at hand. It is irrelevant that the litigant himself is charged under the statute with expression or conduct different than those he asserts the statute overinclusively proscribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">A successful overbreadth challenge thus permits a person charged with speech or conduct violative of a statute to escape punishment based on the First Amendment rights of others impinged upon by the statute although under a narrower, properly drawn statute, his speech or conduct could be punished because it is not so protected. Accordingly, it would be no answer to the overbreadth challenge that the solicitations here represented a significant danger of overreaching or undue influence and were not meant to advance valid associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>tional interests and were not a form of political expression and were not truthful advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\">It is \"because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute\u2019s very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression\u201d, that the Court does not inquire whether the litigant\u2019s \"own rights of free expression are violated\u201d.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">But not every First Amendment right supports an overbreadth challenge. In <em>Bates </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the overbreadth doctrine does not apply \"to professional advertising, a context where it is not necessary to further its intended objective\u201d. The Court reasoned that \"[s]ince advertising is linked to commercial well-being, it seems unlikely that such speech is particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation\u201d.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In <em>Ohralik </em>the United States Supreme Court declared that the lawyer could not \"make a successful overbreadth argument in view of the Court\u2019s observation in <em>Bates\u201d, </em>and said: \"Commercial speech is not as likely to be deterred as noncommercial speech, and therefore does not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>quire the added protection afforded by the over-breadth approach\u201d.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\">Accordingly, the overbreadth challenge here based on <em>Bates </em>and <em>Ohralik </em>must be rejected because the United States Supreme Court has held that the overbreadth doctrine has no application to commercial speech of the kind involved in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">This still leaves the question whether an over-breadth challenge may be advanced based on the associational rights protected in <em>United Transportation Union </em>and the rights of political expression protected in <em>Primus </em>and <em>Button.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In <em>Broadrick v Oklahoma, </em>413 US 601, 615-616; 93 S Ct 2908; 37 L Ed 2d 830 (1973), the United States Supreme Court declared that \"where <em>conduct </em>and not merely speech is involved, we believe that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) Applying the real and substantial test, the Court concluded that the statute there presented was \"not substantially overbroad and that whatever overbreadth may exist should be cured through case-by-case analysis of the fact situations to which its sanctions, assertedly, may not be applied\u201d.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">In a subsequent case, the Court indicated that the exhibition of motion pictures is conduct as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>as speech. It concluded that the deterrent effect of an ordinance prohibiting the showing of films containing nudity by a drive-in movie theater when its screen is visible from a public street or place was \"both real and substantial\u201d, and that the statute was void for overbreadth.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-3\">Recently, in rejecting a challenge to the constitutionality of an ordinance zoning adult theaters, the Court emphasized still another factor in deciding that the overbreadth challenge was insubstantial. The Court said that the exception to the \"traditional rules of standing\u201d is \"justified by the overriding importance of maintaining a free and open market for the interchange of <em>ideas\". </em>(Emphasis supplied.) It concluded that the ordinance would not have a \"significant deterrent effect on the exhibition of films protected by the First Amendment\u201d. It said that there is \"a less vital interest in the uninhibited exhibition of material that is on the borderline between pornography and artistic expression than in the free dissemination of ideas of social and political significance\u201d. This was not \"the kind of threat to the free market in ideas and expression that justifies the exceptional approach to constitutional adjudication recognized\u201d in some of its earlier cases.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The associational activities protected in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number><em>Transportation Union </em>and the form of political expression protected in <em>Primus </em>and <em>Button </em>involve conduct as well as speech \u2014 the solicitation of clients, the same kind of conduct which the solicitation statute seeks to regulate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\">Accordingly we are obliged to assess the over-breadth by the real and substantial test enunciated in <em>Broadrick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We are inclined to the view that the solicitation statute does not represent \"the kind of threat to the free market in ideas and expression that justifies the exceptional approach to constitutional adjudication recognized\u201d in some of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">That Court\u2019s decision in <em>United Transportation Union </em>holding that an injunction based on this very solicitation statute was unconstitutional, and its observation that \"the principle here involved cannot be limited to the facts of this case\u201d,<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> makes it highly unlikely that any union would be deterred from engaging in the activities found there to be protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">One must strain to imagine a case in which prosecuting a claim based on injury from an accident would be a form of political expression of the kind protected in <em>Primus </em>and <em>Button.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">It appears therefore that the overbreadth challenges based on <em>United Transportation Union, Primus, </em>and <em>Button </em>are not real and substantial. We do not, however, place our holding on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Any overbreadth of the solicitation statute can be cured by a limiting construction._</p>\n<p id=\"b649-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>In <em>Broadrick </em>the United States Supreme Court said that \"[application of the overbreadth doctrine in this manner is, manifestly, strong medicine. It has been employed by the Court sparingly and <em>only as a last resort. Facial overbreadth has. not been invoked when a limiting construction has been or could be placed on the challenged statute.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">We are unpersuaded by the argument that a limiting construction should not be placed on the solicitation statute because so much rewriting would be necessary that we would be intruding on the legislative function. Our construction does not involve rewriting but, rather, a statement of exceptions to the statute\u2019s otherwise blanket prohibitions. It is no intrusion on the power of the Legislature to engraft exceptions to a broad prohibition when no violence is done to the Legislature\u2019s central intent and when without such exceptions the statute must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">We find this case analogous to <em>People v Bricker.</em><footnotemark><em>58</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Bricker, prosecuted under the criminal abortion statute,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> resisted prosecution on the ground that although the statute prohibited all abortions the United States Supreme Court had held that the state could not prohibit abortions in certain circumstances.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> We said that we are bound to preserve the constitutionality of statutes by construction, if possible, and that prior constructions are not controlling. We concluded that a construction consistent with the legislative intent could be applied:_</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number><em>\u2019\u2019When the Legislature adopted the statutes prohibiting most abortions there was little or no reason to question their constitutionality. </em>The medical and other developments which influenced the United States Supreme Court to decide <em>Roe [v Wade, </em>410 US 113; 93 S Ct 705; 35 L Ed 2d 147 (1973)] and <em>Doe [v Bolton, 410 </em>US 179; 93 S Ct 739; 35 L Ed 2d 201 (1973)] as it did were far ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\"The central purpose of this legislation is clear enough \u2014 to prohibit all abortions except those required to preserve the health of the mother. <em>The Supreme Court now requires other exceptions. </em>They can properly be read into the statutes to preserve their constitutionality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\"In light of the declared public policy of this state [to prosecute abortion] and the changed circumstances resulting from the federal constitutional doctrine elucidated in <em>Roe </em>and <em>Doe, </em>we construe \u00a7 14 of the penal code to mean that the prohibition of this section shall not apply to 'miscarriages\u2019 authorized by a pregnant woman\u2019s attending physician in the exercise of his medical judgment; the effectuation of the decision to abort is also left to the physician\u2019s judgment; however, a physician may not cause a miscarriage after viability except where necessary, in his medical judgment, to preserve the life or health of the mother.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">So, too, with the solicitation statute, there was little or no reason to question its constitutionality at inception.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> It admitted of no exceptions, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>United States Supreme Court now requires that some be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-3\">Earlier in this opinion we identified protection of the client against overreaching by lawyers and the protection of defendants and the justice system from the fomentation of litigation as possible legislative purposes of the solicitation statute. The exception which we now engraft onto the statute to meet the requirements of the United States Supreme Court is consonant with both purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">We construe the solicitation statute to mean</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>that its prohibition applies only to solicitations which are done primarily to advance the pecuniary interest of a lawyer who solicits or in whose interest solicitation is committed.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>C</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The lawyers here cannot seriously contend that they did not have fair notice of the statute\u2019s proscription.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Again, we find <em>Bricker </em>controlling. The defendant in that case was not a physician and therefore the <em>Roe </em>and Doe<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> abortion decisions gave no protection to his conduct. His conduct legitimately could be punished, and he had adequate notice that the Legislature had chosen to punish it. His conviction was therefore affirmed.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Reliance on <em>People v </em>Dempster<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> is misplaced. That case concerned the construction of the words \"commercial paper\u201d in the Uniform Securities Act.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We read the commercial paper exemption in light of the purpose of the Uniform Securities Act, and concluded that the exemption applied to a smaller class of documents than that encompassed by the definition of \"commercial paper\u201d in \u00a7 3-805 of the Uniform Commercial Code. We held, though, that this new construction could have prospective application only, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-7\">\"This Court is not able, within the bounds of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>process, to 'interpret\u2019 a criminal statute which contains an ambiguous exemption such that it results in conviction of the defendant charged in the specific case. That is not the 'fair warning\u2019 demanded by the Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">That the bar on retrospective application operates only when there is an issue of \"fair notice\u201d is made clear by the Court\u2019s citation of Freund, <em>The Supreme Court and Civil Liberties, </em>4 Vand L Rev 533, 541 (1951):<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">\"The objection of vagueness is twofold: inadequate guidance to the individual whose conduct is regulated, and inadequate guidance to the triers of fact. <em>The former objection </em>could not be cured retrospectively by a ruling either of the trial court or the appellate court, though it might be cured for the future by an authoritative judicial gloss.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Where \"fair notice\u201d is not an issue, retroactive application is permitted.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">We do find, however, that due process rights would be violated unless a limiting construction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>applied before prosecution. It was noted at the outset that there are three species of vagueness challenges.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> We have rejected the claim that this statute, even absent construction, fails to give adequate notice of the conduct proscribed.. We have also held that the overbreadth challenge, to the extent based upon <em>United Transportation Union </em>and <em>Primus </em>and <em>Button, </em>failed because of the limiting construction we place on the statute. No limiting construction was necessary to address the overbreadth challenge based on <em>Bates </em>and <em>Ohralik </em>because the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\">Nonetheless, a limiting construction, making the statute expressly inapplicable to activities protected by <em>Bates </em>and <em>Ohralik, </em>is necessary to prevent violation of a due-process right akin to that which protects one from application of a law so indefinite that it confers unstructured and unlimited discretion on the trier of fact to determine whether an offense has been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">If prosecution were to proceed without benefit of a limiting construction, a person might be convicted for acts within the literal terms of the solicitation statute which cannot, by reason of <em>Bates </em>and <em>Ohralik, </em>be proscribed. Unless the trier of fact has been apprised of the limiting construction, it cannot properly be said that either its assessment of the evidence or its finding was guided by such construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In <em>Shuttlesworth v </em>Birmingham<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> the United States Supreme Court reversed a conviction based on an ordinance prohibiting persons from standing on a sidewalk in such a way as to obstruct free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>passage, or from standing on a sidewalk after having been requested by any police officer to move on. As written, the ordinance suffered from an obvious constitutional defect.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The Alabama Supreme Court subsequently construed the ordinance always to require a showing that the accused blocked free passage. The United States Supreme Court concluded that, although the ordinance was not unconstitutional as construed, the defendant\u2019s conviction should be reversed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\"In any event, the trial court in the present case was without guidance from any state appellate court as to the meaning of the ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">\"The trial court made no findings of fact and rendered no opinion. For all that appears, the court may have found the petitioner guilty only by applying the literal \u2014 and unconstitutional \u2014 terms of the ordinance. * * * Because we are unable to say that the Alabama courts in this case did not judge the petitioner by an unconstitutional construction of the ordinance, the petitioner\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 1142 cannot stand.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-7\"><em>Shuttlesworth </em>was applied in <em>Ashton v Kentucky.</em><footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The defendant was convicted of common-law criminal libel. The trial judge charged that the offense is committed by publication of any writing \u201ccalculated to create disturbances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>peace, corrupt the public morals, or lead to any act, which, when done, is indictable\u201d. The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, but redefined the crime as publication of a defamatory falsehood, with malice; it ruled that criminal liability could not be predicated on a breach of peace. Reversing the conviction, the United States Supreme Court cited <em>Shuttlesworth </em>for the proposition that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">\"where an accused is tried and convicted under a broad construction of an act which would make it unconstitutional, the conviction cannot be sustained on appeal by a limiting construction which eliminates the unconstitutional features of the act, as the trial took place under the unconstitutional construction of the act.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In addition to the risk that a defendant might be convicted without a finding that he engaged in prohibited conduct there is the risk that a belated construction may deprive a defendant of an opportunity to make out a valid defense.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">The indictment charging Posner and Keane with violation of the solicitation statute merely states the grand jury\u2019s conclusion, and gives no indication of the nature of the activities the grand jury found probable cause to believe had occurred. For all that appears, that grand jury may have only found that they engaged in conduct, albeit within the literal scope of the statute, too innocuous to prohibit consistent with <em>Ohralik. </em>We believe that the concerns voiced in <em>Shuttlesworth </em>and <em>Ashton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>prevent Posner and Keane from being forced to stand trial without a grand jury having found probable cause to believe a violation of the statute, as construed, occurred.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> For this reason, the indictment must be quashed, without prejudice to reindictment on the basis of the statute as construed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Count I of Woll\u2019s indictment charges conspiracy to solicit personal injury claims and Count II charges solicitation of personal injury claims. The second paragraph of Count I describes some activities with particularity; all the activity so described centers on the solicitation of workers\u2019 compensation claims. We have held that the application of the solicitation statute to workers\u2019 compensation will be prospective only. To the extent, if at all, the indictment concerns the solicitation of non-workers\u2019 compensation personal injury claims it also fails to give any indication of the nature of the activities the grand jury found probable cause to believe occurred. Woll\u2019s indictment should therefore also be dismissed, again without prejudice to reindictment for the solicitation of non-workers\u2019 compensation personal injury claims.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Woll sought a declaratory judgment and the Attorney General counterclaimed seeking a limiting construction of the statute. The parties limited their argument to the issue of facial invalidity, and did not address the question of how the statute should properly be read should that argument fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">At this time we can provide only a partial limiting construction. Because of <em>Bates, </em>we hold that the solicitation statute does not apply to truthful advertising by a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Ohralik </em>that in-person solicitation for pecuniary gain could be prohibited as a prophylactic measure in circumstances in which there is a risk of overreaching, undue influence, or other evils.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The implication of the Court\u2019s holding is that such solicitation cannot be punished unless it occurs in circumstances presenting such risks. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>task, then, is to define what circumstances can be said to present risks of the evils that the state may legitimately attempt to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We have previously determined that the prophylactic measure cannot be so broad as to prohibit all lawyer solicitation for remuneration. In <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Jaques (On Remand),</em><footnotemark><em>81</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Jaques did not directly approach potential clients; instead, he was found to have asked a union official to recommend his services to others. We held that the disciplinary rule could not reach such conduct because in that situation there was no significant danger of overreaching.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\"><em>Ohralik </em>still might be read as allowing a prohibition of all communications with potential clients by the lawyer or someone acting solely for him, but even this may be too broad a proscription.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Consider, for example, a runner who distributes business cards. One might say that <em>Ohralik </em>protects such conduct because the potential client has an opportunity to reflect before calling the lawyer.

The situation in <em>Marchetti v United States, </em>390 US 39, 59-60; 88 S Ct 697; 19 L Ed 2d 889 (1968), was altogether different:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">\"[T]he imposition of use-restrictions would directly preclude effectuation of a significant element of Congress\u2019 purposes in adopting the wagering taxes. Moreover, the imposition of such restrictions would necessarily oblige state prosecuting authorities to establish in each case that their evidence was untainted by any connection with information obtained as a consequence of the wagering taxes; the federal requirements would thus be protected only at the cost of hampering, perhaps seriously, enforcement of state prohibitions against gambling. <em>We cannot know how Congress would assess the competing demands of the federal treasury and of state gambling prohibitions; </em>we are however, entirely certain that the Constitution has entrusted to Congress, and not to this Court, the task of striking an appropriate balance among such values. We therefore must decide that it would be improper for the Court to impose restrictions of the kind urged by the United States.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b652-5\"> The Supreme Court observed in <em>In re Primus, </em>fn 47 <em>supra, </em>p 438, fn 32, that \"[n]ormally the purpose or motive of the speaker is not central to First Amendment protection, but it does bear on the distinction between conduct that is 'an associational aspect of \"expression\u201d \u2019 * * * and other activity subject to plenary regulation by government. * * * In <em>Ohralik v State Bar Ass\u2019n, [supra], </em>the lawyer was not engaged in associational activity for the advancement of beliefs and ideas; his purpose was the advancement of his own commercial interests. The line, based in part on the motive of the speaker and the character of the expressive activity, will not always be easy to draw, * * * but that is no reason for avoiding the undertaking.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The limitation announced in the text is based on our reading of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court and is designed to remove from the prohibition of the statute those activities protected by the <em>Button </em>through <em>Primus </em>line of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">If the bringing of the lawsuit which is the object of the solicitation is, for the lawyer or his organization, a form of political expression, then the primary purpose of the solicitation is not the advancement of the lawyer\u2019s pecuniary interest, so the statute would not apply to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">Similarly, where an association operates a <em>bona Bde </em>legal assistance or referral program, the resulting solicitations sure done to advance the First Amendment associational interests of that association or its members, and therefore are not done primarily to advance a lawyer\u2019s pecuniary interests; the attorney who participates in a <em>bona Bde </em>program of this sort shares in the association\u2019s First Amendment protection even if he personally participates solely for his own pecuniary gain.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">Even if the unifying purpose of an organization is ultimately the advancement of its members\u2019 pecuniary interests, the legal programs it sponsors may still be beyond the reach of the statute. See, <em>e.g., International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America v National Right to Work Legal Defense &amp; Educational Foundation, Inc, </em>192 US App DC 23; 590 F2d 1139 (1978) (Right to Work Foundation, which sponsors litigation by union members against unions that represent Foundation contributor\u2019s employees may still be a <em>bona Bde </em>independent legal aid organization). The statute would apply, however, to an association that \" 'is a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt\u2019 * * * by a group of attorneys to evade a valid state rule against solicitation for pecuniary gain\u201d. <em>In re Primus, supra, </em>p 428, fn 20 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Union members have a First Amendment right to work for their mutual aid and protection, and because of this the activities of a union official acting as a liaison between union members and attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>neys chosen by the union are not within the scope of the statute even if the official is remunerated for services so performed. <em>United Transportation Union, </em>fn 45 <em>supra. </em>But the activities of all those who can point to affiliation with a labor union are not necessarily beyond the statute\u2019s reach: where the official\u2019s pecuniary involvement so overwhelms his role as union representative that he properly can be termed an agent solely of the attorney and not of the union, claims based on First Amendment associational rights might be dismissed as pretext.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b653-9\"> The trial court properly rejected the claim that the statute is so poorly drafted that it is utterly incomprehensible to a man of reasonable intelligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\"> See fn 60, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b653-11\"> In <em>People v Howell, </em>396 Mich 16, 24-29; 238 NW2d 148 (1976), we affirmed a conviction for acts antedating construction of a previously vague statute.
