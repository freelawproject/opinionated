The said defendant forwarded the said check to the plaintiff with directions that he should pay the proceeds thereof to a Mr. Hain. The said plaintiff avers that immediately upon the receipt of said check he did pay to the said Hain, as requested, the sum of $280, whereupon the said defendant became liable to pay to the said plaintiff the amount of said check, which, however, he has failed to do, and hence the plaintiff brings this suit to recover the amount of said check, to wit, $280, plus the protest charges, $2.06, together with interest thereon from June 3, 1909.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-8\">The affidavit of defense was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-9\">Deponent says that no liability is imposed upon this deponent by reason of the making of said check and the same does not constitute an obligation or a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s statement of demand is defective and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>insufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover thereon by reason of the omission therefrom of formal averments.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_s\">November 21, 1910:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-4\">That while it is averred that deponent forwarded the said check with directions to pay the proceeds as therein stated, yet it is not alleged whether said directions were verbal or written and if in writing no copy thereof is attached to plaintiff\u2019s statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-5\">Deponent further avers that the alleged payment of said money upon the alleged request of deponent imposed no liability upon deponent for payment thereof to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-6\">Deponent denies that he made any such request to the plaintiff or that the plaintiff expended any of said moneys as he has alleged he did.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-7\">All of which facts are true and deponent expects to be able to prove the same on the trial of this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-8\">The court made absolute rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-10\"><em>Charles L.

The error assigned is to the action of the court in making absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>first proposition presented by the appellant is that the statement of claim is defective and insufficient. The procedure Act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 27, requires that the declaration \u201cshall consist of a concise statement of the plaintiff\u2019s demand\u201d and that in the action of assumpsit it shall be replied to by affidavit. The plaintiff having filed his statement one of the things to be considered by the defendant when called upon to reply under oath was the sufficiency of the statement and if it was deemed insufficient the defendant should have raised the objection in the nature of a demurrer in the reply filed thereto. This would have given the plaintiff notice of the objection to the statement and would have enabled the court to determine its sufficiency at the threshold of the litigation. The objection was not made in the affidavit of defense and it would be unjust to the court below and the plaintiff to consider that question on this appeal. Having entered a general defense on the merits of the case it is too late now for the first time to object to the form of the statement: Heller v. Royal Ins. Co., 151 Pa. 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">As to the sufficiency of the affidavit of defense it must be said that the greater part of it is vague, evasive and wholly insufficient. It contains one averment, however, which we think entitles the defendant to be\u2019 heard by a jury. The statement after setting forth the fact of the presentation of the check by the plaintiff to the bank on which it was drawn and the refusal of the bank to pay because payment thereon had been stopped declares that \u201cthe said defendant forwarded the said check to the plaintiff with directions that he should pay the proceeds thereof to a Mr. Hain. The plaintiff avers that immediately upon the receipt of said check he did pay to the said Hain as requested the sum of $280, whereupon the said defendant became liable to pay to the said plaintiff the amount of said check\u201d etc. The consideration for the check is thus set up and the request by the defendant to the plaintiff to pay the amount of the check to Hain and the payment of that amount to him by the plaintiff become material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>facts in the case. If the check was given to secure the plaintiff for the payment of the sum named to Hain and the amount was not so paid the plaintiff would not have a right of action against the defendant so far as the statement discloses a cause of action. To this averment of the declaration the defendant makes reply in the affidavit that he did not make any such request to the plaintiff as is set forth in the declaration and he denies that the plaintiff expended any money on his account as alleged in the statement. This, we think, is a sufficient denial that the defendant requested the plaintiff to pay out money on his account to Hain or that any money was so paid out by the plaintiff. Criticism is made by the learned counsel for the appellee of the use of the word \u201csuch\u201d in connection with the request of the plaintiff and of the use of the word \u201cexpended\u201d and our attention is called to the probability that the defendant used these words evasively, but this involves too great a refinement of construction when applied to an affidavit of defense. Giving to the whole paragraph of the affidavit the plain and ordinary significance which its language suggests it is a denial of the existence of the consideration on which the plaintiff rests his right to recover and as the plaintiff\u2019s claim is based wholly on the fact that he paid out the amount stated in the check at the request and by the direction of the defendant we feel constrained to hold that this part of the affidavit is sufficient to put the plaintiff on proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the record remitted with a procedendo.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
