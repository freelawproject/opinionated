She said to him in substance, \u2018Well, don\u2019t whimper or whine about it; go and take it.\u2019 And he did. And so when O. J. Gunning, the lessee of the defendant\u2019s mill, had made repairs and put in his machinery preparatory to beginning work of making handles, etc., he wanted, or thought he wanted more power, and cast around how it might be had, and went to Rowe Mellott, the defendant, about it. And they decided to raise the dam and take George Keefer\u2019s power: Gentlemen of the jury, is the result of this case to be an illustration of the saying \u2018To him that hath shall be given and to him that hath not shall be taken even that he hath? \u2019 Is the little that poor George Keefer has to be given to Rowe Mellott, a man of means?\u201d</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aypa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>November 21, 1910:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-3\">Mr. Walter takes exception to these remarks of Mr. Sipes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-4\">The court admonishes Mr. Sipes not to mention anything not. in the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-5\">Mr. Walter: And now 1 move, your honor, that a juror be withdrawn and the case be continued at the costs of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b516-6\">The Court: After the statement of the court we do not deem it necessary.

Electric Motor Co., 225 Pa. 91, the court said: \u201cIt has been frequently held that in this class of cases no irregularities should be permitted which tend to inflame the prejudices of the jury against the defendant, and in a flagrant -ease this court will reverse for such error. But so much depends on the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>mediate circumstances and what may be called the atmosphere of the trial that a large discretion must be allowed to the trial judge. In the present case the action of the judge in cautioning the jury was so prompt and the withdrawal of the improper remark by counsel was so frank and unreserved that we cannot say that the judge did not use wise discretion in refusing to withdraw a juror.\u201d These remarks are peculiarly applicable to the present case when all that occurred at the time the exception was taken is considered. It was admitted at bar that immediately upon objection being made, counsel for the appellee promptly apologized and stated in the presence of the jury that he ought not to have made the remarks objected to. It appears also in the bill of exceptions, as noted in the official report of the trial, that the court at once admonished counsel not to mention what was not in the evidence, and at the same time cautioned the jury in the following explicit language: \u201cGentlemen of the jury, you will not be influenced by sympathy or consideration as between the men at all. Let him argue on the testimony of the case. That is an error. You will not consider that at all.\u201d The verdict was small, and upon consideration of those matters which do not appear in the assignment <em>ofi </em>error in connection with what does appear, and having due regard to the consideration that in the determination of such questions something must be left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, we are unable to say that reversible error was committed in overruling the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
