We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Brightstone Waterproofing, Inc. (Brightstone) was a corporation which purchased a Progressive policy in 1993 when it purchased a van. Brightstone was the only named insured on the policy. Ferrolho was not a named insured. On June 24, 1993, Ferrolho was operating the Brightstone van in New York City. While driving, he received a page on his pager. He stopped at a pay phone in order to return the page. While he was in the process of waiting for the pay phone, the vehicle was stolen. As the thief was attempting to abscond with the vehicle, Ferrolho ran after the vehicle, which became caught in traffic. He grabbed the left door handle in an attempt to enter the vehicle. As the thief pulled forward, Ferrolho fell down and sustained injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">Ferrolho concedes that the policy\u2019s liability coverage does not apply to the van because the thief was not using the vehicle with the permission of the named insured. However, Ferrolho contends that he is entitled to coverage under the uninsured motorist endorsement of the Progressive policy which provides that Progressive will \u201cpay all sums the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">Ferrolho contends that UM coverage applies in this case. Kesolution of this issue requires a determination of who is an \u201cin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>sured\u201d as well as what is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.le(2)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The Progressive policy defined an \u201cinsured\u201d as including \u201canyone else occupying a covered auto____\u201d The policy defined \u201coccupying\u201d as being \u201cin, upon, getting in, on, out or off\u2019 a vehicle. On June 24, as the thief was driving away with the van, Ferrolho grasped the vehicle\u2019s door handle, attempted to open the door and \u201cget in\u201d. Thus, Ferrolho was \u201coccupying\u201d the vehicle under the policy because he was \u201cgetting in\u201d or \u201con\u201d the van. Ferrolho was an \u201cinsured\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-l.le(2)(c) provides that an \u201c \u2018[u]ninsured motor vehicle\u2019 shall not include ... a motor vehicle owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any resident of the same household----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The pertinent policy endorsement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZs\">However, an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 or \u2018underinsured motor vehicle\u2019 does not include any vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\">1. Owned by or furnished or available for the regular use of <em>you </em>or any family member.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-13\">[emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-14\">The policy declaration page defined \u201cyou\u201d as the \u201cnamed insured\u201d on the policy. In this ease Brightstone was the named insured, not Ferrolho. Ferrolho was not a family member, and may not be considered a family member of a corporation. Ferrolho does not fit within the exclusionary language of either the policy or <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.le. Additionally, the application of UM coverage to Ferrolho\u2019s situation does not run counter to the legislative policy which inspired the exclusionary language of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-l.le. Thus, the. van was an uninsured motor vehicle under <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-l.l(e)(2)(c) and the policy language.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-15\">Thus, we conclude that Ferrolho may recover under the UM endorsement of the Progressive policy held by Brightstone. We reverse the order of the trial judge and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
