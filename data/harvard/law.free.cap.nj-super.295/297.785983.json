Loder, Sr. (Loder) and Mary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Loder appeal on the ground that the motion judge erred in concluding that Loder was a beneficiary of the charitable and educational works the church was organized to advance as required by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">On October 6, 1991, plaintiffs, along with their children and other family members, attended a church function known as the \u201cAgora\u201d festival (the festival) in Cherry Hill where they enjoyed a Greek dinner for which they were each charged a fee. Loder testified during his deposition that he learned about the festival from a newspaper advertisement and that it was not the first time he and his family had attended. The record reflects that Loder was not a member of the church, and that although he was raised as a protestant, he was not a member of any parish. Loder had gone to the church that evening \u201cto enjoy the Greek food.\u201d He testified that \u201cthroughout dinner,\u201d there were \u201cyoung girls [or children] dancing.\u201d He also testified that he and his family ate dinner in the church building rather than in the tent erected on the church grounds for that purpose. After dinner, Loder stopped at a booth to buy some ethnic food items. Immediately upon leaving the premises, as he was saying goodbye to his daughter, Loder slipped and fell off the edge of the sidewalk adjacent to the parking lot, seriously injuring himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">The church submitted an affidavit stating it \u201cis a not for profit corporation, which is tax exempt, and was organized exclusively for religion, charitable and educational purposes.\u201d The affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>further recites that the festival is an annual church event which is run as \u201ca fund raiser and to provide the general public with an insight into the rich traditions of the Hellenic [c]ulture and [Greek] Orthodox Christianity.\u201d No admission fee is charged generally, but \u201cGreek meals are sold and Greek dancers perform during the meals.\u201d Individuals who attend the festival \u201care encouraged to explore the church and the various exhibits in order to learn more about the traditions of the Hellenic [c]ulture and the [Greek] Orthodox Christianity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">At the motion, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney conceded that the church is a charitable association, arguing instead that the fund-raising aspect of the event and the fact that the festival is mainly concerned with exposing people to Greek culture, not religion, precludes the event from being considered one of the \u201ccharitable works\u201d of the church. Plaintiffs also maintained that even if the festival is considered one of the church\u2019s \u201ccharitable works,\u201d Loder was not a direct beneficiary of the works at the time of his injury. They contend that Loder\u2019s only connection with the church was his physical presence on the premises as part of a commercial venture being conducted and that he took no part in any of the charitable benefits of the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The church countered that the Greek Orthodox Church is a \u201cunique\u201d church in that it gets \u201cits beliefs from the Greek culture\u201d and that through the festival, the church is \u201ctrying to show the community at large ... the importance of the Hellenic culture in their orthodox religion.\u201d Although admitting it charges a dinner fee and that the festival is a fund raiser, the church maintained that its purpose was \u201cto turn people on to the [Greek] Orthodox Christian religion as well as the Hellenic culture itself,\u201d and therefore the festival was part of its charitable works.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Accepting the church\u2019s position, the judge found that the festival had a dual purpose: raising funds for the church and \u201cintroducing\u201d and \u201ceducating the public with regard to the Hellenic heritage and culture ... expressed ... by the types of food and the nature of the festival.... \u201d In essence, the judge determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>by attending the festival, Loder was \u201ca beneficiary, to [some] degree of the works of [the church]\u201d and that he was not a person \u201cunconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of the [church].\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7a. Consequently, the judge awarded summary judgment against plaintiffs on the ground that the church qualified for immunity from personal injury liability under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The requirements for charitable immunity under the Act direct a claimant of such immunity to demonstrate that the entity was formed for non-profit purposes; that it is organized exclusively for religious, charitable, or educational purposes; and that it promoted such purposes at the time of the injury to the plaintiff, who was then a beneficiary of its charitable works. <em>See Pelaez v. Rugby Labs., Inc., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>450, 454, 624 A.2d 1053 (Law Div.1993) (citations omitted); <em>accord Parker v. St. Stephen\u2019s Urban Dev. Corp. Inc., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 324, 579 A.2d 360 (App.Div.1990). Hence, in litigation concerning the Act, the focus is on whether the organization is a charitable association, and whether the injured plaintiff is a \u201cbeneficiary\u201d of its charitable works. <em>Rupp v. Brookdale Baptist Church, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 462-63, 577 A.2d 188 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In analyzing whether an entity qualifies for charitable immunity, the Act directs that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">[t]his act shall be deemed to be remedial and shall be liberally construed so as to afford immunity to the said corporations, societies and associations from liability as provided herein in furtherance of the public policy for the protection of nonprofit corporations, societies and associations organized for religious, charitable, educational or hospital purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-10].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\u201cCase law also reflects th[is] legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Monaghan v. Holy Trinity Church, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>594, 598, 646 A.2d 1130 (App.Div.1994). <em>See also Schultz v. Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>530, 537-38, 472 A.2d 531 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">On appeal, plaintiffs do not dispute that the church qualifies as a charitable association under the Act or that its purposes include educational, cultural, and religious aims. They remon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>strate only against the argument that the festival is a \u201cbenevolent activity\u201d or \u201ccharitable work\u201d of which Loder may be deemed a beneficiary. Relying on <em>Book v. Aguth Achim Anchai of Freehold, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>559, 245 A.2d 51 (App.Div.1968), plaintiffs argue that, in attending the festival, Loder was present solely as \u201ca patron of a church-sponsored restaurant\u201d where \u201che merely purchased a meal,\u201d much like the patron at the synagogue-sponsored bingo game in <em>Book </em>where this court concluded no charitable immunity existed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Although a church\u2019s main purpose may be to provide a place of worship and spiritual guidance,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">[its] function is not so narrowly confined. It is not limited to sectarian teaching and worship. In [the] modern view, exercises designed to aid in the advancement of the spiritual, moral ethical and cultural life of the community in general are deemed within the purview of the religious society. A social center is now commonly regarded as a proper adjunct of the local church \u2014 conducive to the public good, as well as advantageous to the congregation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\"><em>[Bianchi v. South Park Presbyterian Church, </em>123 <em>N.J.L. </em>325, 332-33, 8 <em>A.2d </em>567 (E. &amp; A.1939), <em>quoted in Anasiewicz v. Sacred Heart Church, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 537, 181 A.2d 787 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>38 <em>N.J. </em>305, 184 A.2d 419 (1962).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In <em>Bianchi, </em>a Girl Scout was injured when she fell down an unlit stairwell at a church\u2019s social center. 123 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 329, 8 A.2d 567. She was barred from recovering against the church because she was deemed a beneficiary of the church\u2019s function of promoting individual and societal enrichment. <em>Id. </em>at 332-33, 8 A.2d 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Applying the liberal view of charitable benevolence expressed in <em>Bianchi, </em>and subsequently reaffirmed in <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 537,181 A.2d 787, we conclude that Loder clearly was a beneficiary of the charitable works of the church. Without doubt, the church here was engaged in the performance of the charitable objectives it was organized to advance, inasmuch as it was attempting to demonstrate to the community the rich traditions of the Greek Orthodox Church and \u201cthe importance of the Hellenic culture in [the] orthodox religion\u201d as expressed through Greek food and dance. The fact that Loder paid for the dinner at the festival does not detract from our conclusion that the church was engaged in its charitable works. The doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>charitable immunity is \u201capplicable even where the person injured has paid for the services rendered by the charity.\u201d <em>Casper v. The Cooper Hospital, </em>26 <em>N.J.Super. </em>535, 540, 98 A.2d 605 (App.Div. 1953) (citing <em>Jones v. St. Mary\u2019s Catholic Church </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>533, 82 A.2d 187, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 <em>U.S. </em>886, 72 <em>S.Ct. </em>175, 96 <em>L.Ed. </em>664 (1951)). <em>See also Kirby v. Columbian Institute, </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 211, 243 A.2d 853 (Hudson Cty. Ct.1968) (\u201c[Cjharities do not lose their immunities by virtue of the fact that certain fees are charged for their charitable services.... \u201d). Contrary to the circumstances in <em>Book, stipra, </em>we are dealing with activities that bear a \u201csubstantial and direct relationship\u201d to the church\u2019s \u201cgeneral purpose.\u201d <em>Cf. Kasten v. Y.M.C.A., </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 9, 412 A.2d 1346 (App.Div.1980) (recognizing that where the nature of charitable association\u2019s activities is primarily commercial in character, such as operating a ski area for profit, the association may lose its customary immunity from liability). The festival was not simply a fund raiser, as was the synagogue-sponsored bingo game in <em>Book. </em>In that case, the activity was totally \u201cunrelated to the defendant\u2019s institutional life and work.\u201d 101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 564, 245 A.2d 51. In this case, the contrary is true and, as a result, the judge properly viewed Loder as a recipient of the church\u2019s benefactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Moreover, as we noted in <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>beneficiary status does \u201cnot depend upon a showing that the claimant personally received a benefit from the works of the charity.\u201d 74 <em>N.J.Sviper. </em>at 536, 181 A.2d 787, <em>quoted with approval in Rupp, supra, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 463, 577 A.2d 188. Instead, the test is \u201cwhether the institution pleading the immunity ... was engaged in the performance of the charitable objectives it was organized to advance.\u201d <em>Anasiewicz, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 536, 181 A2d 787. Loder voluntarily partook of the traditional offerings of the Hellenic culture consisting of its food and music. By so doing, he involved himself in the church\u2019s efforts to introduce and educate the community about \u201cthe importance of Hellenic culture in the[ ] orthodox [Greek] religion.\u201d Indeed, Loder was actually engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>in the very activities of the church in which the church intended him to be involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Accordingly, we conclude Loder\u2019s activities on the church premises immediately before the accident \u201c[were] such as to classify [him] as a beneficiary of [the church\u2019s charitable] works at least in <em>some </em>degree, and that because of such activity [he] may not be deemed to be a person \u2018unconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions\u2019 of the Society.\u201d <em>Peacock v. Burlington County Historical Society, </em>95 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 209, 280 A.2d 513 (App.Div.) (holding that even mere casual viewing of exhibits in historical society building while plaintiff waited for her husband was sufficient to characterize plaintiff as a beneficiary of the society\u2019s charitable works, and therefore, plaintiff was not a person \u201cunconcerned in and unrelated to and outside of the benefactions of the [s]ociety\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>50 <em>N.J. </em>290, 234 A.2d 399 (1967). <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2A:53A-7a; <em>George v. First United Presbyterian, </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>294, 639 A.2d 1128 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>167, 644 A.2d 614 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper. There are no genuine issues of material fact sufficient to require submission to a fact finder, the disagreements being \u201cso one-sided\u201d that the church must prevail as a matter of law. <em>See Brill v. Guardian Life, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) (quoting <em>Anderson v.
