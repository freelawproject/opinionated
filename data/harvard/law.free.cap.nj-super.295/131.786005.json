On December 27, 1987, he was working inside a truck trailer operated by F.W. Clukey Trucking Company, preparing to load it with crates of bananas. Wdiile Mr. Hernandez was working inside the trailer, Clukey\u2019s driver moved it away from the loading dock. The movement caused Hernandez to fall out of the trailer. He was seriously injured. Mr. Hernandez and his wife sued Clukey and its driver to recover for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">At the time of the accident, F.W. Clukey Trucking Company was the named insured under a $1,000,000 automobile liability policy issued by Canal Insurance Company. While Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez\u2019s action was pending, Canal commenced a separate action against them, the trucking company and its driver. Canal sought a declaratory judgment that it was not obligated to defend against Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez\u2019s claim or to pay any judgment in their favor because coverage for the accident was excluded by the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement of the policy; alternatively, that if there was coverage, Canal was entitled to be fully reimbursed by Clukey for any costs of defense or payments to Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez, and that its coverage obligation was limited to the amount of the minimum liability insurance required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>After a non-jury trial and the submission of an agreed statement of facts, the trial court rejected Canal\u2019s contentions. A judgment was entered which declared that the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement was \u201cnull and void as a matter of law because it is against public policy;\u201d that Canal was obligated to defend Clukey and its driver against the personal injury action and to fully indemnify them against costs and any adverse judgment up to the $1,000,000 limit of the policy; and that Canal was liable to Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez and to Clukey and its driver for the full amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees which they had incurred in the declaratory judgment action. Canal has appealed, challenging each of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement on which Canal relies for its denial of coverage reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">It is agreed that such insurance as is afforded by the policy for Bodily Injury Liability does not apply to Bodily Injury including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person while in or upon, entering or alighting from the [covered vehicle].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">It is further agreed that, in the event the company shall, because of provision of the Federal or State statutes become obligated to pay any sum or sums of money because of such bodily injury or death resulting therefrom, the insured agrees to reimburse the company for any and all loss, costs and expenses paid or incurred by the company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The parties do not dispute that Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez\u2019s claim falls within the terms of this endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Three reported decisions have considered the validity of Canal\u2019s \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement. <em>Canal Ins. Co. v. Benner, </em>980 F.2d 23 (1st Cir.1992); <em>Great West Casualty Co. v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>901 F.2d 1525 (10th Cir.1990); <em>Powers v. Meyers, </em>101 <em>Ohio </em>App.3d 504, 655 N.E.2d 1358, <em>appeal not allowed, </em>73 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 1413, 651 N.E.2d 1311 (1995). All three hold that the endorsement is void, but only to the extent that it conflicts with a specific state or federal statute or regulation. In <em>Canal Insurance Co. v. Benner, supra, </em>the endorsement was held to be contrary to public policy and therefore void because it conflicted with Maine\u2019s Financial Responsibility Law, which required that \u201c \u2018[ejvery operator or owner of a motor vehicle ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>registered in this State shall maintain at all times the amounts of motor vehicle liability insurance or financial responsibility specified in Section 787,\u2019 \u201d <em>i.e., </em>a minimum of $20,000 for one person and $40,000 for two or more persons injured in the same accident. 980 F.2d at 25, n. 1. The court rejected the insured\u2019s contention that the insurer\u2019s obligation was the $750,000 maximum limit of the policy, and held that it was liable only to the extent of the minimum coverage requirements imposed by the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 27. In <em>Great West Casualty Co. v. Canal Insurance Co., supra, </em>the endorsement was voided because it \u201ccould not abrogate Canal\u2019s responsibility under the clear and mandatory requirements of the KAIRA [Kansas Automobile Injury Reparations Act]\u201d for the statutory minimum coverage of $100,000. 901 <em>F.</em>2d at 1527, 1528. In <em>Powers v. Meyers, supra, </em>the court held that the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement was void because it conflicted with an endorsement whose terms and inclusion in the policy were prescribed by Interstate Commerce Commission regulations, 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 387.15, pursuant to 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10927 (now 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 31139 as amended). The <em>Powers </em>court did not discuss what the limits of coverage would be, presumably because everyone assumed that if the insured was held liable to the injured party, the insurer would be responsible up to the $750,000 of coverage provided by the I.C.C. endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">These cases voiding the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement are analogous to New Jersey decisions which have voided clauses of truckers\u2019 automobile liability policies that purport to exclude coverage for injuries sustained in the course of truckers\u2019 \u201cloading and unloading\u201d operations. <em>Parkway Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>386, 629 A.2d 1352 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>302, 639 A.2d 301 (1994); <em>Bellafronte v. General Motors Corp., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>377, 376 A.2d 1294 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>533, 384 A.2d 513 (1977). <em>See Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc. v. Harbor Bay Corp., </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>402, 575 A.2d 416 (1990). In <em>Parkway, </em>the motor vehicle liability policy at issue contained an exclusion for \u201cBodily injury or property damage resulting from the movement of property by a mechani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>cal device (other than a hand truck) not attached to the covered auto.\u201d 266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 389, 629 A.2d 1352. Relying on the language of <em>Ryder/P.I.E., supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 407, 575 A.2d 416, that \u201cthe obligation to provide coverage in a \u2018loading and unloading\u2019 accident arises from statute and <em>therefore cannot be limited by contract </em>[emphasis in the <em>Ryder/P.I.E. </em>opinion],\u201d <em>Parkway </em>held that the quoted exclusion was void. 266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 391, 629 A.2d 1352. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">With this strong expression from our Supreme Court, we cannot condone [the quoted exclusion] in NJM\u2019s policy which attempts to exclude coverage ... for this claim ... allegedly arising out of the unloading of Bonland Industries truck with Parkway\u2019s crane. Exclusion 8 [quoted] is invalid and against the public policy of this State as expressed in N.J.S.A 39:6B-1 and <em>Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">If the holdings of <em>Parkway </em>and <em>Bellafronte </em>and the dictum of <em>Ryder/P.I.E. </em>approving the <em>Bellafronte </em>holding were applicable to the present ease, Canal\u2019s \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement would also be void, and Clukey and its driver would be entitled to the benefit of the full $1,000,000 coverage of their policy, with no obligation to reimburse their insurer. <em>Cf. Ryder/P.I.E., supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 412-14, 575 A.2d 416. Since <em>Parkway, Bellafronte </em>and <em>Ryder/P.I.E. </em>are based on the courts\u2019 construction of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1 and its predecessor, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6-46(a)(repealed), we next consider the question whether the Canal insurance policy was subject to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1 when Mr. Hernandez was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">Every owner or registered owner of a motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this State shall maintain motor vehicle liability insurance coverage under provisions approved by the Commissioner of Insurance, insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death and property damage sustained by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of a motor vehicle wherein such coverage shall be at least in: a. an amount or limit of $15,000.00, exclusive of interest and costs, on account of injury to, or death of, one person, in any one accident; and b. an amount or limit, subject \u25a0 to such limit for any one person so injured or killed, of $30,000.00____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Canal\u2019s policy was not issued to insure a motor vehicle \u201cregistered or principally garaged in this State.\u201d Clukey\u2019s truck is garaged, and presumably registered, in Connecticut; it is not registered in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4 requires some insurers of motor vehicles which are not garaged or registered in the State to comply with New Jersey insurance law. Pursuant to this statute, every motor vehicle insurance policy sold by \u201cAny insurer authorized to transact or transacting automobile or motor vehicle insurance business in this State, or controlling or controlled by, or under common control by, or with, an insurer authorized to transact or transacting insurance business in this State\u201d must provide insurance protection complying with New Jersey law, including specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1, with respect to any claims arising from accidents which occur while the vehicle \u201cis used or operated in this State.\u201d Policies written by insurers subject to <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4 that do not contain express provisions complying with this statute are deemed to have been amended to comply. <em>Lusby By and Through Nichols v. Hitchner, </em>273 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 583-84, 642 A.2d 1055 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">However, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4 also appears to be inapplicable to the present case. The parties have stipulated that Canal is not licensed to write insurance in New Jersey. They have not stipulated or offered evidence to show whether Canal \u201ccontrols] or [is] controlled by, or under common control by, or with, an insurer authorized to transact or transacting insurance business in this State.\u201d According to the Department of Insurance, the only Canal Insurance Company authorized to do business in New Jersey surrendered its license to write insurance in this State on December 31, 1986, and no member of the Canal Group has written insurance in this State thereafter. If that information is correct, the Canal \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement at issue in this case is not subject to New Jersey statutory law. However, the parties did not focus on this issue. On remand, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of the defendants may, if they wish, attempt to prove facts which would subject Canal\u2019s policy to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">We next consider whether New Jersey law controls the validity of Canal\u2019s \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement by virtue of our common-law choice-of-law rules. Although our conflicts law has evolved considerably since <em>Buzzone v. Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co., </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>447, 129 A.2d 561 (1957), <em>aff'd </em>41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 125 A.2d 551 (App.Div.1956), that case is our starting point. The plaintiffs were New Jersey residents. <em>See Buzzone, supra, </em>41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 524, 125 A.2d 551 (Freund, J.A.D., dissenting). They were injured in an automobile accident in New Jersey as the result of the negligence of the driver of the other vehicle. The tortfeasor was a New York resident, licensed in New York, 23 <em>N.J. </em>at 450, 129 A.2d 561; the vehicle he was driving was registered in New York, 41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515, 125 A.2d 551; and the policy had been issued to him in New York, 41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 513, 125 A.2d 551. The plaintiffs recovered a $40,000 judgment against him and, when it remained unsatisfied, sued the insurance company which had issued his motor vehicle liability policy. 23 <em>N.J. </em>at 450,129 A.2d 561. The policy had been \u201cexecuted in New York and delivered to a resident of New York with respect to a motor vehicle registered in New York____\u201d 41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 515, 125 A.2d 551. The insurer defended on the ground that the insured had secured the policy under a fictitious name after having failed to file proof of financial responsibility required because of a prior accident. 23 <em>N.J. </em>at 450-51, 129 A.2d 561. The Supreme Court assumed that on the basis of these facts, the policy would be valid if the controlling law was New Jersey\u2019s but invalid if it was New York\u2019s. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">We think it too settled to be questioned that the rights and liabilities of the insurer under the policy and the statutory impact thereon are to be determined by the law of the state where the contract was made. \u201cThe question of what is the obligation imposed by a contract of insurance, what are its terms and provisions, has usually rightly been held to be governed by the law of the place of contracting.\u201d 2 <em>Beale on Conflict of Laws, sec. </em>346.4, <em>p. </em>1210 (1935) [other citations omitted],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-9\">[23 <em>N.J. </em>at 452,129 A.2d 561.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. v. Simmons\u2019 Estate, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>28, 417 A.2d 488 (1980), our Supreme Court re-examined the question of what law governs an insurer\u2019s obligations under a motor vehicle liability policy. In that case, the insurance policy had been sold in Alabama to an Alabama resident and it insured an automobile registered in Alabama. A few months after the policy was purchased, the insured joined the Marines and was assigned to a naval installation in New Jersey. After he had been based in New Jersey for a short time, he returned to Alabama on a four-day pass and drove his car back to the New Jersey installation. Less than two months later, at about 11:00 a.m., he lent the car to a fellow Marine who requested it only to drive to a nearby bank to cash his paycheck. The borrower failed to return the car. While the owner was on patrol some time between midnight and 4:00 a.m. the next day, he saw the ear parked in front of a nightclub, but the borrower reached the car before he did. The owner demanded the return of the car, but the borrower, who was intoxicated, refused to comply, and drove away. At 3:40 that morning, the borrower drove the car into a tree. He and four other occupants of the vehicle were killed. 84 <em>N.J. </em>at 30-32, 417 A.2d 488. According to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, \u201cClaims under the ... insurance policy were made on behalf of the decedents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 417 A2d 488. The insurer brought an action seeking a declaration that \u201cunder the circumstances surrounding the use of the car at the time of the fatal crash, the policy issued to [the owner of the car] did not extend coverage to [the borrower] and his four passengers.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">In reaching its determination that Alabama law governed, the Court considered the \u201c \u2018most significant relationship\u2019 standard of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>\u00a7 188 (1971)\u201d and the \u201c \u2018governmental interest\u2019 test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 417 A2d 488. Reviewing the evolution of the law since <em>Buzzone, supra, </em>the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the proper approach in resolving conflict-of-law issues in liability insurance contract controversies is that which may be synthesized from this <em>post-Buzzone </em>evolution of the law in both the contract field as well as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the somewhat related tort field, particularly in the area of automobile accident litigation. This calls for recognition of the rule that the law of the place of the contract ordinarily governs the choice of law because this rule will generally comport with reasonable expectations of the parties concerning the principal situs of the insured risk during the term of the policy and will furnish needed certainty and consistency in the selection of the applicable law. [Citations omitted.] At the same time, this choice-of-law rule should not be given controlling or dispositive effect. It should not be applied without a full comparison of the significant relationship of each state with the parties and the transaction. That assessment should, encompass an evaluation of important state contacts as well as a consideration of the state policies affected by, and governmental interest in, the outcome of the controversy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">[Id at 37, 417 A.2d 488.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The Court then explained that its starting point for the application of these principles was \u201ca recognition that provisionally the law of the State of Alabama where the insurance contract was originally obtained should govern the determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties under the contract\u201d because that approach \u201cpresumptively comports with the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties ... and satisfies the needs for certainty, predictability, and uniformity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 417 A.2d 488. The considerations which affected the determination of the case before the Court were that the insured was a domiciliary of Alabama; the vehicle was purchased and registered there; the policy was issued through an Alabama insurance agent and by an insurer authorized to do business in Alabama; the rates were presumably predicated on Alabama statistical experience; the insured\u2019s presence in New Jersey was short and only temporary, and he planned to return to Alabama. <em>Ibid. </em>The Court also noted, \u201cWith respect to the accident victims, the record does not indicate the nature and extent of their contacts with New Jersey.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39, 417 A2d 488. But the dissent observed that the request by one of the occupants of the car \u201cto visit his wife in Red Bank is an indication that he might have been a New Jersey domiciliary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 57 n. 3,417 A2d 488 (Pashman, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The present case requires us to evaluate \u201cthe significant relationships of each state with respect to the parties and the subject matter of the litigation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 43, 417 A.2d 488, in light of</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number><em>State Farm Insurance Co. </em>In our case, the insured was based in Connecticut and Granby, Connecticut is described as the location of its operations; its presence in New Jersey was transient, but perhaps recurring. The insurer, which was based in South Carolina, was authorized to do business in Connecticut, but not in New Jersey. The application for the policy was executed and signed by an agent in Connecticut. The insurance policy, although issued by an insurance agent in Maine, was entered into in Connecticut. The policy was filed as proof of financial responsibility in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island, but not in New Jersey. The accident which is at the root of this litigation occurred in New Jersey, and Rene Hernandez, the injured party, was employed here. The record does not indicate whether or not he lives in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">To make the evaluation of relationships and governmental interests in the present ease that is mandated by <em>State Farm Insurance Co., supra, </em>we need to identify the potential consequences of applying New Jersey law and the interests that will be affected. As our previous discussion has indicated, New Jersey law would invalidate two provisions of the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement of the Canal policy. The first result would be to make the insurer potentially liable to the injured party for up to $1,000,000; the second would be to absolve Clukey from its contractual undertaking to reimburse Canal for any payments it is required to make on account of liabilities which the endorsement purports to exclude from coverage. We need to consider separately what compelling governmental interests would be served by each of these significant departures from the reasonable expectations which, because of the policy language, Canal and Clukey presumably both entertained when they entered into their insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">If no Federal law were applicable, New Jersey would certainly have an interest in assuring the availability of an adequate amount of liability insurance to indemnify persons who live or work here against injuries caused by interstate carriers. However, detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>federal statutes and regulations dictate that Clukey is required to maintain at least $750,000 of motor vehicle liability insurance. <em>See </em>49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 31139, formerly 49 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 10927; 49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 1043.2(b)(2)(a). Clukey has complied with those requirements and, on appeal, Canal does not dispute that it is potentially liable to Rene Hernandez up to $750,000. The record submitted to us does not tell us the extent of his injuries or the amount of his claim. But since we are attempting to discern and to weigh the demands of New Jersey\u2019s public policy, it is significant to note that currently New Jersey has no specific insurance requirements for motor carriers, with the exception of overweight vehicles and those carrying hazardous materials; neither exception is applicable here. Instead, New Jersey applies its general insurance requirements of $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6B-1, to both intrastate and interstate motor carriers. We conclude, therefore, that our State\u2019s interest in assuring adequate financial protection for persons injured by interstate carriers is not a factor that weighs significantly in favor of deviating from what <em>State Farm Insurance Co. </em>has formulated as the presumptive choice-of-law rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">We see no New Jersey interest in assuring that Clukey gets a better bargain or Canal a worse one than that for which they contracted'. There is no suggestion in the record that inclusion of a reimbursement obligation in the policy was the product of fraud, deception, or unfairness of any Idpd. As we discuss in more detail later in our opinion, Connecticut and Federal law sanction including terms in an insurance contract by which an insured agrees to reimburse the insurer for expenditures compelled by statutes that expand coverage beyond what has been expressly bargained for. We conclude, therefore, that the fact that New Jersey law, if controlling, would void Clukey\u2019s reimbursement obligation is also not a significant reason to depart from the presumptive rule that the controlling law is that of Connecticut where the insured is based and the insurance contract was entered into.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez argue that if New Jersey law is not applicable, we should reach the same result by assuming that Connecticut law is the same as New Jersey\u2019s on the issue of the validity of the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement because there are no reported Connecticut decisions on the question. <em>See Unifoil Corp. v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 467 n. 1, 528 A.2d 47 (App.Div.1987) (when parties fail to cite law of other state, court may assume it is same as law of New Jersey); <em>but see N.J.R.E. </em>201(a) &amp; (c) (judicial notice may be taken of statutes and regulations of other states; such notice is discretionary); <em>Winer Motors, Inc. v.

However, \u201c[tjhese regulations do not apply to the insurance afforded under any policy: (1) to the extent that the insurance afforded exceeds the limits specified in subsection (a) of \u00a7 14-112 of the general statutes.... \u201d <em>Conn.

The clear implication of these provisions is that if Connecticut law invalidates the endorsement at issue in the present case, it does so only to the extent of the $20,000 minimum coverage required by Connecticut law. Furthermore, Connecticut law implicitly sanctions the provision of Canal\u2019s \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement which requires the insured to reimburse the insurer for its expenditures on account of liabilities excluded by the endorsement, but mandated by State or Federal law. <em>See Conn. Agencies Regs. </em>\u00a7 38a-334r-5(e)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; <em>Conn. Agencies Regs. </em>\u00a7 16-304-D8a.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, if the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement is void under Connecticut law \u2014 an issue which we do not undertake to decide \u2014 Canal would be hable to Mr. and Mrs. Hernandez only up to the statutory minimum amount of insurance and Clukey would be liable to reimburse Canal to the full extent of Canal\u2019s expenditures. Because Federal law, which we are about to discuss, makes Canal potentially liable to the injured parties for a greater amount and also requires Clukey to reimburse the insurer for the full amount of its expenditures, we do not need to decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>whether Connecticut law would invalidate the \u201cOccupant Hazard Excluded\u201d endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">As we have previously discussed, if New Jersey law is applicable, Canal is potentially liable to Mr. and Mr. Hernandez to the full extent of the Clukey policy and is not entitled to reimbursement from its insureds. But if New Jersey law does not control, the rights and obligations of the parties are governed by an endorsement entitled \u201cEndorsement for Motor Carrier Policies of Insurance for Automobile Bodily Injury and Property Damage Liability under Section 10927, Title 49 of the United States Code.\u201d This endorsement states expressly that its purpose is to amend the policy to comply with 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 10927 (now 49 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 31139). The endorsement declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">It is understood and agreed that no condition, provision, stipulation, or limitation contained in the policy, or any other endorsement thereon or violation thereof, or of this endorsement, by the insured, shall relieve the Company from liability or from the payment of any final judgment, irrespective of the financial responsibility or lack thereof or insolvency or bankruptcy of the insured. However, all terms, conditions, and limitations in the policy to which this endorsement is attached are to remain in full force and effect as binding between the insured and the Company, and the insured agrees to reimburse the Company for any payment made by the Company on account of any accident, claim or suit involving a breach of the terms of the policy, and for any payment that the Company would not have been obligated to make under the provisions of the policy except for the agreement contained in this endorsement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The limits of Canal\u2019s exposure according to this endorsement are the \u201climits prescribed in 49 <em>CFR </em>1043.2(b)(1) governing minimum amounts of insurance\u201d; <em>ie., </em>$750,000 for one accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">49 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 387.15, a regulation issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission establishing the \u201cminimum levels of financial responsibility for motor carriers\u201d directs that \u201cEndorsements for policies of insurance ... must be in the form prescribed by the FHWA [Federal Highway Administration] and approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>OMB [Office of Management and Budget].\u201d* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See Powers v.
