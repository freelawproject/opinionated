Altrua argues that both the Department and the Ada County district court erred in finding that Altrua was an insurer because Altrua never assumed the risk of paying its members\u2019 medical bills. The Department found, and the district court affirmed, that when members make their predetermined monthly payments into the escrow account Altrua operates, the risk of payment shifts from the individual members to the escrow account, and in turn to Altrua. Altrua also contends that the Department\u2019s determination that it is an insurer despite the disclaimers in its membership contract to the contrary is an unconstitutional interference with Altrua\u2019s right to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-26\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b427-27\">Altrua HealthShare is a nonprofit entity that describes itself as \u201ca nationwide faith based membership of individuals who share in each other\u2019s medical needs by bearing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>burden of others.\u201d On January 15, 2010, the Department filed a Notice of Violation and Right to Hearing against Altrua contending that it was operating as a health insurance company in Idaho without a license. Following a hearing on September 1, 2010, the Hearing Officer issued his findings. The Hearing Officer concluded that Altrua\u2019s membership contract is an insurance contract because Altrua undertakes some risk of paying its members\u2019 claims or losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Altrua then filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which the Director of the Department denied. After the Hearing Officer\u2019s Amended Preliminary Order became a final order by operation of the law on January 4, 2011, Altrua filed a Notice of Appeal and Petition for Judicial Review. On October 13, 2011, the district court affirmed the Department\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Both the Department\u2019s and the district court\u2019s decisions focused on Altrua\u2019s membership contract. This contract includes the Application for Membership, the Membership Eligibility Manual, and Altrua\u2019s Guidelines. The membership application includes a medical history questionnaire, an escrow instruction sheet, and a commitment agreement containing a statement of standards members must follow. Altrua uses the rules contained in the Membership Eligibility Manual to determine whether an applicant may become a member.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">The rules contained in this Membership Eligibility Manual are the standard against which an applicant\u2019s medical history is measured to determine if the applicant qualifies for the membership, and if so, what membership limitations should apply. The applicant\u2019s medical history includes examination reports, hospital records, physician opinions, test results, and symptoms significant enough to mention to a physician that pertain to both resolved and active conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The Membership Eligibility Manual also includes itemized eligibility rules, specific listings for automatic denials based on particular medical conditions and activities such as tobacco or alcohol use, and height and weight guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">On the membership application, potential members indicate their desired level of participation, which along with their age and marital status determines the amount Altrua requires them to pay each month. Altrua provides a detailed chart of this calculation titled \u201cMonthly Contribution Request\u201d in its Membership Eligibility Manual. Altrua describes the monthly contribution as voluntary, but failure to pay the amount designated in the Membership Eligibility Manual renders one\u2019s membership inactive and no funds would be paid to the member.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Altrua holds members\u2019 monthly payments in an escrow account. The escrow instructions, which members sign as part of their application, require Altrua to first \u201cpay the expenses of operating the membership,\u201d then \u201cto pay eligible needs pursuant to the guidelines as modified from time to time by Altrua HealthShare and as interpreted and applied by Altrua HealthShare,\u201d and in the event of any surplus upon the termination of the membership, the \u201cremaining funds shall be disbursed to qualified charities as determined by Altrua HealthShare.\u201d The membership guidelines give Altrua the sole authority to interpret the guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-10\">CONTRIBUTORS\u2019 INSTRUCTION AND CONDITIONS by submitting monthly contributions, the contributor instructs Altrua HealthShare to share escrowed funds in accordance with the membership escrow instructions. Since Altrua HealthShare has nothing to gain or lose financially by determining if a need is eligible or not, the contributor designates Altrua HealthShare as the final authority for the interpretation of these guidelines. By participation in the membership, the member accepts these conditions as enforceable and binding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">Finally, Altrua\u2019s membership contract contains a number of disclaimers. The following are a few of the disclaimers in the membership contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-12\">I understand that the membership is not insurance but is a voluntary medical needs sharing program, and that there are no representations, promises, or guarantees that my medical expense will be paid. I also understand that sharing for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>needs does not come from an insurance company, but from the membership according to the guidelines and membership Escrow Instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">This publication or membership is not issued by an insurance company, nor is it offered through an insurance company. This publication or the membership does not guarantee or promise that your eligible medical needs will be shared by the membership. This publication or the membership should never be considered as a substitute for an insurance policy. If the publication or the membership is unable to share in all or part of your eligible medical needs, or whether or not this membership continues to operate, you will remain financially liable for any and all unpaid medical needs. This is not a legally binding agreement to reimburse you for medical needs you incur, but is an opportunity for you to care for another in a time of need, to present your medical needs to others as outlined in these membership guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">II. Standard op Review</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u201cIn an appeal from the decision of a district court acting in its appellate capacity under the [Idaho Administrative Procedure Act], this Court reviews the agency record independently of the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>A &amp; B Irr. Dist. v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Water Res., </em>153 Idaho 500, 505, 284 P.3d 225, 230 (2012). We review the decision of the district court to determine whether it correctly decided the issues presented to it. <em>Elias-Cruz v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>153 Idaho 200, 202, 280 P.3d 703, 705 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">This Court \u201cshall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(1). This Court \u201cinstead defers to the agency\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. In other words, the agency\u2019s factual determinations are binding on the reviewing court, even where there is conflicting evidence before the agency, so long as the determinations are supported by substantial competent evidence in the record.\u201d <em>A &amp; B Irr. Dist., </em>153 Idaho at 505-06, 284 P.3d at 230-31 (quoting <em>Urrutia v. Blaine Cnty., </em>134 Idaho 353, 357, 2 P.3d 738, 742 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">This Court shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">affirm the agency action unless the court finds that the agency\u2019s findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or (e) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3). Even if one of these conditions is met, this Court will still affirm the agency action \u201cunless substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The Department ordered Altrua to stop selling insurance in Idaho after finding that Altrua had not obtained a certificate of authority to transact insurance in violation of I.C. \u00a7 41-305(1). Under this section, transacting insurance includes any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">(1) Solicitation and inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">(2) Preliminary negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-16\">(3) Effectuation of a contract of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-17\">(4) Transaction of matters subsequent to effectuation of a contract of insurance and arising out of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-18\">(5) Mailing or otherwise delivering any written solicitation to any person in this state by an insurer or any person acting on behalf of the insurer for fee or compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-19\">I.C. \u00a7 41-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-20\">Whether or not Altrua transacted insurance depends on whether the contract between Altrua and its members is an insurance contract. Idaho Code section 41-102 defines insurance as \u201ca contract whereby one undertakes to indemnify another or pay or allow a specified or ascertainable amount or benefit upon determinable risk contingencies.\u201d The Hearing Officer found that this definition \u201ccenters on the phrase \u2018undertakes to indemnify\u2019 \u201d and concluded that \u201cthe fun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>damental attribute of insurance is risk sharing.\u201d Thus, the Hearing Officer focused on the first type of insurance contract under I.C. \u00a7 41-102\u2019s definition \u2014 those that undertake to indemnify another. Altrua does not disagree with this definition of insurance, just the Hearing Officer\u2019s determination that Altrua\u2019s membership contract falls within this definition. Specifically, Altrua claims that it cannot be an insurer because it simply administers members\u2019 funds through an escrow account and assumes no risk of paying members\u2019 claims. This Court agrees with Altrua that under this definition it is not an insurer. Consequently, we need not address Altrua\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s decision that Altrua\u2019s membership contract is insurance violates the Contracts Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">The Hearing Officer correctly determined that for Altrua\u2019s membership contract to be a contract that seeks to indemnify another, it must shift the risk of paying members\u2019 claims from the individual members to Altrua. <em>See Selkirk Seed Co. v. State Ins. Fund, </em>135 Idaho 434, 438-39, 18 P.3d 956, 960-61 (2000) (finding that contract was insurance under \u00a7 41-102 because State Insurance Fund assumes the risk of loss and \u201cprovides coverage for real and determinable risks\u201d); <em>State v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>126 Idaho 178, 183, 879 P.2d 1111, 1116 (1994) (\u201cThe essence of an insurance contract is the shifting of the risk of loss from the insured to the insurer.\u201d (citing <em>Helvering v. Le Gierse, </em>312 U.S. 531, 539, 61 S.Ct. 646, 649, 85 L.Ed. 996, 999 (1941))). The Department argues that substantial and competent evidence supports the finding that Altrua\u2019s membership contract is an insurance contract because Altrua undertakes some risk of paying its members\u2019 claims or losses. The Department mainly argues that the Hearing Officer correctly found that the risk of paying members\u2019 claims is shifted from the members to the separate escrow account into which members pay their monthly fees, and in turn to Altrua, because Altrua exercises complete control over this escrow account. The Hearing Officer based his findings on the role Altrua plays in administering the membership agreement and the members\u2019 reliance that their claims will be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">In their application for membership, members sign detailed escrow instructions prepared by Altrua that transfer control over the account to Altrua. Members pay their monthly contribution into this escrow account and give Altrua almost complete control over these funds. When members submit claims to be paid out of the escrow account, Altrua determines the eligibility of the claim according to its guidelines, which it has complete discretion to interpret. Despite the high level of control Altrua exercises over the escrow account, simply operating the account does not mean that Altrua assumes the risk of paying members\u2019 claims. Altrua does not pay any of its members\u2019 claims with its own funds; rather, all of claims are paid out of the escrow account, which is made up entirely of members\u2019 contributions. While the Hearing Officer is correct that the terms of the membership contract place the discretion for payment in Altrua\u2019s hands, this is not the same thing as assuming the risk of paying members\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The Hearing Officer also concluded that Altrua\u2019s membership contract creates reliance among the members that their claims will be paid. Altrua argues that the membership contract never guarantees that Altrua will pay members\u2019 medical claims and in fact, expressly disclaims any such guarantee. The Hearing Officer recognized these disclaimers, but found it particularly significant that Altrua\u2019s membership brochure specifically states, \u201cNot one eligible medical need has gone unpaid since the membership started.\u201d Additionally, Altrua\u2019s membership agreement and commitment form require its members to adhere to a set of standards, submit an annual membership fee, and provide monthly contributions to Altrua. The membership contract requires members to make these monthly payments, with the failure to make them resulting in membership cancellation without a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Despite the disclaimers in Altrua\u2019s contract, the structure of the membership plan and statements made in Altrua\u2019s brochure and guidelines are substantial and competent evidence supporting the Hearing Officer\u2019s finding that Altrua\u2019s membership contract creates a reliance interest in its members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>that their claims will be paid. However, this reliance is not sufficient on its own to make Altrua an indemnitor. Altrua must assume some of the risk of paying its members\u2019 claims for its membership contract to be one undertaking to indemnify its members. Controlling the escrow account containing the members\u2019 funds is not sufficient evidence that Altrua personally assumes any risk of paying members\u2019 claims. Altrua may have an obligation under the language of its contract, despite its disclaimers, to pay certain member claims so long as funds are available, but there is no evidence in the record that Altrua has guaranteed or assured payment of members\u2019 claims. Therefore, the Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusion that Altrua\u2019s membership contract is an insurance contract because Altrua assumes some risk of paying its members\u2019 claims is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The district court\u2019s order affirming the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings is reversed and the ease is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs to Altrua.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-6\">Justices W. JONES and HORTON, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b431-7\">EISMANN, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ArZ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">I concur in the majority opinion. This is a prime example of an administrative agency exceeding its statutory powers in an attempt to protect citizens from themselves. Although this clearly did not involve health insurance, the Department ignored the terms of the contract in order to find that it was a contract of insurance so that it could prevent Idahoans from entering into this type of contractual arrangement. The people contracting with Altrua HealthShare are adults who presumably understand the risk they are taking by making monthly payments into the escrow fund, but are willing to do so as a means of paying for future health expenses that they may incur. The Department is not tasked with the responsibility of making sure citizens do not make decisions it considers to be unwise. Whether people should enter into this type of arrangement is for them to decide, not the Department.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b431-9\">J. JONES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGo\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion and agree that the ease needs to be remanded for further proceedings. The Department cannot particularly be faulted for concluding that the Altrua documents constitute an indemnity contract but should have pursued the alternate definition under I.C. \u00a7 41-102 \u2014 a contract to \u201cpay or allow a specified or ascertainable amount or benefit upon determinable risk contingencies.\u201d It appears that Altrua designed its program to look like insurance and act like insurance but to exclude it from being insurance by virtue of its numerous disclaimers.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">Altrua contended before the Court on appeal that the rights of its members were contractual in nature and it sought to characterize the Department\u2019s proceeding as an impairment of its contract rights under the United States Constitution. However, in its membership \u201cguidelines\u201d it specifically states that \u201cthe <em>guidelines </em>are not a contract.\u201d Altrua claims that it is merely holding membership fees in escrow for the benefit of its members, while ignoring specific language in the membership guidelines that the fees \u201care voluntary contributions or gifts that are nonrefundable,\u201d and that members retain absolutely no control over the escrowed fees. It is understandable that the Department has concern about the potential for Altrua members to sustain injury. Altrua claims that, \u201cNot one eligible medical need has gone unpaid since the membership started,\u201d but the membership guidelines contain no effective means for a member to obtain redress in the event a claim is not paid, except for an obligatory appeals process where Altrua retains absolute final say.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">In the event that Altrua is successful on remand, the Department may take some comfort in the fact that an Altrua member will not be wholly without recourse. If Altrua\u2019s program does not constitute a contract of insurance within the meaning of I.C. \u00a7 41-102, it then comes within the purview of the Idaho Consumer Protection Act (ICPA), I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 48-601, et. seq. Pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 48-605(3), persons subject to the trade practices and frauds provisions of the Idaho Insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Code (I.C. \u00a7 41-1301, et seq.) are exempt from the ICPA. If it is ultimately determined that Altrua\u2019s program does not constitute engaging in the business of insurance, members can presumably resort to the ICPA for remedial action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
