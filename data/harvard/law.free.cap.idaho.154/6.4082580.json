JONES, Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"b57-23\">Ida-Therm, LLC, appeals a summary judgment in favor of Bedrock Geothermal, LLC, holding that a reservation of \u201call the oil, gas, and minerals, in, on, or under the surface of [deeded] lands,\u201d in a 1946 warranty deed included the geothermal resources underlying the property. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-25\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b57-26\">On March 19, 1946, Arthur J. Bell and his wife, Vinnie O. Bell, conveyed land in Bonneville County, Idaho (the Bell Property) via warranty deed (the Bell Deed) to C.C. Mann. The Bell Deed reserved to Arthur and Vinnie \u201call the oil, gas, and minerals, in, on, or under the surface\u201d of the Bell Property. The individual Defendants in this suit are the successors of Arthur and Vinnie and the owners of the reserved oil, gas, and mineral rights. They allege that the reservation includes the rights to geothermal resources and, based on this contention, they have leased rights to the geothermal resources to Bedrock.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-27\">Plaintiffs Garry and Kalee Mann, Alan and Matilda Kolbet, and Matt Mann are C.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Mann\u2019s successors and the owners of the Bell Property. They allege that the Bell Deed reservation does not include geothermal resources. Based on this, they believe that as part of their estate they own the geothermal rights, which they have leased to Ida-Therm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">On August 4, 2010, the Plaintiffs brought this action in an attempt to clarify the scope of the oil, gas, and mineral reservation, and settle the ownership of the geothermal resources. Bedrock filed an answer and counterclaim on September 9, 2010, alleging that the Bell Deed reservation does include geothermal resources. It thus sought a declaratory judgment that Ida-Therm\u2019s lease was void and quieting title in favor of Bedrock.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">On February 17, 2011, Bedrock moved for summary judgment and \u201cask[ed] the [district court] to rule on the dispositive issue of whether the mineral reservation in the Bell Deed includes geothermal resources.\u201d The district court did so in a May 26, 2011, Memorandum Decision and Order, where it held that the Bell Deed\u2019s mineral reservation had severed the mineral and surface estates, and that \u201cthe scope of [Bedrock\u2019s] mineral estate includes geothermal resources.\u201d Based on this, the court granted Bedrock\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and entered judgment for Bedrock on July 11, 2011. Ida-Therm timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">I. Did the district court err in determining that the Bell Deed\u2019s reservation of \u201call the oil, gas, and minerals, in, on, or under the surface\u201d of the land included geothermal resources?</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">A. Standard of Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">In reviewing grants of summary judgment, this Court uses the same standard as the district court. <em>Cnty. Of Boise v. Idaho Cntys. Risk Mgmt. Program, Underwriters, </em>151 Idaho 901, 904, 265 P.3d 514, 517 (2011). Summary judgment must be granted \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d I.R.C.P. 56(c). In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the prevailing party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law, this Court exercises free review. <em>Doe v. City of Elk River, </em>144 Idaho 337, 338, 160 P.3d 1272, 1273 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s interpretation of a deed, the standard of review \u201cdepends on whether the instrument is ambiguous.\u201d <em>C &amp; G, Inc. v. Rule, </em>135 Idaho 763, 765, 25 P.3d 76, 78 (2001). Whether a deed is ambiguous is a question of law, over which we exercise free review. <em>Id. </em>\u201cInterpretation of an ambiguous document presents a question of fact, and we will defer to the findings of the trial court so long as those findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, interpretation of an unambiguous document is a question of law, and a matter of free review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">B. The district court erred in concluding that a deed\u2019s reservation of \u201call the oil, gas, and minerals, in, on, or under the surface\u201d of the land includes geothermal resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">The district court determined that the Bell Deed\u2019s mineral reservation severed the mineral estate from the surface estate, and that geothermal resources were included in the scope of the mineral estate. It began by noting that, \u201c[n]o party to this action asserts the Bell Deed is ambiguous. The Bell Deed was executed in 1946, and the parties agree there is <em>no </em>extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent.\u201d The district court then reiterated that \u201c[t]he parties agree it would be almost impossible to determine, based on extrinsic evidence, whether the grantor specifically intended to reserve geothermal resources.\u201d Accordingly, the district court concluded that it would be injudicious to conclude that \u201cmineral\u201d was ambiguous, and held that the term is unambiguous, and that its meaning and \u201cthe intent of the parties should be ascertained as a matter of law.\u201d The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>court faced a lack of Idaho precedent to guide this inquiry; therefore, following other state and federal cases, the court determined that \u201c[t]he Bell Deed reserved to the grantor all minerals,\u201d and concluded \u201cthe grantor thereby severed the <em>mineral </em>estate from [Ida-Therm\u2019s] estate.\u201d After examining the scope of the mineral reservation, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">[T]he parties to the Bell Deed, by severing the mineral estate, had a general intent to convey those commercially valuable, underground, natural resources of the [Bell] Property that are distinct from the soil itself. The evidence before this Court suggests geothermal resources are commercially valuable natural resources underlying the [Bell] Property. Furthermore, geothermal resources are distinct from the soil, and there is no evidence that Bedrock\u2019s development and use of the geothermal resources would destroy the surface or [the surface owners\u2019] enjoyment of the surface. In the absence of an expressed specific intent to the contrary, this Court concludes the scope of [Bedrock\u2019s] mineral estate includes geothermal resources, as indicated by the general intentions and expectations evident in the Bell Deed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">On appeal, Ida-Therm brought several challenges to the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. It first argued \u2014 though it cited no authority for the proposition \u2014 that the plain meaning of \u201cmineral\u201d does not include geothermal resources. It then contended, based on principles set forth in <em>Stucki v. Parker, </em>108 Idaho 929, 703 P.2d 693 (1985), and other cases, that the Bells never intended to sever the mineral and surface estates. Ida-Therm further argued that the Geothermal Resources Act, I.C. \u00a7 42-4001, <em>et seq., </em>does not define geothermal resources as a mineral, and that this definition should control in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Bedrock argues in response that Ida-Therm\u2019s plain meaning argument is unsubstantiated and begs the question. It further contends that the language in the Bell Deed evinced a general intent of the parties to sever the mineral and surface estates, and agreed with the district court that \u201cmineral\u201d should include geothermal resources \u201cbecause such resources are functionally similar to other minerals!,] are not necessary to the use and enjoyment of the surface estate, and because a broad reading of \u2018minerals\u2019 encourages title certainty.\u201d Bedrock asserts that the cases and statutes cited by Ida-Therm, though perhaps relevant to interpreting \u201cgeothermal\u201d in other contexts, are simply inapplicable to this particular conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The sole issue for this Court is whether the district court, in finding that the reservation of minerals includes geothermal resources, correctly granted Bedrock\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. Because we find that \u201cmineral\u201d is ambiguous, and because ambiguous grants in deeds are construed against the grantor, we construe the grant in favor of Ida-Therm and reverse the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">1. Deeds and ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Before this Court can review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Bell Deed, we must first determine whether the deed\u2019s mineral reservation is ambiguous. In doing so, we ask whether the reservation is \u201creasonably subject to conflicting interpretation.\u201d <em>C &amp; G, </em>135 Idaho at 766, 25 P.3d at 76. If a deed contains inconsistencies that \u201cthrow [] a \u2018shadow of ambiguity\u2019 over the instrument,\u201d it will \u201cwarrant the introduction of parol evidence as an aid to discovering the intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Fliegel, </em>92 Idaho 767, 771, 450 P.2d 990, 994 (1969). For example, in <em>Gardner, </em>this Court examined a deed that conveyed a parcel of property, \u201c[l]ess a strip of land 30 feet wide off the East side for roadway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There, we found that the reservation was ambiguous, because \u201c[o]n the one hand it expresses the intent to retain the fee to the strip in the grantor,\u201d but \u201c[o]n the other hand it expresses the intent to create an easement for roadway over the strip in favor of the grantor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because these two reasonable interpretations were irreconcilable, this Court resorted to parol evidence to discern the intent of the parties. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>Latham v. Garner, </em>105 Idaho 854, 855, 673 P.2d 1048, 1049 (1983), this court examined two grants of \u201ceasements and rights-of-way\u201d to the defendants that were \u201cexclusively for their use, and unto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>their successors and assigns forever.\u201d We reasoned that \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018exclusively for their use\u2019 lends itself, without contortion, to a number of interpretations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858, 673 P.2d at 1052. Namely, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">The instrument could be interpreted as (1) the grant of an easement right of way to the grantee, the defendants herein, to the exclusion of all others, except the grantor; or (2) the grant of an easement right of way excluding all others, including the grantor; or, (3) as the grant of a fee simple estate to the grantee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\"><em>Id. </em>We thus held that the deed was \u201creasonably subject to conflicting interpretations and as such is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">As noted by both parties, and the district court, whether a mineral reservation is ambiguous is an issue that has divided courts. <em>Compare Kinney v. Keith, </em>128 P.3d 297, 303 (Colo.App.2005) (holding that \u201c \u2018[minerals\u2019 is not capable of a definition of universal application; it is a general word susceptible of different meanings, and therefore, courts look to extraneous evidence to reveal the parties\u2019 intent, including the circumstances surrounding the reservation at issue.\u201d), <em>with Spurlock v. Santa Fe Pac. R. Co., </em>143 Ariz. 469, 694 P.2d 299 (Ariz.App.1984) (finding the opposite, due predominantly to policy concerns). The rationale behind treating \u201cmineral\u201d as ambiguous was explained by the court in <em>Spurlock:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">Courts that hold mineral to be an ambiguous term are often thrust into a complex and hopeless search for the \u201ctrue intentions\u201d of the original contracting parties. With the passage of decades and a series of mesne conveyances, this task can be impossible. And, as many courts have noted, attempting to discover the parties\u2019 specific intent regarding a substance that was unknown to anyone at the time of the original conveyance is antilogical. <em>E.g., Northern Nat. Gas Co. v. Grounds, </em>441 F.2d 704, 714 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 951, 92 S.Ct. 268, 30 L.Ed.2d 267 (1971). The most consistent results produced by these cases are title uncertainty and the need to litigate each mineral reservation to determine what substances it encompasses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">694 P.2d at 307. The <em>Spurlock </em>court cited policy reasons for holding the term minerals to be unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">An established rule of law provides for the reliable means of ascertaining mineral ownership. This certainty is important because of the heavy investment of capital required to develop petroleum and other mineral resources. Without an established rule of law, the courts would necessarily be called upon to interpret numerous reservations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 307-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">The district court decided to adopt the <em>Spurlock </em>approach and treated the mineral reservation here as unambiguous. This is because \u201c[n]o party to this action asserts the Bell Deed is ambiguous,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Bell Deed was executed in 1946, and the parties agree there is <em>no </em>extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent.\u201d Thus, the district court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">[I]t would be injudicious to conclude the term mineral is ambiguous. Such a holding would unnecessarily encourage litigation to determine the scope of grants or reservations similar to that of the Bell Deed. Discovering the grantor\u2019s intent would be particularly difficult in this case where execution of the Bell Deed occurred in 1946. The parties agree it would be almost impossible to determine, based on extrinsic evidence, whether the grantor specifically intended to reserve geothermal resources. This Court therefore concludes the meaning of the word \u201cmineral\u201d and the intent of the parties should be ascertained as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">While we recognize the concerns raised by the district court, we hold that \u201cmineral,\u201d as used in the Bell Deed, is ambiguous. At the outset, we note that \u201cmineral\u201d has not been defined by Idaho case law. Moreover, it has no uniformly recognized legal meaning. Indeed, other courts making this determination have arrived at a variety of definitions of \u201cmineral\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">Minerals have been defined as substances having a value separable from that of the soil in which they are located. Another test for determining whether a substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>is a mineral requires that the substance have a definite chemical composition by which it can easily be recognized. Yet another test determines that substances which are minerals within the scientific, geological, and practical meanings of the term constitute minerals within the purview of a clause reserving all minerals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ab\">53A Am.Jur.2d <em>Mines and Minerals </em>\u00a7 2; <em>see also Dyegard Land P\u2019ship v. Hoover, </em>39 S.W.3d 300, 311 (Tex.App.2001) (holding that water is not a mineral because it is \u201cnot \u2018rare\u2019 and \u2018exceptional\u2019 in character,\u201d and is too closely related to the surface itself); <em>Bambauer v. Menjoulet, </em>214 Cal.App.2d 871, 29 Cal.Rptr. 874, 876 (1963) (concluding that though gravel \u201cbelongs to the mineral kingdom,\u201d it was not a part of a mineral reservation because it lacked \u201ca definite chemical composition by which it can be easily recognized\u201d); <em>N.M. &amp; Ariz. Land Co. v. Elkins, </em>137 F.Supp. 767, 771 (D.N.M.1956) (holding that uranium and thorium, \u201cbeing minerals within the scientific, geological and practical meanings, would certainly constitute minerals\u201d in a reservation clause). Neither party here cited to a dictionary in making their case, but these definitions are just as varied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD\">[Mjineral, <em>n. </em>1. Any natural inorganic matter that has a definite chemical composition and specific physical properties that give it value cmost minerals are crystalline solids &gt;. [] 2. A subsurface material that is explored for, mined, and exploited for its useful properties and commercial value. 3. Any natural material that is defined as a mineral by statute or easelaw.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1015 (8th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Applying the various definitions of \u201cmineral\u201d above leads to widely divergent results: geothermal resources have value separable from the soil, but it is unclear if they have an easily recognizable, definite chemical composition; they are not crystalline solids, yet are exploited for commercial value; and while some Idaho statutes recognize geothermal resources as minerals, others do not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And the length of the parties\u2019 briefing itself is at least incidental evidence of the ambiguity of \u201cmineral\u201d; if the term truly had a plain meaning, it would seem that sharing it would not have been so complicated. Put simply: the term \u201cmineral,\u201d as used in the Bell Deed, is precisely the sort of language which we have previously held to be reasonably subject to conflicting interpretation, and thus is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Despite the concerns raised by the <em>Spur-lock </em>court, treating \u201cmineral\u201d as ambiguous here would not \u201cunnecessarily encourage litigation.\u201d As Ida-Therm noted, as a practical matter, the lack of Idaho case law regarding mineral reservations suggests that these issues are rarely brought before our courts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>More fundamentally, this Court .has repeatedly held that seeking and effecting \u201cthe real intention\u201d of contracting parties is its primary concern. <em>C &amp; G, </em>185 Idaho at 766, 25 P.3d at 79. If finding the real intention requires litigation, so be it; but a lengthy search for the correct result is preferable to precipitously seizing upon the wrong one. This leads to a further concern raised by the district court \u2014 that here, \u201cit would be almost impossible to determine, based on extrinsic evidence, whether the grantor specifically intended to reserve geothermal resources.\u201d Again, this Court is mindful of the difficulties presented by eases bereft of facts. But parol evidence is not the only tool by which courts can interpret ambiguous language. As discussed in the following section, canons of construction can be applied to document language, regardless of the amount of extrinsic evidence at hand, in an effort to find the parties\u2019 true intent. Doing the best we can with the facts we have might be difficult, but it is where the ambiguity of \u201cmineral\u201d necessarily leads us. And mutual agreement among the litigating parties \u2014 however well intentioned \u2014 cannot transmute ambiguous text into something clear-cut. We thus hold that \u201cmineral,\u201d as used in the Bell Deed, is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">2. The Meaning of the Mineral Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Having held that the mineral reservation in the Bell Deed is ambiguous, we turn now to interpreting its meaning. This Court interprets a deed\u2019s language as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">In interpreting a deed of conveyance, the primary goal is to seek and give effect to the real intention of the parties. [ ] Where a deed is ambiguous, interpretation of the grantor\u2019s intent is a question of fact determined from the instrument itself, as well as from the surrounding facts and circumstances. [ ] Where a deed is unambiguous, however, the parties\u2019 intent must be ascertained from the language of the deed as a matter of law without resort to extrinsic evidence. [ ]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-7\"><em>C &amp; G, </em>135 Idaho at 766, 25 P.3d at 79 (citations omitted). We start with the face of the deed. The Bell Deed is a warranty deed conveying the described real property, together with all appurtenances, to C.C. Mann and his heirs and assigns. The deed specifically reserves \u201coil, gas, and minerals.\u201d Real property consists of lands and that which is affixed or appurtenant to lands. I.C. \u00a7 55-101. \u201cLands are the material of the earth, whatever may be the ingredients of which it is composed, whether soil, rock or other substance.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 55-101A. \u201cA fee simple title is presumed to be intended to pass by a grant of real property unless it appears from the grant that a lesser estate was intended.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 55-604. A deed reservation \u201cshould be not indefinite or uncertain____ [F]ailure of a grantor to clearly express the kind of rights retained on a conveyance may result in the entire fee title passing to the grantee, without reservation.\u201d C.J.S., Deeds, \u00a7 357. Further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">In case of doubt, an exception or reservation in a conveyance is construed in favor of the grantee rather than of the grantor. In general, the court views grants in a deed expansively and reservations restrictively, so where there is any uncertainty or ambiguity in the language used, the grantee should have the benefit of the doubt or the ambiguity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">C.J.S., Deeds, \u00a7 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">This Court defers to the district court\u2019s findings of fact when interpreting ambiguous documents. Here, the district court found that there were virtually no extrinsic facts that could illuminate the intent of the Bell Deed. It was executed in 1946, and \u201cthe parties agree there is <em>no </em>extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent\u201d \u2014 which would include whether the Bells intended to reserve geothermal resources for themselves, or grant them to C.C. Mann. Based on our review of the record, we accept these findings. Without any extrinsic evidence reflecting on the intent of the grantors, we turn to the rules of construction outlined above. That is, we construe the reservation narrowly and the grant broadly. In other words, we construe the grant in favor of C.C. Mann and his successors, and hold as a matter of law that the geothermal resources are appurtenant to the Bell Property. Thus, Ida-Therm is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>rightful lessee of the mineral rights. The contrary holding of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Bedrock, and hold as a matter of law that: 1) the Bell Deed\u2019s mineral reservation does not include geothermal resources; and 2) that C.C. Mann\u2019s successors are the owners of the geothermal resources. Costs on appeal are awarded to Ida-Therm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-7\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W. JONES and HORTON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-4\">. One of those statutes, the Geothermal Resources Act (GRA), formed the basis of Ida-Therm\u2019s argument that the GRA definition of \"geothermal resources\" should control in this case. But this argument fails because it ignores the GRA\u2019s clear prefatory limitations \u2014 that its definitions are only effective \u201c[w]henever used in this act.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 42-4002. The GRA deals with permitting for geothermal wells, not private conveyances of geothermal rights, which is the issue here. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 42-4001, <em>et seq. </em>It is rudimentary that a statute cannot override terms which exist outside its expressly fixed bounds; thus, the GRA's definitions have no control over the language of the Bell Deed. And any persuasive value that the Act might have, perhaps as evidence of the Legislature's intent to define mineral in a particular way, is undercut by other statutes that define mineral in a precisely opposite fashion. <em>Compare </em>I.C. \u00a7 42-4002(c) (\"Geothermal resources are found and hereby declared to be sui generis, being neither a mineral resource nor a water resource ____\u201d), <em>with </em>I.C. \u00a7 47-701(1), which pertains to minerals located on state-owned lands (\u201cThe terms ... 'mineral,' ... and \u2018mineral right\u2019 ... shall be construed to mean and include ... geothermal resources ....\u201d), <em>and </em>I.C. \u00a7 42-230 (\"All ground water having a temperature of two hundred twelve (212) degrees Fahrenheit or more in the bottom of a well shall be classified as a geothermal resource____\u201d). Furthermore, the State recognizes two types of geothermal resources \u2014 \u201ca low temperature geothermal resource,\" which has a temperature greater than 85 but less than 212 degrees Fahrenheit, which is administered pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 42-233, and groundwater with a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit or more, which is administered pursuant to Chapter 40, Title 42, Idaho Code. I.C. \u00a7 42-230(a)(1) and (2). It might also be observed that all of these statutory definitions were enacted well after the Bell Deed was executed, making them irrelevant to the interpretation of that deed. The Legislature\u2019s inconsistent approach to defining \"geothermal resources\u201d precludes the use of statutes to determine whether those resources are minerals, and does nothing to resolve the ambiguity of \"mineral\u201d here. Rather, it lends support to the conclusion that a good deal of ambiguity exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
