Nature of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">The Board of Dentistry (the \u201cBoard\u201d) fined a dentist for failing to adequately inform one of his patients before performing a procedure, and for publishing misleading advertising on his website. The district court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision, and the dentist appealed to this Court. We reverse because there was insufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-18\">II. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b883-19\">Since 1986, Lon N. Peckham, D.M.D, has been licensed by the Board as a general dentist. At all relevant times he operated a solo practice called AIRO Dental in Post Falls, Idaho. This case is based on two separate chains of events. The first involves his treatment of Judy Malby, a patient who patronized his office between June of 2003 and February of 2007. The second involves an ongoing dispute with the Board regarding claims that Dr. Peckham made in a newspaper advertisement and on his website, although the charges here are based on only a single webpage.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-20\">Before the events that gave rise to this case, Dr. Peckham developed a phased treatment plan under which he was to place crowns on four of Malb/s teeth. The allegations here involve only a left rear molar (\u201cTooth 18\u201d). Malby is satisfied with the crowns on the other three teeth; those crowns were made from gold or porcelain fused to gold. Tooth 18 had been crowned some twenty years earlier, but Malby needed a new crown due to further decay.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-21\">In December of 2006, Dr. Peckham placed a silver amalgam buildup on Tooth 18 in preparation for the later installation of a poreelain-fused-to-gold crown. However, after Dr. Peckham built up Tooth 18, Malby asked if he could provide a less expensive crown. Dr. Peckham responded that he could place a \u201csilver crown\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the tooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-22\">Malby does not \u201cremember the real conversation\u201d with Dr. Peckham regarding the \u201csilver crown.\u201d She is \u201csure there was some conversation\u201d but cannot \u201cremember anything that was talked about.\u201d She remembers only that the following pieces of information were <em>not </em>revealed: (1) that the crown would be \u201csilver amalgam\u201d as opposed to pure \u201csilver\u201d; (2) that silver amalgam is the same substance used for fillings; and (3) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>the \u201csilver crown\u201d would be shaped directly in her mouth in a single visit, as opposed to manufactured in a lab and installed during a follow-up visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Before the \u201csilver crown\u201d was placed, Malby knew that it would be \u201cless visually appealing than a porcelain crown.\u201d Nonetheless, she chose the \u201csilver crown\u201d for two reasons: (1) as a rear molar, the aesthetics of Tooth 18 were less important to her; and (2) she wanted to save money. Malby admitted that \u201c[she] alone made the choice between a porcelain crown and a silver crown\u201d and that \u201cPeckham did not suggest or recommend one over the other.\u201d Dr. Peckham concedes that he may not have used the word \u201camalgam.\u201d According to Dr. Peckham, he uses the term \u201csilver crown\u201d because it is more understandable to patients. His unrebutted testimony was that he advised Malby that the \u201csilver crown\u201d would not last as long as a full gold or poreelain-fused-to-gold crown.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Dr. Peckham placed the \u201csilver crown\u201d on Tooth 18 in February of 2007. In July of 2008, the \u201csilver crown\u201d detached from Tooth 18. Malby first visited a dentist named Dr. Simon Prosser in the hopes that he could glue the \u201csilver crown\u201d back to Tooth 18. Dr. Prosser examined the \u201csilver crown,\u201d determined that he could not re-attach it, and recommended an implant. In August, Malby sought a second opinion from Dr. Steven Bates, a general dentist licensed in Washington State who has practiced in Deer Park, Washington for thirty-five years. Bates also suggested an implant, but Malby opted for a buildup and new crown instead. In September of 2008, Malby filed an official complaint with the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">There is conflicting evidence about why the \u201csilver crown\u201d detached. Dr. Peekham\u2019s theory is that the underlying tooth structure further decayed because Malby failed to practice good dental hygiene and make follow-up appointments. He finds support in the fact that Dr. Prosser observed \u201crecurrent decay\u201d on what remained of Tooth 18. However, Dr. Bates stated there was no decay and that the remaining tooth structure was \u201cpretty clean.\u201d The hearing officer made no findings on this question, which in any event is irrelevant to the issue of whether Malby received sufficient information about the \u201csilver crown\u201d procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">At some point in late 2007 or early 2008, Dr. Peckham published an advertisement in the Coeur d\u2019Alene Press titled \u201cShocking Research From World Authority <em>Finds a Link </em>Between Dementia and Missing Teeth.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The advertisement stated that a recent study showed that <em>\u201cpeople with no teeth or very few teeth had a higher rate of dementia.\u201d </em>After receiving a complaint regarding the advertisement, the Board sent a letter <em>to </em>Dr. Peckham demanding that he immediately cease \u201c[t]his type of advertising.\u201d The Board\u2019s letter claimed that the advertisement \u201cmay be false, or misleading or deceptive to the public and is not readily susceptible to verification\u201d (an apparent reference to I.D.A.P.A. 19.01.01.046.02) and that the advertisement was \u201cintended to take advantage of the fears and emotions of a particularly susceptible type of patient\u201d (an apparent reference to the former I.D.A.P.A. 19.01.01.046.02(f)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">Only a single webpage from the AIRO Dental website is alleged as a basis of the charges at issue here. That page, which is titled \u201cTHE TRUTH ABOUT DENTURES\u201d (the \u201cDentures Page\u201d), begins with the following disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-13\">Can you handle the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-14\">The State Dental Board doesn\u2019t think you can!!!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-15\">WARNING: If you are easily scared and prone to make rash decisions without understanding the risks as well as the benefits, don\u2019t read any farther [sic]. This report is only suitable for rational adults.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b884-16\">The Dentures Page goes on to state that \u201cour political dental organizations don\u2019t think you can handle the truth, and are actively trying to hide it from you!\u201d It explains that Dr. Peckham published a \u201cpublic service ad in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>our local newspaper,\u201d but two weeks later [he] received a \u2018cease and desist reprimand\u2019 from the state dental board accusing [him] of taking unfair advantage of \u201cvulnerable individuals.\u2019 \u201d Although he had placed the warning as a precautionary measure to ensure compliance with the former I.D.A.P.A. 19.01.01.046.02(f), Dr. Peckham \u201cfirmly believe[d] that the public has a right to know, and that we as professionals have a duty to inform about any health dangers we may know or learn of.\u201d The Dentures Page then makes a number of factual assertions, including that \u201c[m]issing teeth are associated with dementia\u201d and that \u201c[l]ong term denture use leads to ... [increasing risk of diabetes ... [and] [i]ncreasing risk of heart disease.\u201d There are no citations on the Dentures Page. However, the Dentures Page acknowledges that \u201cto be perfectly honest, we don\u2019t know exactly why all these facts are true.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">Although it was not mentioned in the Board\u2019s Amended Administrative Complaint, both parties extensively discuss the so-called \u201cDenture Truth Report.\u201d The Denture Truth Report apparently can be viewed on the AIRO Dental website, and also was available to interested individuals upon request in hard-copy form. It is similar to the Dentures Page, but includes an addendum listing many articles from peer-reviewed scientific journals on which Dr. Peckham supposedly relied when making his factual claims about dentures. Only one of those articles, Pamela Sparks Stein et al., <em>Tooth Loss, Dementia and Neuropathology in the Nun Study, </em>138 J. Am. Dental Ass\u2019n 1314 (2007) (hereinafter the \u201cStein Article\u201d), is included as part of the record. The Stein Article reports a longitudinal study of the dental and cognitive health of a group of Roman Catholic nuns. It found that there is a correlation between a low number of teeth and the onset of dementia late in life, but cautioned that causation should not be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">In April of 2009, the Board filed its Administrative Complaint against Dr. Peckham based on his alleged failure to (1) \u201cadvise [Malby] in understandable terms of the treatment to be rendered, i.e., providing a large amalgam build up rather than a silver crown,\u201d and to (2) \u201cinform [Malby] of the proposed treatment and any reasonable alternatives, and ... to involve [her] in treatment decisions ... [by] providing a large amalgam build up when [she] expected to receive a silver crown.\u201d In December the Board filed its Amended Administrative Complaint. In addition to the allegations listed above regarding the Malby Matter, the Board further alleged that Dr. Peckham made misleading representations on his website related to (1) the correlation between denture use and various ailments, and (2) his suggestion that the Board was trying to hide the \u201ctruth\u201d about that correlation. These allegations were based on the Dentures Page only, not on the newspaper advertisement or the Denture Truth Report. The Board requested the revocation of Dr. Peckham\u2019s license and a fine of up to $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">A hearing was held in July of 2010. During the hearing, the Board offered two definitions of a \u201ccrown.\u201d According to Dr. Blaisdell, a licensed general dentist who has practiced for thirty years in Caldwell, Idaho, a crown is: \u201c[a] substitute or a replacement for the top of the tooth when it becomes damaged or too weak to be able to support the occlusive forces [i.e.] the biting forces of the mouth.\u201d Dr. Blaisdell further testified that \u201cthe conventional way\u201d in which a crown is placed is an indirect method; in other words, a crown normally is manufactured outside the mouth and then cemented onto the remainder of the tooth that requires treatment. The second definition came from a textbook titled \u201cContemporary Fixed Prosthodontics\u201d on which Dr. Blaisdell relied when formulating his own definition. According to the textbook, a crown is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">[A]n artificial replacement that restores missing tooth structure by surrounding part or all of the remaining structure with a material such as cast metal, porcelain, or a combination of materials such as metal or porcelain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Notably, the textbook definition does not list direct placement as a determinative characteristic.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">Dr. Blaisdell further testified that \u201camalgam\u201d is a combination of metals. In dentistry a \u201csilver amalgam\u201d \u2014 i.e. an amalgam that includes silver \u2014 is frequently used to fill eavi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>ties and to build up tooth surfaces as preparation for the placement of crowns made from other materials. The advantage of a silver amalgam is that it can be placed on a tooth in a \u201cmushy form\u201d and then shaped as it hardens.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Ultimately, Dr. Blaisdell opined that the \u201csilver crown\u201d was a silver amalgam buildup rather than a crown, on the sole grounds that it was placed directly, rather than indirectly. Similarly, Dr. Bates opined that the \u201csilver crown\u201d was a \u201cpiece of amalgam\u201d and not a crown.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Dr. Blaisdell admitted on cross-examination that the type of material used does not determine whether a restoration is a crown. He also conceded that in the 1970s a dentist reported using the same procedure that Dr. Peckham used on Tooth 18 and that this dentist called the restoration an \u201camalgam crown.\u201d Finally, Dr. Blaisdell testified that \u201c[cjolloquially people would call it a silver crown.\u201d Similarly, Dr. Bates admitted on cross-examination that the item that dislodged from Tooth 18 could be called \u201can amalgam crown,\u201d although he considered it an inferior and temporary alternative to a \u201cpermanent crown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">At no time during the hearing did the Board put on any evidence regarding the amount of information that a dentist in good standing would have provided regarding the \u201csilver crown\u201d procedure. Indeed, the only testimony related to that subject came from Dr. Peekham\u2019s expert, Dr. Darrel Mooney. Dr. Mooney is licensed to practice fixed prosthodonties,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and has been doing so in Boise since 1987. He testified that no further consent is needed before placing a silver amalgam \u201ccrown\u201d if a patient has already properly consented to a gold crown, and then requests a cheaper alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">In September of 2010, the hearing officer issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Recommended Order (\u201cRecommended Order\u201d). In the Malby Matter, the hearing officer found that \u201c[tjhere is some basis for an \u2018amalgam\u2019 crown dating back more than 30 years,\u201d but also found that \u201c[t]he procedure performed on Ms. Malby [on] February 16, 2007, was best described as an amalgam build up; a crown was not placed in her mouth.\u201d The hearing officer further opined, without citing any expert testimony or other evidence in the record, that \u201c[i]t can reasonably be concluded that unless a patient is specifically informed that amalgam will be used to create a direct placement crown, the patient did not give informed consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-11\">The hearing officer concluded that Dr. Peckham had violated I.C. \u00a7 54-924, which allows the Board to revoke or suspend a dentist\u2019s license or impose fines of up to $10,000 per violation. Specifically, the hearing officer found that Dr. Peckham had violated the subsections stating that a dentist shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-12\">(7) Commit malpractice, that is, to provide dental care which fails to meet the standard of dental care provided by other qualified dentists in the same community or similar communities, taking into account his training, experience and the degree of expertise to which he holds himself out to the public; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-13\">(8) Engage in unprofessional, unethical or immoral conduct, as defined by board rules; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b886-14\">(12) Violate any other provisions of law or rules adopted by the board____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b886-15\">The hearing officer concluded that, in the Malby Matter, Dr. Peckham violated a single rule: I.D.A.P.A. 19.01.01.040.21, which forbids the \u201c[f|ailure to advise patients ... in understandable terms of the treatment to be rendered [or] alternatives____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-16\">In the Advertising Matter, the hearing officer concluded that \u201cDr. Peckham\u2019s website and supporting information concerning \u2018The Truth About Dentures\u2019 [are collectively] an advertisement as defined by I.D.A.P.A. Rule 19.01.01.046.01(8) <em>[sic </em>\u2014 should be (a) ].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>He further concluded that Dr. Peckham had violated I.C. \u00a7 54-924(4) and (9), which provide in pertinent part that no dentist shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aut\">(4) (a) Make ... any fraudulent, false, or misleading statement as to his own ... method of practice; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-4\">(e) Advertise the use of, or use, any system, method, technique [or] device ... which is ... falsely advertised ... or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-5\">(9) Advertise in such way as to ... probably deceive or defraud, the public or patrons____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Dr. Peckham supposedly violated a single rule in the Advertising Matter: I.D.A.P.A. 19.01.01.046.02, which prohibits licensed dentists from advertising \u201cin any form or manner which is false, misleading or deceptive to the public or which is not readily susceptible to verification.\u201d The rule further provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-7\">False, misleading or deceptive advertising or advertising that is not readily susceptible to verification includes, but is not limited to, advertising that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-8\">a. Makes a material misrepresentation of fact or omits a material fact; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b887-9\">b. Makes a representation likely to create an unjustified expectation about the results of a dental procedure____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">The hearing officer held that Dr. Peckham misleadingly (1) failed to distinguish between causation and correlation; (2) conflated missing teeth with long-term denture use; (3) indicated \u201cthat he can cure or limit heart disease and diabetes by dental treatment\u201d; and (4) suggested that the Board was attempting to hide the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">In March of 2011, the Board issued its Final Order. The Board recited that it had considered all of the evidence presented to it and that it had also scrutinized the Recommended Order. Furthermore, the Board adopted the Recommended Order \u201cin its entirety including all findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d and \u201cincorporated\u201d the Recommended Order \u201cby reference.\u201d The Board then imposed a penalty of $10,000 ($5,000 for each of the two infractions) and ordered Dr. Peckham to pay $23,000 in prosecution costs as provided by I.C. \u00a7 54-924.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-14\">Later in March, Dr. Peckham filed his Petition for Judicial Review in the First Judicial District Court for Bonner County. In January of 2012, the district court issued its Memorandum Opinion and Order on Petition for Judicial Review, in which it upheld the Board\u2019s Final Order in all respects. Regarding the Malby Matter, the court commented that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence for the hearing officer to find Dr. Peckham failed to advise Ms. Malby in understandable terms that the tooth restoration he provided on her back molar was an amalgam material overlay or crown, rather than a silver metal crown.\u201d In the Advertising Matter, the court held, with little explanation, that the Board\u2019s decision was supported by the record. Dr. Peck-ham timely appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-15\">III. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b887-16\">A. Is the Board\u2019s Final Order procedurally deficient merely because it incorporates by reference the hearing officer\u2019s Recommended Order?</p>\n<p id=\"b887-17\">B. Should the district court\u2019s order upholding the Board\u2019s decision in the Malby Matter be reversed?</p>\n<p id=\"b887-18\">C. Should the district court\u2019s order upholding the Board\u2019s decision in the Advertising Matter be reversed?</p>\n<p id=\"b887-19\">D. Is Dr. Peckham entitled to attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117?</p>\n<p id=\"b887-20\">IV. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b887-21\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s decision in a petition for judicial review under the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, we examine the agency record independently, but ultimately decide whether the district court correctly ruled on the issues presented to it. <em>See Two Jinn, Inc. v. Idaho Dep\u2019t. of Ins., </em>154 Idaho 1, 3, 293 P.3d 150, 152 (2013). An agency\u2019s final order must be affirmed unless the appellant shows that his substantial rights have been prejudiced, I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(4); <em>Hawkins v. Bonneville Cnty. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>151 Idaho 228, 232, 254 P.3d 1224, 1228 (2011), and also that the final order is:</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">(c) made upon unlawful procedure;</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">(d) not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole; or</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">(e) arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">I.C. \u00a7 67-5279(3); <em>Wheeler v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Welfare, </em>147 Idaho 257, 260, 207 P.3d 988, 991 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">We will not disturb an agency\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record, even if the evidence is conflicting. <em>A &amp; B Irrigation Dist. v. Idaho Dep\u2019t of Water Res., </em>153 Idaho 500, 505-06, 284 P.3d 225, 230-31 (2012); <em>Vickers v. Lowe, </em>150 Idaho 439, 446, 247 P.3d 666, 673 (2011). It is the Board\u2019s burden to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence, rather than the accused\u2019s burden to prove his innocence. <em>See Laurino v. Bd. of Prof'l Discipline of Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>137 Idaho 596, 601, 51 P.3d 410, 415 (2002) (citing <em>Cooper v. Bd. of Prof'l Discipline of Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>134 Idaho 449, 456 n. 3, 4 P.3d 561, 568 n. 3 (2000)). And, while the Board may use its expertise to reach factual findings based on evidence in the record, that expertise cannot serve as a substitute for necessary evidence. <em>See Paul v. Bd. of Prof'l Discipline of Idaho State Bd. of Med., </em>134 Idaho 838, 842, 11 P.3d 34, 38 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Y. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">A. The Board\u2019s Final Order is not procedurally deficient merely because it incorporates by reference the hearing officer\u2019s Recommended Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-12\">Dr. Peekham argues that the Board\u2019s Final Order was deficient because it incorporates by reference the hearing officer\u2019s Recommended Order without setting forth new findings of fact or reasoning. The Board responds that Dr. Peekham was properly served with a copy of the Recommended Order. Therefore, he was not prejudiced in any way by the fact that the Board\u2019s Final Order did not restate the hearing officer\u2019s findings and reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">Under the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act, an agency\u2019s final order must include: \u201cA reasoned statement in support of the decision. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts of record supporting the findings.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 67-5248(1)(a). In an analogous case, a Florida appellate court held that it is not reversible error for an agency to incorporate by reference a hearing officer\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, rather than stating them anew in the final agency order. <em>See City of Orlando v. Int'l Ass\u2019n of Fire Fighters, Local 1365, </em>384 So.2d 941, 946 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1980). We agree and find no error with the Board\u2019s procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">B. The district court\u2019s order upholding the Board\u2019s decision in the Malby Matter must be reversed because there is insufficient evidence that Dr. Peck-ham failed to adequately inform Malby about the \u201csilver crown\u201d procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-17\">Dr. Peekham argues that the Board never established a standard of care. Rather, the hearing officer independently created his own standard. Dr. Peekham further argues that the Board\u2019s failure to establish a standard of care deprived him of due process of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Board contends that it was unnecessary to establish a standard of care because this is an administrative disciplinary proceeding. The Board insists that \u201cthere was ample testimony that Ms. Malby received an amalgam buildup and not a crown,\u201d and that \u201camalgam crowns are not used in the current practice of dentistry.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>We begin our analysis with two indisputable propositions. First, it would be impossible for a healthcare provider to fully apprise his or her patients of every aspect of each procedure. The human body is amazingly complex, and to fully comprehend even the most mundane treatment one must have an advanced understanding of anatomy and physiology. Without some limit on the amount of information that a healthcare provider is obligated to discuss, our healthcare infrastructure would grind to a halt.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">However, it is equally clear that in the absence of an emergency a healthcare provider must offer pertinent information to his or her patients. The failure to do so would be a grave affront to their rights to self-determination and bodily autonomy. <em>See Pekera v. Purpora, </em>80 Conn.App. 685, 836 A.2d 1253, 1256 (2003), <em>aff'd, </em>273 Conn. 348, 869 A.2d 1210 (2005); <em>McQuitty v. Spangler, </em>410 Md. 1, 976 A.2d 1020, 1031 (2009); <em>Canesi ex rel. Canesi v. Wilson, </em>158 N.J. 490, 730 A.2d 805, 812 (1999); Roger L. Jansson, Note, <em>Researcher Liability for Negligence in Human Subject Research: Informed Consent and Researcher Malpractice Actions, </em>78 Wash. L. Rev. 229, 244 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Our Legislature has struck a balance between these competing concerns in I.C. \u00a7 39-4506, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-6\">Any ... consent [for the furnishing of health care, treatment or procedures] shall be deemed valid and [reasonably] informed if the health care provider to whom it is given or by whom it is secured has made such disclosures and given such advice respecting pertinent facts and considerations as would ordinarily be made and given under the same or similar circumstances, by a like health care provider of good standing practicing in the same community-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">This statute is part of the Medical Consent and Natural Death Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The purposes of the Act are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-9\">(a) To provide and codify Idaho law concerning consent for the furnishing of hospital, medical, dental, surgical and other health care, treatment or procedures, and concerning what constitutes an informed consent for such health care, treatment or procedures; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b889-10\">(b) To provide certainty and clarity in the law of medical consent in the furtherance of high standards of health care and its ready availability in proper cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">I.C. \u00a7 39-4501(1). Nothing in the Act suggests that it is inapplicable in administrative disciplinary proceedings. As such, Dr. Peck-ham can be punished for inadequately advising Malby about certain particulars of the \u201csilver crown\u201d restoration only if the Board establishes that, under similar circumstances, a dentist in good standing would have provided that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">Malby has very little recollection of her discussion with Dr. Peckham regarding the \u201csilver crown.\u201d In fact, she identified only three pieces of information that Dr. Peckham did not reveal: (1) that the crown would be silver amalgam as opposed to pure silver; (2) that silver amalgam is the same substance used for fillings; and (3) that the \u201csilver crown\u201d would be shaped directly in her mouth in a single visit, as opposed to manufactured in a lab and installed during a follow-up visit. There is not one shred of evidence that a dentist in good standing under the circumstances that Dr. Peckham encountered would have provided any of these three pieces of information. Moreover, the parties debate at length whether a direct-placement restoration can technically qualify as a \u201ccrown.\u201d We will assume <em>arguendo </em>that it cannot. Even with the benefit of this assumption, there is simply no evidence that a dentist in good standing under the circumstances that Dr. Peckham encountered would have apprised his patient of the obscure semantic distinction between a \u201ccrown\u201d and an \u201camalgam buildup\u201d or \u201camalgam crown.\u201d Because there was insufficient evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>support the Board\u2019s conclusion in the Malby Matter, the district court\u2019s order upholding it must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">C. The district court\u2019s order upholding the Board\u2019s decision in the Advertising Matter must be reversed because there is insufficient evidence that any of the statements in the Dentures Page were misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">We hold that the Board did not adduce sufficient evidence to support a finding that any of Dr. Peekham\u2019s statements on the Dentures Page were misleading.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As noted earlier, the hearing officer\u2019s Recommended Order, which was adopted by the Board and upheld by the district court, identified four ways in which the Dentures Page was supposedly misleading: it (1) failed to distinguish between causation and correlation; (2) conflated missing teeth with long-term denture use; (3) indicated \u201cthat [Dr. Peckham] can cure or limit heart disease and diabetes by dental treatment\u201d; and (4) suggested that the Board was attempting to hide the truth. We address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">First, the Dentures Page merely states that \u201cmissing teeth are associated with dementia.\u201d It does not state that missing teeth cause dementia. The Dentures Page also asserts that \u201c[l]ong term denture use leads to ... increasing risk of diabetes [and] ... increasing risk of heart disease.\u201d During the hearing, the Board cross-examined Dr. Peckham about whether the articles that he relied on supported these claims; Dr. Peck-ham insisted that they did. The Board never presented any expert testimony to the contrary. Nor did it make any of Dr. Peckham\u2019s sources \u2014 with the exception of the Stein Article, which dealt only with dementia \u2014 part of the record. Therefore, there is no basis for concluding that Dr. Peekham\u2019s unrebutted testimony was inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">Second, the articles that Dr. Peckham relies on apparently discuss connections between missing teeth and various ailments, as opposed to denture use and various ailments. Dr. Peckham assumes that there is a high overlap between the set of people who lack teeth and the set of people who use dentures, and infers that characteristics of the first set will be shared by the second set. Perhaps there are many toothless people without dentures. If this is so, then Dr. Peckham\u2019s inferential leap is unwarranted. In the absence of any evidence on this question, however, we cannot conclude that this aspect of the Dentures Page is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">Third, the Dentures Page simply does not claim that Dr. Peckham can cure or limit heart disease and diabetes by dental treatment. It suggests that dental treatment can eliminate one contributing cause of these ailments. There is no evidence that this claim is unfounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-11\">Finally, the validity of Dr. Peckham\u2019s claim that the Board is hiding the truth is entirely dependent on whether Dr. Peckham is disseminating the \u201ctruth.\u201d The Board has not proven that the contents of the newspaper advertisement are untrue (although one could well characterize Dr. Peckham\u2019s writing style as sensationalistic and tawdry). Therefore, there is insufficient evidence that Dr. Peck-ham\u2019s criticism of the Board in the Dentures Page is misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-12\">Because there is insufficient proof to establish that the Dentures Page is misleading, the Board\u2019s decision in the Advertising Matter cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">D. Dr. Peckham is not entitled to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">Dr. Peckham requests attorney fees on appeal pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 12-117. Although we ultimately find the Board\u2019s arguments unpersuasive, we do not believe that it \u201cacted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.\u201d I.C. \u00a7 12-117(1). Therefore, we decline Dr. Peckham\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-15\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b890-16\">We reverse the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Board\u2019s Final Order as to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>the Malby and the advertising matters because there was insufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s conclusions. We tax costs, but not attorney fees, in Dr. Peckham\u2019s favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b891-4\">Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices EISMANN, J.
