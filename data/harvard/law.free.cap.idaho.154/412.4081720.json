Jones appealed his conviction by an Elmore County jury on two counts of rape. The case was initially heard by the Idaho Court of Appeals, which affirmed on one count and reversed on the second.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones sought review, which we granted in order to consider the force and resistance necessary with respect to a charge of forcible rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">In the spring of 2008, Jones, Craig Carpenter, and the victim, A.S., were longtime friends. Carpenter and A.S. were engaged and had children together but, unbeknownst to Carpenter, Jones and A.S. had been sexually involved for approximately four years. On May 22, 2008, after spending the night together in Jackpot, Nevada, A.S. and Jones drove back to Idaho and decided they would end their affair. But despite this, they returned to A.S.\u2019s apartment and engaged in consensual sex that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Afterwards, A.S. went to the bathroom and then returned to the bedroom, where Jones was looking at pornographic material on the computer. Jones sat next to A.S. on the bed and started touching her, and she responded by telling him that \u201cI thought we had decided that the time before [ ] was the last time and it wasn\u2019t going to happen anymore.\u201d A.S. stated that at that point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-14\">I was laying on my stomach on the bed, and [Jones] got behind me. And I wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing, and I got up on my elbows to see what he was doing, and he was undoing his pants____ I told him, no, that I wasn\u2019t going to do this, and I looked back down, and that\u2019s when he leaned forward, and I was pushed down, like this, to where I couldn\u2019t get up, and he started having sex with me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">A.S. clarified that when she stated she was pushed down \u201clike this\u201d she meant that Jones \u201cleaned forward to where his body was pushing on [hers]\u201d and that her \u201chands were underneath [her] and she couldn\u2019t turn around.\u201d Jones then moved A.S.\u2019s underwear to the side and had intercourse with her, while she \u201ckept yelling at him and pleading for him to stop and please quit,\u201d which he ignored. Jones apologized to A;S. afterwards, asked her if she was okay, and admitted that he \u201clost control.\u201d He stated that if A.S. \u201cwanted to press charges that [she] could because he was out of line.\u201d After Jones eventually left, A.S. contacted the Boise State University Women\u2019s Center. She told a counselor that she had been raped and was advised to call the police, which she did not do. Thereafter, A.S. continued to be in contact with Jones and subsequently went to Jackpot with him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-18\">On May 27, Jones went to A.S.\u2019s apartment to watch movies. He spent the night and remained there in the morning after Carpenter left for work and A.S.\u2019s children went to school. At the time, A.S. was taking an antihistamine for a bee sting and a prescription anti-anxiety medication, both of which caused her to feel drowsy. As a result of her drowsiness she laid down on the living room couch and started to \u201cdrift off.\u201d Jones went into the living room, sat next to her, and started stroking her hair. A.S. testified that after he \u201cgrabbed a handful of hair and pulled\u201d hard enough to hurt her, she was nonresponsive in hopes that \u201cif [she] just laid there and didn\u2019t move he would leave [her] alone.\u201d She further stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-19\">After he was done pulling my hair, he left me alone for a little bit. And then he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>grabbed my chest and squeezed my breast really hard____ He apparently didn\u2019t get the reaction he wanted, and he moved down to my vaginal area____ He started touching me outside, and then he started putting his fingers inside me really hard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATlE\">Jones then proceeded to pull down A.'S.\u2019s pants and underwear, and \u201cpushed [her] legs apart and started having sex with [her].\u201d In response, A.S. \u201cjust froze,\u201d and testified that she was \u201cparalyzed\u201d with fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Afterwards, Jones and A.S. went to the bedroom and shared a cigarette. Jones helped A.S. into bed and once again started to have sexual intercourse with her. She testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-9\">[A]bout a little ways into it he stopped, and then he said, \u201cBaby, I do have a problem.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d ... He got off me and pulled his clothes back on and put mine back on. And then he sat me back up and asked me if he could have sex with me. And I just kept saying over and over again, no, my kids are going to be home soon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">Eventually, Jones left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">A.S. drove to Carpenter\u2019s brother\u2019s house and told the brother\u2019s girlfriend that she had been raped. They took A.S. to the hospital where she told the staff that she had been sexually assaulted, but that she did not want to press charges. But law enforcement was contacted, and A.S. provided a statement to police while at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">On May 29, A.S. met with a detective, who arranged for A.S. to make a recorded call to Jones. A.S. confronted Jones regarding the incidents, and Jones is heard on tape apologizing for both incidents, conceding that he \u201ccontinued\u201d with sexual intercourse despite her protests in the first incident and her not responding during the second and admitting that after the first incident he sent her text messages<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cpromising [her] it wouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Additionally, A.S. is clearly heard saying, \u201cYou think this is okay to do to people who are unconscious? Apparently you\u2019ve done this to [M.C.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before, and now you did it to me.\u201d In response, Jones says that he was already on felony probation for domestic battery and that he would have to register as a sex offender based on these new accusations. Jones also admits, when asked to describe the bad things he did in the past, that he had \u201churt [M.C.]\u201d and had also committed driving under the influence (DUI) offenses. Toward the end of the tape, A.S. asks Jones to describe what he did to her\u2014 he states that: \u201cI think that I pushed things too far and I guess it\u2019s rape. I did it. You obviously didn\u2019t want any part of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-22\">Based on the May 22 incident in the bedroom (Count I) and the May 28 incident on the couch (Count II), Jones was charged with two counts of forcible rape under I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(3).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At trial, A.S. testified regarding the events of both days. She admitted she had never informed police that she and Jones were sexually involved during the four years prior to the incidents. She also admitted her statements to the police were incomplete\u2014 specifically, she did not reveal that she and Jones had had consensual sex earlier in the day on May 22. Moreover, although she had shared text messages from Jones that she thought were incriminating, she did not show officers text messages sent by her to Jones that indicated that she loved him (and that would have revealed their relationship). A.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>also admitted that even at the time of trial, she was still concealing her relationship with Jones from Carpenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">During cross-examination, defense counsel focused on a letter that A.S. wrote, had notarized, and gave to the prosecution before trial. In it, she recanted her allegations of rape, asserted that Jones was wrongfully charged, and characterized the incidents as a misunderstanding between her and Jones. But A.S. subsequently sent another letter to the prosecutor that retracted her retraction \u2014 she maintained that counseling had induced a change of heart and that she indeed wished to go forward with the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The State then presented the testimony of the nurse who examined A.S. after the second incident. The nurse stated that A.S. was \u201cvisibly frightened\u201d during their interaction: crying, avoiding eye contact, and speaking very softly. During the examination, A.S. \u201chad her knees to her chest, kind of holding herself\u2019 and afterwards she laid down and \u201cjust kind of curled up.\u201d The nurse further testified that she found no physical evidence of trauma consistent with rape \u2014 there was no bruising, scrapes, or scratches on A.S.\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Just prior to the presentation of the State\u2019s final witness and the introduction of the taped confrontation call into evidence, Jones objected, stating that the tape should be redacted. Specifically, he sought to remove a statement implying he had sex with M.C. while she was asleep. The district court ruled that the tape should not be redacted because it reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">In the first place, ... this is a rape allegation that was without [A.S.\u2019s] consent. I don\u2019t believe that this is a rape allegation that she was unconscious at the time. So that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t see how this is prejudicial. And clearly you could have made this motion a lot earlier. But I don\u2019t see that this is that prejudicial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-8\">Furthermore, whatever relevancy it might have it certainly is not outweighed by any unfair prejudice to your client. I mean, as far as I know this is not a rape case about, you know, over the course of their relationship he was having sex with her while she was asleep.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">The State then called its final witness, detective Bob Chaney, who met with A.S. following the incidents and who arranged the taped call to Jones. That tape was played in its entirety for the jury. Detective Chaney then testified that he read and copied several text messages from Jones to A.S, which were admitted into evidence, but that he did not inspect any messages sent from A.S. to Jones \u2014 -including those in which she told Jones that she loved him. He was unaware that Jones and A.S. had been in a long-term consensual sexual relationship, and that the two had engaged in consensual intercourse on May 22, prior to the first incident. Chaney testified that the lab report he received following A.S.\u2019s examination yielded no traces of semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">Jones moved for a directed verdict at the close of evidence, alleging that the State failed to prove: 1) that A.S. resisted sexual intercourse and 2) that her resistance was overcome by force. The district court denied the motion, and the jury convicted Jones of both counts of forcible rape. He was sentenced to concurrent 25-year sentences, with five years determinate for each. Jones appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals determined that verbal resistance was sufficient to substantiate a charge of forcible rape and further concluded that the force overcoming that resistance would need to be greater than the force inherent in sexual intercourse. The Court applied these standards and affirmed the Count I conviction, but reversed on Count II. The Court further held that the district court\u2019s decision to admit the un-redacted tape into evidence was harmless error. Jones petitioned for, and we granted, review.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">I. Whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for forcible rape as alleged in Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-15\">II. Whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for forcible rape as alleged in Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>III. Whether the district court erred in admitting the un-redacted tape into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">A. Standard of Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">When reviewing a Court of Appeals decision, \u201cthis Court gives serious consideration to the views of the Court of Appeals, but reviews the district court\u2019s decision directly.\u201d <em>State v. Corbus, </em>150 Idaho 599, 602, 249 P.3d 398, 401 (2011); <em>State v. Lampien, </em>148 Idaho 367, 371, 223 P.3d 750, 754 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">In assessing the sufficiency of evidence, we \u201cwill uphold a judgment of conviction entered upon a jury verdict so long as there is substantial evidence upon which a rational trier of fact could conclude that the prosecution proved all essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Severson, </em>147 Idaho 694, 712, 215 P.3d 414, 432 (2009). \u201cEvidence is substantial if a reasonable trier of fact would accept it and rely upon it in determining whether a disputed point of fact has been prove[n].\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. <em>State v. Sheahan, </em>139 Idaho 267, 286, 77 P.3d 956, 975 (2003). Further, we \u201cwill not substitute our own judgment for that of the jury on matters such as the credibility of witnesses, the weight to be given to certain evidence, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>Severson, </em>147 Idaho at 712, 215 P.3d at 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">A district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Thomgren, </em>149 Idaho 729, 731, 240 P.3d 575, 577 (2010). Generally speaking, the lower court has sole discretion in deciding whether to admit or exclude evidence. <em>State v. Howard, </em>135 Idaho 727, 731, 24 P.3d 44, 48 (2001). But, this discretion is not unlimited. The trial court must exercise reason in its decision making. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, this \u201cbroad discretion in the admission of evidence at trial will be reversed only where there has been a clear abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732, 24 P.3d at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">If no objection is made to a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, then the issue is not preserved and may only be considered on appeal if it constitutes \u201cfundamental error.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 224-26, 245 P.3d 961, 976-78 (2010). In that case, \u201cthe appellate court\u2019s authority to remedy [the] error is strictly circumscribed to eases where the error results in the defendant being deprived his or her Fourteenth Amendment due process right to a fair trial in a fair tribunal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224, 245 P.3d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">B. There was sufficient evidence to convict Jones on Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">The first question before this Court is whether there is sufficient evidence that Jones forcibly raped A.S. on May 22. Resolving this brings up two broader issues: whether verbal resistance qualifies as resistance under Idaho\u2019s forcible rape statute and the amount of force required to overcome this resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">Jones argues that scant Idaho case law illuminates the meaning of \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cresistance\u201d and that \u201cunless and until the [Legislature affirmatively modifies the common law\u201d of forcible rape, this Court must adhere to the common law understanding that \u201csome quantum of physical resistance is required.\u201d He claims that A.S.\u2019s purely verbal resistance to Jones on May 22 would be insufficient to support a charge of forcible rape. Jones additionally contends that the \u201cextrinsic force standard\u201d should apply, i.e., that a charge of forcible rape requires more force than is inherent in the sexual act. He asserts there was no evidence that he used any force that exceeded what \u201cwas required to achieve penetration.\u201d As he puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-15\">[A.S.] was already lying outstretched in a prone position on her stomach on the bed immediately prior to the intercourse at issue____ Given her physical position, it was necessary for Mr. Jones to position himself on top of [A.S.] in order to accomplish penetration. Additionally, [A.S.] testified that her arms were already underneath her prior to the intercourse \u2014 Mr. Jones did not physically hold her arms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>down or place her arms where they were pinned underneath [A.S.\u2019s] body.... Finally, the act of pulling aside [A.S.\u2019s] underwear was also incidental to the act of penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Jones thus posits that the State failed to provide evidence of resistance or force that would support a conviction for the forcible rape charge in Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">With regard to resistance, the State responds that this Court has not followed the common law standard of \u201cresistance to the utmost\u201d for \u201cat least 105 years,\u201d citing State <em>v. Neil, </em>13 Idaho 539, 90 P. 860 (1907), and <em>State v. Andreason, </em>44 Idaho 396, 257 P. 370 (1927). It argues that in Idaho the resistance factor exists \u201csimply to show two elements of the crime \u2014 the assailant\u2019s intent to use force in order to have carnal knowledge and the woman\u2019s nonconsent.\u201d (quoting <em>Andreason, </em>44 Idaho at 396, 400, 257 P. at 371). Because A.S. said no and \u201cwas effectively prevented from further resistance by being pushed onto the bed with her arms pinned,\u201d the State contends that there was sufficient evidence of resistance. Further, with regard to force, the State argues against the extrinsic force standard. Its contention is that \u201cthe only \u2018quantum\u2019 of force required by the statute is that necessary to \u2018effect\u2019 the penetration over the victim\u2019s resistance.\u201d The State argues that that much force was present here. We will first address the resistance issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">1. Resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The Court freely reviews issues of statutory interpretation. <em>State v. Forbes, </em>152 Idaho 849, 851, 275 P.3d 864, 866 (2012). \u201cWhen [this] Court must engage in statutory construction, it has the duty to ascertain the legislative intent and give effect to that intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to ascertain the intent of the Legislature, \u201cnot only must the literal words of the statute be examined, but also the context of those words, the public policy behind the statute and its legislative history.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">The Idaho Code defines forcible rape as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-12\">Rape is defined as the penetration, however slight, of the oral, anal or vaginal opening with the perpetrator\u2019s penis accomplished with a female under any one (1) of the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-13\">(3) Where she resists but her resistance is overcome by force or violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-14\">I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-15\">The term \u201cresistance\u201d is not defined in the statute and there is no legislative history to provide guidance. Thus, we begin our review by considering the common law. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 73-116. \u201cAt common law, [a] state had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the woman resisted her assailant to the utmost of her physical capacity to prove that an act of sexual intercourse was rape.\u201d Michelle J. Anderson, <em>Reviving Resistance in Rape Law, </em>U. Ill. L.Rev. 953, 962 (1998); <em>see also </em>Joshua Mark Fried, <em>Forcing the Issue: An Analysis of the Various Standards of Forcible Compulsion in Rape, </em>23 Pepp. L.Rev. 1277, 1286 (1996); Susan Est-rich, <em>Rape, </em>95 Yale L.J. 1087, 1122-23, 1130-31 (1986). Thus, under the utmost-physical-resistance standard, \u201cverbal resistance was simply inadequate to prove anything.\u201d Anderson, <em>supra, </em>at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-16\">The utmost-resistance requirement, beyond producing some severely inequitable results at trial,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> proved to be nearly impossible to establish. Anderson, <em>supra, </em>at 964 (noting that under it, even \u201cif a woman struggled to the utmost of her physical capacity until doing so appeared futile to her, and only then acquiesced to the rapist\u2019s advances, she ... was not raped\u201d). Thus, the utmost-resistance standard has since been abandoned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>varying degrees. <em>See People v. Yanik, </em>43 N.Y.2d 97, 99, 400 N.Y.S.2d 778, 779, n. 1, 371 N.E.2d 497 (1977) (\u201cThe [utmost-resistance] standard has been rejected by almost every other court that has considered the question.\u201d). Approximately thirty-two states, the Model Penal Code, the District of Columbia Code, and the Uniform Code of Military Justice have done away with the resistance requirement completely, allowing prosecutors to establish a rape without any resistance present. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 261; Wash. Rev.Code Ann. \u00a7 9A.44.040; Model Penal Code \u00a7 213.1; D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3002; 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a). Six more states\u2019 criminal codes expressly state that physical resistance is not required for a rape conviction. <em>See, e.g., </em>Alaska Stat. Ann. \u00a7 11.41.470(8)(a) (noting that, \u201c \u2018without consent\u2019 means that a person ... with or without resisting, is coerced by the use of force against a person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">As the State notes, Idaho began its departure from the common law rule about 105 years ago. In <em>Neil, </em>this Court examined a charge of assault with intent to commit rape, and particularly, the defendant\u2019s argument that in order to prove every element of rape, \u201cthe state must show ... that the female \u2018showed the utmost reluctance and used the utmost resistance.\u2019\u201d We rejected that approach in this oft-quoted passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">A large number of authorities are cited by counsel for appellant, to the effect that the state must show in such cases that the female \u201cshowed the utmost reluctance and used the utmost resistance.\u201d <em>De Voy [Devoy] v. State, </em>99 N.W. 455, 122 Wis. 148 [ (1904) ]. To our minds the trouble with a number of these authorities is that they reverse the order of the inquiry. They go about inquiring into the kind, character, and nature of the fight put up by the woman, rather than the nature of the assault and evident and manifest purpose and intent of the assailant. For the purpose of reaching the conclusions announced in some of these cases, it is necessary to assume that, in the first place, a man has a right to approach a woman, lay hold on her person, take indecent liberties with her, and that, unless she \u201ckicks, bites, scratches, and screams\u201d <em>(People v. Morrison, </em>1 Parker Cr. R. [N.Y.] 625) to the \u201cutmost of her power and ability,\u201d she will be deemed to have consented, and indeed to have invited the familiarity. Such is neither justice, law, nor sound reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">13 Idaho at 547-48, 90 P. at 862. This early departure from the utmost resistance requirement gained much favorable comment. <em>See, e.g., People v. Norrington, </em>55 Cal.App. 103, 202 P. 932, 935 (1921) (stating that \u201c[o]ur views upon this phase of the case are so admirably expressed by the Idaho Supreme Court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">This Court reaffirmed <em>Neil, </em>and clarified the meaning of the resistance requirement, in <em>State v. Andreason. </em>There, the appellant was walking with a woman who he forcibly pulled toward him. 44 Idaho at 399, 257 P. at 370. She tried to get away, and they fell on the ground, at which point he \u201cplaced his hand over the girl\u2019s mouth when she attempted to scream, and while holding her on the ground, raised her dress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But she managed to get up, pushed the appellant away, and ran to safety. <em>Id. </em>After escaping, \u201cone of her arms was bleeding, her dress was torn, and she was bereft of one shoe\u201d \u2014 she testified \u201cthat she was completely exhausted from the scuffle, and that perhaps she could not have gotten away if appellant had not wanted to let her go.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 257 P. at 370-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The appellant in <em>Andreason </em>argued that \u201cthe law [requires] an intent to accomplish the act [of rape] in spite of any resistance that the victim may put forth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 257 P. at 371. Or, in other words, he argued that because the woman escaped his assault, or because he relented and \u201cwanted to let her go,\u201d that he had not assaulted her with intent to commit rape. <em>Id. </em>at 399-400, 257 P. at 370. The Court characterized his argument as \u201ca misconception, or at least an overemphasis, as to the necessity for resistance on the part of the woman attacked.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400, 257 P. at 371. We then clarified, \u201cThe importance of resistance by the woman is simply to show two elements of the crime \u2014 the assailant\u2019s intent to use force in order to have carnal knowledge, and the woman\u2019s nonconsent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>the \u201cappellant finally desisted in his efforts to accomplish the object which the jury found he had intended, and that [because he ended] the encounter ... he did not consummate his purpose, this would not justify the conclusion of an absence of a lecherous desire before he withdrew from the struggle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 401, 257 P. at 371. The Court held there was sufficient evidence to uphold a verdict of assault with intent to commit rape. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02, 257 P. at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Based on the case law developed beginning with <em>Neil, </em>Idaho Criminal Jury Instruction 904, entitled \u201cResistance to Rape,\u201d provides, \u201cAlthough [the victim] must have resisted the act of penetration, the amount of resistance need only be such as would show the victim\u2019s lack of consent to the act.\u201d That instruction was given in this case. The comment to the instruction says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-5\">In Idaho, the rape victim is not required to resist to the utmost of the victim\u2019s ability. <em>State v. Neil, </em>13 Idaho 539, 90 P. 860 (1907). The importance of resistance by the victim is simply to show two elements of the crime \u2014 the assailant\u2019s intent to use force in order to have sexual intercourse and the victim\u2019s non-consent. <em>State v. Andreason, </em>44 Idaho 396, 357 [257] P. 370 (1927). <em>See also, State v. Fowler, </em>13 Idaho 317, 89 P. 757 (1907); <em>State v. Lewis, </em>96 Idaho 743, 536 P.2d 738 (1975); <em>State v. Robran, </em>119 Idaho 285, 805 P.2d 491 (Ct.App.1991); <em>State v. Gossett, </em>119 Idaho 581, 808 P.2d 1326 (Ct.App.1991).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Given the plain language of Idaho\u2019s forcible rape statute and Idaho\u2019s well-established case law regarding resistance, we hold the statute does not require that rape victims resist to their utmost physical ability and that verbal resistance is sufficient resistance to substantiate a charge of forcible rape. For one thing, there is no language in I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(3) requiring \u201cphysical\u201d resistance. The statute only requires \u201cresistance.\u201d It does not differentiate between physical or verbal resistance. Furthermore, <em>Neil </em>and <em>Andreason </em>have expressly rejected the common law utmost physical resistance standard. As a result, the English common law regarding forcible rape has not applied in Idaho for over a century. Therefore, in this State verbal resistance is sufficient for a charge of forcible rape. Whether the evidence establishes the element of resistance is a fact-sensitive determination based on the totality of the circumstances, including the victim\u2019s words and conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Beyond this, allowing verbal resistance to support a charge of forcible rape is sound policy. Requiring physical resistance by a rape victim naturally \u201cincreases the likelihood of the attacker\u2019s use of violence.\u201d <em>State v. McKnight, </em>54 Wash.App. 521, 774 P.2d 532, 534 (1989) <em>(where the </em>court found \u201cno rational basis for requiring resistance to be manifest in all cases by physical means, and in fact, [was] persuaded that public policy considerations militate against such a requirement\u201d); <em>see also People v. Barnes, </em>42 Cal.3d 284, 228 Cal.Rptr. 228, 721 P.2d 110, 119 (1986) (citing studies reporting that \u201cthe likelihood of receiving injuries requiring medical treatment nearly doubled when victims resisted assailants\u201d and that \u201cresistance is inadvisable since it may provoke greater injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">The State highlights the inequity of requiring physical resistance in situations in which the victim is restrained and unable to physically resist, as was the case here. It argued that because \u201cJones applied sufficient force to effectively prevent physical resistance\u201d by A.S., it would be a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d to then hold that forcible rape did not occur due to merely verbal resistance. We agree. As this Court observed in <em>Neil, </em>an inquiry \u201cinto the kind, character, and nature of the fight put up by the woman, rather than the nature of the assault and evident and manifest purpose and intent of the assailant,\u201d is in effect, backwards. <em>Neil, </em>13 Idaho at 547-48, 90 P. at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">Based on the evidence before it, the jury certainly had sufficient basis to find that on May 22, A.S. resisted Jones\u2019 advances. She testified that she \u201ckept yelling at him and pleading for him to stop and please quit, and he just kept ignoring her.\u201d When asked if she tried to \u201cstrike out,\u201d she responded that \u201c[she] couldn\u2019t,\u201d because \u201c[her] hands were pinned down, and Jones\u2019 weight was on [her] on the bed.\u201d In sum, A.S.\u2019s verbal resistance, in the form of repeated pleas for Jones <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>to stop, was sufficient evidence of resistance under I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">2. Physical force or violence overcoming resistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The next issue before us is the meaning of \u201cforce or violence\u201d overcoming resistance, for the purposes of I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(3). There are two primary approaches for addressing this issue: the extrinsic force standard, which defines \u201cforce\u201d as anything beyond that which is inherent or incidental to the sexual act itself and the intrinsic force standard, which deems the force inherent in intercourse as sufficient to substantiate a charge of forcible rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The extrinsic force standard is the traditional view and \u201cis still the most commonly adopted.\u201d <em>See also Stokes v. State, </em>648 So.2d 1179 (Ala.Crim.App.1994); <em>State v. Parish, </em>405 So.2d 1080 (La.1981); <em>State v. Soderquist, </em>63 Wash.App. 144, 816 P.2d 1264, 1266 (1991); <em>Martin v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 190, 686 A.2d 1130, 1155 (Md.Spec.App.1996); <em>State v. Kaufman, </em>187 Ohio App.3d 50, 931 N.E.2d 143, 158 (2010); <em>Sabol v. Commonwealth, </em>37 Va.App. 9, 553 S.E.2d 533, 536 (2001). The standard, as stated by the Washington Court of Appeals in <em>McKnight, </em>is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">The <em>force </em>to which reference is made in forcible compulsion \u201cis not the force inherent in the act of penetration but the force used or threatened to overcome or prevent resistance by the female.\u201d ... Where the degree of force exerted by the perpetrator is the distinguishing feature between second and third degree rape, to establish second degree rape the evidence must be sufficient to show that the force exerted was directed at overcoming the victim\u2019s resistance and was more than that which is normally required to achieve penetration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-8\"><em>McKnight, </em>774 P.2d at 535 (citations omitted). The primary justification for the extrinsic force standard seems to be textual. That is, if a forcible rape statute by definition requires penetration, then for an additional requirement of force to be meaningful, it necessarily must mean some force beyond that inherent in penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">This reasoning was echoed by the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in <em>State v. Jacques, </em>536 A.2d 535 (R.I.1988). There, the state argued that \u201cthe force sufficient to accomplish an act of intercourse may constitute sufficient force to support a conviction for sexual assault.\u201d Id at 537. Or, in other words, it advocated that the court adopt an intrinsic force standard. The court refused, and concluded that \u201cevery element needed to prove\u201d forcible rape must be shown by the state. Id The court also pointed out that Rhode Island\u2019s rape statute \u201clists other situations in which penetration alone is sufficient for a conviction\u201d \u2014 implying that had penetration alone been sufficient for a charge of forcible rape, the extra element of force would not have been added. Id The court reaffirmed the extrinsic force standard, and required the state to show \u201cproof of force beyond that which is used in the consummation of the act.\u201d Id</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">The intrinsic force standard, on the other hand, represents the more modern trend. It provides that any amount of force \u2014 even that which is inherent in intercourse \u2014 can substantiate a charge of rape. The seminal case adopting this standard is <em>In re M.T.S., </em>129 N.J. 422, 609 A.2d 1266 (1992). In <em>M.T.S., </em>the Supreme Court of New Jersey considered \u201cwhether the element of \u2018physical force\u2019 is met simply by an act of non-consensual penetration involving no more force than necessary to accomplish\u201d the act. <em>Id </em>at 1267. There, the victim had been sleeping, and woke up to realize her clothes were removed, and that the assailant was on top of her, in the act of penetration. <em>Id. </em>at 1268. After examining the state\u2019s \u201creformed statute,\u201d which defined rape without reference to a victim\u2019s resistance or submission, the court there found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">The understanding of sexual assault as a criminal battery, albeit one with especially serious consequences, follows necessarily from the Legislature\u2019s decision to eliminate non-consent and resistance from the substantive definition of the offense. Under the new law, the victim no longer is required to resist and therefore need not have said or done anything in order for the sexual penetration to be unlawful. The alleged victim is not put on trial, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>his or her responsive or defensive behavior is rendered immaterial. We are thus satisfied that an interpretation of the statutory crime of sexual assault to require physical force in addition to that entailed in an act of involuntary or unwanted sexual penetration would be fundamentally inconsistent with the legislative purpose to eliminate any consideration of whether the victim resisted or expressed non-consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4ir\"><em>Id. </em>at 1276-77. Other jurisdictions, with similar statutes, have adopted the intrinsic force standard. <em>See State v. Sedia, </em>614 So.2d 583, 535 (Fla.App.1993); <em>State v. Chandler, </em>939 So.2d 574, 580 (La.App.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Based on the plain language of I.C. \u00a7 18-6101(3), we hold that the extrinsic force standard applies in Idaho. Section 18-6101(3) defines forcible rape as \u201cpenetration, however \"slight,\u201d \u201c[w]here [a woman] resists but her resistance is overcome by force or violence.\u201d Were we to construe \u201cforce\u201d as encompassing the act of penetration itself, it would effectively render the force element moot. Force would <em>always </em>be present and never have to be proven, so long as there was sexual intercourse. Generally speaking, \u201cit is incumbent upon a court to give a statute an interpretation which will not render it a nullity.\u201d <em>Hecla Mining Co. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>108 Idaho 147, 151, 697 P.2d 1161, 1165 (1985). Thus, in order to give full effect to the complete text of the statute, we adopt the extrinsic force standard. Beyond this, the intrinsic force standard is typically instituted in jurisdictions where the legislature has stepped in to amend its rape statute. But in Idaho, the Legislature has not undertaken any such reform. We must work within the confines of the statute as written. Thus, we conclude that some force beyond that which is inherent in the sexual act is required for a charge of forcible rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Even with the extrinsic force standard, a jury had sufficient evidence before it to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones used force that overcame A.S.\u2019s resistance. This is because Jones used more force than is inherent in the sexual act during the incident on May 22. As A.S. testified, Jones \u201cleaned forward\u201d and she \u201cwas pushed down ... to where [she] couldn\u2019t get up\u201d; he \u201cleaned forward to where his body was pushing on [hers],\u201d pinning her hands underneath her so she could not turn around; and he removed her underwear to the side. Jones argues that all these actions were merely incidental to the act of intercourse. But Jones\u2019 use of his body weight to trap A.S.\u2019s hands under her, and effectively forestall any struggle, seems in particular less \u201cincidental\u201d to sex and far more like force employed to overcome her resistance. Thus, a jury could well have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones used force to overcome A.S.\u2019s resistance during the incident on May 22. Because both the resistance and force elements were present for this incident, we hold that there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for forcible rape, and accordingly affirm Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">C. Because A.S. neither physically nor verbally resisted sexual intercourse on May 28, there was insufficient evidence to convict Jones on Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">Jones contends that there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction for forcible rape on Count II, particularly that A.S. never even verbally communicated to him that she did not want to engage in sexual activity or that he used force or violence to overcome any resistance. The State counters that \u201cA.S.\u2019s resistance was in feigning sleep\u2014passive resistance,\u201d and that this was enough to show A.S.\u2019s lack of consent to intercourse during the May 28 incident. Jones replies that \u201cthe States\u2019 position that non-resistance is proof of resistance,\u201d is untenable, not in accord with the plain language of 18-6101(3), and would effectively render the explicit resistance requirement a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">We hold that there is insufficient evidence to support a charge of forcible rape based on Count II. By her own admission, A.S. \u201cdidn\u2019t respond\u201d physically, or even verbally, to Jones\u2019 advances on May 28\u2014she \u201cjust froze.\u201d Idaho\u2019s forcible rape statute expressly requires resistance. Satisfying this element with inactivity strains the definition of resistance, essentially nullifying the resistance requirement. Though studies have shown that \u201cfreezing up\u201d is indeed a legitimate, under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>standable reaction of victims of sexual assault,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> this Court has no authority to jettison the resistance requirement \u2014 modifying this State\u2019s statutes is the Legislature\u2019s province alone. As the statute is plainly written, some quantum of resistance is required, and A.S. did not resist Jones\u2019 advances on May 28. There was insufficient evidence on the element of resistance to support the conviction of forcible rape on Count II so we need not consider the issue of force. The conviction on Count II is accordingly reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">D. The admission of the unredacted tape into evidence is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The final issue is whether the admission of the unredacted tape into evidence was an error requiring reversal. Jones argues that given the damaging admissions on the tape, the lack of physical evidence, and A.S.\u2019s credibility issues at trial, that \u201cit cannot be said, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there was no reasonable possibility that admission of the un-redacted recording ... did not contribute\u201d to Jones\u2019 convictions. The State responds that Jones incorrectly considered the prejudicial effect of the entire tape, despite the fact that Jones only objected to a single portion of it at trial. The State further avers that the district court did not err in admitting the tape, and alternatively, if it did err, that doing so was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove\u201d a defendant\u2019s criminal propensity. I.R.E 404(b); <em>State v. Needs, </em>99 Idaho 883, 892, 591 P.2d 130, 139 (1979). But this evidence may be used for purposes other than those prohibited by I.R.E. 404(b). <em>State v. Avila, </em>137 Idaho 410, 412, 49 P.3d 1260, 1262 (Ct.App.2002). This Court uses a two-tiered analysis to review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of prior bad acts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-16\">First, the trial court must determine whether there is sufficient evidence to establish the other crime or wrong as fact---- The trial court must also determine whether the fact of another crime or wrong, if established, would be relevant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-18\">Second, the trial court must engage in a balancing under I.R.E. 403 and determine whether the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-19\"><em>State v. Grist, </em>147 Idaho 49, 52, 205 P.3d 1185, 1188 (2009) (citations omitted). The first-tier relevancy determination is freely reviewed, and the second-tier balancing decision is reviewed with an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>For the latter, this Court asks: \u201c(1) whether the lower court rightly perceived the issue as one of discretion; (2) whether the court acted within the outer boundaries of such discretion and consistently with any legal standards applicable to specific choices; and (3) whether the court reached its decision by an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>State v. Hedger, </em>115 Idaho 598, 600, 768 P.2d 1331, 1333 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-20\">Before analyzing whether admitting the unredacted tape constituted error, it must be noted that in his briefing Jones objects to the admission of a host of statements found on the tape. Particularly, Jones takes issue with his taped admissions that he slept with M.C. \u201cwhile she was sleeping,\u201d that he was on probation for domestic battery, that he had \u201churt\u201d M.C., and that he had previously been convicted of driving under the influence. However, Jones did not object to all these statements at trial \u2014 he only objected to the admission of his statement that he had slept with M.C. while she was sleeping. After the district court agreed that a possibly prejudicial phrase written on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>the tape itself should be redacted, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">THE COURT: But other than [the phrase written on the tape] there\u2019s nothing on the tape that you\u2019re going to be objecting to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGJ\">[Counsel for Jones] MR. BISHOP: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aed\">Subsequently at trial, after the district court apparently ruled that M.C. would not be allowed to testify, and just prior to the introduction of the tape, its actual contents were then brought up:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">MR. BISHOP: Your Honor, we have an issue with regards to the tape. First of all, the tape is going to be played____And, in light of the court\u2019s ruling on the 404(b) [motion], there was <em>one statement that I bring to the attention of the court. </em>There\u2019s a reference about a question by [A.S.] in regards to, has anything like this occurred or something or other, and she makes reference to an incident with [M.C.] who was the individual on the 404. It is about thirty seconds of that tape?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">[Counsel for the State] MS. SCHIN-DELE: Yeah, it\u2019s not a very long \u2014 and I am not even sure \u2014 I can\u2019t remember exactly where in the 53 minutes it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">MR. BISHOP: So that is on the tape. And in light of the decision, I think that should be redacted out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">THE COURT: I am trying to figure out why it should be redacted----What exactly is said so that I know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-12\">MS. SCHINDELE: Your Honor, if I recall \u2014 I was looking for the exact language. I had it written down. If I recall correctly, [A.S.] asks, so have you ever done this before? And I believe there is a negative answer, and then she says, what about with [M.C.]? And I think the defendant\u2019s answer is something about he had sex with her one time while she was sleeping____ It\u2019s something along that line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-15\">THE COURT: All right. I don\u2019t think that is \u2014 I don\u2019t think it should be redacted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-16\">(emphasis added). Based on Jones\u2019 prior statement that he had no objection to the contents of the tape, and his subsequent narrow objection to \u201cone statement\u201d found therein, he only preserved an objection to the tape\u2019s single colloquy regarding Jones\u2019 prior act with M.C. while she slept. While this Court may review unpreserved issues on appeal, it can only do so when the error is fundamental \u2014 and \u201cabuse of discretion in admitting evidence is a trial error\u201d that \u201cwould not constitute fundamental error.\u201d <em>State v. Cannady, </em>137 Idaho 67, 72-73, 44 P.3d 1122, 1127-28 (2002). We simply review the decision to admit Jones\u2019 admission that he slept with M.C. while she slept and will not address any additional unpreserved objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-18\">Turning to the admission of the statement on the tape, the district court concluded that the tape\u2019s prejudicial effect did not substantially outweigh its probative value. The district court based its decision to admit the tape on the dissimilarity of the incidents between Jones and M.C., and between Jones and A.S. Thus, the court stated that \u201cwhatever relevancy [the tape] might have is certainly not outweighed by any unfair prejudice to [Jones]\u201d because \u201cthis is not a rape ease about, you know, over the course of [Jones\u2019 and AS.\u2019s] relationship he was having sex with her while she was asleep.\u201d The exchange in question went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMoS\">[A.S.]: Have you ever done (inaudible) with Stacy when she was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-19\">Jones: No!</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-20\">[AS.]: And [M.C.]? And you told me that you never did this but now I have a hard time believing it. Have you ever done this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-21\">Jones: No, I have not. I guess when you get accused of it for so long you turn that way. I don\u2019t know. I ... I don\u2019t even know myself anymore. The only thing I did with [M.C.] was sleep with her while she was sleeping. That pissed her off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ3\">[A.S.]: So you did the same thing to her you did to me?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-22\">Jones: Um.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-23\">[AS.]: You thought I was asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-24\">Jones: I didn\u2019t think you were asleep.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-25\">We find no fault with the district court\u2019s determination that the danger of unfair prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. For one thing, someone can \u201csleep with someone\u201d in two, completely different senses \u2014 everyone that shares a bed with someone is \u201csleeping with\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>that person; but not everyone who shares a bed with someone is having intercourse with that person, consensual or otherwise. Thus, Jones\u2019 admission that he \u201c[slept] with [M.C.] while she was sleeping\u201d does not necessarily amount to a confession that he had sex with her while she was asleep. A further dissimilarity with the situation involving M.C. is Jones\u2019 statement that he did not think A.S. was asleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">However, the district court omitted an important step in its analysis. The court made passing reference to \u201cwhatever relevancy\u201d the statement may have, but did not actually consider its relevance. The district court should have done so and its failure to do so constitutes error. Whether one considers the statement in either of the two senses mentioned above, it is difficult to see how it is relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The State asserts that, even if the district court erred in admitting the statement, the error was harmless. We agree. Even assuming that Jones was stating that he had sex with M.C. while she was sleeping, and that the jury interpreted it this way, this lone statement would not be particularly prejudicial, given the host of other properly admitted evidence of Jones\u2019 guilt. The evidence against Jones was compelling \u2014 he made \u201crepeated admissible statements showing his consciousness of guilt\u201d and sent text messages to A.S. admitting that he lost control. There was A.S.\u2019s detailed testimony that she resisted Jones\u2019 advances and that he overcame those advances by force, which he clearly did not deny during their taped phone call. There were the taped statements to which Jones did not object: Jones\u2019 admissions of being on probation for domestic battery, of hurting M.C., and of his previous D.U.I. offenses. At one point in the tape Jones even admits: \u201cI think that I pushed things too far, and I guess it\u2019s rape. I did it. You obviously didn\u2019t want any part in it.\u201d Moreover, although A.S.\u2019s credibility was called into question, given that she withheld information from law enforcement and recanted the allegations at one point, she was cross-examined vigorously on these points. In short, given the weight and quantity of the unrefuted evidence across the board, versus the one statement regarding Jones and M.C., the statement did not prejudice Jones with respect to Count I. The district court erred in admitting the statement, but we find that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">We affirm Jones\u2019 conviction on Count I, and reverse his conviction on Count II.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-11\">Chief Justice BURDICK, and Justices EISMANN, W.
