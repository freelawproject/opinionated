The defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to admit expert testimony regarding domestic violence and testimony of an excited utterance; the deputy prosecutor\u2019s actions in soliciting testimony of the defendant\u2019s post-custody silence when accused of the crimes; and the verdict finding defendant was a persistent violator. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-16\">Factual Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-17\">On a cold October night at about 3:00 a.m., two patrol officers working the night shift were taking a short break at a police substation. They had parked their patrol car near the back door and left it running to keep the interior warm and to prevent the computer mounted inside from shutting down. While inside the substation, one of the officers heard a knocking sound, which he at first thought was being made by the ventilation system. When he heard the knocking again, he and the other officer investigated its source, which was the back door. Upon opening the door, they saw a 40-year-old woman curled up in a fetal position on the ground. She was dressed only in a tee-shirt and jeans and was not wearing shoes. She was very upset and crying and appeared to be injured and in pain. They asked, \u201cAre you okay?,\u201d and she responded: \u201cI need help. My boyfriend beat me up.\u201d The officers helped her into their patrol car where it was warm and called for paramedics.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">While awaiting the paramedics, one of the officers questioned the woman about what had happened. She was still crying and upset. She said that her boyfriend had punched, kicked, and choked her; that his name was Darin Parton (Defendant); and that he was in a single-wide trailer across the street. Once the woman was placed in an ambulance to be transported to the hospital, the officers walked across the street to locate the trailer she had described. After doing so, they went to the hospital to gather more information from the woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">At the hospital, they asked the woman in greater detail what had happened, and then they returned to the trailer with two other officers. After trying unsuccessfully to make contact with someone inside, they entered the trailer and located Defendant asleep in the back bedroom. They called to him to stand up and show his hands, but he did not respond. They then entered the bedroom and \u201cplaced him in custody,\u201d handcuffing him. Ultimately, they arrested him for domestic battery and attempted strangulation, both felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">At the preliminary hearing in magistrate court, the woman denied that Defendant had harmed her in any way. She testified that she had fallen asleep on the couch while watching television and was awakened when she felt something fall on her. When that occurred, she was scared and began screaming because she suffers from a panic disor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>der. She said that her two dogs (dachshunds) were then \u201call over me, and I fell off the couch and hit my head [on the coffee table].\u201d According to her, Defendant had fallen on her, and when she was on the floor her two dogs were jumping and biting both she and Defendant. She said the dogs were all over her face and she was confused \u201cbecause it was so chaotic.\u201d She then left the trailer because she was confused, hurt, and scared, and went to the police substation. She explained that she lied to the police about what had happened \u201c[b]ecause I didn\u2019t want them to think I was crazy, and I didn\u2019t want to go to a place like Intermountain [Hospital] or a psychiatric unit to tell them that I was just freaked out.\u201d Based upon evidence other than the woman\u2019s testimony, Defendant was bound over to answer in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The State filed an information in the district court charging Defendant with the felonies of attempted strangulation and domestic violence. The State also filed a part two to the information alleging that he had previously been convicted of two felonies and that he should be considered a persistent violator if he were convicted of a felony in this ease. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty in the district court, and the ease was tried to a jury on May 3 and 4, 2010. The jury returned a verdict finding him guilty of both felonies. After receiving evidence of the two alleged prior felonies, it also returned a verdict finding that he was a persistent violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On the charge of attempted strangulation, the district court sentenced him to twenty-five years in the custody of the Idaho Board of Correction, with five years fixed and the remainder indeterminate. On the charge of domestic violence, the court sentenced him to ten years with five years fixed, with that sentence to run concurrently with the other sentence. Defendant then timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Did the District Court Abuse Its Discretion by Allowing Expert Testimony Regarding Defendant\u2019s Recorded Statements During Telephone Calls to the Woman?</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The State called the woman as a witness during the trial. She stated that after Defendant came home from work, they had a few beers and then went to a local bar where they had additional drinks. After a while, Defendant became loud and obnoxious, and so she left and walked back to the trailer. Her son and his girlfriend later came to the trailer, and while they were still there, Defendant came in. According to the woman, he was obviously drunk because he was stumbling and his speech was slurred, and he stayed about five minutes and left. Her son and his girlfriend left about 11:00 p.m., and she then fell asleep on the couch while watching television. She was awakened at about 2:20 a.m. to the sound of Defendant coming into the trailer. Upon entering, he tried to hug her, but she pushed him away, telling him to go to bed. He then became aggressive. She testified in detail to Defendant pushing her down and then grabbing her hair with his left hand and using his right hand to punch her repeatedly in the face with a closed fist. As she was struggling to escape, he pulled her upright by her hair; grabbed her around the throat and lifted her so that her feet were off the floor; and then slammed her to the floor. She landed on her back, and he straddled her, sitting on her stomach. He then began choking her to the point that she could not breathe. Fearing that he would kill her, she went limp pretending to be dead. When he let go and got off of her, she rolled over and tried to catch her breath. He then began kicking her and stomping on her and then got on top of her, grabbed her hair with both hands, and began pounding her head on the floor. At that point, she lost consciousness. She awoke with him pulling her head up between his knees by her hair and then dropping his weight in her face so her head hit the floor. She testified she could not remember much of what else happened, but she eventually escaped and ran to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">The emergency room physician testified that when he saw the woman at the hospital, she was very upset and disoriented. He testified that she had been through \u201cquite a bit of trauma,\u201d that she had \u201cextensive bruising,\u201d and that she had probably lost con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>sciousness. He stated that the triage nurse wrote in the medical records that the woman had been \u201ckicked, hit, and choked by her boyfriend\u201d and that she was \u201c[cjomplaining of neck pain, head pain, headache and left wrist pain.\u201d The physician said she had \u201cbruises about her entire face\u201d and that they \u201cwere too many to describe.\u201d She also had red marks on her neck, bruises on her arm, and a small laceration on her head that was bleeding. After completing his examination, he diagnosed her with \u201c[ejlosed head injury; contusion, multiple sites; abrasions, multiple; and sprain, cervical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Because the woman had testified at the preliminary hearing that Defendant had not harmed her, the State called two experts regarding domestic violence. The second expert was a detective who had listened to recordings of three telephone conversations between the woman and Defendant while he was in jail. The telephone calls were made on the day of Defendant\u2019s arrest. After the detective testified to his extensive training and experience regarding domestic violence, the recordings were admitted into evidence and played for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The deputy prosecutor then asked the detective what evidentiary value, if any, they had, based upon his training and experience as a domestic violence detective. The detective answered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">Actually, I found it to have significant evidentiary value. To begin with, he makes obvious attempts to influence her in how she\u2019s going to proceed and how she\u2019s going to speak with people who conduct follow-up investigations in the prosecutor\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">In addition, he expresses his disappointment that she did not make up a story about getting in a fight with a chick in the bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-8\">In addition, he never denies that he did this. I think that\u2019s strong, compelling evidence in a case like this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-9\">And then beyond that, as she goes down the list of the things that he did to her, he acknowledges all those things. He says, \u201cI know, I know, I know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Defense counsel then objected on the ground that he did not recall Defendant saying \u201cI know\u201d in the recordings. The district court responded that the jury heard the audio and could decide what was said. The deputy prosecutor asked the detective to continue, and he stated: \u201cWell, as he responds to her saying what he had done to her, you know, there\u2019s no denials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-11\">Defense counsel again objected, stating that the jury did not need the detective to tell them what the calls said. During the ensuing colloquy among court and counsel, defense counsel stated that \u201cthe jury is entirely capable of drawing their conclusions from having listened to them,\u201d apparently objecting on the ground that the detective\u2019s specialized knowledge would not assist the jury to understand the evidence or to determine a fact at issue. The court asked if the deputy prosecutor was offering the testimony as an expert opinion, and the deputy prosecutor responded that while the detective had expertise in the area of domestic violence, the deputy prosecutor was limiting the testimony to what evidentiary value the calls have to a detective. The court then asked if it was \u201cas a detective with the Boise City Police Department, having experience and expertise in the area of domestic violence,\u201d and the deputy prosecutor answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Defense counsel again objected on the ground that expert testimony was not necessary. The deputy prosecutor then stated that she was not offering the detective as an expert witness but as a fact witness. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-12\">And I\u2019m not offering him right now as an expert under [Idaho Rule of Evidence] 702. He is a fact witness with regard to these calls because he heard them with his own ears. He wrote a police report about them that\u2019s been provided to defense counsel. So it\u2019s not an expert in terms of 702, but he does have some additional expertise in the area that would ultimately\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-13\">The court then asked whether the detective would be offering conclusions as to whether someone should be prosecuted based upon what was stated during the telephone calls, and the deputy prosecutor answered, \u201cJust what, if any, evidentiary value they had.\u201d Finally, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019m not sure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>this is much different than a DUI evaluation. It seems to be in the realm of an investigative officer\u2019s duty as to what evidence that they would look at in putting together a ease.\u201d The court then allowed the detective to testify. He recounted several statements by Defendant during the telephone calls that the detective characterized as \u201cmanipulative efforts\u201d and stated they were \u201csomething that, as a domestic violence detective I\u2019m always looking for, because that is ingrained in this type of crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">On appeal, Defendant contends that the detective\u2019s testimony was not relevant. In order to preserve the issue for appeal, \u201c[a]n objection to the admission of evidence must state the specific ground for the objection, if it is not apparent from the context.\u201d <em>State v. Cannady, </em>137 Idaho 67, 72, 44 P.3d 1122, 1127 (2002). The only objection made by defense counsel was that the detective\u2019s testimony would not assist the jury to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Rule 702 of the Idaho Rules of Evidence states, \u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d \u201cExpert testimony is only admissible when the expert\u2019s specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence and determine a fact in issue.\u201d <em>State v. Walters, </em>120 Idaho 46, 55, 813 P.2d 857, 866 (1990). \u201cThe determination of whether expert testimony will assist the trier of fact \u2018lies within the broad discretion of the trial court.\u2019\u201d <em>Kuhn v. Coldivell Banker Landmark, Inc., </em>150 Idaho 240, 252, 245 P.3d 992, 1004 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Defendant does not argue that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the detective to testify. He argues that it was error to permit the detective to testify because the deputy prosecutor expressly stated that she was not offering the detective as an expert. It is apparent from the deputy prosecutor\u2019s statements that she did not understand the difference between an expert witness and a fact witness. The detective had no direct knowledge of any facts in this case. The deputy prosecutor apparently believed that a witness who utilizes his or her expertise to draw conclusions from facts somehow then becomes simply a fact witness. As Defendant states in his opening brief on appeal, \u201c[Although the State claimed that it was not offering [the detective] as an expert, it is clear from the State\u2019s argument and the presentation of [the detective\u2019s] background that the State was relying on his specialized knowledge of domestic violence.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">The issue is not whether the deputy prosecutor understood the rules of evidence. It is whether the district court abused its discretion in permitting the detective to testify as an expert. The district court seemed to understand that the detective was being offered as an expert, based upon the court\u2019s statement, \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is much different than a DUI evaluation.\u201d The deputy prosecutor\u2019s lack of knowledge does not show that the district court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Defendant also argues that the inflammatory nature of the detective\u2019s ultimate testimony shows that it was error to admit it. As stated above, the only objection was whether the detective could offer expert testimony-whether it would assist the trier of fact. There were no objections to the opinions he ultimately gave. That he ultimately gave some testimony that would be objectionable does not establish that the district court abused its discretion in permitting him to testify in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-12\">Defendant has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in permitting the detective to testify as an expert on domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-14\">Did the District Court Abuse Its Discretion by Allowing Testimony of the Woman\u2019s Out-Of-Court Statements Under the Excited Utterance Exception?</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">Prior to trial, Defendant moved to prevent the police officers from testifying to the woman\u2019s statement that her boyfriend <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>beat her up. There was an evidentiary hearing at which both the woman and one of the officers testified. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court ruled that the statement was admissible as an excited utterance under Rule 803(2) of the Idaho Rules of Evidence. This exception to the hearsay rule has two requirements: \u201c(a) There must be an occurrence or event sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of an observer; and (b) the statement of the declarant must have been a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.\u201d <em>State v. Poe, </em>139 Idaho 885, 904, 88 P.3d 704, 723 (2004). When deciding whether an out-of-court statement falls within this exception to the hearsay rule, the trial court may consider factors which include the lapse of time between the startling occurrence or event and the statement, the nature of the occurrence or event, the condition of the declarant, the presence or absence of self-interest when the statement was made, and whether the statement was volunteered or made in response to a question. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A]dmission of excited utterances as an exception to the hearsay rule is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Bingham, </em>116 Idaho 415, 421, 776 P.2d 424, 430 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The woman testified that she ran to the police substation because she was afraid for her life. When she got there, she knocked on the front door, but nobody answered. She then went around to the back, where she saw a police car running. She walked up to the car and looked inside to see if anyone was there, and then saw the back door of the building. She pounded on it, but nobody answered. She then walked to the front door of the building to see if anyone was there, and then walked back to the back door. When asked how much time passed, she answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just remember I just put my head down, thinking, they\u2019ll find me. They\u2019ll find me. And I don\u2019t know if I fell asleep or what because I just hurt.\u201d When asked if she hurt her head, she responded: \u201cI was hurting, hurting. My head was hurting. I was scared. I was trying to get away, just wanted to be safe.\u201d On cross examination, she was asked if she could have spent ten to fifteen minutes going back and forth between the front and back door, and she answered, \u201cAbout, I think.\u201d She was then asked if she may have fallen asleep, and she responded: \u2018Yeah, because, like I said, everything\u2019s a blur. I mean, when it comes to that because it just barely happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The officer testified that they discovered the woman no more than thirty minutes after they had arrived at the substation and that it was probably fifteen to twenty minutes after they had arrived when they heard the knocking. He said that he first thought it was sounds from the ventilation system, but when it continued they investigated the source of the sound and discovered the woman at the back door.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">The district court considered the following factors. About twenty minutes elapsed between the startling event (her boyfriend battering her to the point that she was afraid he would kill her) to her making the statement to the police. When the officers found her, she was on the ground in a fetal position crying. She did not take time to put on her shoes when she fled, indicating how afraid she was. When the officers found her, they did not ask, \u201cWhat happened.\u201d They asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d The woman\u2019s statement that her boyfriend beat her up was not made in response to a question designed to incriminate anyone by her response. The court realized that it had discretion to decide whether the statement qualified as an excited utterance, and it determined that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">On appeal, Defendant argues that as a matter of law the statement could not be an excited utterance because \u201ca statement made by an adult victim of domestic violence, who fell asleep between the startling event and the making of the statement, cannot be an excited utterance.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) The woman did not state that she fell asleep. She stated that she may have because everything was a blur. She was not asleep when the officers found her, and the officer testified that upon hearing the knocking sound again they investigated the source of the sound and discovered her when they opened the back door. From his testimony, it would appear that they discovered her shortly after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the last knocking sound. Under the facts found by the district court, the statement was not inadmissible as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Defendant also states, \u201cAdditionally, the fact that the statement was made in response to a question is a circumstance that cuts against classifying the statement as an excited utterance.\u201d That was certainly a factor to argue to the district court, but on appeal we do not reweigh the facts to determine whether the statement fits within the classification of an excited utterance. The issue on appeal is whether the district court abused its discretion. The district court took this fact into consideration and noted that the officer asked the woman if she was okay, not what happened. Defendant has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Did the State\u2019s Conduct in Eliciting Testimony of and Commenting on Defendant\u2019s Silence Constitute Fundamental Error Requiring a New Trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Defendant contends that the deputy prosecutor committed fundamental error when she elicited testimony of his pre-arrest silence and his <em>post-Miranda </em>warnings refusal to answer a question about the crime, and when she commented during her closing argument about his pre-arrest silence. Defendant did not testify during the trial, and so there is no issue regarding impeaching his testimony. Also, none of these alleged errors were objected to at trial. Therefore, to show fundamental error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">(1) the defendant must demonstrate that one or more of the defendant\u2019s unwaived constitutional rights were violated; (2) the error must be clear or obvious, without the need for any additional information not contained in the appellate record, including information as to whether the failure to object was a tactical decision; and (3) the defendant must demonstrate that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, meaning (in most instances) that it must have affected the outcome of the trial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-10\"><em>State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 226, 245 P.3d 961, 978 (2010) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">(1) Whether one or more of the defendant\u2019s unwaived constitutional rights were violated. The first prong of the <em>Perry </em>analysis is that \u201cthe defendant must demonstrate that one or more of the defendant\u2019s unwaived constitutional rights were violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe Fifth Amendment guarantees an accused the right to remain silent during his criminal trial and prevents the prosecution for commenting on the silence of a defendant who asserts the right.\u201d <em>Jenkins v. Anderson, </em>447 U.S. 231, 235, 100 S.Ct. 2124, 2127, 65 L.Ed.2d 86, 92 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The deputy prosecutor questioned the first officer to testify about Defendant\u2019s failure to make any statements after he had been handcuffed in his bedroom and was, according to the officer, placed in custody, but before he was either arrested or read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant contends that this violated his Fifth Amendment rights. The questions and answers were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-13\">Q. After, did he acknowledge that that was, in fact, his driver\u2019s license?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-14\">A. He was very uncooperative with us. I don\u2019t think he even ever acknowledged that was him and that was his driver\u2019s license. Just very uncooperative with us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-15\">Q. And did he make any statements regarding why you were there or the events of the evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-16\">A. As I recall, the only statement that I recall him making is that he didn\u2019t know what was going on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-17\">Q. And at some point was he under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-19\">Q. And for what was he under arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-20\">A. For domestic battery and attempted strangulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-21\">Q. Why was he under arrest at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-22\">A. Just based on [the woman\u2019s] statements, her injuries and his lack of statements to us, telling us exactly what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Q. Now Mr. Parton, in fact, had some injuries, too, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">A. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">Q. And why didn\u2019t you go arrest [the woman] or investigate her for the crime of domestic battery?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">A. [The woman] is the one who actually called us for help. We figured if he would have been injured and needing help, he would have been the one that called us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The United States Supreme Court has never held that the Fifth Amendment protects against the use of prearrest, pre<em>Miranda </em>silence. In <em>Jenkins, </em>the defendant contended that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the prosecutor cross-examined him during his trial regarding his prearrest silence in order to impeach his credibility. The Court held that such cross-examination did not violate the Fifth Amendment. It expressly refused to decide the application of the Fifth Amendment to prearrest silence, stating, \u201cOur decision today does not consider whether or under what circumstances prearrest silence may be protected by the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236 n. 2, 100 S.Ct. at 2128 n. 2, 65 L.Ed.2d at 93 n. 2. The Supreme Court has still not decided that issue. In <em>Portuondo v. Agard, </em>the Court said, \u201cThe [ <em>Jenkins </em>] Court noted that it was not clear whether the Fifth Amendment protects prearrest silence.\u201d 529 U.S. 61, 70, 120 S.Ct. 1119, 1125, 146 L.Ed.2d 47, 56 (2000). However, in <em>State v. Moore </em>this Court stated, \u201cWe believe the better rule is that which holds that the defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment right not to have their silence used against them in a court proceeding is applicable prearrest and <em>pre-Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d 131 Idaho 814, 820, 965 P.2d 174, 180 (1998). The right against self-incrimination in the Fifth Amendment applies \u201conly when the silence is used solely for the. purpose of implying guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821, 965 P.2d at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The first challenged testimony was that Defendant did not acknowledge that he was Darin Parton and that the driver\u2019s license located by police in his bedroom was his. Defendant does not argue how this testimony was for the purpose of implying guilt due to Defendant\u2019s refusal to identify himself. Defendant only argues that \u201cit is difficult to imagine the relevance of testimony concerning whether Mr. Parton ever acknowledged a driver\u2019s license found in his wallet containing his photograph was his.\u201d Although we agree that the relevance of that testimony is questionable, arguing that the testimony was irrelevant is not the same as arguing that it was used solely to imply Defendant\u2019s guilt from his silence. It could simply imply that he was angry to be awakened by police officers in his bedroom and then handcuffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">The second challenged testimony was the officer\u2019s answer as to why he arrested Defendant. He said, \u201cJust based on [the woman\u2019s] statements, her injuries and his lack of statements to us, telling us exactly what happened.\u201d Defendant argues that this testimony \u201cresulted in [the officer\u2019s] statement about Mr. Parton\u2019s \u2018lack of statements\u2019 helping to provide probable cause for his arrest.\u201d The State counters that this testimony \u201cregarding the reason for arresting Parton was just that\u2014a statement about why Parton was arrested. It was not a statement intended to imply guilt from Parton\u2019s failure to provide his version of events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">The State does not explain why the officer\u2019s reason for arresting Defendant would be admissible. The testimony was obviously offered solely to show that an accused\u2019s failure to offer a statement about the allegations is properly considered in deciding whether the accused committed the crime alleged. Although an officer at the scene may consider the accused\u2019s failure to rebut the accusations when deciding whether to arrest, there is no showing why the officer\u2019s analysis in deciding who to arrest is admissible at trial. The obvious purpose of the testimony was to convince the jury that they should apply the same analysis as the officer did and consider a defendant\u2019s failure to offer an explanation when deciding guilt. As such, it violated Defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">The next challenged testimony was the deputy prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the second officer to testify about a conversation with Defendant while he was being transported to jail. The questions and answers were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Q. Did you make any further statements at that time to investigate or ask him questions about what had happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">A. Yeah. I read him his Miranda rights. I tried. It seemed like every sentence he would interrupt, that he would make statements, again, that didn\u2019t make any sense, that weren\u2019t coherent most of the time. Once I got through reading his rights, asked if he understood them, and he didn\u2019t answer the question. So I didn\u2019t question him at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">Q. And that\u2019s because he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge that he understood his rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">A. Yes, correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">Q. Were you in the vehicle that took him to the jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">A. I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-9\">Q. And did he make any statements on the way to the jail?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">A. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">Q. Tell the jury about those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">A. He stated that he wanted to know what was going on. We\u2019d told him several times up to this point what had been taking place, but he asked again, and I said because he didn\u2019t understand his rights that I wasn\u2019t going to talk to him. And at one point, he said he understood his rights and wanted to know what was going on, which at that point, I explained being arrested for domestic battery. And I believe he said that nothing happened, at which point I said, \u201cDo you remember beating up your girlfriend?\u201d And at that time, he said he wanted his attorney, and so I stopped asking him questions at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">The deputy prosecutor elicited testimony that after the defendant had been given his <em>Miranda </em>rights and was asked \u201cDo you remember beating up your girlfriend?,\u201d he refused to answer the question and asked for an attorney. The State argues, \u201cThe prosecutor merely asked the officer to tell the jury what \u2018statements\u2019 Parton made on the way to the jail. She did not ask him to explain the circumstances surrounding the statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">The officer was called as a witness by the deputy prosecutor. She presumably asked whether Defendant had made any statements on the way to jail because she knew the statements he had made. She did not seek to limit the officer\u2019s testimony, but asked whether Defendant made <em>any </em>statements, and then asked the officer to tell <em>them </em>to the jury. She presumably knew that Defendant had asked the officer what was going on and then stated nothing happened when the officer told him he had been arrested for domestic violence. Those statements may have been relevant to impeach Defendant if he later testified to some version of what occurred, but he had not yet testified and did not testify. The obvious purpose of the deputy prosecutor\u2019s question was to have the officer testify as to Defendant\u2019s third statement-asking for an attorney when confronted with the allegation that he had beaten his girlfriend. As such it violated his Fifth Amendment Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-18\">During the deputy prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, she argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-19\">Despite, essentially, the perjury that she committed at the preliminary hearing in this case, the reasons to believe [the woman] far outweigh the reasons not to believe her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-20\">We also have the option to believe the defendant. At the scene, he was inconsistent. He told [the officer], first, that he didn\u2019t do anything, and then that he didn\u2019t remember anything. Well, which one is it? You either didn\u2019t do anything or you don\u2019t remember. Which one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-21\">He didn\u2019t acknowledge or provide any explanation for the significant injuries to his face. And you saw those pictures. Those are significant injuries that he had.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-22\">Defendant contends that his Fifth Amendment rights were violated by the argument that he \u201cdidn\u2019t acknowledge or provide any explanation for the significant injuries to his face.\u201d The second officer to testify stated that at the jail, \u201cwe noticed them [Defendant\u2019s injuries] in the light when he was getting his handcuffs taken off.\u201d They then took photos to show the injuries. As he was explaining the photos to the jury, he stated that \u201cwe had to actually talk to him to convince him to take photographs of his injury.\u201d He also stated, \u201cWe explained everything in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>his best interest, that he, in fact, had injuries.\u201d Thus, in the context of the testimony, the deputy prosecutor was pointing out that Defendant failed to offer an explanation for his injuries when they were pointed out to him at the jail. At this point, he had been arrested and given his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Commenting on his silence violated his Fifth Amendment rights. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 619-20, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 2245-46, 49 L.Ed.2d 91, 98-99 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">(2) Whether the error was clear or obvious. The second prong of the <em>Perry </em>analysis is that \u201cthe error must be clear or obvious, without the need for any additional information not contained in the appellate record, including information as to whether the failure to object was a tactical decision.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>150 Idaho at 226, 245 P.3d at 978. With respect to this prong, Defendant asserts, \u201cconsidering the clarity of the law on this subject, along with the fact that there could have been no reasonable strategic basis for defense counsel not to have objected, it is clear that the error was plain.\u201d In response, the State asserts that Defendant\u2019s trial counsel may have declined to object because he did not think the testimony was objectionable or he was sandbagging. If, as posited, defense counsel did not realize the impropriety of the deputy prosecutor\u2019s actions, ignorance of the law is not a tactical decision. With respect to the possibility of sandbagging, the State does not offer any reason to suspect that may have occurred. We need not address whether that was a possibility because Defendant has failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">(3) Whether the error affected Defendant\u2019s substantial rights. The third prong of the Perry analysis is that \u201cthe defendant must demonstrate that the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, meaning (in most instances) that it must have affected the outcome of the trial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of the third prong, Defendant\u2019s entire argument is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACe3\">Considering the final prong, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the misconduct affected the verdict, the weaknesses in the State\u2019s case, as noted in sections I and II (including the complaining witness\u2019 admitted perjury in an earlier proceeding in this case), as well as the fact that Mr. Parton did not testify at trial, establish that the three references to his exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights could reasonably have affected the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Defendant first asserts that harm was shown \u201cby the weaknesses in the State\u2019s case, as noted in sections I and II (including the complaining witness\u2019 admitted perjury in an earlier proceeding in this case).\u201d In section I of Defendant\u2019s opening brief, he argued that the district court erred in permitting the detective to testify as an expert, and in section II he argued that the court erred in ruling that the woman\u2019s initial statement to the police officers was an excited utterance. Neither of those were weaknesses in the State\u2019s case, nor were the court\u2019s rulings erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Defendant then states that the woman \u201cadmitted perjury in an earlier proceeding in this ease.\u201d She admittedly testified falsely at the preliminary hearing in an attempt to get the charges dismissed against Defendant, and during the trial she explained she did so \u201c[bjecause he had such control over me, and I felt intimidated.\u201d On cross-examination, she testified to what parts of her preliminary hearing testimony were true and what parts were false. The State also offered testimony from an expert regarding the dynamics of domestic violence from the victim\u2019s perspective. Defendant does not explain why the fact that the woman testified falsely during the preliminary hearing in order to help Defendant showed that the State\u2019s case at trial was weak.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Finally, Defendant points out that he did not testify at the trial. That fact does not show that the State\u2019s case was weak, nor does Defendant explain why his decision not to testify would show that the deputy prosecutor\u2019s actions affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Constitutional errors in the setting of a particular case may be so unimportant and insignificant that they are deemed harmless. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22, 87 S.Ct. 824, 827, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 709-10 (1967). To show that the errors affected Defendant\u2019s substantial rights requires at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>least an examination of the evidence presented and the overall strength of the State\u2019s case. <em>State v. Hooper, </em>145 Idaho 139, 146, 176 P.3d 911, 918 (2007). Such an examination is lacking in Defendant\u2019s argument. Therefore, he has not shown that the errors affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Is Defendant Entitled to a New Trial Under the Cumulative Error Doctrine?</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial under the cumulative error doctrine. Under that doctrine, \u201ca series of errors, harmless in and of themselves, may in the aggregate show the absence of a fair trial.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>150 Idaho at 230, 245 P.3d at 982. As discussed above, the only errors were not shown by Defendant to have affected his substantial rights. Therefore, he is not entitled to a vacation of the judgment under the cumulative error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Was There Sufficient Evidence Supporting the Jury\u2019s Finding that Defendant Was a Persistent Violator?</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">The jury found that Defendant was a persistent violator based upon a judgment out of Pierce County, Washington, for the crime of assault in the third degree and a judgment out of Canyon County, Idaho, for two counts of the crime of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant contends that the Washington judgment was insufficient to prove that it was he who committed the crime. The judgment stated that the defendant was \u201cDarin William Parton\u201d and that his date of birth was \u201c08/31/71.\u201d Defendant contends that the second officer who testified stated that Defendant\u2019s \u201cdate of birth is either August 30 or 31, 1971\u201d and then argues that \u201ca judgment of conviction containing merely the same name and a possible date of birth match\u201d is insufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">The officer did not testify that Defendant\u2019s date of birth was \u201ceither August 30 or 31, 1971.\u201d During the trial, the police officer initially testified that Defendant\u2019s date of birth was \u201c8/30,1 believe, of '71,\u201d but he was then permitted to read from his report and stated that Defendant\u2019s date of birth was \u201c8/31 of '71.\u201d Thus, Defendant\u2019s argument is simply that, as a matter of law, the same name and same date of birth are not sufficient to prove that Defendant was the person convicted in the Washington judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-14\">\u201cThis Court will not overturn a judgment of conviction, entered upon a jury verdict, where there is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Sheahan, </em>139 Idaho 267, 285, 77 P.3d 956, 974 (2003). \u201cWe view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, and we do not substitute our judgment for that of the jury regarding the credibility of the witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Oliver, </em>144 Idaho 722, 724, 170 P.3d 387, 389 (2007). Evidence is substantial if a reasonable jury could have relied upon it in determining that the allegation was proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>145 Idaho 99, 103, 175 P.3d 788, 792 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-15\">The Washington judgment was admitted without objection. The name of the defendant on the judgment was \u201cDARIN WILLIAM PARTON\u201d and his date of birth was \u201c08/31/71,\u201d which are identical to Defendant\u2019s Ml name and date of birth. No contradictory evidence was presented, nor was there any argument that Defendant had a common name. The jury was not required to reach its verdict beyond any possible doubt. It was only required to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Darin William Parton named in the Washington judgment was the same Darin William Parton on trial in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>case. The jury\u2019s verdict finding that it was is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"AFF\">Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"A-R\">We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<judges id=\"A_kS\">Chief Justice BURDICK, Justices J.
