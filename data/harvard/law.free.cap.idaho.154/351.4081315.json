On April 22, 2009, Rubey was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver. Subsequently, the Ada County Prosecutor\u2019s Office (State) brought this action under I.C. \u00a7 37-2744 for civil forfeiture of the motorcycle and related items used in the alleged crime. The magistrate court granted summary judgment to the State, and the district court reversed and remanded that decision. The State now appeals to this Court, arguing that the district court erred in its decision and that the legislative intent behind I.C. \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) supports civil forfeiture for either the transportation or trafficking of drugs. We affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-15\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">On April 22, 2009, Boise Police observed Christopher Rubey leave his home driving a 2007 Legend Motorcycle (Motorcycle) and observed a blue Chevy truck follow the Motorcycle. Police then observed the Motorcycle engage in what they described as driving maneuvers intended to evade police surveillance. The police eventually stopped the Chevy truck and placed the driver \u2014 the primary subject of the surveillance and for whom a federal warrant was outstanding\u2014 under arrest. Rubey then rode the Motorcycle to the scene and made contact with the police. During a consensual search, a police pat down revealed thirteen grams of methamphetamine inside Rubey\u2019s coat jacket. Rubey was arrested and charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">On May 20, 2009, the County filed its Complaint In Rem For Forfeiture Under Idaho Code \u00a7 37-2744 (Forfeiture Complaint) in magistrate court. The Forfeiture Complaint alleged that a Motorcycle, methamphetamine, cell phone, black vest, and black jacket were lawfully seized and subject to forfeiture. In response, Rubey asserted an affirmative defense that the Motorcycle was not used in any manner described in I.C. \u00a7 37-2744 and is not properly subject to forfeiture. The parties agreed to stay the forfeiture ease pending the resolution of the criminal ease, and Rubey eventually pled guilty to the lesser charge of possession of methamphetamine in violation of I.C. \u00a7 37-2732(c). On January 4, 2010, the State filed a motion for summary judgment and an accompanying memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">The magistrate court held a motion hearing on February 1, 2010, and on February 25, 2010, issued an order granting the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment. In granting summary judgment, the magistrate court found that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the Motorcycle is forfeited to the State because it is a conveyance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>used to transport controlled substances in violation of I.C. \u00a7 37-2744. The magistrate court issued a final judgment, and Rubey appealed to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">After receiving briefs from both parties, the district court heard oral argument on the appeal on November 4, 2010. In an October 13, 2011 Memorandum Decision and Order, the district court reversed the magistrate court\u2019s order. In its decision, the district court concluded that I.C. \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) was not ambiguous and that the language \u201cfor the purpose of distribution or receipt\u201d of a controlled substance applied to the actions described in the statute. The State timely filed a notice of appeal with this Court on November 8, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">II.ISSUE ON APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">1. Whether the district court erred in reversing the Magistrate Court\u2019s decision that Idaho Code \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) allows conveyances to be forfeited when used to transport controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">III.STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">When the district court renders an opinion in its intermediate appellate capacity, the Supreme Court \u201cdirectly reviews the district court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Hausladen v. Knoche, </em>149 Idaho 449, 452, 235 P.3d 399, 402, (2010). \u201cThe interpretation of a statute is a question of law over which this Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Carrier v. Lake Pend Oreille Sch. Dist., </em>142 Idaho 804, 807, 134 P.3d 655, 658 (2006). \u201cThe interpretation of a statute \u2018must, begin with the literal words of the statute; those words must be given their plain, usual, and ordinary meaning; and the statute must be construed as a whole. If the statute is not ambiguous, this Court does not construe it, but simply follows the law as written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Verska v. Saint Alphonsus Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>151 Idaho 889, 893, 265 P.3d 502, 506 (2011) (quoting <em>State v. Schwartz, </em>139 Idaho 360, 362, 79 P.3d 719, 721 (2003)). \u201cA statute is ambiguous where the language is capable of more than one reasonable construction.\u201d <em>Porter v. Bd. of Trustees, Preston School Dist. No. 201, </em>141 Idaho 11, 14, 105 P.3d 671, 674 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">IV.ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">In the sole issue on appeal, the State argues that the district court erred in reversing the magistrate court\u2019s decision that Idaho Code \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) allows conveyances to be forfeited when used to transport controlled substances. First, the State argues that I.C. \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) is ambiguous and an interpretation of the statute requires an analysis of legislative history to determine legislative intent. Second, the State argues that previous decisions from this Court have supported civil forfeiture of conveyances that are used to transport methamphetamine. In response, Rubey argues that the statute is not ambiguous, the legislative history is not relevant, and federal case law is not applicable to an interpretation of I.C. \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-12\">Idaho Code section 37-2744(a)(4) states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-13\">(a) The following are subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-14\">(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels, which are used, or intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, delivery, receipt, possession or concealment, for the purpose of distribution or receipt of [controlled substances].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-15\">The statute was interpreted differently by the magistrate and district courts. In its order, the magistrate court found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-16\">After due consideration and in applying the plain language of the statute and looking to federal law as for guidance, this Court concluded that as a matter of law the Plaintiff is required to prove that the vehicle was used or intended to be used to transport or to facilitate any of the listed actions with regard to a controlled substance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-17\">Going further, the magistrate court addressed the applicability of the statute\u2019s qualifying clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-18\">This Court applies the plain language of the statute and will not require the Plaintiff, in a civil forfeiture case, prove the criminal elements of distribution of meth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>amphetamine or receipt of methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-4\">Requiring the State to prove distribution or receipt of methamphetamine in the civil forfeiture case is not in this Court\u2019s opinion, what the Idaho Legislature intended, nor is such a conclusion consistent with federal precedent which this Court found instructive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">In contrast, the district court held that \u201c[t]he interpretation adopted by the magistrate reads \u2018for the purpose of delivery or receipt\u2019 out of the statute completely,\u201d and that \u201cit must be assumed that the legislature meant something by those words.\u201d On the issue of elements that must be proven, the district court held that the State would \u201chave to prove the purpose of delivery or receipt by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">On appeal, the State argues that the first clause of the statute, which ends with the phrase, \u201cto transport,\u201d would not be modified by the, \u201cfor the purpose of distribution or receipt\u201d language. Rubey argues that the district court interpreted the statute correctly, and that the \u201cfor the purposes of distribution or receipt\u201d language modifies the entire subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">As a starting point, differing opinions from two courts would not necessarily make the statute ambiguous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">[A]mbiguity is not established merely because different possible interpretations are presented to a court. If this were the case then all statutes that are the subject of litigation could be considered ambiguous ____ [A] statute is not ambiguous merely because an astute mind can devise more than one interpretation of it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-10\"><em>Matter of Permit No. 36-7200 in Name of Idaho Dept. of Parks &amp; Recreation, </em>121 Idaho <em>819, 823, 828 P.2d 848, </em>852 (1992) <em>(abrogated on other grounds by Verska v. Saint Alphonsus Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>151 Idaho 889, 265 P.3d 502 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">To analyze the meaning of the statute \u201cwe must look to the grammatical construction of the statute as the legislature intended the statute to be construed according to generally accepted principles of English grammar.\u201d <em>State v. Collinsworth, </em>96 Idaho 910, 914, 539 P.2d 263, 267 (1975). Generally, \u201c[ujnder the rule of the last antecedent clause, a referential or qualifying clause refers solely to the last antecedent, absent a showing of contrary intent.\u201d <em>BHC Intermountain Hosp., Inc. v. Ada Cnty., </em>150 Idaho 93, 96, 244 P.3d 237, 240 (2010). However, \u201c[w]hen punctuation discloses a proper legislative intent or conveys a clear meaning the courts should give weight to it as evidence.\u201d 2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 47:15 (5th ed. 1992). \u201cEvidence that a qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 47.32.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\">Here, the qualifying clause \u201cfor the purpose of distribution or receipt\u201d is separated from its immediate antecedent, \u201cconcealment,\u201d by a comma. This separation is intended to apply the qualifying clause to all antecedents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the coordinating conjunction \u201cor\u201d that follows the clause \u201cto transport\u201d syntactically equates that clause with \u201cin any manner to facilitate the transportation, delivery, receipt, possession or concealment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This conclusion is bolstered by the absence of any distinct modifier for \u201cto transport\u201d that would imply the rule of <em>reddendo singular singulis, </em>translated as referring each to each. <em>See </em>2A Sutherland Statutory \u25a0 Construction \u00a7 47:26 (5th ed. 1992). (\u201cWhere a sentence contains several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>antecedents and several consequents they are to be read distributively.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The district court correctly found that the statute is not ambiguous. Given the plain meaning of the words and the tenets of grammar it would be unreasonable to apply the qualifying clause \u201cfor the purpose of distribution or receipt\u201d to every antecedent after \u201cto facilitate\u201d while not applying it to the clause \u201cto transport.\u201d What we are left with, in this context, can be extracted from the statute as bolded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">(a) The following are subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels, which are used, or intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, delivery, receipt, possession or concealment, for the purpose of distribution or receipt of [controlled substances].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARq\">I.C. \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) (emphasis added). Put another way, the qualifying phrase \u201cfor the purpose of distribution or receipt\u201d in I.C. \u00a7 37-2744(a)(4) modifies the antecedents \u201cto transport, or in any manner to facilitate the transportation, delivery, receipt, possession or concealment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Since there is only one reasonable interpretation, the statute is unambiguous and there is no need to address legislative history or other extrinsic evidence. \u201cWe have consistently held that where statutory language is unambiguous, legislative history and other extrinsic evidence should not be consulted for the purpose of altering the clearly expressed intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Verska, </em>151 Idaho at 893, 265 P.3d at 506 (quoting <em>City of Sun Valley v. Sun Valley Co., </em>123 Idaho 665, 667, 851 P.2d 961, 963 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">In its decision, the district court properly concluded that the statute is unambiguous and that the qualifying phrase \u201cfor the purpose of distribution or receipt\u201d applied to the action described in the statute. Therefore, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">We find that the district court did not err when it reversed the decision of the magistrate court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b391-14\">Justices EISMANN, J. JONES, and W. JONES, and Justice Pro Tern KIDWELL concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b390-11\">. By contrast, there is no comma between the phrase \"to facilitate\u201d and the enumerations \u201cthe transportation, delivery, receipt, possession or concealment.\u201d Here, the last antecedent rule would necessarily require the reader to ascribe those enumerated acts to the last antecedent \"facilitate\u201d and not to the preceding phrase \"to transport.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-15\">. <em>See </em>Tenielle Fordyce-Ruff, <em>Creating Separation and Emphasis in Your Writing Part I: Joining Independent Clauses, </em>The Advocate, Vol. 54, No. 2, p. 45 (2011) (Used in this context, the comma \u201cdistributes the emphasis between the ideas equally, creating very little separation between them. Neither the first nor the second clause is emphasized. Instead, the comma lets the reader know that the idea before and the idea after the comma are equally important.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
