He appeals based on several evidentiary grounds. First, he argues that the district court abused its discretion by admitting impermissible character evidence that gang members commit crimes and other violent acts and by admitting improper testimony from a police officer and an expert witness interpreting the security video from the scene of the <em>crime. </em>Almaraz also argues that the district court erred in failing to suppress an eyewitness identification due to suggestive procedures, and by precluding an expert from opining to the suggestiveness of a specific eyewitness\u2019 identification. Finally, he contends that the cumulative effect of the errors deprived him of a fair trial, and that this Court should remand the case to the district court for a new trial. We vacate Almaraz\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-21\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b624-22\">Hector Almaraz and Thomas Salazar, both members of the gang Brown Magic Clique (\u201cBMC\u201d), attended the Club 7 bar on April 23, 2006. The bar was equipped with sixteen video surveillance cameras which showed that a fight erupted after Almaraz punched another patron, Gabriel Flores. Just thirty seconds after the brawl began, the video cameras depict Flores flailing his arms in the air and stumbling to the ground. Although the video does not clearly portray the shooting or identify any patron with a gun, it does show Almaraz behind Flores just before he was shot. Flores died in the hospital as a result of a gunshot wound to his back. Almaraz was subsequently charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Flores.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-23\">Ken Hust was a patron at the Club 7 bar on the night of the shooting. Three days after the shooting, Hust met with police about the events of that evening. Hust was initially apprehensive and reluctant to speak with the police. At first, Hust told police officers that he did not see the shooter. In an effort to calm Hust\u2019s fears and encourage him to talk, the officer conducting the interview, Officer Sloan, told Hust \u201cwe caught the guy that did the shooting.\u201d Hust then ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>plained that he might be able to recognize the shooter if he saw his face. Officer Sloan left the interview room to retrieve a photo to be used as a photographic lineup and turned off the tape recorder. Officer Sloan testified that upon returning with the photograph, Hust\u2019s face went blank as if he had seen a ghost and identified Almaraz without hesitation. The photograph obtained by Officer Sloan and presented to Hust was not a typical photo lineup. Instead of several discrete pictures of different individuals, the photo used was a group photograph of Almaraz and seven other Hispanic men. Almaraz is in the center of the photo with a chandelier hanging directly above his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Before trial, the defense moved to suppress Ken Hust\u2019s eyewitness identification arguing that the overly suggestive procedures the police used to obtain the identification violated Almaraz\u2019s due process rights. Specifically, Almaraz argued that Hust\u2019s identification was unreliable because of Officer Sloan\u2019s interview procedures, the suggestiveness of the group photograph used as the \u201cphotographic lineup,\u201d and Hust\u2019s lack of opportunity to adequately observe the shooter at the time of the incident. The district court denied Almaraz\u2019s motion to suppress. The district court allowed the defense to present expert testimony from Dr. Daniel Reisberg, a cognitive psychologist, about the types of suggestive procedures that can render an eyewitness identification unreliable. In his testimony before the jury, Dr. Reisberg identified proper guidelines regarding witness interviews and identified specific types of police conduct that could compromise a witness\u2019s memory. The court allowed Dr. Reisberg to testify specifically about the suggestiveness of the group photograph the police showed to Hust, but not about the suggestiveness of Officer Sloan\u2019s interview procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Also prior to trial, the State filed a motion in limine seeking to admit evidence at trial of Almaraz\u2019s gang affiliation and the criminality of BMC generally under I.R.E. 404(b) to support its theory of motive. The State argued that the shooting was not merely a random killing, but that Almaraz shot Flores because of gang rivalry. The State asserted that Flores was shot because he was wearing a red jersey, which symbolized the color of a rival gang. Almaraz objected to such testimony during the pre-trial hearing and at trial on the ground that its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. The district court ruled that evidence of Almaraz\u2019s gang affiliation was relevant to the issue of motive and, after applying a balancing test, the court found that the probative value was not outweighed by the prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">The district court allowed Tommy Salazar and another former member of BMC, Armando (Milo) Landin, to testify about the criminality of BMC. Landin testified that BMC\u2019s criminal purpose was \u201cbasically selling drugs and violence.\u201d Salazar testified about Almaraz\u2019s membership in BMC, general criminal conduct of BMC gang members, and the events that took place with Almaraz on the night that Flores was killed. Specifically, Salazar testified that the colors blue and brown symbolized membership in BMC and that the color of one of the gang\u2019s rivals was red. When recalling the details leading up to the fight, Salazar, who was standing near Almaraz in the bar, testified that Almaraz asked Flores why he was wearing a red shirt and inquired about which gang Flores claimed. Flores explained that he was not representing any gang, but simply liked the red Chicago Bulls jersey he was wearing. According to Salazar, Almaraz then asked Flores to remove the jersey. When Flores refused to take off his red jersey, a fight immediately broke out, which ended when Flores was shot in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">The State then presented Officer Jason Cantrell to testify as an expert on gangs. Officer Cantrell testified about the criminal and violent crimes generally committed by street gangs. His testimony was not specifically related to BMC or any of its members. Almaraz objected to the State calling Officer Cantrell as an expert on \u201cwhat gang life is like\u201d in general. After the court allowed Officer Cantrell to give his expert opinion testimony about gangs, the defense moved for a mistrial, or alternatively to have the entire testimony stricken from the record, arguing that the State failed to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>BMC was in fact a criminal street gang with the primary purpose to commit crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The State called Lieutenant Stephanie Steele, an officer who was called to duty on the night of the shooting, to review the bar\u2019s surveillance video tapes. The defense objected to Lieutenant Steele\u2019s characterization of the video when she testified, on re-direct examination, that Almaraz appeared to be in what she called a \u201cshooter\u2019s crouch\u201d just before Flores was shot. The defense argued that such an interpretation invaded the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The State also called Grant Fredericks to testify as a video expert to assist the jury in accurately interpreting the bar\u2019s surveillance videos from the night of the murder. When testifying to his impression of optimized versions of the surveillance videos, the State asked Fredericks if he had formed an opinion about when Flores was shot. The defense objected, arguing that Fredericks\u2019 background in analyzing hundreds of videos was not a sufficient foundation to testify about a person\u2019s physiological reaction to being shot. The defense further argued that the question went to the ultimate issue of the case and thereby invaded the province of the jury. The district court allowed Fredericks to give his opinion about the particular video frame that depicts the victim\u2019s response to being shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">The jury returned a verdict that Almaraz was guilty of first-degree murder. On September 26, 2008, Almaraz was sentenced to life imprisonment with 40 years fixed. Almaraz filed a motion for a new trial which was subsequently denied by the district court. Almaraz timely filed a notice of appeal against his conviction and sentence on October 31, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">II.Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">1. Whether the district court abused its discretion by allowing the jury to hear character evidence regarding the criminality of BMC and the criminality of gangs generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">2. Whether the district court erred in failing to suppress Hust\u2019s eyewitness identification as unreliable due to suggestive practices used by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">3. Whether the district court abused its discretion by preventing the defense expert, Dr. Reisberg, from testifying about the specific interview procedures used by the police during Hust\u2019s eyewitness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">4. Whether the district court abused its discretion by allowing Lieutenant Steele\u2019s testimony interpreting the surveillance video and describing Almaraz\u2019s stance just before Flores was shot as a \u201cshooter\u2019s crouch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">5. Whether the district court abused its discretion in finding the State laid a proper foundation to support admitting the testimony of Grant Fredericks, a video expert, regarding the precise moment Flores was shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">III.Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">This \u201cCourt reviews a trial court\u2019s decision admitting or excluding evidence, including the testimony of expert witnesses, under the abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>White v. Mock, </em>140 Idaho 882, 888, 104 P.3d 356, 362 (2004). \u201cA trial court does not abuse its discretion if it (1) recognizes the issue as one of discretion, (2) acts within the boundaries of its discretion and applies the applicable legal standards, and (3) reaches the decision through an exercise of reason.\u201d <em>Fazzio v. Mason, </em>150 Idaho 591, 594, 249 P.3d 390, 393 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">IV.Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">A. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Admitting Evidence About the Criminality of Gangs</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Almaraz argues that the district court erred by admitting evidence regarding the criminal conduct of BMC members and of street gangs in general as impermissible character evidence. The State first argues that Almaraz did not preserve this issue for appeal because he only objected generally to the admission of evidence relating to his membership in a criminal gang, not to the evidence of other BMC members\u2019 acts or general gang activity. The State then argues that the district court correctly admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ted the testimony of Salazar, Landin, and Officer Cantrell to show motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Almaraz sufficiently objected to both the introduction of Officer Cantrell\u2019s testimony and that of Salazar and Landin to preserve these issues for appeal. Generally, this Court will not consider issues on appeal that were not raised below. <em>State v. Danney, </em>153 Idaho 405, 408, 283 P.3d 722, 725 (2012). Both parties addressed the issue of admitting evidence of BMC\u2019s criminal conduct at the pre-trial hearing on the State\u2019s motion in limine. The State presented the testimony regarding the criminal activity of BMC under the guise of I.R.E. 404(b) and argued that the evidence was relevant to Almaraz\u2019s motive. The defense objected to this testimony as unfairly prejudicial because of a fear that prior bad acts or wrongs associated with gang activity would be used for propensity purposes, which would substantially outweigh any probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The defense objected to Officer Cantrell's expert testimony at trial on I.R.E. 404(b) grounds. The Court heard argument from both parties on this issue outside the presence of the jury. It is clear from the defense\u2019s argument that the objection to Officer Cantrell\u2019s testimony about gang life was made out of a concern that the evidence would in fact be used for propensity purposes. The defense also argued that this evidence was not even relevant, because none of these general gang activities were tied to Almaraz. Therefore, Almaraz sufficiently objected to the State\u2019s evidence of other BMC members\u2019 acts and of general gang activity as unfairly prejudicial character evidence to preserve these issues for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Generally, character evidence is not permissible to prove a person acted in conformity therewith. I.R.E. 404(a). Furthermore, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is also not admissible to prove criminal propensity. <em>State v. Grist, </em>147 Idaho 49, 52, 205 P.3d 1185, 1188 (2009); <em>see </em>I.R.E. 404(b). However, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or prior acts may be admissible if offered to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d I.R.E. 404(b). The admissibility of prior bad acts is subject to a two-pronged analysis. <em>State v. Field, </em>144 Idaho 559, 569, 165 P.3d 273, 283 (2007). First, the court must determine whether the prior wrong or bad act is relevant to a material issue other than the defendant\u2019s character or propensity to commit the crime charged. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court must perform a balancing test to determine whether the probative value of the bad act is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Id.; see also </em>I.R.E. 403. The trial court\u2019s determination regarding the danger of unfair prejudice is discretionary and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is shown to be an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.; State v. Enno, </em>119 Idaho 392, 406, 807 P.2d 610, 624 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">\n<em>1. Both the criminal conduct of BMC and the criminal conduct of gangs generally are relevant to proving motive.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The district court properly used its discretion to admit the testimony of Salazar and Landin to support the State\u2019s theory that Almaraz was motivated to kill Flores because of a gang rivalry. On appeal, it is undisputed that evidence of Almaraz\u2019s membership in the BMC gang was properly admitted under I.R.E. 404(b) to demonstrate motive. This Court further holds that the testimony from Salazar and Landin regarding the criminal and violent conduct of BMC members was also properly admitted. Such evidence is relevant to explain how gang rivalries can often lead to violence and retaliation. Salazar and Landin provided specific examples of prior crimes that BMC members had committed. The defense argues that such evidence of prior bad acts is improper character evidence under I.R.E. 404(b) because the testimony is about other members\u2019 bad acts and is not specifically related to Almaraz. The fact that the conduct was not related to Almaraz shows it was not offered to prove his character but only to prove motive. This testimony is relevant under I.R.E. 401 and I.R.E. 402 because it illustrates how something as simple as wearing a red shirt could trigger a rival gang member to react with violence if he felt disrespected. We hold that this evidence is relevant to an issue other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>than Almaraz\u2019s criminal propensity for murder; it is relevant to illustrate motive and intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The district court also correctly admitted the testimony of Officer Cantrell, the State\u2019s expert on gang activity. Officer Cantrell testified that different gangs wear different colors and that a rival gang wearing a rival color may incite violence. Because none of Officer Cantrell\u2019s testimony was specific to BMC, Almaraz argues that the testimony was irrelevant and highly prejudicial character evidence under I.R.E. 404(a). Almaraz argues that by allowing Officer Cantrell to testify that gangs generally commit crimes, the jury would infer that Almaraz was more likely to commit crimes because he is a gang member. Officer Cantrell\u2019s testimony is relevant to motive because it explains how criminal gangs operate and assists the jury in understanding the nature of gang rivalries. Thus, we hold that Officer Cantrell\u2019s testimony about gang culture was relevant to a material issue other than Almaraz\u2019s propensity to commit crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">\n<em>2. The probative value of the evidence relating to the gang activity of BMC and the criminal conduct of street gangs in general was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The district court recognized the potentially inflammatory nature of gang evidence and balanced the probative value of the testimony against the danger of unfair prejudice in accordance with I.R.E. 403. The court found that the probative value of the testimony was not substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the testimony. To further mitigate any unfair prejudice of gang related testimony, the district court gave a limiting instruction to prevent the jury from considering the evidence as probative of Almaraz\u2019s propensity to commit crimes. The district court instructed the jury that \u201c[sjuch evidence may be considered by you only for the limited purpose of proving the defendant\u2019s motive____ You should disregard such evidence if you find no connection between the crime charged and gang involvement.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The testimony challenged is relevant in understanding Almaraz\u2019s purported motive to shoot Flores because of a seemingly harmless offense \u2014 wearing a red jersey in the wrong place. Such evidence of gang culture was necessary to explain how the mere gesture of refusing to remove a shirt could amount to an act of disrespect that provoked a violent and deadly reaction. Therefore, this Court finds that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of the evidence relating to BMC\u2019s criminal activity and the violent nature of street gangs was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">B. The District Court Erred in Failing to Suppress Ken Hust\u2019s Identification of Almaraz as the Shooter</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">Hust was a patron at the Club 7 bar on the night of the shooting and he identified Almaraz as the shooter at trial. The defense filed a pretrial motion to suppress Hust\u2019s identification arguing that both the interview procedures and group photograph used by the police were overly suggestive, rendering the identification unreliable. The district court denied the motion to suppress, ruling that the identification procedure was not so overly suggestive that it diminished reliability. On appeal, Almaraz contends that the overly suggestive procedures used by the police to obtain Hust\u2019s identification violated his due process rights. The State argues that in order for a constitutional violation to occur, the suggestive procedures must be based on police action and the suggestive nature of the group photograph was not created by police action. If showing the suggestive photograph to Hust was state action, the State then argues that the police interview was not suggestive because Officer Sloan was not trying to change Hust\u2019s identification, but elicit information that Hust was withholding due to fear of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>The preliminary issue for this Court is whether Office Sloan\u2019s act of showing Hust the group photograph was police action. While this Court acknowledges that the suggestive nature inherent in the photograph was not created by police action, the act of showing the suggestive photograph instead of a proper photo lineup was clearly police action. Therefore, this Court must address the substantive issue of whether the district court erred in denying the defense\u2019s motion to suppress Hust\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, this Court applies a bifurcated standard of review. <em>State v. Bay, </em>153 Idaho 564, 286 P.3d 1114, 1117 (2012). This Court will accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that are supported by substantial evidence and freely review any constitutional principles implicated by the facts. <em>Id. </em>To determine whether 'evidence of an out-of-court identification violates due process, this Court applies a two-step test. <em>See State v. Hoisington, </em>104 Idaho 153, 162, 657 P.2d 17, 26 (1983). First, the defendant must establish that the identification procedure was overly suggestive. <em>United States v. Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 240 n. 31, 87 S.Ct. 1926, 1939 n. 31, 18 L.Ed.2d 1149, 1164 n. 31 (1967); <em>Hoisington, </em>104 Idaho at 162, 657 P.2d at 26. Second, if the defendant meets that burden, courts consider whether the identification was nonetheless reliable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>This second step entails considering the witness\u2019s opportunity to view the perpetrator, his degree of attention, the accuracy of his description, his level of certainty, and the time between the crime and pretrial confrontation, and then weighing those factors against the \u201ccorrupting effect of the suggestive identification.\u201d <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 108, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2249-50, 53 L.Ed.2d 140, 150 (1977); <em>Hoisington, </em>104 Idaho at 162, 657 P.2d at 26. Thus, greater indicia of reliability may be necessary the more egregious the suggestive procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">This Court is aware of the dangers of erroneous eyewitness identification. As Justice William J. Brennan said, \u201cthere is almost nothing more convincing [to a jury] than a live human being who takes the stand, points a finger at the defendant, and says \u2018That\u2019s the one!\u2019 \u201d <em>Watkins v. Sowders, </em>449 U.S. 341, 352, 101 S.Ct. 654, 660-61, 66 L.Ed.2d 549, 558-59 (1981) (Brennan, J., dissentingXinternal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, the empirical evidence demonstrates that eyewitness misidentification is \u201cthe single greatest cause of wrongful convictions in this country.\u201d <em>State v. Henderson, </em>208 N.J. 208, 27 A.3d 872, 885 (2011). While this Court has acknowledged that the reliability of eyewitness identification has been subject to \u201congoing scientific and judicial inquiry,\u201d we have yet to articulate the impact of this inquiry on our due process analysis. <em>See State v. Crawford, </em>99 Idaho 87, 102, 577 P.2d 1135, 1150 (1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The New Jersey Supreme Court recently undertook a very thorough examination of the current state of scientific research regarding eyewitness identifications and concluded that \u201c[t]he research ... is not only extensive,\u201d but \u201cit represents the \u2018gold standard in terms of the applicability of social science research to the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henderson, </em>27 A.3d at 916. \u201cExperimental methods and findings have been tested and retested, subjected to scientific scrutiny through peer-reviewed journals, evaluated through the lens of meta-analyses, and replicated at times in real-world settings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court and find that this extensive research convincingly demonstrates the fallibility of eyewitness identification testimony and pinpoints an array of variables that are most likely to lead to a mistaken identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The New Jersey Supreme Court divided these variables into \u201csystem variables\u201d and \u201cestimator variables.\u201d System variables are factors that are \u201cwithin the control of the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 895. Estimator variables are \u201cfactors related to the witness, the perpetrator, or the event itself\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>like distance, lighting, or stress \u2014 over which the legal system has no control.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The research showed that the following system variables help reduce the risk of misidentifxcation: (1) conducting the identification procedure double-blind helps ensure that lineup administrators who know the suspect\u2019s identity do not inadvertently suggest the information to the witness;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) administering proper pre-lineup instructions that inform the witness that a suspect may or may not be in the lineup and it is permissible not to identify anyone; (3) avoiding confirmatoxy or post-identification feedback which can engender a false sense of confidence in the witness\u2019s identification;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) making a full record of the witness\u2019s statement of confidence once an identification is made; and (5) shielding witnesses from viewing suspects or fillers more than once.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 895-903.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In contrast, the reseax\u2019eh established that the following estimator variables diminish the reliability of a witness\u2019s identification: (1) stress; (2) the use of a visible weapon dxxring a crime;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) the shorter the duration of a criminal event; (4) the greater the distance and the poorer the lighting conditions; (5) increased levels of intoxication; (6) the use of disguises during the crime and changes in facial features between the time of initial observation and a subsequent identification; (7) the greater the period of time between observation and identification to law enforcement; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (8) race-bias;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and (9) feedback from co-witnesses confirming the identification of a perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>at 904-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">These two types of variables dovetail nicely with the two-step analysis this Court applies to determine whether evidence of an out-of-court identification violates due process. As previously stated we first look at whether the identification procedures are overly suggestive, and if we find that they are, we examine whether the reliability of the identification outweighs the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification. We hold that the system variables outlined above are factors that courts should consider in determining whether identification procedures were overly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Correspondingly, the estimator variables we addressed serve to elaborate on this Court\u2019s five-factor test for reliability: (1) the witness\u2019s opportunity to view the perpetrator, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the witness\u2019s accuracy of description, (4) the witness\u2019s level of certainty, and (5) the time between the crime and pretrial confrontation. For example, under the first factor courts may consider the lighting at the time the crime was committed, whether the perpetrator was wearing a disguise, and the length of time taken to commit the crime, among other variables. Under the second factor courts may consider the amount of stress the witness was under, whether a weapon was present, or the witness\u2019s level of intoxication. Additionally, we note that courts should be cautious in the amount of weight they give to a witness\u2019s degree of certainty in their identification when police have used overly suggestive procedures, particularly when confirmation feedback has been given. <em>See State v. Lawson, </em>352 Or. 724, 291 P.3d 673, 689 (2012) (noting that \u201cthe current scientific knowledge and understanding regarding the effects of suggestive identification procedures indicates that self-reported evidence [a witness\u2019s level of certainty and degree of attention] can be inflated by the suggestive procedure itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">In sum, we are not changing the two-part test this Court adopted in <em>Hoisington </em>to determine whether an out-of-court-identification violates a defendant\u2019s due process rights. Rather, by outlining the system and estimator variables that research has convincingly shown to impact the reliability of eye-witness identification, we hope to provide guidance to lower courts applying the test from <em>Hoisington.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">\n<em>1. The procedures used in obtaining Hust\u2019s pretrial identification were overly suggestive.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">This Court must first determine whether the State\u2019s conduct was impermissibly suggestive. \u201c[T]he due process test for suppression of an in-court identification that is allegedly tainted by an impermissibly suggestive out-of-court identification is whether the out-of-court identification was so suggestive that there is a very substantial likelihood of misidentification.\u201d <em>Hoisington, </em>104 Idaho at 161, 657 P.2d at 25. In accordance with the framework we have just laid out, our analysis of whether the procedures Officer Sloan used during Hust\u2019s identification were overly suggestive will include consideration of whether any of the system variables that diminish the chance of misidentification, such as double-blind administration or proper preidentification instructions, were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">It is clear from the facts the police violated the standard guidelines for preparing a photo lineup by choosing a picture that was overly suggestive in nature. When asked about the proper procedures used to prepare a photo lineup, Officer Sloan testified that he typically asks the department\u2019s secretary for a lineup after giving her the suspect\u2019s name. The DMV then provides the photos using other individuals with similar race, weight, and height, within a couple of hours from the request. Far from a double-blind administration of a line-up, Officer Sloan was involved in the case and used a single photograph that pictured Almaraz in the center of a group of individuals. Officer Sloan provided no explanation or justification for using the group photograph as the photo lineup for Hust\u2019s identification.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, the police had time \u2014 three days \u2014 and the ability to arrange a traditional photo lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">Additionally, Officer Sloan\u2019s conduct during the identification was also suggestive. Officer Sloan repeatedly interrupted the witness, asked leading questions which implied the answer he was looking for, and discussed with Hust outside information about the case, the suspect, and the victim during the interview. Even more troubling is the fact that Officer Sloan turned off the tape recorder right before he asked Hust to identify Almaraz from the group photograph. Such conduct by a police officer is an egregious error that deprives the court of having a full record of the witness\u2019s confidence in his identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Further, Officer Sloan failed to give Hust the general instruction that the suspect may or may not be in the photo. Not only did Officer Sloan fail to give any pre-identification instructions, he indicated that Almaraz was in the photograph when he asked, \u201cwho had the gun?\u201d Officer Sloan\u2019s question was manifestly suggestive. In telling Hust that the shooter was already in custody, and that they had a strong case, Officer Sloan implied that the shooter would be present in any photographic lineup offered for identification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Finally, rather than using a traditional photo lineup, Hust was shown a group photograph which placed Almaraz squarely in the center of the group with a chandelier hanging directly over his head. If a photo lineup creates a situation in which the witness\u2019s attention is focused on the defendant, the lineup may be unduly suggestive. <em>State v. Hyde, </em>127 Idaho 140, 146, 898 P.2d 71, 77 (Ct.App.1995)(citing <em>State v. Haggard, </em>119 Idaho 664, 667, 809 P.2d 525, 528 (Ct.App.1991)). Moreover, Almaraz was the only individual without facial hair in the photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court analyzed the suggestiveness of the police interview during the motion to suppress hearing. As to the photograph, the district court stated that the issue of suggestiveness \u201cis one for the jury to make a determination.\u201d As to the interview, the district court had concerns after reading the written transcript but \u201c[wjhen I listened to Officer Sloan\u2019s testimony, suddenly there was context to that transcript. Well, [Hust] was reluctant, he was scared.\u201d Going further, the district court concluded that Officer Sloan was dealing with a scared witness and was abrupt in an effort to get Hust to talk, rather than an effort to guide his answers. We do not dispute the district court\u2019s finding of fact that Officer Sloan\u2019s questioning of Hust was not overly suggestive on its own. However, when Officer Sloan\u2019s questioning is coupled with the suggestive group photograph, his failure to give proper pre-identification instructions, and his failure to record Hust\u2019s identification, the same conclusion cannot be reached. Taken together, we hold that the procedures Officer Sloan employed to elicit Hust\u2019s identification were overly suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">\n<em>2. The overly suggestive interview and photographic lineup were not outweighed by aspects of reliability.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Once the police procedures are found to be overly suggestive, the court must conduct a second inquiry to determine \u201cwhether under \u2018the totality of the circumstances\u2019 the identification was reliable even though the [identification] procedure was suggestive.\u201d <em>Hoisington, </em>104 Idaho at 162, 657 P.2d at 26 (quoting <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 382, 34 L.Ed.2d 401, 411 (1972)). We continue to apply the five-factor test found in <em>Hoisington, </em>but also consider the relevant estimator variables that fall under these factors. A court must consider the following five factors to decide whether the identification is sufficiently reliable: (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the prior description of the criminal, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated at the identification, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the identification. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 2253, 53 L.Ed.2d 140, 154 (1977); <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382, 34 L.Ed.2d at 411).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Under the first factor, Hust\u2019s proximity to and involvement in the fight provided an opportunity to view the shooter at the time of the shooting. Not only was Hust at the bar on the night of the murder, he also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>that he was trying to break up the fight and indicated that he was merely two to three feet away from Almaraz. However, Hust also stated that he did not get a good look at the shooter\u2019s face because he was focused on the victim and because the shooter ducked down and ran out of the bar so quickly. Additionally, in <em>Henderson, </em>the New Jersey Supreme Court cited research indicating that \u201cwhile there is no minimum time required to make an accurate identification, a brief or fleeting contact is less likely to produce an accurate identification than a more prolonged exposure.\u201d 27 A.3d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Under the second factor, there is substantial evidence that Hust\u2019s attention was compromised due to his intoxication and the chaotic atmosphere of the bar after the fight erupted. Hust testified that he had been drinking heavily the night of the incident.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Studies have found that \u201cthe effects of alcohol on identification accuracy show that high levels of alcohol promote false identifications\u201d and that \u201clow alcohol intake produces fewer misidentifications than high alcohol intake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906 (citing Jennifer E. Dysart et al., <em>The Intoxicated Witness: Effects of Alcohol on Identification Accuracy from Shomups, </em>87 <em>J. Applied Psychol. </em>170, 174 (2002)). The district court noted that Hust attempted to break up the fight and viewed Almaraz as a participant in the fight. However, Hust\u2019s impairment and the chaotic nature of the bar fight would impact his level of awareness and weighs against reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">In analyzing the third factor, Hust\u2019s description of the shooter became more detailed over the course of the interview, but was not entirely inaccurate. Hust described the shooter as a Hispanic male of average weight and height, but he initially told Officer Sloan that he did not get a look at the shooter\u2019s face. He also provided an incorrect description of what the shooter was wearing and could not remember if the shooter was wearing a hat. Eventually, Hust stated that \u201cif I seen [sic] his face I could probably say it was him or it wasn\u2019t him\u201d and that he saw the shooter\u2019s face \u201cas he turned back around and he ducked down\u201d while exiting the bar. In its analysis, the district court found that the clothing description was inaccurate, but not fatal to the later identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Under the fourth factor, this Court finds that the level of certainty Hust demonstrated during the identification weighs against reliability because Officer Sloan turned off the tape recorder before showing Hust th\u00e9 photographic lineup. It is an improper police tactic for an interviewing officer to record only part of the interview, especially -without providing a reason or justification. This action denies all reviewing courts of the best recollection of what was said or done and thereby may weaken the state\u2019s preparation for further investigation or courts\u2019 preparation for reviewing the identification. Because Hust did not testify in the pretrial proceedings, this Court must rely solely on Officer Sloan\u2019s testimony that Hust had an immediate reaction when he saw the photograph and identified Almaraz without hesitation. Officer Sloan described Hust\u2019s reaction to the photograph as though he had \u201cseen a ghost\u201d and recognized Almaraz as the shooter \u201cwithout hesitation.\u201d The district court found that the \u201clevel of certainty demonstrated at the identification, while the officer testified that he acted like he saw a ghost or whatever, he had responded immediately and was quite certain.\u201d However, since the tape recorder was turned off before Hust\u2019s identification, and Hust did not testify at trial that any of Officer Sloan\u2019s actions led him away or toward identifying the defendant, we only have the officer\u2019s testimony as evidence to the level of certainty demonstrated. These facts together with the potential for confirmation feedback weigh against reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">Finally, in analyzing the fifth factor, the length of time between the shooting and the identification was reasonable and did not detract from the overall reliability of the identification. Three days elapsed between the shooting and Hust\u2019s identification and courts have found this time period to be accept<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>able.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See e.g., State v. Gray, </em>129 Idaho 784, 797, 932 P.2d 907, 920 (Ct.App.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Of the five factors, only the fifth factor is unquestionably in favor of reliability. The other four factors each have specific shortcomings that call into question the reliability of the identification. Additionally, as we noted above, confirmation feedback from overly suggestive police procedures can impact an eyewitness\u2019s level of certainty in their identification. This is especially troublesome given the unexplained turning off the tape recorder before the interview was complete. After balancing these five reliability factors against the suggestive elements of the identification, the reliability of the identification fails to outweigh the impact of the suggestive circumstances. Therefore, this Court holds that the district court erred in admitting Hust\u2019s identification because the suggestiveness of the identification procedure was not outweighed by independent indicia of reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">\n<em>3. Whether the State met its burden of proving that the district court\u2019s erroneous admission of Hust\u2019s identification of Almaraz into evidence was harmless.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Where a defendant alleges error at trial that he contemporaneously objected to, this Court reviews the error on appeal under the harmless error test. <em>State v. Perry, </em>150 Idaho 209, 222, 245 P.3d 961, 974 (2010). If the Court finds that the district court abused its discretion in admitting or excluding the evidence, then the Court must declare a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the outcome of the trial, in order to find that the error was harmless and not reversible. <em>Id. </em>at 227-28, 245 P.2d at 979-80. In other words, the error is harmless if the Court finds that the result would be the same without the error. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Perry, </em>this Court applied the standard of harmless error for a constitutional violation found in the United States Supreme Court opinion in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). \u201cUnder the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error analysis, where a constitutional violation occurs at trial, and is followed by a contemporaneous objection, a reversal is necessitated, <em>unless </em>the State proves \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u2019\u201d <em>Perry, </em>150 Idaho at 221, 245 P.3d at 973 (quoting <em>Chapman, </em>386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828, 17 L.Ed.2d at 710). Put another way, did the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict would have been the same if Hust\u2019s testimony had not been erroneously admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">In this ease, the State argued in oral argument that any evidentiary errors are harmless. The critical analysis, then, is whether the State properly advanced an argument that any error in the introduction of Hust\u2019s testimony \u2014 and that of Officer Sloan relating to his identification \u2014 was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">In the context of the exclusion of Dr. Reisberg\u2019s testimony, the State\u2019s brief argues that the Hust\u2019s identification is not a key element of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">The evidence in this case established that Almaraz was engaged in a fight with the victim when the victim was shot and all the evidence, including surveillance video of the moments just before and just after the shot was fired, indicates that Almaraz was the killer. Although Hust\u2019s identification was helpful, it was not so important as to be considered key.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Going further, the State argues the existence of other evidence that does not rely upon Hust\u2019s testimony. This evidence includes the murder weapon that was found near the crime scene in a shirt tied to Almaraz and ammunition identical to that used in the killing being found at Almaraz\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">However, the State never specifically argues that Hust\u2019s identification did not \u201ccontribute to the verdict obtained\u201d as clearly required under <em>Perry. For </em>example, <em>the </em>subject is not even discussed in the State\u2019s written brief on appeal, and is only vaguely referenced at oral argument. This Court has previously held that \u201cAdditional issues raised for the first time on appeal at oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>argument are not properly before this Court.\u201d <em>State v. Crowe, </em>131 Idaho 109, 111, 952 P.2d 1245, 1247 (1998). As such, the State has failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the verdict in this case would have been the same even if Hust\u2019s testimony had not been admitted. Therefore, this Court finds that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">C. The District Court Abused Its Discretion by Limiting the Expert Testimony of Dr. Reisberg</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">On appeal, Almaraz argues that the district court abused its discretion by limiting Dr. Reisberg\u2019s testimony and precluding him from testifying specifically to the procedures associated with Hust\u2019s identification. In response, the State argues that Almaraz failed to show error in the district court\u2019s ruling on the scope of admissible testimony on the reliability of eyewitness identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Dr. Reisberg testified twice in this case. He first took the stand in a pre-trial hearing on the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude or limit expert testimony on eyewitness identification. The defense called Dr. Reisberg, a cognitive psychologist, to offer expert testimony on the suggestiveness of Officer Sloan\u2019s interview with Hust and the photographic lineup. Dr. Reisberg offered testimony on how eyewitness memory can be affected by many factors, including suggestiveness during police questioning. After testimony and argument, the district court ruled that the defense would be allowed to present testimony from Dr. Reisberg, although the extent of his testimony would be determined during trial outside of the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">During trial, the defense again offered Dr. Reisberg\u2019s expert testimony on the suggestiveness of Officer Sloan\u2019s interview with Hust and the photographic lineup. Specifically, the defense wanted to play audio portions of Hust\u2019s actual interview and then allow Dr. Reisberg to point out how the interview violated established guidelines. The district court allowed Dr. Reisberg to testify about the suggestiveness of the photographic lineup, but ruled that his expert opinion regarding the suggestiveness of the interview would invade the province of the jury. The district court found it proper to leave the accuracy of Hust\u2019s identification to the jury and precluded Dr. Reisberg from making any direct connections between improper technique and the procedures Officer Sloan employed during his interview with Hust. The district court only allowed the defense to present expert testimony from Dr. Reisberg regarding suggestive procedures that can render eyewitness identification unreliable. In his testimony before the jury, Dr. Reisberg identified proper guidelines regarding witness interviews and identified specific types of police conduct that could compromise a witness\u2019s memory. Almaraz argues that the district court abused its discretion because Dr. Reisberg\u2019s expert opinion testimony regarding the suggestiveness of the Hust interview would have assisted the jury in understanding how to apply the guidelines to the facts and in determining the proper weight to give Hust\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\n<em>1. The District Court Erred by Prohibiting Dr. Reisberg from Testifying to the Specific Procedures Associated with Hust\u2019s Identification.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Under I.R.E. 702, an expert witness may provide an opinion \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\u201d Therefore, after the court qualifies a witness as an expert, it \u201cmust determine whether such expert opinion testimony will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Pearce, </em>146 Idaho 241, 246, 192 P.3d 1065, 1070 (2008). Expert testimony that only vouches for the credibility of another witness \u201cencroaches upon the jury\u2019s vital and exclusive function to make credibility determinations, and therefore does not \u2018assist the trier of fact\u2019 as required by Rule 702.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>139 Idaho 520, 525, 81 P.3d 1230, 1235 (2003). However, expert opinion testimony that is admissible under I.R.E. 702 \u201cis not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d I.R.E. 704. Indeed, we have routinely held that \u201can expert\u2019s opinion, in a proper case, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>admissible up to the point where an expression of opinion would require the expert to pass upon the credibility of witnesses or the weight of disputed evidence. To venture beyond that point, however, is to usurp the jury\u2019s function.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>139 Idaho at 525, 81 P.3d at 1235 (quoting <em>State v. Hester, </em>114 Idaho 688, 696, 760 P.2d 27, 35 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The trial court has discretion in excluding expert testimony on eyewitness identification and will not be overturned without an abuse of discretion. <em>Weeks v. E. Idaho Health Sens., </em>143 Idaho 834, 837, 153 P.3d 1180, 1183 (2007). A lower court does not abuse its discretion if the court correctly recognized the issue as one of discretion, acted within the bounds of its discretion, and reached its decision by exercising reason. <em>State v. Moore, </em>131 Idaho 814, 819, 965 P.2d 174, 179 (1998) (citing <em>Sun Valley Shopping Ctr., Inc. v. Idaho Power Co., </em>119 Idaho 87, 94, 803 P.2d 993, 1000 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Here, the district court abused its discretion when it ruled that Dr. Reisberg could not testify about the specific procedures used in Hust\u2019s interview. In making its ruling, the court excluded the testimony as invading the province of the jury without making a determination as to whether it would have assisted the jury. The district court was correct that expert opinion testimony as to the accuracy of Hust\u2019s identification would invade the province of the jury, but Dr. Reisberg\u2019s testimony was not an opinion as to Hust\u2019s credibility. Rather, Dr. Reisberg would have testified about the specific instances of police suggestiveness, which would have been helpful to the average juror\u2019s understanding of whether the interview was conducted in an overly suggestive way. Courts should not overly restrict expert testimony that assists the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In reaching this holding, this Court still recognizes that an expert cannot opine to the accuracy of the eyewitness identification or the credibility of any witness as those matters are reserved for the jury. However, an expert witness may testify to specific instances of police suggestiveness that may call into question the reliability of the eyewitness testimony.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">[E]xpert testimony on the reliability of eyewitness identifications does not invade the province of the jury to determine what weight or effect it wishes to give to eyewitness testimony. An expert should not be permitted to give an opinion about the credibility or accuracy of the eyewitness testimony itself; that determination is solely within the province of the jury. Rather, the expert should be permitted to testify only about factors that generally have an adverse effect on the reliability of eyewitness identifications and are relevant to the specific eyewitness identification at issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">State v. <em>Guilbert, </em>306 Conn. 218, 49 A.3d 705, 729 (2012) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Testimony relating to the proper guidelines for conducting an accurate interview or lineup, whether or not those procedures were followed in the case at hand, and the consequences of non-compliance with those procedures does not invade the province of the jury. The disallowed testimony offered by Dr. Reisberg was aimed at specific procedures employed by Officer Sloan, and how empirical research has shown those procedures to be suggestive. Dr. Reisberg was not offering an opinion on the credibility or accuracy of the eyewitness testimony itself. Credibility is an issue for the jury, as the jury is the lie detector in the courtroom. <em>See Perry, </em>139 Idaho at 525, 81 P.3d at 1235. The district court erred by excluding Dr. Reisberg\u2019s testimony on the ground that it would invade the province of the jury, when the testimony was not an opinion on Hust\u2019s credibility. Therefore, this Court holds that the district court erred in limiting Dr. Reisberg from testifying about the specific instances of suggestive conduct used during Officer Sloan\u2019s interview with Hust.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">\n<em>2. The State failed to meet its burden to show that the limitation on Dr. Reisberg\u2019s testimony was harmless error.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">Where a defendant alleges error at trial that he contemporaneously objected to, this Court reviews the error on appeal under the harmless error test. <em>Perry, </em>150 Idaho at 222, 245 P.3d at 974. \u201cA defendant appealing from an objected-to, non-constitutionally-based error shall have the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>establish that such an error occurred, at which point the State shall have the burden of demonstrating that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">For reasons similar to Section IV.B above, the State failed to meet its burden. There is no mention of harmless error in the State\u2019s briefing on appeal, and only a general mention of harmless error at oral argument offered without supporting authority. This Court has previously held that \u201c[a]dditional issues raised for the first time on appeal at oral argument are not properly before this Court.\u201d <em>Crowe, </em>131 Idaho at 111, 952 P.2d at 1247. This Court has acknowledged that this rule will be relaxed when the issues are supported by argument in the briefs, <em>id., </em>but there is no direct argument on this point in the State\u2019s brief. Therefore, we hold that the State failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">D. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Allowing Lieutenant Steele to Testify that Almaraz Was in a \u201cShooter\u2019s Crouch\u201d Just Before the Victim Was Shot</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Lieutenant Stephanie Steele was called to duty on the night of the shooting and supervised the investigation. The State called Lieutenant Steele to testify about the investigation and to review the bar\u2019s surveillance video tapes. On re-direct examination, the State asked her to describe the information she was relaying at the scene to the other officers and what part of the surveillance video was significant to the investigation. Lieutenant Steele identified a key frame in the video at 2:19:50 where she testified that Almaraz \u201cappears to be in a \u2014 what I call a shooter\u2019s crouch\u201d just before Flores was shot. The defense argued that such an interpretation invaded the province of the jury and was beyond the scope of cross-examination. The district court ultimately allowed Lieutenant Steele to proceed, reasoning that the testimony was relevant to illustrate what details she was relying on when she relayed the information to the other officers. Nevertheless, the court agreed that the issue was ultimately up to the jury and provided a limiting instruction explaining that the jurors should make their own determination of what the videos showed. Lieutenant Steele continued to testify about her interpretations of the video and identified the suspect\u2019s position immediately after Flores was shot and described how he exited the bar. The defense objected on the grounds that it was improper opinion testimony and the court sustained the objection until foundation was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Later in the trial, the defense called Officer Dean Muchow who also viewed the bar\u2019s surveillance videos. When asked on direct examination if there was a question about when exactly the shot occurred, the State objected that such testimony was improper opinion evidence because of a lack of foundation or knowledge. After sustaining the objection, the defense responded by reminding the court \u201c[w]ell judge, over objection you allowed Lieutenant Steele, with absolutely no more foundation, to give her opinion about not only exactly when the shot occurred, but where the shooter was, the shooter\u2019s stance. And that\u2019s in the record now. And it was over objection.\u201d The district court responded by acknowledging that Lieutenant Steele\u2019s testimony may have been improperly admitted. The court stated \u201c[a]nd I have noted to counsel since then that that was \u2014 I didn\u2019t say it on record, but that wasn\u2019t something that should have been allowed, but it was something in context to something else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">\n<em>1. Almaraz\u2019s Claims Were Properly Preserved for Appellate Review.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">On appeal, the defense argues that the description of Almaraz in a shooter\u2019s crouch improperly invaded the province of the jury because it answered the ultimate issue in the case \u2014 who shot Gabriel Flores? The defense further contends that Lieutenant Steele\u2019s testimony was improper lay opinion testimony under I.R.E. 701 because it was based on specialized knowledge and a proper foundation had not been laid for her to testify as an expert. The State argues that Almaraz did not properly preserve the issue for appellate review because the defense made no reference to I.R.E. 701 as grounds for the objection at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Generally, this Court will not consider an alleged error on appeal unless a timely objection to the alleged error was made at trial. For an objection to be preserved for appellate review, either the specific ground for the objection must be clearly stated, or the basis of the objection must be apparent from the context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><em>State v. Sheahan, </em>139 Idaho 267, 277, 77 P.3d 956, 966 (2003) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">However, some discretion lies with the court to consider the objection in light of the context in which it was presented. Under I.R.E. 103(a), an objection must state \u201cthe specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.\u201d After reviewing the objection within the context of the arguments contained in the transcripts, this Court finds that the issue was properly preserved for appeal. After Lieutenant Steele characterized AJmaraz\u2019s stance as \u201cwhat I call a shooter\u2019s crouch,\u201d the defense objected by stating: \u201ceverybody can look at the same video with the same eyes. And ultimately, it\u2019s the jury\u2019s question. And interpretation\u2019s out of line.\u201d Moreover, as Lieutenant Steele continued to describe her interpretations of the video, she testified that the man in the shooter\u2019s crouch moved after Flores was shot and pointed out his new position on the video. The defense objected stating \u201cthat is an opinion and reasonable people watching this, I guarantee you, will disagree with that interpretation.\u201d Although the rule was not specifically invoked, the defense\u2019s arguments surrounding Lieutenant Steele\u2019s testimony show that the defense was concerned that her conclusion was a lay opinion that was not helpful to a clear understanding for the jury and was based on specialized knowledge as a police officer in violation of I.R.E. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\"><em>2. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Allowing Lieutenant Steele to Testify that Almaraz </em>Was <em>in What She Called a \u201cShooter\u2019s Crouch. \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The decision to admit opinion testimony, whether lay opinion or expert opinion, rests within the discretion of the lower court, while the determination of its weight lies with the jury. <em>State v. Cutler, </em>94 Idaho 295, 299, 486 P.2d 1008, 1013 (1971). \u201cThe trial court\u2019s broad discretion in admitting evidence \u2018will only be disturbed on appeal when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Merwin, </em>131 Idaho 642, 646, 962 P.2d 1026, 1030 (1998)(quoting <em>Walker v. Am. Cyanamid Co., </em>130 Idaho 824, 832, 948 P.2d 1123, 1131 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">While this Court acknowledges that the admissibility of Lieutenant Steele\u2019s statement that Almaraz was in what she calls a \u201cshooter\u2019s crouch\u201d may have been a close call, this Court finds that the decision was made within the district court\u2019s discretion. Lieutenant Steele testified to her personal observations of the video and simply explained why she thought frame 2:19:50 was a key frame and why the gentleman in the crouched position was a key suspect. The defense failed to show that identifying Almaraz\u2019s stance as a \u201cshooter\u2019s crouch\u201d was due to specialized knowledge or was a term of art used by the police. Furthermore, the court allowed the defense to re-cross examine Lieutenant Steele based on her statement, but defense counsel did not take advantage of that opportunity. The district court also provided the jury with a limiting instruction reminding the jury that they were not bound by any witness\u2019s testimony about the video. Therefore, we hold that Almaraz failed to show that the district court\u2019s admission of Lieutenant Steele\u2019s testimony was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">E. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Admitting the Expert Opinion Testimony of Grant Fredericks about when the Victim Was Shot</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">The State called Grant Fredericks as an expert in forensic video analysis to assist the jury in interpreting enhanced versions of the bar\u2019s video surveillance from the night of the murder. During his testimony, the State asked Fredericks if he had formed an opinion about when Flores was shot and if he could identify that frame in the video. The defense objected, arguing that Fredericks\u2019 background in analyzing hundreds of videos was not a sufficient foundation to testify about a person\u2019s physiological reaction to being shot. The district court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>State had laid a proper foundation and allowed Fredericks to give his opinion about the particular video frame that depicts the victim\u2019s response to being shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in admitting expert evidence, and its judgment will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Polk v. Larrabee, </em>135 Idaho 303, 314, 17 P.3d 247, 258 (2000). Under I.R.E. 702, expert testimony is admissible \u201c[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cthe trial court has the discretion to determine whether a proper foundation has been laid for the admission of expert testimony.\u201d <em>Swallow v. Emergency Med. of Idaho, P.A., </em>138 Idaho 589, 593, 67 P.3d 68, 72 (2003) (citing <em>Perry v. Magic Valley Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>134 Idaho 46, 995 P.2d 816 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">After reviewing the foundation laid by the State, this Court finds no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Fredericks was sufficiently qualified to give his expert opinion of when the impact of the shot occurred based on his experience and training in video analysis. Fredericks is a forensic video analyst who, in 1984, started a company assisting law enforcement with video-related investigations. He then became a police officer with the City of Vancouver Police Department in Canada, where he was the coordinator of the department\u2019s forensic video unit. Fredericks also trained other police officers on how to interpret videos throughout the United States and Canada. In 2000, Fredericks was hired by Avid Technology, the main imaging company for law enforcement, as the manager of the forensic video division. He primarily focuses on videos involving homicide, robbery, and kidnapping cases. When asked to describe his role as an expert, Fredericks responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">I have examined thousands and thousands of videotapes over the past 25 years specifically for this purpose, to assist the jury and to accurately interpret the video. My experience is that because of my knowledge and skills and experience and my equipment \u2014 and I will spend many dozens, if not hundreds, of hours sometimes examining video \u2014 I\u2019m able to see things that the average person wouldn\u2019t see right away. So I may be able to point out, this is what the camera shows, and then allow you to assess whether you can also see that. My experience is that if I were just to play it, you wouldn\u2019t see everything I see. That\u2019s \u2014 those are the skills I bear, to assist you. So my duty here is to assist you in accurately interpreting what the video\u2019s showing, answer any questions, technical questions about why the video looks the way it does, and to assist you following motion and the movement of individuals ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">This foundation was bolstered even further when Fredericks testified about his personal experience in the line of duty seeing people shot. In response to the defense\u2019s objection, Fredericks clarified his experience and stated that in addition to analyzing videos of homicides, \u201cI\u2019ve experienced firsthand, as a police officer people being shot____ I have been on the scene where my partner shot somebody, and I\u2019ve experienced hearing shots and seeing somebody react to being shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">This Court finds that such a foundation allowed the district court to determine that Fredericks was in fact qualified to give his opinion about which frame depicted the victim reacting to being shot. Fredericks was properly qualified to identify the precise moment captured on video based on his knowledge, training, skill, and experience in assisting law enforcement agencies in interpreting videos of crime. In explaining the basis for his opinion, Fredericks testified that at 2:19:50 there was no reaction from the victim. Then, at some point between 2:19:50 and 2:19:51, the victim reacted and you could see that reaction in the video by 2:19:51.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Fredericks stated \u201c[h]is arms fly up. He moves forward. His chest comes out. His back is arched. Something has caused that \u2014 that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>occur.\u201d Fredericks went on to describe that within a third of a second, virtually every patron in the bar reacted intensely and quickly. The totality of these reactions led Fredericks to opine that the shot was fired at the moment just before 2:19:51. Prior to this testimony, the district court also gave the jury a limiting instruction that ultimately the factual determinations about what the video depicts was left to the jury and they should weigh all the testimony regarding the video. As a result, this Court finds no error in the district court\u2019s determination that such testimony properly assisted the jury in interpreting the video. Therefore, Almaraz has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in finding that the State properly laid a foundation to support Frederick\u2019s expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Based on the reasoning above, this Court holds that the district court abused its discretion in failing to suppress Hust\u2019s identification of Almaraz as the shooter, and abused its discretion in limiting Dr. Reisberg from testifying about the suggestiveness of the specific procedures the police employed during Hust\u2019s interview with Officer Sloan. This Court further holds that there was no other abuse of discretion committed by the district court on the remaining evidentiary issues Almaraz raises on appeal and we do not reach the issues of cumulative error or the denial of Almaraz\u2019s motion for new trial. Thus, this Court vacates Almaraz\u2019s conviction and remands for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b640-6\">Justices EISMANN and HORTON, CONCUR.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b628-8\">. In addition to giving jury instructions at the close of the trial, the court also gave the juiy a limiting instruction regarding all expert testimony presented, explaining that the experts are there to assist the jurors in weighing the information, but ultimately the determination is up to the jurors as the triers of fact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b629-5\">.

Moreover, I cannot understand the State\u2019s inexplicable failure to brief the question of whether these two errors were harmless. This oversight ordinarily would preclude us from considering the issue of harmless error, because in most cases it would be unfair to decide this question without briefing and argument from counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">But, this is a unique case. Almaraz shot Flores in front of several eyewitnesses while being taped by a surveillance camera. Damning physical evidence also links him to the crime. If I believed a jury could possibly reach a different result in a new, error-free trial, I would not hesitate to join the Majority. But, I believe that in extraordinary eases like this one we have a duty to independently examine the record to determine whether all of the errors below were harmless, and, if they were, to affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">Typically, in a criminal appeal the government must argue that the errors below were harmless; otherwise, it waives that issue. <em>See Pizzuto v. State, </em>146 Idaho 720, 725, 202 P.3d 642, 647 (2008)(party must support contentions on appeal with argument and authority); <em>State v.

Stovall, </em>641 F.Supp.2d 657, 665-66 (E.D.Mich.2009)(same). However, a vast body of authority has developed following <em>United States v. Giovannetti, </em>928 F.2d 225 (7th Cir.1991) (per curiam), which held that such a waiver is not necessarily binding on an appellate court. <em>See, e.g., Gover v.

Two terse sentences devoid of citations to authority is a questionable \u201cholding\u201d at best, and nothing indicates that this Court was then aware of the <em>Giovannetti </em>line of cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">Although this Court has often stated that issues not briefed or argued by the parties are waived, which is a good rule in the run of eases, it is impractical to retry cases where all of the errors below were plainly harmless. Moreover, if we adopt the <em>Giovannetti </em>test, we will eliminate the risk that the State might strategically omit a harmless-error argument in an effort to force us to reach a decision on one of the substantive issues involved in a case. If we assert our discretionary power to examine the record for harmless error <em>sua sponte, </em>such gamesmanship will be unavailing. <em>See United States v. Rose, </em>104 F.3d 1408, 1414-15 (1st Cir.1997) (noting that \u201cthe interest in avoiding incentives to the government to fail to make the proper arguments\u201d is one reason to adopt the <em>Giovannetti </em>test).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Here, the record is not so long or complex that it would be overly burdensome for us to review it for harmless error, particularly because the parties identified and thoroughly argued the errors, but \u201csimply failed to address [their] likely impact on the final result.\u201d <em>United States v. Pryce, </em>938 F.2d 1343, 1348 (D.C.Cir.1991). Nor were the errors interwoven with other aspects of the State\u2019s case such that it would be difficult to evaluate their prejudicial effect. <em>See United States v. Samaniego, </em>187 F.3d 1222, 1225 (10th Cir.1999). Rather, both of the errors require us to answer a straightforward question: would this case have come out differently without Hust\u2019s eyewitness identification?</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">The answer clearly is \u201cno.\u201d The State presented a large amount of evidence that was redundant with Hust\u2019s identification. Salazar and two other eyewitnesses testified that Almaraz shot Flores, and the bar\u2019s surveillance video shows Almaraz crouching behind Flores at the instant Flores was shot in the back. Following the murder, police officers searching near the bar found a shirt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>with Almaraz\u2019s DNA on it, in which was wrapped a gun that ballistics tests matched to the bullet casings from the shooting. This comports with Salazar\u2019s testimony that Almaraz told Salazar \u201cI got him,\u201d wrapped his shirt around his gun, and then threw it over some bushes. Even without Hust\u2019s identification, the proof that Almaraz was the shooter is unassailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">I am absolutely convinced that a jury will reconvict Almaraz if he is retried. The trial by jury is \u201cone of the most sacred rights enjoyed by our people,\u201d <em>Russell v. Alt, </em>12 Idaho 789, 88 P. 416, 417 (1907), particularly in criminal eases, where one\u2019s freedom or very life may be at stake, <em>see Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 19, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 1838-39, 144 L.Ed.2d 35, 53 (1999). No one should be deprived of this sacred right out of mere concern for efficiency and expense. But, Almaraz has been fairly tried and found guilty, albeit with two errors that I believe far beyond a reasonable doubt had no effect on the guilty verdict. It has been held by the United States Supreme Court that a criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial, not necessarily a perfect trial. Almaraz had a fair trial. I see no need to reverse his conviction in order to give him a <em>second </em>fair trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b642-5\">Justice J. JONES, concurs.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b641-6\">. One could well argue that the second \u201cfactor\u201d is dispositive. If the record is long or complex, the court cannot be confident in its unguided determination of harmlessness. Therefore, the first factor is relevant only to the extent that it impacts the second factor. Moreover, time and expense can <em>never </em>justify depriving a defendant of a fair trial. Therefore, the third factor is relevant only if the second factor has already been established.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\">. \"Any error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded.\u201d I.C.R. 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
